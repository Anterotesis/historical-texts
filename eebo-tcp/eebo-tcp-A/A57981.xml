            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In this Piece, which the violence of requests in some, the importunity of chiding in others, and the less modest triumphing in not a few hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, rather than willingly brought forth, the question of the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of humble believing above all factious disputing, even though the subject were the <hi>form, the going out and the coming of the house of the Lord,</hi> is with me, and (which is of infinite more weight) with the truly godly soon determined: for, Blessed is the servant whom the Master when he cometh shall finde watching, praying, believing, not tossing and raising the dust of debating and multiplied Replies and Duplies, since the <hi>peace and joy of believing, that we may abound in hope through the power of the holy Ghost,</hi> is of great price with those in whom the <hi>meekness and gentleness of Christ</hi> hath place. For it were desireable, not to be in bondage to either Engine or Pen; and it would appear that there is less of <hi>Christ</hi> and more of <hi>Self</hi> in our sickness of over-loving these truths, which suffer most bruising and grinding (might I be licensed so to speak) between the Milstones of Sides, Opinions and Contradictions of Parties, as if that were the choicest verity which the mans own engine hath taken out of an Adversaries hand (in a manner) <hi>with his bowe and his sword.</hi> But O how more precious were it, if the holy Ghost had perswaded the man of the sweetness of it from the fountain of holy Scripture! for it is beyond doubting, that syllogisms, and haply thirty two or fourty Arguments have not such leading and captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting influences upon the heart, as the convincing light of the Spirit acting upon the supernatural instinct of the new birth, to bring the thoughts ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive to the obedience of Christ.

               </gap>of dispute in the head weakens love in the heart. And what can our Paper-industry adde to the spotless truth of our <hi>Lord Iesus?</hi> O that Opinions were down, and the <hi>Gospel</hi> up; and Sides and Parties might fall, and <hi>Christ</hi> stand; and that all Names, Sects and Ways were low, and the <hi>Lord alone exalted!</hi> and that we could both dispute for <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and in the same act worship <hi>Iehovah!</hi> There is too much fire stricken out of the letter in our debates: it were good that the Spirit with fire from heaven did animate and inliven the letter and word of our Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks; it were good that the Ministers of the Gospel in the Isle of <hi>Britain</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58837:3"/>
were well studied and read in that celebrious and noble Text, <hi>Iesus Christ and him crucified,</hi> that we might contend for his high interests, and had the <hi>Key of David</hi> to open <hi>Christ,</hi> to commend him in all his loveliness, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would come and see, and wonder; then should we know how choiser it were to act in our selves the love of Christ, being warmed and inflamed therewith, than to write the letters of his love in ink and paper, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim of it to others.</p>
            <p>Neither is this spoken to deny but many precious and savoury truths, as Christ himself, have <hi>endured contradiction of sinners;</hi> but the witnesses both sealed these truths with their blood, and were in their debatings shined upon by the out-lettings and emanations of the <hi>Spirit of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were safer to lie in the dust and be humbled before the Lord for the breach of Covenant, the vast toleration of false Religions, our vanity of apparel, when we busk and adorn our selves in filks, even in our state of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity; for intemperance, execrable swearing, lying, mocking and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of godliness, lothing and hating the godly, covetousness, the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness of our profession; and which is the root of all, Atheism, gross ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God and of Jesus Christ, the abounding of many other iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as if we would make it appear, that three <hi>Englands</hi> are scarce suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to humble one <hi>Scotland.</hi> Which is not spoken to justifie the Author, or a party from deep accession to these sins, or to clear and acquit the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Church from the charge put on them by Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi> Its true, we judge it not warrantable to say, that the servants are to call and invite none to the marriage-banquet, but such as they look on as regenerate, and clothed with the wedding-garment; nor to teach, that <hi>the Lord of Hosts shall make a feast of fat things, a seast of wine on the lees, of fat things full of marrow,</hi> unto, and for a visible society, of which <hi>Magus</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> the Traitor are priviledged members; and that the Lord in them <hi>shall destroy the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>

Its wonder if there be a power now on earth, who saith in reality as <hi>Iob</hi> did, when the secret of God was on his Tabernacle, Job 29. 11. <hi>When the ear heard me, then it blessed me, and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me; because I delivered the poor that cryed, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him: the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widows heart to sing for joy; I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my judgement was as a Robe and a Diadem; I was as eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame; I was a father to the poor, and the cause that I knew not I searched out, &amp;c.</hi> And now to other snares this is added:</p>
            <p>That our Brethren have framed and defend one engagement which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Intrant to the Ministry must take and subscribe, otherwise there is no maintenance for him, <hi>that he is resolved to live peaceably, and unoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively under the present government;</hi> and how far we are from siding with any seditious, unpeaceable, treacherous, and malignant way, and from raising tumults, is well known; but we dare not deceive our souls, and deal doubly with the Lord, and with the present powers, to make a difference betwixt a resolution to do a duty, and a promise or engagement to do a duty, as our brethren do, when the resolution is declared and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. 2. When it is judicially declared to understanding, and wise men, who cannot take the sense to be, <hi>he is resolved for the present,</hi> but hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to alter his resolution to morrow, and judges in conscience he may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without equivocating. For when the resolution is declared. 2. Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>infor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When it is declared <hi>ad modum compacti,</hi> by way of covenant: if the present powers shall give order for his enjoying the stipend, he is resolved to do such a duty. Let any say whether he doth not covenant &amp; promise; and if he speak sincerely as a Minister of Christ, he may not swear the same. This we disown, as no lawful act of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, though it be said to be done by a surreptitious meeting of Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents from the Synods of this Church, without the knowledg and consent of some and of hundreds of godly Ministers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As we desire not Presbyterial government to be reproched for such judging, so neither are Prelatical acts of Synods for debarring from the holy ministry <hi>men of an holy and unblamable conversation, and for the grace of God in them, and their knowledge and utterance, able and fit to preach the Gospel,</hi> upon this account, because they are unpeaceable, and hold up de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, that is, because they will not be satisfied with the publick resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for taking in to places in the Church, Parliament, Army, Committee of Estates, all the malignant party in the land, or will not promise silence in their matters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor doth it belong to the essence of Presbyterial Government, that all members of this Church, and inferiour Judicatures, should so submit to the superiour respective Judicatures, that if they be grieved with the sentence, they ought to acquiesce thereunto, and not to contra-act, but

For our Church acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth no subjection nor subordination of inferiour Judicatures unto su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, <hi>but in the Lord,</hi> and so to submit to any sentence, and to forbear a duty of preaching the Gospel, praying, visiting, exhorting, catechising pastorally in families, to abstain from the Lords Supper, and from acts of due censure necessary for the flock upon the known unjust sentence of a Synod, until a general Assembly (which possibly cannot be convened in an age to determine) is to 1. obey men unjustly forbidding a called Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Christ to preach in season, and out of season, rather then God; for they unjustly forbid, and the Lord justly commands; therefore the called Minister must act and contra-act to their unjust sentence, and not forbear for an hour, as the Scripture clears, 2. <hi>Tim. 4. 1, 2. Act. 20. 31. 18, 19, 20. 1 Cor. 9. 16. Isa. 58. 1. Ier. 1. 17. Ezek.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. &amp; 3. 10, 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 28, 29. and so this is unjust. 2. It is to make Synods and Ecclesiastical Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Lords of our faith, which the Reformed Churches detest in popish Councels; for all men and Councels most lawful can challenge only li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited obedience and submission in the Lord to their determinations, if they speak and command <hi>according to the Law and the Testimony,</hi> Isa. 8. 20. <hi>otherwise there is no sight in them.</hi> And so it is popish. 3. We conceive in performing acts of that government which Christ owns in his Word, we do not sin; for no authority of a Judicature can make that to be the word of God, and obedience to God, which was not, as to the matter, obedience to God before that authority, nor on the contrary. Now to abstain from preaching, praying, eating and drinking as the Lords Supper in a called minister, and in a visible professor, duly called and fitted, is sin; then cannot the authority of the Church, fat less their known unjust sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ence make it lawful. 4. Suppose the general Assembly should ratifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the unjust sentence of the inferiour Judicature, or annull their just sentence, the people of God are not obliged to stand to either the one or the other. So we disown the point which our Brethren delivered to us in their papers for union sought by us, as nothing belonging to the essence of Presbyterial government, but reject it as unsound, tyrannical and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As we desire to be humbled for our accession to the sins of the Land, so its no part of Presbyterial government owned by us, that many unsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, ignorant and wickedly weak, not a few, yea, too many scandalous, malignant, and prophane Ministers and Elders are in office; and oh if they had not lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When such, I say, are incorporate with the chief leading men of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Resolutions, and that in opinion, judgement, way, and common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and actings, for furnishing Commissions, publick Messages to Court, and carrying on the course of desection, and their followers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they shall not be deserted by their Patrons; and the body of people in congregations are ignorant, prophane, and loose, and yet have suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the election of Ministers and Elders, contrary to the word of God, and acts of our Church; and when its now as it was in the prelatical times, <hi>the people love to have it so;</hi> and when our Brethren and other opposers have that Catholick advantage known in all ages, to wit, the multitude for them, and against us; and Pulpits have sounded against us in the prelatical language, casting into our bosome that <hi>Isa. 65. 5. stand by thy self, come not near me, for I am holier then thou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Nor look we on the receiving to Church-fellowship men known e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the covenant and cause of God, who again and again had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their engagement, and of many like unto them, any otherwise then as a taking of the name of God in vain, and as an heinous abuse of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Church-pardoning and readmitting of penitents.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The admitting of many known unsufficient, and unqualified, and scandalous Ministers and Elders to office in the house of God, and the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting of the ordinance of the Lords Supper, by admitting thereunto many ignorant and scandalous persons, is to us no part of this Government. Since we earnestly desire the laudable way of the provincial Synod at <hi>London</hi> for promoving of godliness, and examining of such as are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lords Supper, and wait to see what the Lord will do for the help of a suffering people, for the <hi>gathering of the dispersed of Zion,</hi> and building among us the old waste places; nor do we so faint, but we look toward such refreshing words, <hi>Isa. 27. 2. In that day sing ye unto her, a vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of red wine; I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment, lest any hurt it.</hi> What is spoken to the whole, the faith of an afflicted part may own it. <hi>Isa. 60. 18. Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting, nor destruction within thy borders, but thou shalt call thy walls salvation, and thy gates praise.</hi> Isa. 62. 12. <hi>And they shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord; and thou shalt be called, Sought out, a City not forsaken.</hi> Isa. 66. 13. <hi>As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comsort you, and ye shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in Ierusalem, and when ye see this your heart shall rejoyce, and your bones shall stourish like an herb.</hi> Isa. 58. 11. <hi>And the Lord shall guide thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and satisfie thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones, and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.</hi> It were not the wisedom of any to disoblige Christ, by either neglecting, or hurting of such as desire to be owned by the Lord Jesus, as his own hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ones. The Lord was not in the debt of <hi>Cyrus</hi> for his favour toward his people. He can be angry at all who will not kiss the Son; and better heaven in the length &amp; latitude of it were turned in a mass or web of fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry anger (so it were but creature-wrath) &amp; I were folded in that web, then that I should lie under the Gospel-indignation and anger of the Son of God.

            <p>As I intend to darken the reputation of no man, so far less to underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the authority and name of the servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> yea, the Commandment of God layes laws on me to give testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie to his Learning, his dexterous Eloquence and Accuracy in Disputes, and as Christian report bears, to judge him one who walked with <hi>God,</hi> and preached Christ not with <hi>the enticing words of mans wisedom, but in demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the spirit, and of power.</hi> Yet, as I hugely differ from his esteem of these against whom he disputes, in putting them all to the worth of a straw, and every Pen to a <hi>nihil dicit,</hi> he <hi>sayes nothing;</hi> and ranking us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the opposers of Christs Kingdom, <hi>Cerinthus, Ebion, Gnosticks, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians,</hi> whom godly Fathers did oppose, and with <hi>Boniface, Hildebrand,</hi> Papists, against whom the <hi>Waldenses, Wicliff, Hush, Ierom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> did witness; and with Prelates, Primates, Metropolitans, as if we were the Prelates successors, who would keep a dominion in the hands of Elders, so in the particulars in the following disputes; I have apprel ensions far contrary to this man, whose name is savoury in the Churches, concerning the government of Christs visible Kingdom: and should desire that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness may shine more eminently in the Churches of Christ; for the first declining of Churches hath its beginning from a loose and prophane walk of officers; nor can Assemblies have any other issue then that of which <hi>Nazianzene</hi> complains, when Pastors are ungodly, then the Sun at noon day goes down upon the Prophets, and Stars fall from Heaven, and the glory of the Lord departs from the Temple. And were our practice more concentrick with, and suitable unto our rule, the question of the constitution of visible Churches should be a huge deal narrower.

                  <hi>If you say that settled preaching as established and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Church is a mark of the Church, so you make the Church a mark of it self, this plea is too narrow.</hi>

                  <hi>M. Rutherfurd said, the argument is nothing against us, such adulterers.</hi> Psal. 50. <hi>as are not to take the Law in their mouth, are to be cast out, but the question is whether, if they be not cast out, the Church for that be no true Church.</hi> M. H. <hi>Answer, the first part yieldeth the cause again, for if they should be cast out, there is no reason they should be received, or taken in, nor have they any right thereunto, nor be they fit matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>M. Rutherfurd</hi> is not such a yielder of truth as so; for <note place="margin">Though scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous men, as adulterers, ought to be cast out, yet <hi>M.

                  <hi>M. Hookers</hi> argument yieldeth more thus, <hi>these who are worthy to be casten out, had never right to be received in, as Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> so <hi>M. H.</hi> But adulterers who take the law in their mouth, known adulterers (so <hi>M. Rutherfurd</hi> yieldeth and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes) are worthy to be casten out: ergo adulterers; who take the law in their mouth, had never right to be received in as Church-members. 1. <hi>M. Hookers</hi> proposition is most false, for thousands, as <hi>Magus,</hi> and others worthy to be casten out, had

right (Church right, of that onely we speak) such as pastors can give them, to be admitted members, so the Scripture, so <hi>M. H.</hi> part 1. chap. 2. conclus. 3. pag. 27 When then both the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and assumption are taught in Scripture, granted by <hi>M H</hi> see now who yieldeth the cause. 2. to say if they should be casten out, ergo they had never right to come in; is, as if he wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d say, such a woman hath committed harlotry with many men beside her husband, ergo she had never right to be a married wife, and was never lawfully marryed; and so hath neither committed adultery, nor deserveth a bill of divorce.</p>
               <p n="3">3 No more can follow from this, that adulterers once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to membership, falling into scandals ought to be casten out, ergo if they had been under the same scandall visibly, they ought not to have been taken in, but this supposeth a begging of the question, that there is in Scripture a gathering of Churches of visible converts out of Churches of men and women born and baptized in their infancy within the visible Church, which yet I say was never dreamed of by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and though it were so, whether we speak of such a gathering, or of gathering of Churches out of <hi>Pagans,</hi> persons not capable of Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scandals, before their admission, which may hold them out, as they are guilty of Gospel-scandals, after they profess the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. For then an unmarried woman might be capable of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with her own husband, before she be married upon him. 2. as to that which M. Rutherfurd <hi>said, that supposed they were not cast out, the question is whether the Church for that be no Church.</hi> M. H. <hi>saith, that wholly misseth the mark again, for the question is twitching the constitution of the Church, of what matter it should be made, it is not twitching separation from the Church.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, because I dispute against both these of the congregation, and the Separatists our brethren, having no arguments but such <note place="margin">
                     <hi>M R</hi> yields not the cause because he gives two an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the same argument; one to the rigid Separatists, another to our brethren.</note> as Separatists and Anabaptists have, and with more vigour prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted then they, because I conclude against separation as well as against them, having to do with two adversaries, and giving one answer to the one, (which yet is not taken off) and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answer to the other, it is not equal dealing to say the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Separatists wholly misseth the mark, because it is not the same with the answer to the congregational way.</p>

2. <hi>M. H.</hi> declineth an answer to that which I said against the separation, that if any were not casten out, <hi>it followeth not that the Church leaveth off to be a Church, and must be separated from.</hi> But our brethrens practise in <hi>New England</hi> is, if any Church do not cast out such as deserved to be cast out, to non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion them, and declare them to be no Churches of Christ, and so they must be separated from; which can be upon no ground, but because they maintain a Church to be no true Church consisting of false matter, and visibly unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; <note place="margin">False matter makes a Church to be no Church by our brethrens way. <hi>M. Can.</hi> Necess. of Separ. Sect. 3. pag. 176. 177. that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes a Church, and maketh it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther become a false Church, or no Church at all, cannot be a true Church, nor true member of the Church.</note> and would <hi>M. H.</hi> have Church-Communion kept with such? yea his arguments first and second, which are both but one, (though he find out four, where there are scarce three) prove them to be no visible Church, for he must stand by this as his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These to whom Christ is head and king by the influence of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick guidance, and motion of the head as leige subjects, are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit matter of the visible Church, and the onely true visible Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But such as deserve to be casten out, and are not casten out, yea are owned still as Church-members, are not such to whom Christ is head and king. Ergo such leave off to be members and are not a visible Church; the proposition and assumption both are <hi>M. Hookers.</hi> I confesse when an answer cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, it is a compendious way, to say not one word to it, but simply, <hi>the answer doth wholly misse the marke. M. H.</hi> must say a Church of false matter is no Church, or then with us, a society professing the pure doctrine of Christ, though the members be wicked, is a true Church.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Answ. 1. Then the <hi>Saints, faithfull, brethren, temples of the holy Ghost,</hi> at <hi>Rome, Ephesus</hi> must be proven to be visible Saints from the Scripture, from such a visible Saintship, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and the <hi>Apostles</hi> saw in these goodly ungodly Saints, <hi>Iudas, Magus, &amp;c.</hi> for if these titles conclude that they were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally converted, and chosen to grace and glory, &amp;c. as <hi>Ephs. 1. 3. 1 Thess. 5. 10. 2 Thess. 13. 14. 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 16. as they do, then must all and every visible member of these Churches be visible elects, and predestinate to glory, which if our brethren say of all the members of all these visible Churches, suppose <hi>Magus</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> had been among them, it is easie for any to prove the contrary. 2. but if so be that these titles prove they were all internally converted, and that our visible Church must
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58837:18"/>
be such, or else they are falsly constituted, then how shall <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Magus,</hi> find roome in the visible <hi>Church,</hi> as true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers since they were not such? if it be said that the argument which proveth that they weremore, may well prove the lesse, and that they had all the visible Saintship that <hi>Magus, Iudas</hi> had, we shall grant that; but then you must stand by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Such as were the members of the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Rome, Ephesus, Thessalonica, &amp;c.</hi> by these places cited by the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline-book of new England, chap. 3. sect. 3. pag. 56. 57. 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 27. Ephs. 2. 22. 1 Cor. 3. 16, 17. 2 Cor. 11. 2. 1 Cor. 1. 2. Galat. 1. 2. Math.</hi> 16. 16. to 19. such ought the members of our Church visible to be, or then they are constituted of false mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <note place="margin">The argument, such as were the members of the Church of <hi>Rome, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> such should the members of our Church visible be, scanned and foundfaulty. <hi>M H</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth the book of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of <hi>new England.</hi> Hookers sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey par. 1. c. 2.

               </p>
               <p>But the members of these Churches by these places were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and internally converted and justified. Ergo our Churches visible must also consist of these that are really and internally converted and justified, or then they are constituted of false matter; but the conclusion is false and absurd, for so <hi>Christ</hi> and the Apostles erred even proceeding in a Church way in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Iudas, Magus,</hi> to be members; for sure they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally and really converted and justified: and yet <hi>M H.</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them true members, and his visible Saints, it was wisdome therefore to <hi>M.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58837:19"/>
to adde to the Scripture, to help their own cause. 2. If you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to this argument, you must say with <hi>M. H.</hi> that Christ hoped and was bound to conceive by the fruits of <hi>Iudas</hi> his life, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was a <hi>Saint, and might have some seeds of some spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Christ dealt not with <hi>Iudas</hi> in a Church-way, it is a dream void of the word.</note>

Whereas he sayeth the Church judgeth not of things hid; whether the Churches of New England do not judge and heavily censure (though they will not give it that name) all the baptized in their Church, whom they exclude from Church-membership and the Lords supper, all their life, as if they were Pagans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have not so much charity as to believe them to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible converts; judge reader. But (say they) this will not prove that they were internally and really converted, because <hi>Paul</hi> saith so of them; to which I say, then upon the same account must we expone these places <hi>Ephes. 2. 4. God rich in mercy hath loved us, and when we (Paul</hi> and converted Jewes and Gentiles) <hi>were dead in sinnes hath quickened us together in Christ,</hi> in the judgement of charity and in a Church way onely. 6. <hi>and hath raised us up together, and hath made us fit together in heavenly places in a Church-way.</hi> verse 10 <hi>we are his workmanship created unto good works,</hi> and we who verse 12. <hi>were sometimes without Christ, strangers to the Common-wealth of Israel, 13. are now made neare in the blood of Christ:</hi> and verse 18. <hi>we who were strangers, have accesse, by Christ, through one spirit unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, onely in a Church-way, by politick guidance of our head Christ:</hi> and the like must be said of all the reall internall work of the spirit upon the hearts of all the Saints at <hi>Ephesus, Colosse, Corinth, Thessalonica, &amp;c. so they were by this reason light in the

Lord quickened, had Christ dwelling in them by faith, were sealed, translated from death to life, &amp;c.</hi> in a Church way, and from none of these places can we conclude that they were really and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally converted, for all these places and reall works of grace must agree to <hi>Iudas, Magus,</hi> and to all such visible Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all Churches visible rightly constitute must be made up, by this argument, of such visible Saints, else they are false in the matter, and not according to the pattern of Apostolick Churches.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58837:22"/>
my tenet is that the Church can only judge of visible walking and profession in point of admission or not admission to seales, and in that point the Church hath nothing to doe to judge whether they have faith saving or not, none can partake sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly of the seales for their owne personall salvation and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne, but these only who have saving faith, but the Church may admit without sinne multitudes, who eat and drink their own damnation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26, 27. and yet passe no sentence of signes notifyng faith or no faith, <hi>internall conversion or</hi> no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall conversion upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 M. <hi>Hooker</hi> knoweth that <hi>M.

Whereas <hi>M. H.</hi> sayeth ergo.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>The Church may receive to the seales whom she knoweth hath no right Ecclesiasticall to them:</hi> it followeth not; for upon the Churches part, the right is good to conferre the seales, upon the knowledge of notifying signes, but of signes in order to conversion or not conversion, that is the place of the master Christ to Judge, not of servants, in this case before they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted members. But that the Church may admit to the seales whom she knoweth not whether they have right internall for their owne personall salvation, that I teach, and can make good from Scripture, Act. 8. 13 Math. 22. 12. 1 Cor. 11. 26, 27, 30. now I say, that its the <hi>place of Christ, not of servants</hi> to judge of the conversion or not conversion of members, not because men may, in no sort, judge of the conversion of or non conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of others; for in these cases we may judge of the conversion of others. 1. in order to speak to their spirituall state, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, or not, Act. 17. 22. 1 Cor. 3. 1. (2) in the cases of duties of love, suppose we erre upon the matter, as Math. 10. 42. 1 Joh. 3. 14. (3) these that try intrants to the Ministery are to judge authoritatively whether they be converts to them or not, 1 Tim. 3. 10. 2 Tim. 2. 2. but to judge so before their admission wants warrant of Scripture: Pastors as pastors converted none, yea according to the command of Christ are to intend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert none at all, by M. <hi>H.</hi> his way.</p>

4. Where M. <hi>R.</hi> teacheth, that to be invisible members gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth onely right to the seales, I know not.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I teach indeed that the Church may of purpose receive in to the visible Church, who are known members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick visible Church, and manifestly gracious, upon a purpose, that they may, in a particular congregation, be confirmed not converted. But that is nothing to our point, but M. <hi>Hooker</hi> holdeth that pastors as pastors are called of <hi>God</hi> to convert no Church-members, for they presuppose they were before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: hence I say.</p>
               <list>

                  <item>2. Or then as pastors called of God, they doe not preach to Church-members, to convert them. <hi>This contradiction is inevitable.</hi>

               <p>If the former be said. I gaine the point, and M. <hi>Hooker</hi> must yeild the cause.</p>
               <p>If the latter be said.</p>
               <p>Then must pastors as pastors called of <hi>God</hi> preach to Church-members, as some other officers, either as ruling Elders, which confoundeth the preaching Elder, and the not preaching Elder, contrary to the 1 Cor. 12. 28. 1 Tim. 5. 17. or (2) as <hi>Doctors,</hi> which again confoundeth the teaching, and the exhorting El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; contrary to Rom. 12. 7, 8. Ephes. 4. 11. or (3) as <hi>Deacons,</hi> which is popish: for <hi>deacons serve tables,</hi> but attend not to word and prayer, Act. 6. 2, 3, 4. or they preach to them, as private Christians, and unofficed persons, upon an intention to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Church-members: for if only they preach as pastors to confirme them, not to convert them, they doe not fulfill their Ministery which <hi>they have received of the Lord, in all poi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ts,</hi> as they should, Colos. 4 17. then they use not the word as pastors, for all uses, <hi>for reproofe, for correction, for instruction, for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16. nor doe they as pastors, <hi>preach in season and out of season,</hi> by reproving, rebuking, exhorting. (2) Then must all pastorall feeding formally be in confirming only, not in feeding, nor begetting to Christ, <hi>nor in restoring the lost, nor in bringing againe the driven away,</hi> nor in all these five points, Ezek. 35. 4. which are ascribed to <hi>Christ,</hi> who feedeth in his sent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, ver. 15. 16. Micah 5. ver. 4. nor in delivering the sheep
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58837:23"/>
from the Lion and the wild beasts. Now this distinctions should be proved from the word of truth. 2. Then Pastors as watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men give not warning of the sword, and of dying in sin, as <hi>Ezech. 3. 16, 17, 18, 19 20. Ezech.</hi> 33. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp;c. but as unofficed men, and private Christians.

But it may be said, <hi>if Pastors as Pastors must instruct gain-sayers of the truth, as</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 25. <hi>then may gain-sayers of the truth be Church-members; but the latter is absurd.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Let him answer that which M. <hi>Robinson</hi> hath pag. 97. <hi>all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iustif. of Separat.</note> 
                  <hi>the Churches that ever the Lord planted consisted of only good, as the Church of the Angels in heaven, and of mankind in paradise.</hi> God <hi>hath also the same ends in creating and restoring his Churches; and if it were the will of God that persons notoriously wicked should be admitted into the Church, God should directly crosse himself and his owne ends, and should receive into the visible covenant</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> such <hi>as were out</hi> of <hi>the visible state of grace, and should plant such in his Church, for the glory of his name, as served for no other use then to cause his name to be blasphemed, pag. 98. In planting of the first Church in the seed of the woman, there were only</hi> Saints <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture; now all Churches are of one nature and essentiall constitution, and the first is the rule of the rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I now perceive that M. <hi>Hooker</hi> and his followers in this point defend M. <hi>Robinsin</hi> and the Separatists, as M. <hi>Hooker</hi> chap. 2. pag. 20, 21. but I must say these words <hi>(thus we have cleared the expressions of our brethren of the separation)</hi> must be an ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their cause. <note place="margin">M. <hi>Robinson</hi> &amp; his maintain that the visible Church, as touching its essential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, should consist of onely reall converts, as the Church in Paradise: and M. <hi>Hooker</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends them in this.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> But M. <hi>Hooker</hi> should also clear M. <hi>Hooker</hi> and his own from contradictions, as well as M. <hi>Robinson:</hi> for M. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binsons</hi> argument must be thus, or nothing.</p>
               <p>Such as is the essentiall constitution of the first <hi>Church</hi> in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah</hi> not yet fallen in sinne, and the Church of the Angels in heaven, before their fall, such must be the constitution of all our visible Churches now, <hi>for all Churches are of one nature and essentiall constitution,</hi> saith he. I assume.</p>
               <p>But the Church in paradise, and of Angels before either of them fell, consisted of only such as were inwardly and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally sanctified.</p>
               <p>Ergo such must be the constitution of all our visible Churches
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58837:26"/>
now, to wit, they must consist of only inwardly and effectually sanctified, and free of all sinne.</p>
               <p>But the conclusion is absurd, for if so, our visible Churches must be as clean from sinne, as the Church of Angels and of our first parents were, when they were first created, and yet M. <hi>Robinson</hi> saith pag. 112. <hi>for we doubt not but the purest Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth may consist of good and bad in Gods eye, of such as are truly sanctified and faithfull, and of such who only for a</hi> time, put on the outside and vizard of sanctity; so M. <hi>Robinson:</hi> the wit of man shall not clear these expressions from contradictions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be not the approving and commanding will of <hi>God</hi> (for of that will given to men who planteth Churches, he must speak, or he speaketh nothing) that the wicked be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, then it is not Gods will that <hi>Magus, Demas</hi> be admitted into the Church: but this latter is absurd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to both Mr. <hi>Robinson Iustif. of Separat. pag.</hi> 12. and to Mr. <hi>Hookers Survey, par. 1. ch. 2. pag.</hi> 23, 24. and contrary to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46. compared with <hi>Act. 5. 1, 2.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Gods creating of the first visible Church of Angels and men without sinne, is not a binding and commanding rule to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and to the Church to admit none to the visible Church, but such as God created members of the first visible Church free of all sinne, or because there is a standing obliging rule to Pastors and the Church, such as this <hi>(admit not in the Church of Christ

That any such as <hi>obstinately remain wicked have allowance from Christ,</hi> that is, a command to constitute a visible Church as members, is all one as to say, whether commandeth <hi>Christ</hi> men to be members of the Church, and to be also pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously wicked: which is no plous question, for it is whether doth Christ allow men to be hypocrites? Or if <hi>by allowance from Christ</hi> Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> mean, whether doth Christ allow and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Pastors to own obstinate wicked men, as members, because they profess and practise the things of the Gospel? We answer, they ought not to admit or baptise Pagans of that sort, and if they be baptised, and so wickedly they profess, they ought to cast them out.</p>

                  <hi>But visible holiness is required to fit a man of years to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized.</hi>

                  <hi>The consequence admitteth no denial, because to be baptized, and to be admitted a member, infer each other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The assumption is proved by the constant practise of</hi> John Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptist, <hi>Matth. 3. 5, 6. where</hi> Jerusalem, Judea, <hi>Scribes, people and souldiers came to be baptized of him, they confessed their sins, it was a confession that amounted to repentance; so</hi> John <hi>verse 7. bring forth fruits worthy of repentance and amendment of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Luke 3. 6. <hi>What shall we do? the</hi> Apostle <hi>answers,</hi> Acts 2. 38. <hi>repent and be baptized; the works of repentance and the aime of baptisme do import as much; remission of sins calleth for such competent knowledge of Christ, as may make way for the sight of the need of a Saviour, and also of a going to him.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This argument may pass current with these that deny <note place="margin">Whether they were all to <hi>Iohn</hi> reall converts, whom <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized.

                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> onely to be born of visible parents maketh a man of years fit to be baptized.</p>
               <p>The assumption is clear, because that <hi>God be our God and the God of our seed, Gen.</hi> 17. maketh both parents and children within the covenant, yea also within the visible Church, as the <hi>Church of New England</hi> truly teacheth, and giveth them right <note place="margin">Answer to the 32 quest. p. 20.</note> to baptisme; and when <hi>Egypt</hi> shall be the people of <hi>God,</hi> as is foretold, <hi>Isai. 19. 25. Egypt</hi> is the <hi>Church</hi> visible, and all their seed, when they so profess, except these two be different, to be professedly Gods people, and to be a visible Church, which cannot be said; and therefore the argument presupposeth a falshood, and beggeth the question: that there is one thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a man of years born within the visible Church, to fit him in the judgment of the Church for baptisme and Church-membership, and another to fit an infant for baptisme and Church-member-ship, when an infant born within the visible Church, by his birth is fitted both for Church-membership in the judgment of charity, and for baptisme; and so the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proveth that the children of believing parents must have some new qualification before they can be received members of the Church visible; and yet it is granted their birth made them members of the Church visible; so they are members and not <note place="margin">M. <hi>H.</hi> ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth to all whom <hi>Iohn</hi> baptised, and who are to be admitted visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble members a confession of sinnes, such as amounted to the reall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which <hi>Iohn</hi> commanded <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>If to be baptized and to be admitteed members, infer each other,</hi> to Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> saith, <hi>ergo,</hi> all that are baptized are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the visible Church, and all members of the visible Church must be baptized. How then doth the Churches of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> refuse multitudes whom they know to be baptized, and came from <hi>England</hi> to be Church-members? 3. See how Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> maketh out the assumption; to wit, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course and practise of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> Math. 3. 5, 6. in which he laieth this as a ground, that in all <hi>Iudea</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (for <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized them all, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 5.) there was no visible Church, no visible Saints, no converts till <hi>Iohn</hi> made them such by baptisme. I hold that <hi>Christ</hi> was born in the visible Church, and that <hi>Simon, Anna, Zachariah, Elizabeth,</hi> and many others were visible Church-members before <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized them, and that the Church of the Jews and of baptized Christians were
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58837:28"/>
both the same visible Church, the one believing professedly in him who was to come, the other in him who was already come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He presumeth that by <hi>Iohns</hi> baptizing these were framed up in particular Independent congregations, by a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenant, for this is brought to prove the frame of visible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>New England</hi> by Mr <hi>Hooker:</hi> but how the text speaketh this, who can see, except Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> himself? <hi>for all</hi> Judea <hi>and</hi> Jerusalem <hi>were baptized,</hi> Mark 1. 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4: How proveth he that all the baptized were visible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts that came to <hi>Iohn?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Those that confessed their sins,</hi> by such a confession as <hi>Iohn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to wit, <hi>which amounted to repentance, and bringing forth fruits worthy of amendment,</hi> these were visible converts, before they were baptized.</p>
               <p>Yea say I, if the confession amounted so high in the practice of all <hi>Iudea,</hi> as the precept and command of <hi>Iohn</hi> required, then all the land of <hi>Iudea, Ierusalem,</hi> and all the region round about <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who were all baptized, Matth. 3. 5, 6. Mark 1. 4, 5. all the people, Luke 4. 21. were not only visible saints, <hi>but did all really repent and bring forth fruits worthy amendment of life:</hi> for Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> his argument is not from the peoples practice, but from <hi>Iohns</hi> command. <hi>Bring forth fruits</hi> &amp;c. so Mr. <hi>Hooker. They confessed their sinnes,</hi> v. 6. it was such <hi>a confession as amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to repentance;</hi> that I confesse is a sea of Charity to all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible saints. Now hear how M. <hi>Hooker</hi> exponeth their practised confession, <hi>The Baptist so interprets is, bring forth fruits worthy of repentance and amendment of life.</hi> Now sure <hi>Iohn</hi> commanded never such a confession, as <hi>Magus</hi> the witch made <hi>Act.</hi> 8. nor a visible repentance such as maketh a visible saint, but he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a reall internall repentance, otherwise saith he, if <hi>ye bring not forth good fruit,</hi> Matth. 3. ver. 10. see your doome, <hi>every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen down and cast into the fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore if the argument stand thus, such a confession <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> commandeth <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 6, 7. such must be in all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> and the Church can lawfully baptize them, or admit them to the visible Church, otherwise they sinne who bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58837:29"/>
and receive into the visible Church visible hypocrites.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> requireth reall and internall repentance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the baptized should be cast into hell fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p>But the conclusion is so grosse, that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> could not dreame of it.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, the precept of Repentance is not given to the Jewes, so as obedience thereunto must be necessarily required before <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> can lawfully and without sinne admit them to baptism, and into the Christian visible Church, but for their either more personall and fruitfull receiving of the Sacrament, or farre rather, that they may be saved from <hi>the wrath to come,</hi> Matth. 3. 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And as to that <hi>Act. 2. 38. what shall we doe?</hi> if it conclude any thing it must have this meaning, <hi>men and Brethren what shall we doe, before ye can owne us as visible saints, and baptize us without your hazard of casting pearles before swine?</hi> This is to doe violence to the word of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But these words <hi>(what shall we doe?)</hi> must be all one with the like of <hi>Saul, Act.</hi> 9. 6. and of the Jaylor, <hi>Act. 16. 30. what shall we doe to be saved and to obtaine life everlasting, and a due roome in the visible Church of grace here, and at length of glory?</hi> and it is clear that repentance which the Apostles command is the course of repentance all their life to be performed, both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter baptisme, ver. 40. <hi>and with many other words did he testifie and exhort, saying, save your selves from this untoward generation,</hi> which is, <hi>walk not in the way of this people:</hi> and doth <hi>Peter</hi> advise no repentance, but such visible repentance as was to goe before their baptism? certain he adviseth repentance, new obedience and perseverance therein to their lives end after they should be baptised.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As to the ayme of baptism, which is for <hi>remission of sinnes,</hi> it importeth a confession such <hi>as amounteth to repentance</hi> reall and true, yea constant and induring to the end, <hi>Ergo</hi> they were <note place="margin">None are to be baptized by M. <hi>H.</hi> his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while they die, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate their course of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> justified and effectually redeemed in <hi>Christ,</hi> and persevered therein to the end, before <hi>Iohn</hi> could baptise them without sinne: how weak are these? and so these huge multitudes were never baptized untill they all died reall converts, and that was never at all; for the Baptist so requires, before they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The profession that M. <hi>R.</hi> requireth doth notifie, M. <hi>R.</hi> said not, <hi>Faith must notifie</hi> to the Church that a person is a true believer, before he can be admitted a member of the Church by the Church. And that is the question now. Not what profession doth notifie simply; but what it must notifie to the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58837:31"/>
the Church can lawfully admit them to be members. M. <hi>R.</hi> never said that; nor sayeth M. <hi>R.</hi> That not every profession, but that which is apparently true doth notifie so much, and that which is only savoury to the godly. 2. As also M. <hi>H.</hi> addeth to my words, the adjective, <hi>True,</hi> which is not in my words; yea I teach that the profession of <hi>Demas, Magus,</hi> doth not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie that they are true believers: And though visible profession should notifie true faith, it is not necessary that it must offer to judicious charity such overweighing evidences as the Church cannot lawfully admit <hi>Magus</hi> a member, but they must first positively judge him a reall convert; and the like <hi>Iohn</hi> must judge of all <hi>Iury</hi> whom he baptized. 3. Since M. <hi>H</hi> speaketh of admission to the seales in the plurall number, he must mean both the seales; Hence let this quaere be answered by our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whether they think that profession doth notifie to a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable <note place="margin">M. <hi>H.</hi> must be to near to that all infants born of their visible Saints must be reall converts.</note> judgement that all infants of Church-members, because born of Church-members, are reall converts. If so, birth must give conversion, and <hi>David</hi> must give to <hi>Absalom</hi> conversion by birth. 2. All infants so born must be regenerate; but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Scriptures teach that many so born turn Apostates, and prove sonnes of perdition. How our brethren shall free themselves of some baptismall regeneration, and of the apostacy of the justified and truly sanctified, let them consider, and the sound Reader judge; for our brethren tell us, it is not lawfull to put the seale upon a blank.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is the argument of Mr. <hi>Robinson,</hi> and most are borrowed from <hi>Separatists</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in this theme, if such as are known to be no visible members <hi>must be tolerated, untill censures be applied and they convinced or cut off, in that</hi> intervall the Church must either give the seales to them, and their seed, or not. If the former be said, then must the Church <hi>knowingly prophane the holy things of God.</hi> And so visible members as visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble saints, and under that formall reduplication as visible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, are not admitted to the Church, but as tolerated scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous persons, upon whom the Church bestowes Church-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and seales, untill it be seen they are converts visible, which destroyeth a principall pillar of the brethrens way. If the latter be said, that the seales are to be denyed to them and to their seed, in the intervall, then the visible Saintship so judged is not the formall reason of membership and Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, <note place="margin">Our brethren cannot admit visible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts upon these formall reasons as visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble converts.</note> to wit, of seales; for hence seales are denyed to such members as are seen to be scandalous, but not casten out, which againe destroyeth the same principle. 2. The argument presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth that none are excommunicate, but under the formall reason of visible non-converts. <hi>Ergo David, Peter,</hi> and such are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58837:32"/>
undoubtedly visible converts, cannot be excommunicate for adulterie or murther, though visible they remaine as to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things (save in the matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> and the one particular scandall for which they are excommunicate, sound and savoury saints) but the Church must judge <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and all such <note place="margin">Our brethren must say that none are to be casten out of the Church, but as visible non-converts.</note> whom they excommunicate, non-converts and unchosen to glory; which is against the brethrens way also: for if none be admitted Church-members, but such as according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and revealed will of <hi>God</hi> are judged converts visible; <hi>Ergo</hi> all casten out are no members, and so non-converts, and should not have been admitted but holden out, though in other things they be visible converts. 3. M. <hi>H.</hi> cannot produce any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of M. <hi>R.</hi> wherein he argueth simply from corrupted and degenerate members, such as the Jewes were, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. who blaspheme, contradict and openly put away the Gospel, that such may be admitted and planted in Churches. But <hi>Sardis,</hi> for the few names therein, is one of the seven visible Churches and golden Candlesticks among which Christ walks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. and M. <hi>Hooker</hi> yeilds the seales were due to these members and their feed, though they had a name of living members and were dead, so they were not visibly scandalous; but M. <hi>R.</hi> his argument is not brought, but a new one, for M. <hi>R.</hi> saith that <hi>God</hi> made a covenant, <hi>Deu.</hi> 29. with the body of the people for the elects sake, said to be hard, blind, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>

of hope, that there was something reall,</hi> that is, the whole number about three thousand (none excepted, for all were made Church-saints visible) gave grounds of hope that they were all really (otherwise their speaking and hearing the word was reall, that is, not imaginary) internally and effectually called, and born over againe of the spirit, and so chosen to life eternall from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, before the Apostles durst without the offending of God admit them to Church-fellowship and visible communion; those (I say) must be proven. If I durst, I am not farre from judging the godly and judicious in cold blood, free of heate of dispute, dare not so judge of the Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. or <hi>Acts</hi> 8. (5) There is no shadow <hi>Acts 8. that Peter</hi> (M. <hi>H.</hi> should say <hi>Philip) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">No grounds there are to say that <hi>Philip</hi> and the Church of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> smelled the savouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of saving grace in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> before he was admitted a member.</note> 
                  <hi>not Magus while he saw such grounds of the sorcerers reall conversion and reall predestination to glory (6) Peter</hi> said that <hi>Magus had no share in Christ.</hi> True, but said he that he was an unbaptized man who had no share in the visible Church?

               </p>
               <p>True, but it is no answer to the argument from the manner of receiving in, this is something to the casting out, (8) that <hi>Peter</hi> reproveth him in the gall of bitternesse. 2.

               </p>
               <p>The practise of the Apostolick Church is to be considered in three cases. The 1. Case is.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Such should be the members of the visible Church before they be admitted, as <hi>Peter</hi> requireth the thousands to be before they were admitted members: But <hi>Peter</hi> requireth of the 3000. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all repentance; Repent and be baptized, &amp;c.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> For the ordinary drunkard, he is either born and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized in the Church, or he is a Pagan and an ordinary drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard having these three. If the former be said, he is born a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church, and so the question is concerning his casting out, not concerning his receiving in. I confess, I know not how Mr. <hi>H.</hi> could answer the question himself, concerning children born in their Church of Parents, Father, Mother, that are Church Members, though such live 60 or 70 years never baptized, and have these three requisites, and be free of gross scandals, they could not admit such to the Lords Supper. The
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58837:39"/>
Ministers should have some extraordinary call of God to preach to such, as <hi>Paul</hi> had to go to preach in <hi>Macedonia, Act.</hi> 16. for by our Brethrens way they have no right, <hi>by way of Covenant,</hi> from the parents, but onely a <hi>providential right</hi> to preach the Gospel, which requires an extraordinary Apostolick cast.</p>
               <p>As for the other, if the man be a born heathen, and shall come to get these three requisites, and profess as <hi>Magus</hi> did, he is to be received a Member: but if he hath not these three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites, for he lives in Sorcery, as <hi>Magus</hi> and <hi>Elymas,</hi> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the Gospel, the openly lying profession is scandalous; such a profession Mr. <hi>R.</hi> faith is not his requisites: If he be a Pagan, and continue in habitual drunkenness, he may be holden out while he gives evidences to others of amendment, and then he may be admitted to the outer court, as a heater; though a profession of faith, if not belied with worshipping of false gods, can hardly consist with Paganism.</p>

Now <hi>Peters</hi> answer is a strengthning and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting answer: for the doubt of their cast-down conscience is, <hi>Ah!

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Those that I cannot know have any right to the Seals, to them I cannot give the Seals in any faith: But I cannot know that Infants are of the invisible Church, which onely gives them right to the Seals. If Mr.</hi> R. <hi>grant the proposition, that they give the Seals to such whom they know not to have any right, they tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> No Anabaptist can object to me. That to be of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible <note place="margin">M. R. disclaims that which M. H. chargethup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that to be of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church onely giveth right Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick to the seals.</note> Church onely giveth right Ecclesiastick to the outward Seals, which <hi>Magus</hi> receiveth, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> calleth the dispensing of the outward Seals a special priviledge, but such as <hi>Magus</hi> hath no special or saving Priviledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It passeth the wit of man to defend Independents against Anabaptists: for 1. The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and Independents both agree in the same constitution of visible Churches, that they must be real converts, as far as we can judge: but that we can judge of no Infants born of believing Parents, <hi>except we pluck out the eyes of charity,</hi> and believe that <hi>Cain, Ishmael, Esa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Covenant in faith, as the Apostle calls faith.</hi> So Mr. <hi>H.</hi> But I cannot know that all the Infants of Believers have right to the Seals, because their parents are visible Saints, some of them E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, some of them Reprobate: Except I 1.

Mr.</hi> H. answers, <hi>This salve is too narrow for the sore, for the distinction will either make God order the giving of the Seals to such who have no right, and so impeach his wisdom, to appoint the giving of the Seals to such to whom he gives no right to receive them: Or else it doth involve a contradiction and the several expressions contain apparent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions; for this</hi> voluntas signi <hi>which allows the visible Church to give the Seals, it tither gives another right, besides that which the invisible Members have, or else it gives no right: If it give another right, then the invisible Church hath not onely right, which is here affirmed; if it give no right, then the visible Church doth give the Seals orderly to such who have no right to them. I confess, such is my feebleness, that I see not how this can be avoided. How have hypocritical Professors right to the Seals? Not as Members visible: For Mr.</hi> R. <hi>saith,</hi> p. 249. <hi>The visible Church, as the visible Church, hath no right unto the Seals; as invisible they can give none, for they have none to give.</hi>

But it is like they were convinced in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science they did proceed from a false and erroneous Exposition of the Lords will of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and of Precept, and therefore I doubt not but Mr.</hi> H. <hi>did not a little sail against the truth, in carping at this distinction acknowledged by all our Divines.</hi>

All which places Mr. <hi>H</hi> never looked on the face, but suppressed them all. Then let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> clear the wisdom of God in appointing a Ministerial and Pastoral offer of Covenant-mercies, Christ, Pardon, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing, the new heart, Life eternal, to be made to such as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> the traytor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he saith, <hi>The distinction of</hi> voluntas beneplaciti, <hi>and</hi> voluntas approbans, <hi>contains apparent contradictions.</hi> It seems he never heard of this distinction allowed by the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches; and that he joyns with the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who teach, That this distinction placeth in God two contrary Wills; and that he wills and decrees one thing from eternity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and approves the contrary to his creatures: Hence there must be <hi>guile and dissimulation,</hi> and no serious dealing in the Lords commands, saith <hi>Arminius, Corvinus,</hi> and the Arminians at the Conference at <hi>Hague,</hi> and the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Hence it is, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will have the same very right given by the approved Will of God to Members, that is given by the Decree.

                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:58837:44"/>
But we answer to both: God by his Decree ordains what shall come to pass or not come to pass, or what shall fall out or <note place="margin">A clearing of that distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords will of purpose or decree, &amp; of his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his siding with them in that, though inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, as Mr. <hi>R.</hi> in charity judgeth.</note> not fall out, be it good in his effective Decree, or be it evil in his permissive Decree: <hi>For all things were written in his book, when as yet they were not,</hi> even all <hi>Davids</hi> Members, <hi>Ps. 139. 16.

But God by his approving Will does not decree what shall come to pass or not come to pass, but onely commands what is good, and promises rewards accordingly, and forbids what is evil, and threatneth punishment, whether the good or the evil come to pass, or never come to pass; he commands <hi>Iudas</hi> to believe, and <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that is, he approves of their faith as good obedience, and agreeable to his Law, and yet their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience never falls out, nor did the <hi>Lord</hi> ever decree they should obey: for what God decree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Here <note place="margin">The decree &amp; the approving will of God are the same.</note> is no shadow of contradiction here. Again, God giveth a right to the Seals to hypocrites; that is, he commandeth the Church to give the Seals to <hi>Magus,</hi> whether such really or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritically believe, this is a right not properly inherent in visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Members, for their Profession, yea, or their supposed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version. 1. Because all saving and real right to Ordinances is relative to Election to glory, and flows from the Merit of Christs death; but visible Professors, as such, of whose society <hi>Magus</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> are, have not any saving and real right, as chosen and redeemed in Christ, by grant of our Brethren. 2. A right flowing onely from an external profession, and from
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58837:45"/>
composed hypocrisie in <hi>Magus,</hi> is no true right; a lie cannot give a true right, I offend that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> so anxiously contends for a Charter to such Bastards as <hi>Magus.</hi> 3. It is a favour to <note place="margin">Of the right that real visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Professors have to the Seals; &amp; that that right which <hi>Magus</hi> &amp; other paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Members have, is no true right. The command to be baptized as a simple command gives no right Ecclesiastical, no right inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to <hi>Magus</hi> to be baptized except he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Yet doth the Church without sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite &amp; baptize Professors, without pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a sentence upon their real conversion, or hypoctitical.

                     </gap>gus</hi> a right to the Seals: Except Mr. <hi>H.</hi> never Divine so spake; the command reveals the right, but gives none. As also the right of visible Professors is <hi>Ius passivum,</hi> and a conditional and passive right; for <hi>Magus</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> have no right to be visible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or to partake of the Seals, yea or to profess the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Name of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 16. but upon condition of faith: for God cannot command sin and an hypocritical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: yea, he forbids treading in his Courts, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 12, 13. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they repent and believe, <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. therefore <hi>Magus</hi> sins in professing, and in being baptized, he remaining rotten: But the Church sins not, but does the command of Christ in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, inviting all that profess, whether they be really, or in the judgement of charity, Converts or no. Which distinction not being observed, our Brethren and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> mistake the nature of an Ecclesiastical right; for the Lord in the command gives to all visible professors, such as <hi>Peter,</hi> who really believe, both the Ecclesiastick and external right to the Seals which he decreed to give them, and the same internal and real right which they have by faith, and no other than according to his eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, they have given them in time by real believing. But for hypocrites, as <hi>Magus,</hi> they have no right Ecclesiastick to the Seals, but a sort of active and permissive right, by which they claim room in the visible Church, and the Seals from the Church. Therefore taking the <hi>Church visible as onely visible,</hi> as contra-distinguished from the invisible and really believing: and as visibility is common to both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Magus,</hi> and their external profession obvious to the eye of man, so the visible Church hath no right that is true and real to the Seals:

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Magus,</hi> and such like wooden and tree-legs, might claim the same life, living Membership, lively and vital operations, and to have the anointing, and to be kept through faith unto salvation by the power of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. and to have the fear of God put in their hearts, that they should not depart from God, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 39, 40. if they have the same right to <hi>Membership and the Seals in their substance and grace signified with sound believers.</hi> And this is most absurd.</p>
               <p>If hypocritical Professors have another external and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical right then real believers upon these grounds, it must be a false and a bastard Charter, founded upon an hypocritical profession.

               <p>Lastly, it is poor to say, <hi>How come hypocritical Professors to have right to the Seals? As visible Members they have none, as invisible Members they have none, for such they are not.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> True, they are not; but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives them the same right with invisible Members: <hi>quo jure</hi> let him shew. <hi>Ergo, the Church must give them no Seals, or give them Seals, when she cannot know they have any right, for indeed they have none that is true and real.</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Church doth obey Christ in giving them Seals; and it well follows, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Church giveth them Seals, when she cannot know they have any right, to wit, internal and real, which is a saving priviledge of <hi>special note in the Mediator,</hi> to the Seals including signes and the grace signified: for so onely they do belong in the Lords intention and eternal decree to real believers, not to <hi>Magus</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> except Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will stand for Arminian Universal Grace, and say that God intends the same saving grace in Ordinances and Seals to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and likewise to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</hi>

                  <p>Whether the visible Church, as visible, can bear these styles of the Body of Christ, of the Redeemed of God, the Spouse of Christ, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, <hi>These things may well be given to the visible</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Those over whom Officers are set, to feed them by Doctrine and Discipline, must needs be the visible Church: But these are the Church,</hi> Act. 20. 28. <hi>Feed the flock, not of the Elect onely, but of the whole visible Church; Take heed to the whole flock of God, else if they were set over the Elect onely, they might reply, Lord, we cannot search into thy secrets, who are the Elect and invisible Saints, onely to feed them: where as the current and common sense of the Scripture, is, taking Redeemed and Sanctified as visible, though not really such, the stream of the Text runs pleasantly, Feed all visibly redeemed. Elect and Reprobate:</hi> So they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed in the judgement of Charity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Church visible is taken two wayes. 1. In the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, <note place="margin">The Church is two ways visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> as comprehending all Professors, sound, as <hi>Peter,</hi> or rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as <hi>Magus;</hi> all which have a sort of right to the Seals, but divers wayes, as is said.</p>
               <p n="2">2. More restricted, as a Church so and so visible, as the soundest part of real believers, comprehending in <hi>Corinth</hi> onely such as are really justified, sanctified, &amp;c. In the latter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ense, the Church visible and professing is one in the matter, all one with the Church invisible, and soundly and sincerely professing, and <hi>Peter</hi> is both a real believer, and visible and soundly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing believer. In the former sense, <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to <hi>Ephesus, 1 Cor 1. Eph. 1. 1. Rom.</hi> 1. 7. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> calleth all the Church visible there justified, or not justified, the Church, to wit, the Church visible. In the latter sense onely the so and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58837:47"/>
so visible professors, sanctified, justified, are the onely really, soundly professing visible Church, and the whole is named from the sounder part. In the latter sense, Christ is head and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <note place="margin">How Christ is the Head of the visible Church.</note> of the visible Church, consisting of onely real, sound, visible Professors, and that not onely by the influence of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick guidance, but also by the influence of saving grace. But of this visible Church Mr. <hi>H.</hi> moves not the question, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Arguments speed the worse. <note place="margin">The place Act. 20. 28 <hi>Feed the flack, &amp;c.</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by M.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Argument of the same strain is formed by the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, so, <hi>As many as are the really redeemed Church</hi> (say the <hi>Arminians)</hi> and, <hi>As many as are the Church of God redeemed in the judgement of Charity</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>H.) the Elders were to feed.</hi> But the Elders were to feed the whole flock, Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, real believers and hypocrites.

It is false, that as many as were bought with the blood of Christ in the judgement of charity, as were to be fed with Word, Seals and Censures.</hi>
                  </note> we see not: For Redemption to be bought with the blood of God; yea, to be chosen to life before the foundation of the world, which are proper to the invisible Church onely, are attributed to the visible Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Eph. 1. 4. Was it <hi>Pauls</hi> minde that thanks should be given to God, because God hath chosen us all, and every one of the visible Church (here is Universal Predestination) of <hi>Ephesus</hi> before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world to be really holy (for of that holiness he speaks) because from eternity God had in the judgement of charity chosen to life and holiness such as <hi>Magus</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the grievous Wolves in that Church? So must <hi>Paul</hi> say, 2 <hi>Thess. 2. 13. We are bound to give thanks to God for you,</hi> all whom we feed, all to whom we write, real converts or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, <hi>that God hath,</hi> in the judgement of charity, <hi>chosen you all salvation through sanctification of the Spirit, and bilief in the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Proposition is false, <hi>That as many as in the judgement of charity were bought with the blood of God, as were to be fed with
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58837:47"/>
Doctrine and Discipline, and so with Excommunication;</hi> Then were they to esteem all the grievous Wolves that spared not the flock, but preached perverse things, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28, 29. and all that had in such a manner fallen from their first love, and first works, yea all the Apostates in the judgement of charity to be bought with the blood of God, and eternally chosen to life, and saved: for the Officers were to feed all these with Exhortations, Threatnings, Censures. Now the latter is unsound.</p>
               <p>But 3. <hi>They were all recommended to the care of Pastors, as dear bought.</hi> True: but not as if all were dear bought, the Text saith not that. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> no doubt, sinned with the Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in adding that to the Text; for a father departing may recommend his family of children and servants to a Steward, because (saith the father) they are dear to me; it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they are all dear to him as children.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The visible Church in the sense of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> as including <hi>Magus, Iudas,</hi> as such, is not Christs body. 2.

of charity, otherwise it is a sinful addition to the Text.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. A Church may be visibly in Covenant, which hath not an infallible assistance, may erre in fundamentals, fall away, and not endure as the dayes of heaven, and so are his first and fifth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments answered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is, I consess, soon done, if well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true, if men entertain such things as they call truths, when they are but lies of Arminians, it will be easie to <note place="margin">If a Church Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, the onely visible Church may fall away, as M. H. grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, then is not such a Church visible the first and principal subject of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, and of the like pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of special note in the Mediator, as M. H. saith.</note> wipe away all with a dry <hi>Negoconclusionem.</hi> My first argument <hi>to prove that the invisible, and not the visible single Congregation, is the principal, prime and onely proper subject of all the priviledges of special note given in the Mediator Christ,</hi> is <hi>Par. 1. pag.</hi> 244, 245. because that is such a subject of all these priviledges, to which onely and principally the Promises belong, that they are <hi>a seed enduring as the dayes of heaven,</hi> Psa. 89. and <hi>can no more cease to be in Gods Covenant</hi> favour, <hi>than the Ordinances of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can cease to be,</hi> Jer. 31. 35, 36. then <hi>the Mountains can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,</hi> Isa. 54. 10, &amp;c. But the visible Church of a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not such, &amp;c. Judge Reader of the answer.</p>
               <p>The fifth Argument, Because the invisible Church of the Elect is such as cannot erre in fundamentals, cannot fall from the Rock, and not the visible Church of the Congregation, whereof seven may be a Church, and six of them such materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als as <hi>Magus;</hi> nor can such a Congregation bear as the first, onely, and prime subject, these styles (say I, pag. 250.) that are proper onely to the Elect, Redeemed, and really sanctified Church, the styles of <hi>Christs Sister, Love, Dove, Spouse, My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Body of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> answers by yielding the Assumption, <hi>A Church may</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The single co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>be visibly in Covenant, may erre in fundamentals, may fall away.</hi> And this is Mr. <hi>R.</hi> first and fifth Arguments. Hence if perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and never falling away, be a special priviledge given in the Mediator Christ, and it agree not to the Congregational, the onely visible Church, and if it agree not to all visible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, then is not the visible Church the onely principal subject of such priviledges; since the world was, no Logick can say that a property can be denied of its first and onely subject, That is a man, and yet is not apt to laugh.</p>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:58837:48"/>
2. To be <hi>visibly in Covenant,</hi> is not a priviledge of special note, that is, a saving priviledge, such as Perseverance, to have the anointing, and a new heart: Of which saving priviledges I spake all along, pag. 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, &amp;c. for to be visibly in Covenant, agrees to <hi>Magus,</hi> and to all rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Members; but these saving priviledges of perseverance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his visible Church, which may, and doth fall away, saith Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Judge then, if these two Arguments be wiped away with a wet finger, as saith Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> p. 40, 41. <hi>A Church may be visibly red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emed by the blood of God, be called the Body of Christ, the Sons and Daughters of God, and yet not be really and inwardly such, which is his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Argument. The third is answered already.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is with a hop and a skip to take away Arguments. 1. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> should have done so much as repea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed the Argument. But to be really redeemed, to be the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to be, I say, <hi>in veritate rei, the Sons and Daughters of God,</hi> and not to be called so onely (a generation of Vipers call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. the holy seed) <hi>are priviledges of special note in the Mediator Christ,</hi> as I spake pag. 244. and these priviledges agree not to the visible and nominal Church, of which <hi>Magus</hi> is a Citizen, as to the principal, prime and onely subject, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> yieldeth; and so yieldeth the Argument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Church may be both visibly the Redeemed of God, and called, and be really the Body of Christ, and invisibly, be also the Redeemed of God, by a figure, as touching the sound and real visible Saints among them, but that destroys Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his cause, who will have all and every one in the judgement of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity redeemed, even so many as are fed with Word and Censures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> should have applied his answer to the Arguments, but he saw it would not frame. I have done it. Let the second thoughts of some help here. <note place="margin">M. H. must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound all the precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Lords giving the engraven Law in the heart, of Christs bearing our sins on the tree, with the like, <hi>according to the judgement of charity.</hi> Yea, and the Lord doth not, by this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, really commend his Church, but onely in the judgement of charity; as Cant. 2. 14. <hi>Thy voice</hi> (in prayer) <hi>is sweet,</hi> in the judgement of charity; and Cant. 4. 7. <hi>Thou art all fair, my love,</hi> in the judgement of charity; and v. 9, 10, 11, 12. must bear the like sense.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For Mr. <hi>H.</hi> must apply his answers to the cited places: so <hi>Ier. 31. 33. I will put my law in their inward parts,</hi> according to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58837:49"/>
the judgement of charity; and <hi>Ier. 32. I will put my fear in their hearts,</hi> according to the judgement of charity. And when the Lord saith, <hi>I was a husband to Israel,</hi> that is, in the judgement of charity. <hi>Isa. 53. He was stricken for the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of my people,</hi> that is, visible Saints, and for <hi>Magus,</hi> for my confederate people, in the judgement of charity.

                  </gap>ee not men dare to adde their after-birth inventions to the truth of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> addeth, pag. 40 <hi>They who hold that a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church is redeemed externally, cannot say by any good infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that Christ died for all such in Gods intention, or that all such are chosen to glory, or that God intendeth to save all such.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ars.</hi> This is said, not proved. If Christ die for the whole <note place="margin">If Christ die for all the world in the judgement of charity, he must intend in the same judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to die for them, &amp; must in the same judgement c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I judge Christs dying for us essentially includes his intention to save, to deliver from the present evil world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this charitable judgement of Mr. <hi>H</hi> believed Christ died for all the Members of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> (suppose <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> to be a baptized Member) he must in the same judgement believe that God intended to save <hi>Magus:</hi> yea, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> must believe in charity, by his death he intends to save all and every one in the visible Church, all the earth over, and so did choose to glorifie all the visible Saints, and consequently all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 1, 2. all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> all <hi>Assyria,</hi> Isa. 19. 25. <hi>all the Gentiles,</hi> Isa. 60. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. <hi>all the Kingdoms of the world,</hi> Rev. 11. 15. for they are all the visible Kingdoms and Churches of Christ; and charity shall forbid to believe, that there be one reprobate in the visible Churches, and shall necessitate Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to believe that God intends salvation, and so chose to salvation every man and woman of them. But I shall not undertake to reconcile our Brethrens charity and their faith, when the Lord shall fulfil the Prophesies, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. &amp; 19, &amp;c. And what reason is there, I pray you, to say, People are visibly redeemed, but not <note place="margin">Redemption how it is not properly visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> visibly chosen to glory? for the act of redeeming is not Christs visibly dying on the Cross, for that Redemption material was
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58837:49"/>
visibly to no generations before that crucifying of Christ, or to us; but it is the laying down of the ransom of that noble life for such a certain number of Elect, not one moe, not one fewer than are written in the Lambs Book of Life (I am of that opinion, I hope, with our Brethren) and this is as much hid and invisible to man, until their godly walk make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in its effects to be visible, as their eternal Election to glory; therefore I much wonder of Mr. <hi>Lockyers</hi> asserting from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. (but I hope my Reverend Brother Mr. <hi>Iames Wood</hi> hath by this silenced him: for we look for onely silence from him, except some other lewd brotherly help) that the proper and allowed <hi>matter of a visible Church now in the dayes of the Gospel, is persons truly converted, such as God who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>

                  <hi>interest in Christ, had yet a command from Christ to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Seals, had warrant from his Word to require them; then they had a right (outward and visible</hi> in foro Ecclesiae) <hi>to partake of them: for there is no better right than Gods Command to enjoyn, and his Word to warrant us to challenge any priviledge. But many graceless, who were no invisible members,</hi> Ishmael, Esau, <hi>and all the males were enjoyned to be circumcised, and all the houses of Israel to eat the Passover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. What is in question is not proved, to wit, <hi>That the priviledges of special note in the Mediator Christ,</hi> i. e. saving priviledges, as Mr. <hi>R.</hi> often teacheth, pag. 244, 245. belong <note place="margin">Hypocrites have not any Ecclesiasticall right to the seals from the command of God, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the condition.</note> not to the <hi>invisible Church as to the proper and first subject.</hi> But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> proves, <hi>That external signs, and external right to the Seals, in foro Ecclesiae, are bestowed upon rotten Members,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus <hi>and others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He ought to prove the visible Church is the onely prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal subject of the seals, as he elswhere asserts. But this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument proves it not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He frames the Argument of Infants, who have right to be circumcised, who have no command of Christ (for Infants are not capable of commands or threatnings) and brings not instances of these come to age under the New Testament.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A graceless man, as <hi>Magus,</hi> hath thus far right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Seals, that he may say to the Church, <hi>You sin in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Seals, and therefore I require you baptize me, as Christ hath commanded you:</hi> but he cannot say, <hi>I have right even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal to receive Baptism, and I sin not in receiving it.</hi> And Mr.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58837:50"/>
                  <hi>H.</hi> Argument to prove it is naught: Why, saith he, <hi>Graceless men have the command of God to challenge the Seals; Magus</hi> hath the command of God to challenge, and to receive the Lords Supper. A command absolute he hath none: shew me such a command, <hi>Magus, Iudas, eat and drink at the Lords Supper, challenge, claim and receive Baptism; All Israel eat the Passover, be ye real believers or hypocrites, be ye self-triers, and prepared or not, be ye clean or unclean:</hi> I confess there were no better right to challenge the Seals, than such a command, if any such were; but if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> or any of his reade such a command, I pray I may see, and reade also. But <hi>Magus</hi> hath onely a conditional command, which gives him no true and real right, save onely conditionally, to wit, <hi>Magus, receive the Seals and the Lords Supper, so thou believe, and examine thy self; if not, thou hast no right to the seals, but eatest and drinkest thine own damnation:</hi> And because these graceless men fulfil not the condition, and believe not, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Argument is wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The thing denied is not concluded. <hi>Iob</hi> and his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly friends had the marrow of the Seals, and wanted some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal signs, which are not <hi>saving priviledges,</hi> as I alledge pag. 244. That <hi>Iob</hi> was not circumcised, possibly is said, not proved by Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. My minde is not to deny that the visible acts of eating, drinking, being washed in Baptism, belong not to visible belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as visible, taking visible as coincident with real believers; for invisible men can no more visibly partake of Ordinances, than Spirits can be baptized, and eat the Lords Supper.</p>

                     </gap>. 41. If the invisible Church be the first subject of the seals, the invisible Church must have the seals firstly, and the visible Church secondarily; as heat is first in the element of fire, and secondarily in things hot by participation, as iron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is no Logick: If the invisible and real believer, for example, <hi>Peter,</hi> be the first subject of the seals, including Christ signified in them, then to receive the seals worthily, agree first to <hi>Peter</hi> and to invisible real believers, and secondarily to these same invisible believers, as they do visibly declare by their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury conversation, that they are really believers: but there is no real transmigration of accidents out of one subject to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <note place="margin">The visible Church as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, is not the first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal subject of the seals, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their substance of the new heart, perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp;c.</note> that is cold Logick: but such real and internal right to the seals, and to Christ and his grace signified by the seals, do neither firstly nor secondarily belong to such visible Saints as <hi>Magus</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> yea neither <hi>per se,</hi> nor <hi>per participationem;</hi> as the Sun and Stars are neither hot nor cold, either firstly or secondarily, for they are, <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, <hi>Corpora quintae essentiae,</hi> bodies of a fifth essence, different from the elements and all mixed bodies.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> p. 42, 43. <hi>The Olive tree is the prime subject of the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that issues from it, and appertains to it, and of all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. But the visible Church,</hi> Rom. 11. <hi>is the Olive, the seals and other priviledges are part of the fatness which pertains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: Therefore the visible Church is the prime subject of them. That the Olive is the visible Church, see</hi> Beza, Pareus, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Will Mr. <hi>H.</hi> bide by this Conclusion, That the visible Church, including rotten <hi>Magus,</hi> trayterous <hi>Iudas,</hi> is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58837:51"/>
the prime subject of all saving priviledges, of the new heart, <note place="margin">The olive tree Rom. 16. 15. not the visible Congregation as visible, but as it includeth the Elect; and the fatness is not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of which <hi>Magus</hi> parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</note> Gods inward heart-teaching, perseverance, &amp;c? Then by his own argument, <hi>Magus,</hi> and the visible body whereof he is a graceless member, as visible, must be first qualified inherently with all these saving priviledges, as heat is firstly (saith he) in the fire; and then Justification, Perseverance in grace, must be transferred from such an ugly body as <hi>Magus, Iudas, &amp;c.</hi> to real and invisible believers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Assumption is false: Reade again <hi>Calvin, Beza, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus;</hi> adde <hi>Pet.

Martyr, They that are far off are made nigh,</hi> Ephes. 2. 12, 14. and <hi>were engrafted in the Head and Body,</hi> saith <hi>Pareus;</hi> yea, <hi>Willet</hi> citeth <hi>Gorham,</hi> and <hi>Lyra,</hi> who expound the fatness of habitual grace.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Let Mr.</hi> R. <hi>remember he said, lib. 2. pag. 260. None</hi>

                  <hi>are to be cast out for non-regeneration known to be such. But if ye give them the seals (saith Mr.</hi> H.) <hi>the Church shall give the seals to such whom she knows have no right to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself is alike burthened with this as I am: A <note place="margin">Ch 2. p. 27. Non-regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not men from Church-right to the seals, as M. H. imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> toleration there must be of some, until the scandals be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Censures applied, and the Church knows men to be unregenerated, many dayes before they can know it <hi>juridicè.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> then answer, whether they should be debarred from the seals or not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If such were admitted being free of scandal, it follows not (its a poor begging of the question) that the Church should admit to the seals such as she knows hath no right. Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not in the judgement of charity real converts; that is, <hi>non causa pro causa,</hi> no cause.</p>

of Offices and Officers in another subject, besides the visible Church, in the invisible Catholick Church, convertibly, or reciprocally and universally. Whatsoever hath these priviledges, to wit, Offices, Officers, Seals, right to the Seals, &amp;c. is the invisible Catholick Church. And onely the invisible Catholick Church</hi> (Ergo, <hi>not the visible) hath all these priviledges. If Mr.</hi> R. <hi>rid his hands, &amp;c. its good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath two pages near by of this, of which whether <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>R.</hi> places not the formal reason of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, officers, seals in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, as Mr. H. saith.</note> I have rid my hands, let the judicious Reader determine. Know, Reader, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will have all priviledges, external Offices, Officers, Seals, and right Ecclesiastick (which is formally a painted bastard right) in the visible Church, onely as its first subject: I rid my hands of this, by granting it; take the visible Church in a good sense, as including good and bad, nor said I ever any thing to the contrary. But these are not the <hi>saving priviledges of special note,</hi> such as to be taught of God, to persevere in saving grace, &amp;c. as I oft say, p. 244, 245, &amp;c. And though Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his priviledges, to be an Apostle, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officer, to have right external to the seals (a bastard right) agree to the visible Church, yea to <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Magus,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>gratiae gratis datae:</hi> yet saving priviledges, the anointing; the new heart, Justification, Perseverance; the styles of Spouse, Sister, Love, Dove, &amp;c. are such as I desire Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to rid his hands, and to clear the coasts to us, by his answer to my words. <hi>Due right,</hi> par. 1. pag. 244, 245. divers pages; how these agree reciprocally to his visible Church. I take but some few. <hi>The single Congregatinn of such as</hi> Magus <hi>and</hi> Peter, <hi>&amp;c. is the first and reciprocal, and proper subject of the anointing, of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perseverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And convertibly, <hi>All that have the anointing, are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, persevere, are onely the single independent Congregation of such as</hi> Magus <hi>and</hi> Peter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then will Mr <hi>H.</hi> do with his own, that are both visibly and invisibly justified, regenerate, who by persecution or pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence are broken from the Independent Church? Shall they not share of the anointing, because they are not Members of the single Congregation? This is hard measure to the godly, and bad Divinity. This is not good Logick, that therefore
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58837:52"/>
Mr. <hi>R. must shew some other essential causes of Offices and Officers besides the invisible Church:</hi> He must mean the visible Church of which <hi>Magus</hi> is a Member. I know in Logick, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is an essential cause of an accident; <hi>Subjectum sumitur in d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And for the close, the society, the saving priviledges, of the new heart, perseverance, is the invisible Church; and all that have these, the anointing, perseverance, &amp;c. is the invisible my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical true Church. I own this reciprocation, as new Logick; though let not the Reader mistake, I take invisible as opposed to visible in its latitude, as it takes in both believing <hi>Peter,</hi> and the hypocrite <hi>Magus;</hi> yet so, as the visible Church is so named, to wit, a true visible Church, from the choicest part, but not as invisible is opposed to visible, <hi>tali modo,</hi> both visible and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere: for the Catholick Church invisible, is also the Catholick Church visible, to wit, <hi>tali modo,</hi> in a sincere profession vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>

               <p n="2">2. It is uncharitable, and against the Word, to teach, That when a Church is dissolved, by no sin and scandal visible, but by persecution or pestilence, that the dissolved members, though both real and visible converts, have no right to the Ordinances: for if the formal cause, to wit, their confederacy into one visible body, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, be removed, their visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and external right is removed. The like is to be said of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible professors, and of members of another Congregation, and known godly sojourners; these Mr. <hi>H.</hi> excommunicates for no scandal visible and invisible: for impossible it is that they <hi>can meet together in one place with their own Church,</hi> with which onely they are incorporate by this confederacy.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The act of mutual engaging, which passeth away, arising from the act of obligation, the state of membership. The nature of incorporating members to mutual duties will constrain to yield to this.</hi>

                  <hi>The second part of the Assumption is clear by</hi> Matth. 18. <hi>where a legal order is set, by which brethren only of the same Church ought to exercise power one over another, not over infidels, nor yet with other Christians; for I rebuke a Christian of another Church, I cannot call the Church; he departs the place and refuses to come; but I may in a legal way convince and bind</hi> Archippus, <hi>for he is a brother;</hi> and Mr. <hi>R. saith, if the classis will not censure him, the congregation may reject him.</hi> Learned <hi>Whitaker</hi> saith, <hi>That each of the congregation or counsel hath power over the Apostle Peter, as a brother to censure him;</hi> so saith Mr. <hi>R.</hi>

As to that, Whether the Church or the Ministery be first, it is sure, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah,</hi> as men, were before the Word: if <note place="margin">The ministery must be before the church of believers.</note> any say, They being created according to the Image of God, were created a Church; yet some priority there is of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, before the concreated Law: but sure they were not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a visibly professing Church, and therefore the Word, as preached in Paradise by the Lord the first Minister, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15, 16. must be before <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah</hi> as a visibly professing Church. For, the seed is before the tree, the means before the end, the father before the childe, and so some Ministery, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or extraordinary begetting, there must be, before the Church begotten. Who baptized <hi>Iohn Baptist?</hi> or if he was at all baptized, is not much. But that the Church in the ordinary way of Christ is before the baptizing and begetting Ministery, is wilde Divinity.</p>

                  <hi>a Ministerial Church before a Congregational Church, which onely can call them to be Ministers; then such a Church is much more before Baptism. For before the coming of some godly zealous Christian and Scholar into a countrey where there are a company of Pagans converted, they may joyn in Church-fellowship, and call this man lawfully according to God, to be their Minister, therefore there is a Church before a Minister, and so before Baptism.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.

               <p n="3">3. Doth not Mr. <hi>H.</hi> dress up a providence of a Christian Scholar sent to converted Pagans, and must they be made the ordinary and onely Church who can call Ministers? and this Scholar being unbaptized himself, must as the married Pastor in the ordinary way of Christ baptize to his dying day others, and his calling must be null (say our Brethren) except that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Answer to 32 questions, q. 20. p. 67.</note> Church call him; and according to the ordinary Rule of Christ, he must be all his life unbaptized (which must be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of Baptism, with the <hi>Famil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The conclusion is fancied, and nothing against me. 2. There be two things in baptized Members.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God is their God, of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Assyria,</hi> fathers and sons under the New Testament, as the Prophecy is, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 1, 2. &amp; 19. 25. &amp; 60. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. 2.

               <p n="2">2. There is the solemnity of admission by Baptism in the excommunicate; this is hurt: but its no more to me the formal cause of Membership, than the ceremony of Coronation, or the

delivery of a Sword, is the specifick form of a King, and of a Major: and therefore all is granted, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is a wonder that M. <hi>H.</hi> cannot find valid argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bear a free conclusion. For to me Baptism is not a means of a Church-membership simply, but of a Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>tali modo,</hi> that is, of a member conspicuously and solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differenced from a Pagan.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is bad Divinity to join the nocent excommunicate man with the innocent dissolved member.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a naughty argument to prove that Baptism is a <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accident of the covenant:</hi> why? because its <hi>efficacy may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by unbelief:</hi> for the efficacy of any thing is the <hi>actus se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus,</hi> the operation of it, not its essence; so he may prove that Christ the essential subject of the Gospel is a separable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident <note place="margin">How Baptism is hurt in the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</note> of the Gospel and covenant of Grace, because both the efficacy of the Gospel and of the Redeemer, by mens unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and unbelief is hindered.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He concludes not so much as his own fansied conclusion; to wit, this only, <hi>ergo</hi> the efficacy of baptism is not the specified form of visible membership; <hi>valeat totum:</hi> what Dreamer said any such thing? it is sure baptism <hi>in fieri,</hi> as it is administrate and professed, is the means of the excommunicate mans solemn installing and engaging to be a follower of Christ: and by the scandal that brings on excommunication baptism as professed and as binding is so far hurt as the Covenant-Baptismal is viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and if the man be excommunicate for Apostasy, then it is disputable whether Baptism be not quite undone.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is weak moral Philosophy which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> addeth, that <hi>well deserving in an heir gives formality to possession.</hi> Well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving gives just and Law-right to possession in the heir: But
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58837:64"/>
he is a weak Lawyer who would so plead; the innocent Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller believing in God hath due deserving to his own purse, which yet is in the bloody Robbers pocket. Why Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith he hath well deserving, which (saith he) <hi>is the formal cause of possession,</hi> and so he must have possession, for the formal cause cannot be separated from <hi>formatum.</hi> And so godly <hi>David</hi> unjustly expelled from his Kingdom for many years, yet deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well, must have right both to possess his Kingdom, and not possess it, for if he have the formal cause of possession, he must have possession when he is expelled. <note place="margin">

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. It shall follow that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is a true Church, for all the members of that Church have true baptism, which is the formal cause of a true Church: but that is false, that that Church is a true Church.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The conclusion of the connex proposition is nothing against me, who deny Baptism to be the formal cause of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such a Baptism that is valid, as touching the substance of the seal, as is in <hi>Rome,</hi> such a Church according to the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physick entity</hi> and being of a Church, is <hi>Rome</hi> a Ministerial Church, teaching necessary fundamentals, though darkning and contradicting all; but it is not <hi>morally</hi> a true Church, but leprose and unclean. See what <hi>Iunius, Whitaker, Calvin</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetus</hi> say hereupon: Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is far from their sound expressions; if this be true, then to <hi>Iezabel</hi> and seducing Teachers, who are under the Church-covenant, the formal cause of membership must appertain, and they must be Church-members, and must be tolerate, till they be judicially tried, and censures applyed, so Mr. <hi>H.</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Survey. par. 1. c. 2. pag. 29, 30.</note> and Church priviledges bestowed on them at the command of Christ. So also Mr. <hi>H.</hi>

Which is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The seal of our incorporation, which is latter and poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58837:64"/>
to the incorporation cannot be the form of it; for the Sacrament is not appointed to make a thing that was not, but to confirm that was; or it doth not give, but confirm grace.</hi> But such is Baptism.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The conclusion is not against me.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Observe that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> sides with <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi>

Baptism seals that union with the visible Church, which was <hi>actu primo</hi> in Infants, being born fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derally holy, <hi>Rom. 11. 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 14. and is a way and means of one more solemn installing in the visible Church; as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Keys of a Castle, both confirms the covenant of the Princes giving of the Castle to the receiver, and doth more solemnly authorize the man as Captain of the Castle. The like may be said of the press-money received by the souldier, who before had given up his name to the Captain, and that by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The Church was visible, when there was no seal, neither</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. These five Arguments Mr. <hi>H.</hi> borrowed from the <note place="margin">Answ. to 32. Quest. Q. 4. pag. 12, 13, 14. Baptisme is a seal of grace and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which were before Baptism was.</note> brethren, but weakened them by an unjust conclusion, which I own not, nor any of our brethren. This argument also is apt to destroy all the seals; for there was a Church of visible rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate persons, and of such as by faith saw Christs day in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> house, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. and as yet neither was there Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor Passeover, nor Baptism: will it hence follow, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is essentially no seal of regeneration, nor of any covenant or covenant-Grace, because covenant, covenant-grace, visible membership, and all these were before either circumcision or baptism? but sacred signs are seals of graces and priviledges go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before these signs, both in time and nature.</p>
               <p>Circumcision so shall essentially be no seal of the covenant, nor of the righteousness of faith, contrary to <hi>Gen. 17. 7. Rom.</hi> 3. 11. For there was a people visibly in covenant, and <hi>Abraham</hi> was righteous before that circumcision was instituted. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing follows, but onely baptism doth not seal our union with Christ, and solemn entry into his Church-visible, until the

               <p>FOr the better understanding of the question, Church-right to membership, and to Ordinances and Seals must be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it is in, and referred to the professor himselfe; and then <note place="margin">A necessary discourse how profession gives right to membership, how not.</note> the question is upon what ground may the man himself chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a room in the visible house, and the seals: now professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as profession is not a ground, for then a man should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally made a visible member, and be fed as one of the flock, and be externally called (which are <hi>finaliter,</hi> and in themselves saving mercies) because he professeth his desire to be fed, and to have the Gospel sent unto him.</p>

               <p n="2">2. To have right true and real to Membership and to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, is to be called of God in a Church-way, from sin to grace and glory. So <gap reason="foreign">

Now no man hath right, true and real to membership and seals, and to be called of a God in a Church-way by the preached Gospel, because he professeth that he desires to be called; but the whole right and ground here is the Lords free grace, sending the Gospel to whom he will, <hi>Deut. 7. 7. Deut. 10. 14, 15. Psal. 147. 10, 29. Acts 16. 6, 9, 10. Acts</hi> 18. 6, 7, 8 9.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58837:65"/>
then other people, <hi>Bythinia</hi> especially, at this time, because so <hi>Corinth</hi> shall profess the Gospel, before ever they hear the Gospel; but here the Lord hath mercy upon whom he will.</p>
               <p>But 3. when the Gospel is come to a people, if the question be, what gives to this man, not to this man true real right to Membership, and Ordinances, and Seals, so as he may claim them before God and not sin: The meritorious right is Christs death, the condition upon his part is faith; hence visible profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as such cannot give right: for then might <hi>Magus</hi> say, I have right to a room in the visible Church, and to baptism, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am a visible Saint: for that is an untruth.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

It declares (I say as before) but does not as a formal cause make a Church-member, and it declares he hath right as a citizen of the visible Church, that Rulers without sin may admit him to Ordinances: but profession makes him not a member visible of onely this <note place="margin">Its not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of divine institution, that a man be a fixed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of this congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> one congregation; yea, that one be a fixed member of this congregation, is, 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Its a pity to black paper with such <hi>Wind-mills. Where there be the same individual members, there must be the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual whole or</hi> totum integrale. All the individual members of a mans body, either similar parts, flesh, and blood, and bones; or the Organs, eyes, ears, feet, hand, and all the rest taken together, as united, are the whole organical body of man; and so all the Congregations on earth, taken together, are, and make up the whole integral Catholick visible Church, existing in all the Kingdomes and States of the earth.

And as all the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> are fixed and near members

of <hi>London,</hi> and proper parts thereof, and yet common and remote members and Subjects of <hi>England.</hi> Hence by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his own Argument, <hi>Where there be the same individual mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, thereof necessity must be the same whole integral:</hi> So <hi>I assume</hi> (saith he.) <hi>But there be the same individual members of all the particular Congregations.</hi> I assume also, <hi>Iohn, Richard, Thomas,</hi> Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> are all in their very individual natures, individual Subjects of <hi>England.</hi> Ergo, <hi>London</hi> must be <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>York</hi> must be <hi>London;</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> must be <hi>Richard</hi> Citizen of <hi>Yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Again I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, the same individual thumb, and individual little finger and toes, and individual eyes and ears, are all members of the hand, or congregation of fingers, of the feet and society of toes, &amp;c. and they are also common members of the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical body. Therefore by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Logick, the thumb must be the little finger; and when the thumb is cut off, the thumb remains.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is from no marriage engagement, but from providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial conveniency; the wise Lord seeing it Physically impossible, that the whole Catholike Church so numerous can be fed in the same field, by the same men, therefore he divided them in sundry little flocks, over which the shepherds combined, have power not as married husbands but as meer servants.</p>

               <p>This is most false, and not proved by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> for the just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is true.</p>
               <p>If covenants between Master and Servant, between Husband <note place="margin">The covenants of master and servant, and marriage co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants be of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer onely in number, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not that a master may claim all men on earth to be his servants, or that a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band may claim all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on earth to be his wives; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</note> and Wife differ in number; then must a Master make a covenant in number different with servants; one with this servant, and another covenant different in number from that, with another; or then he can claim neither the one nor the other for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, because covenants between master and servant, are all of the same common nature: nor because <hi>Abraham</hi> married <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> and all marriage-covenants are of the same essence and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can <hi>Abraham</hi> claim <hi>Hagar</hi> and another third woman, and a fourth for his wives, and except he have a marriage covenant with <hi>Hagar</hi> different in number from the marriage-covenant with <hi>Sarah,</hi> and a third marriage-covenant with the third dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in number, he cannot claim any of them for his wives: for <hi>Hagar</hi> may say, though all marriage-covenants be of the same essence and nature; yet because <hi>Abraham</hi> never made a marriage-covenant with me by name, which is essentially requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all covenants of that kind, he is not my husband, nor am I his wife. So a people cannot say to a Pastor of another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <hi>thou art our fixed, proper Pastor, obliged to reside with us, and to imploy thy labours ordinarily upon us only,</hi> except they had particularly chosen him by name; but this will not hinder, but all elections and covenants with Pastors, as fixed and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary labourers with them, are of the same essence and nature, and differ only in number and accidents; nor can this hinder but a Pastor of another Congregation is a Pastor <hi>habitu</hi> and <hi>actu primò,</hi> to all Congregations on earth, and no married hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to that Congregation: though it be physically impossible,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58837:73"/>
and contrary to reason, to say he can be a fixed, proper chosen Pastor to all the Congregations of the earth; for fixedness and election of the people is not of the essence of a Pastor.</p>

                  <p>The Arguments of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> against the Church-Covenant are vindicated.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>H. Relation as such is not a foundation of a Covenant, when Twins are born, or Brethren and Sisters near to other in time. The duties issuing there from have their rise and power from the Impression of the Rule of nature, such relations may be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied without a covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This destroys your Church-covenant, for many in sister-Churches, men and women, are born over again, and made visible members of the body of Christ, and made fellow Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to them that are far off, and near to the whole houshold of God, Jewes and Gentiles, <hi>Eph. 2. 19, 20, 21. Eph. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 Cor. 10. 17. 1 Cor. 12. 12, 13. Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23. And the duties <note place="margin">The necessity of a Church-covenant is Scriptureless and dark.</note> issuing hence rise from no covenant soddering the members to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one single flock: for they belong to many flocks, but only from the rule of renewed nature. Therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to prove, if there be a necessity of a voluntary covenant, that visible Saints of two Congregations now agreeing to be fellow-members of a third Congregation, are now more bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren by <hi>Mat.</hi>

               <p>And 2. so <hi>Paul</hi> hath been less accurate then our brethren in the visible oneness of brethren.</p>

3. There must be no visible brotherhood, nor Church one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but by ordinary meeting within the walls of the same house.</p>
               <p>And 4. this covenanting either implicit or explicit must be of as great necessity as a visible Church on earth.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The covenant once made by mutual agreement of parents,</hi>

                  <hi>may be communicated to the seed, without their consent,</hi> Deut. 29. 10. <hi>A Minister is a Minister to children born of parents, who have elected him to be their Minister, and they are within the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by vertue of that covenant which their parents made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Nothing then makes children within the covenant <note place="margin">Children are not under the tie of the Church-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> of grace visibly, but your Congregational covenant. But sure <hi>Israels</hi> seed by <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12, &amp;c. and <hi>Gen. 17. 7. Act.</hi> 2. 39. were born in visible covenant with God, and they knew not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such Congregational watching over one another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The seed of dissolved members, visible Saints, are then without any sin in parents and children (to speak comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) born Pagans, but the Scripture teacheth us of no losing of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-right, but by sin, either of the parties themselves, or of their parents.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How are then children of covenanting parents born Church members; yet, when come to age, if they cannot evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence their regeneration holden all their life, for no Church-members are debarred from the Lords Supper, living and dying Pagans? are Ministers, because of their covenant, Ministers to Pagans?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Scripture teacheth that parents oblige the children to the Gospel-covenant, <hi>Deut. 29. Gen.</hi> 17. but no Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that parents lay bands of oath and vow of God to be visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble members of only (for example) the Congregation of <hi>Boston,</hi> of only <hi>Hartford;</hi> for look what covenant obligation lies upon the parents which is to that Congregation by name only, the like must lie upon the children.</p>

                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:58837:74"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The vow in Baptism, and the Gospel-covenant professed <note place="margin">The covenant of grace being so necessary, the Church-covenant is needless.</note> by me, without any new engagement, obligeth me in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches I am in, to be my brothers keeper, and watch for his soul, otherwise I may make this count, <hi>Lord, I was not obliged to any Church-watching over my brother, but my Congregational brother by</hi> Mat. 18.</p>
               <p>But 1. was he not thy brother before thou wast inchurched into one Congregation with him? (shall the Lord say.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wast thou not to eat the same bread with him before as then? by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is no need of engagement to watch Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationally over all with whom thou eatest the Lords Supper, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou being so journer enter in oath to every Congregation, and break it in the morrow.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The covenant of Prince and people, husband and wife hath nothing to do with this, except the nearer visible one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, brotherhood, &amp;c. of which I spoke, be cleared from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and M. <hi>H.</hi> prove that <hi>Peter</hi> is tied by oath to that only Pastor and Flock, as subjects to one only soveraign.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. <hi>The covenant of grace may be taken in the narrowest acception (believe and live) so it is inward and invisible between the soul and God. But if you take it in the breadth, as it includes whatever is warranted by the Gospel, so it is visible and includeth the Church-covenant, and its ordinance of the Gospel, but not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the covenant of the Gospel if the Churches be dissolved through persecution, they are not obliged to the duties of confederacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> (Believe and live) is not the narrowest, nor the invisible covenant, but the summe of all duties given to all the visible Church, <hi>Ioh. 3. 16, 18. Ioh. 5. 24, 40. Ioh. 11. 26, 27. Rom.</hi> 10. 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this be a Gospel ordinance, give us Scripture for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Dissolved members are never loosed from Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, comforting, rebuking, otherwise they were not to gaine their brethren.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Christ by no hint or shadow, layes the duty of gaining a brother upon our membership with single Congregations, a thing of order and providential necessity; but upon brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>Mat. 11. If thy brother trespass against thee,</hi> &amp;c. Now he

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The instance brought by me is as well of a moral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">The peoples chusing makes not a Minister.</note> as a natural father, and his either agreeing by promise or oath to the people, makes him not a Pastor, (a Pastor to them is another thing) nor doth the election of the people make a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, the ordination of the Elders by prayer makes him a Pastor, <hi>Act. 6. 6. 1 Tim. 5. 22. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The being a Pastor to the people doth not make a Pastor, for it is but <hi>actus secundus,</hi> the exercise of his calling, not the essence of the Minister.</p>

                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:58837:75"/>
3. The man doth tender the Lords Supper, which is a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick and proper act of a Pastor, and that warrantably, to these who are of another Congregation, and never chused him for their Pastor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other two hurt not the truth (I desire not to plead mine own cause) a man is made a servant to a master by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <note place="margin">The peoples choice of <hi>A.

               <p n="3">3. My Argument proves, that swearing, as it includes a free agreement to the duties of a Father (Moral) or Officer, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or Pastor, doth not make the man a Father, a Master, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, especially when the man is Father, servant of Christ, and Pastor <hi>habitu,</hi> and <hi>actu primo,</hi> to all the Churches on earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he agree to be Father and Pastor to this Congregation, as I thus illustrate, a free City appoint four men fearing God to be Rulers, or Bailiffes to them, the City divides it self into four quarters: the first quarter agreeth with such a man to rule them: The next quarter agreeth with the second to rule, and so do the rest. Now no man can say this first quarter made the man a Magistrate, for the whole City made all the four of private men to be publick Magistrates, and quarters by agreement did only appropriate their labours to them. So <hi>Titio</hi> covenants with a Mason, with a Gardener to build him a House, and plant him a Vineyard; yet this agreement makes neither the one a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor the other a Gardener, for they were such before: nor doth the sick mans chusing of such a Physician to cure him, make the man a Physician. Any man knows that the people call and chuse <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> not that they may make him a gracious and an able Minister, but because they discerned him to be such, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they chused him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Witness who swears to tell the truth, engageth cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-wise to tell the truth, though the engagement be put upon him by the command of the Judge.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Neither the incestuous Corinthian,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 73, 74. (saith Mr. <hi>R.) nor these</hi> 3000. Act. 2. <hi>nor</hi> Samaria, <hi>nor any planted

Churches of</hi> Ephesus, <hi>Acts 19. of</hi> Corinth, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. Berea, Philippi, Thessalonica, Rome, <hi>give any hint of a Church-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Ans. The Churches forgiving and confirming of their love to the incestuous Corinthian, was a receiving of him of new to covenant; had his profession at large made him a member, he had been a member whether the Church received him or not; or had ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism made him a member, that remaining, he should have been a member; a disfranchised man is so received by Covenant anew to City-priviledges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Nothing is answered to these celebrious Samplar-Churches planted without this new covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One excommunicate for a particular scandal, as the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous <note place="margin">No Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenant in the first plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches.</note>

               <p n="3">3. But of Baptism before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The forgiving of that man, may say somewhat to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of him to the priviledges of the Covenant of Grace, but nothing of a Church-covenant.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The civil Corporations way of re-admitting disfranchised members, is no binding Rule to the Church of God.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. There is no word of Church-covenant in these places,</hi> Acts 2. <hi>it follows not,</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is not in the word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The consequence is not valid from particular Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: but if there be no Covenant in any place, where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">There is no ground in Scripture for a Church-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> is made of planting of Churches, it holds well. <hi>Heb. 7. 14. Moses</hi> (who in his writings speaks of all sorts of Priests) spake nothing concerning Priesthood in the Tribe of <hi>Iudah: Ergo,</hi> there is no Priest of that Tribe. And there is no hint in Scripture, where the sacrifice of Christ is spoken of, that there is any ungodly sacrifice: <hi>Ergo,</hi> (say our Divines) the sacrifice of the Mass is a device of men. So no such Covenant is in Scripture in framing of Churches.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is no doubt they took themselves engaged by <note place="margin">Their perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as is said, could neither of them be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible before they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> Baptism.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Where there is a solemn baptizing into a Church, the person is made a Disciple of Christ,</hi> Matth. 28. 19. <hi>So to be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple, is to be ingraffed into the body of Christ, and to be made a fellow-heir of the same body,</hi> Eph. 3. 6. <hi>that is, of the visible Church,</hi> Joh. 12. 40. <hi>though many believed in him, yet they would not confess him, or be his disciples.</hi>

But the truth is, the inward
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58837:77"/>
state of none can be said either a falshood or reality to the Church, following the Rule of the Word in dispensing of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; for in the like, neither regeneration nor non rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration can be the object of the Churches discerning. Also this is to be observed, that Christ hath made the sounder part of the visible Church, the Church in the actual exercise of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Christ never gave a power to erre or to sin to his Church visible, or to any part thereof; as Nature gave not a power to the locomotive faculty to halt, but to move: therefore he cannot have given a power to a Synod as many, but as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding right; and to Members as choosing discerningly, not as erroneously.</p>

               <p>Obj. <hi>But so no questions shall be determined in Church meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for two may say they onely meet in Christs Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> These are but words: for if they not onely say so, but it be a real truth, and if all the rest erre in that act, these two are onely the visible Church, though men judge them turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Schismaticks.</p>
               <p>Hence, by the way, a word of that necessary and judicious question moved by <hi>Calvin,</hi> Matth. 18. 18. <hi>What ye binde on</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; loosing on earth &amp; in heaven, Mar. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>earth, &amp;c.</hi> Since the Church tolerateth many hypocrites, and absolveth and looseth many who do but counterfeit and fancy Repentance, shall we say that such are loosed and pardoned in heaven? Some say, by <hi>heaven</hi> here is meant the visible Church;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58837:78"/>
and they distinguish between <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Scandal:</hi> and therefore that by <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>loosing,</hi> here is meant, not forgiveness, or justification, or absolution from the guilt of sin in heaven, or in the Court of God, or condemnation for that sin, but onely deliverance from scandal, and the removing of scandal, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of the man into the visible Church as a Member: sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his repentance be but hypocritical, yet when the Church proceedeth impartially, according to the Rule of Christ, the sentence is ratifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by God, and the man is loosed from the scandal, though not from the sin; the sin is yet bound before God, because he hath not really repented; otherwise the Church, who knows not heart-actings, and who really repent, who not, though proceeding right according to the Rule of Christ, should not have the promise of ratifying in heaven what they do on earth, fulfilled to them; which cannot be said.</p>
               <p>But taking it for a good observation that <hi>Calvin</hi> hath here, that <hi>Matth. 16. Christ</hi> speaketh of binding and loosing <hi>concio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> by the Word preached; but here, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. he speaketh especially of binding and loosing juridical in the Court of the Church, by Excommunication or Absolution from that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. In the former consideration the question is easie.</p>
               <p>No Pastor in preaching Gospel-promises or threatnings, can binde, but conditionally: If the party do not believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the mans sin is bound in heaven; if he do believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, his sin is loosed in heaven.</p>
               <p>As to the other, we finde in the Word no such signification of <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>loosing,</hi> in regard of scandal, but they are ever <note place="margin">Calv. Resp. <hi>Non ad alios dirigi sermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, quam qui rectè ac sincerè Ecclesiae se re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliant.</hi> Mat. 18. is nota rule for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, as if their sins were loosed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> spoken of in regard of sin and the guilt thereof.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Calvin</hi> saith well, That the speech of Christ is directed to no other than to those who duly and sincerely do reconcile themselves with the Church; and the Lord being willing to comfort trembling consciences, is not setting down a Rule for comfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

is for such as obey, and for those who fulfil the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>non de obliquis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the doubt, That the Church often absolves such who really repent not, how then can the hypocrite be loosed in heaven, when the Lord knows he does but fancy Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Two things hère are to be distinguished.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Churches proceeding in the external Court, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to them, if they impartially, according to the Rule of Christ, proceed, and be not sudden in re-admitting, but see the incestuous man near swallowed up (though one mans measure of visible repentance be not the Rule <hi>to all)</hi> before they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their love to him, and forgive him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. Suppose his repentance be but counterfeit, or not saving and real, as was that of <hi>Ahab,</hi> yet are they to receive him, and admit him to the Ordinances, and the Lord ratifies what they do in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord ratifies <hi>Philips</hi> baptizing of <hi>Magus;</hi> and the <note place="margin">The Lord rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in heaven what the Church doth on earth, though the hypocrite be not pardoned.</note> Lord approves the Servants inviting to the marriage-supper the man that wanted the wedding-garment: for what the Lord commands, that he must approve and ratifie in heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What in charitable judgements is praise-worthy, that God also must ratifie in heaven; yea, it is praise-worthy in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, when they heard Christ say, <hi>One of you twelve hath a Devil, one of you shall betray the Son of Man;</hi> every one suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and feared himself; none of the eleven suspected <hi>Iudas,</hi> but gave him charity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Without this God should not approve the gathering of Churches, nor the casting of the draw-net in the Sea, nor the sowing of seed upon all sort of grounds, the way side, the thorny, the rocky, the good ground, that the chosen, who are yet in the state of nature, may be brought in, and effectually called.

                     </gap>ed spicio, potestatem tribuit Apostolis, ut sciant qui ab ipsis condemnantur, hominum sententiam divinâ sententiâ roborari. Ita <hi>Cyprian.</hi> de Un t. Eccles. <hi>c.</hi> 3. Ita <hi>Chrysostomus.</hi> Ita <hi>Augustinus</hi> in loc. <hi>What ye shall bind</hi> (Diodati) <hi>proceeding in knowledge, uprightness, and wisedom. English Divines,</hi> An. in loc. 18. <hi>Whatsoever ye shall bind</hi> (Ioh. 20 23. 1 Cor. 5. 4.) <hi>by convincing men of sin against God, or of wrong done to you. The sentence of Absolution to the penitent is concional, and so conditional, to the Church right proceeding is absolute and juridical. There is not the like measure of visible Saintship required of one at his first admission and at his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission after excommunication.</hi>
                  </note> the Church, the Pastor, thus: <hi>Be it unto thee according to thy Faith and Repentance;</hi> and except the man really repent, his sin is not loosed in heaven. So then, the Churches loosing from the scandal is conditional, upon a seen condition of outward repentance morally sincere to the Churches apprehension, but they simply and absolutely make him a Citizen of the Church, and admit him to Ordinances, according to the command of Christ, both in private and publick Church offences, <hi>(If thy brother who offended, repent, forgive him)</hi> but his loosing from the sin or guilt in heaven, is ever conditional, and never abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be pronounced by the Pastor, the mouth of the Church, who cannot certainly know the condition.</p>
               <p>Hence 1. the scandal is loosed in earth and heaven; the Church impartially following the rule of Christ sometime when the sin remains and is bound in heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church may say the man is absolutely freed from the scandal, so as the Church sins not in receiving him in, if they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58837:79"/>
follow the rule; but he sins, and the scandal is bound in coming in, if he repent not: and also as to the guilt, he is freed from the sin only conditionally, for the condition of removal of the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal is seen, and visible: but the condition of the loosing from sin is invisible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometime the man is both loosed from the scandal, and from the sin, and every way loosed in heaven and earth, when he both really and visibly repents.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Church should go as near in readmitting a fallen sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and loosing him on earth, as they can discern the Lords loosing in heaven: the Corinthians seem to exceed in this. 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 7. So that contrariwise, ye ought rather to forgive him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. There is more of real Saintship required, to receive in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain one who hath been once a member and hath fallen, and was cast out, then to admit a member newly come from Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The larger the means of salvation have been, the greater guiltiness, as the scandal of a Christian is greater then the sin and scandal of a <hi>Sodomite, Mat. 10. 15. Mat. 11. 22. Mat.</hi> 12 41, 42. And therefore the repentance of the one must be more signal and larger then the repentance of the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is not such a measure of marriage-love required of a Virgin before she be married, as after she hath been married, and born children to the husband; nor can any say there is so much knowledge required in a new Intrant that knows not the first elements of Philosophy, as in one who hath studied seven years.</p>
               <p>Hence 6. it is utterly false, that as visible Saintship and real Repentance, as far as can be, is required of one excommunicate, before he can be received in again; so real visible Saintship, as far as can be seen, must be required in members before they be first admitted. But I desire our Brethren, if they judge the first receiving into the Church a loosing from sin and scandal, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admission is, they will teach it me.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. If Baptism be the Seal</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>R.) of our entry in</hi>

                  <hi>the Church, then is not this covenant the formal cause of Church-membership.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>If Baptism seal our membership, then it is after member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and so not the formal cause of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:58837:80"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is in my argument no word that baptism is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cause of our membership. Baptism is a seal of our solemn installing in the Church; it's a seal <hi>quoadnos,</hi> as state and fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in houses or lands is.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Though children do not covenant personally, yet they are included virtually in their parents,</hi> Deut. 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If Mr. <hi>H.</hi> mean Children not born, as the place <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. doth evince, what is that to the purpose? we have no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion with any, whether unborn children have right to mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, or to baptism, <hi>non entis nulla sunt accidentia;</hi> if he mean <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>H.</hi> makes Infants to be no actual co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters.</note> born infants are but virtual, or potential covenanters, as the seed is a tree <hi>in potentia,</hi> and no tree <hi>actu,</hi> so must Infants be no actual covenanters, but <hi>in potentia</hi> only. Anabaptists shall thank Mr. <hi>H.</hi> for this, for then they are not actually holy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. nor actually to be baptized, nor is God actually the God of Infants; but some act is required of them, to lay hold on the covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Kingdom of Heaven then is not due to them, nay not a halfe salvation but <hi>in potentia.</hi> But our Saviour pronounced them actually blessed, and said, <hi>of such is the kingdom of God,</hi> Mat. 18. 14 Mat. 19. 14. Mark 10. 14, 15. Yea, as Christ cannot bless unborn Infants, not can he say, <hi>of such is the kingdom of God,</hi> if they be covenanters onely <hi>in potentia,</hi> and be such only.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. This covenant is either the covenant of grace, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">M. <hi>R.</hi> Arg. 4. Par. 1. p. 78, 79</note> 
                  <hi>from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>The new covenant is either considered according to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of saving grace given in it, and so this is not the covenant. Or 2. according to the means of grace offered, and so the Church-covenant is contained within the covenant of grace, and so the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is null. A man may be in the covenant of grace, who is not a Church-member, and a man may be a Church-member, who is not within the covenant of grace, as</hi> Magus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is a doubt to me if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> understand his own distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Gods decreeing, and commanding will; for with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> he saith these are contrary wills.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My argument is this, The Church covenant is tither one and the same, or a branch of the covenant of grace, as it offers
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58837:80"/>
grace externally to all, to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Magus,</hi> or then it is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent covenant. That it is different Mr. <hi>H.</hi> denies, for then it <note place="margin">The covenant of grace so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, ties us to all Church-duties in all Congregations, without any special covenant-engagement, making me a special Church-brother to these of this Congregation only, and that by divine command of a new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, different from the Gospel-covenant.</note> should not be warranted in the Gospel, if it be a part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-covenant, how can they debar men of approved godliness, and visibly within the covenant of grace from ordinances? for such are implicitly in this covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some are (saith M. <hi>H.) in the covenant of Grace, that are not Church-members,</hi> and contrary: true; but not if they be externally and professedly as <hi>Israel</hi> was, for so to be Gods vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible people in covenant, is to be Gods visible Church, <hi>Acts 2. 39. Gen. 17. 7. Rev. 11. 15. Isa.</hi> 19. 25. now we dispute whether the Church-covenant be not a branch of the covenant of the Gospel externally proposed. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> yeelds it is, only he saith, the Church-covenant <hi>is not the covenant of grace according to the benefits of saving grace given in it:</hi> true; nor is the covenant of grace externally preached, according to which <hi>Magus</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and all such Church-members are in the covenant of grace: <hi>the covenant of grace according to the benefit of saving grace given it,</hi> to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, a new heart, and remission, &amp;c. Then this cannot hinder, but when one vowes to duties in baptism, he also vowes he shall acquit himself in all duties of warning, rebuking, gaining to Christ persons in all Congregations he shall come unto: for sure to be buried with Christ in Baptism, and to rise again to newness of life, <hi>Rom. 6. 3, 4. Col. 2. 11, 12. Gal. 3. 27. 1 Pet. 3. 21. 1 Cor.</hi> 12 13. engages a man, when converted, to strengthen his brethren, to gain others, <hi>Ps. 51. 12, 13. Luk. 22. 23. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 16. and undeniably to gain a trespassing brother, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and it must be commanded in the covenant of grace; and to exhort another while it is to day, <hi>Isa. 2. 3. Isa. 19. 23, 24, 25. Zach. 8. 21, 22. Ier.</hi> 50 4, 5. And therefore it must be will-worship and unwarrantable, to teach that a visible professor is not called, nor can lawfully gain a trespassing brother, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. until he be inchurched a member to that one Congregation, and that he is not to gain to God, and to bring into fellow Church-duties the inhabitants of another City, nor in covenant way to exhort one
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58837:81"/>
another while it is to day, nor to strengthen one another in Church duties of love, while first we be all inchurched, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular agreement, and covenant to this only Congregation. Yea, <hi>it is the nature</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>H.) of all Corporations, that one cannot be a Member, or free Citizen, without the consent of that Corporation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If entring the covenant of grace and professed faith in Baptism put me not in a state of brotherhood to any, but to <note place="margin">It is vain do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that none can be my Church-brother, whom I am to gain, but one under the same only Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal covenant with me.</note> the five thousand men, and multitudes beside of the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 4. and also <hi>Acts 5. 14. Acts</hi> 6. 7. (whose faces I never saw, nor can see, to enter this new covenant with them.) Then</p>
               <p n="1">1. All of other Congregations, as to the duty of Church-gaining, as to me are Pagans.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> must warrant from the word the distinction of Christians, and of Congregational brethren.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To Christs s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cond coming, none can be made my Church-Brother, though visibly and professedly he have with me one hope of Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God, one Father of all, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. but one of the same Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and that by this new covenant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He is never my Congregational brother, but by this new engagement. Nor</p>
               <p n="5">5. Of the same visible body with me, notwithstanding of the oneness, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5. but by this.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor can he eat of one bread with me, contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 13. and our brethrens way, being not my brother, nor a member of that houshold of Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. which to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is only a Congregational houshold.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Nor should I love him as a visible brother to me, contrary to 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14, 15. nor give him alms, as such, contrary to 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 17, 18. 3 Ioh. 5. Iam</hi> 2. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>M. H. <hi>The word</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>R.) teacheth that I should confess Christ, walk before God, &amp;c. but that I am under a divine law to swear this covenant which is different from the covenant of grace, in relation to this duty, is no divine law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>But to say there is no divine law to necessitate a man to enter into another covenant for marriage, beside the covenant of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58837:81"/>
grace is strange. So a man may take the place, and do the duties of a husband to a woman, and tell her, I have been these many years in the covenant of grace, and there is no necessity to make a mariage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenant beside. A</hi> Nimrod <hi>might say, the Gospel teacheth to pay tribute to Princes, and the Prince to exact it, and there needs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther covenant between Prince and people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The reason is altogether impertinent, for a Pastor is no <note place="margin">Way of the Churches, c. 6. sect. 6. pag. 103 sect. 7. <hi>Cotton</hi> of the Keys. c. 4. pag. 17. Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> Survey.

So when he dispenceth Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper to fourty of another Congregation, which he may lawfully do, 1 <hi>Cor. 10 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 13. As our brethren teach: the Pastor saith, <hi>I am no married Husband, nor Church-covenanting Pastor to you fourty forraign members of another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but yet I do the duty of your own sworn, and only Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Pastor to you, in dispensing to you this Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and there is no need of a marriage covenant between you and me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not this by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his own doctrine, to quit the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when it undoes his own cause, and to say the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of husband &amp; wife is blasphemous? And the like is said of that of Prince and people; for he is no Prince nor Magistrate to a people which never promised, nor covenanted with him for subjection and obedience: and a covenant is necessary in both these, but a Pastor may and doth discharge pastoral acts to these with whom he never entred a marriage-covenant, all our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren grant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> denies not, but there may be a Covenant between a fixed and a proper Pastor (to make him fixed and proper, not to make him a Pastor) and this Congregation, but that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement makes neither Husband nor Prince; but my argument is, that the covenant of grace gives marriage membership to the man who entereth it, to all Congregations on earth, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants the sound professor to gaine a trespassing brother in all Congregations, without the new fansied marriage, or covenant
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58837:82"/>
between him and them. And the covenant of grace entred did this.</p>
               <p>See and answer my Arguments, and prove not to me a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-membership with this only Congregation, by an asserted comparison, wickedly said. But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> speaks dishonourably of partaking Church-ordinances, and seals in another Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and from another Pastor, when he will have these acts to be adulterous, and traiterous, performed by no Husband, but by a strange man, and a forraign usurper and tyrant.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The Gospel requires me to seek for the help of a godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, and to marry, and not to burn, therefore there is no marriage covenant to make a husband, and such a man a Pastor to me.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. would have no schism in the body, but would have the Churches to have the same Church-care one of another, and not to be divided in one Faith, one Baptism, one Church-head, one Church-Gospel, &amp;c. which must be, if I be
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58837:84"/>
not a member of all congregations.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We are to suffer one with another, rejoyce one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but no Church-feeling is required of me, if I and those of another congregation be not of the same visible body, by vertue of the fellow-feeling between the members, the Apostle cannot speak of a natural compassion: for humanity will teach Christians to mourn at the destruction of Heathens, but they are not for that of the same body of Christ with us. But as <note place="margin">Churches and members of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociate Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble professors and members no less than single congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</note> all these prove that there is a visible body of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>y congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and so that there is a Catholick integral visible body. So we thus argue: If the Church-actings, and sufferings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing condition of those of associated Churches be visible and audible to us, no less than the Church-actings, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and rejoycing condition of the single congregation, whereof I am a member: then must the one be a visible Body and Church as well as the other.</p>
               <p>But the latter is true. The Proposition is clear: for if the properties and accidents be visible, the subject is visible; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is the formal reason why a congregation is visible, for we see not the spirits and faith in the hearts of the single con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but we see their profession in single persons, and their meetings in one place, for hearing, praying, praising and partaking of the seals. Now all these we see in three or four or six meetings, or conventions of the Churches associated, which shall but make one numerous congregation of ten thousand, as the dissenting Brethren said of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and we see them severally meet, as we see the Church of our own single congregation. As for their poverty, sickness, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the sufferings of these of the same congregation of which we are members, we see not these in Church meetings, but in single members, and these must be visible in many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, as the famine in <hi>Iudea</hi> for which <hi>Paul</hi> made a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, as well as in one. From all this its clear, that it is false which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, <hi>That all particular Churches are all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that the Church visible hath.</hi> For Apostles, godly sojourners, dissolved members, are not members of congregations, not are they congregations themselves, and yet they are members of the visible integral Catholick Church.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Mr.</hi> R. <hi>plainly affirms, That when one enters a member of such a Congregation under the Ministery of</hi> A. B. <hi>he cometh under a new relative state, by an implicit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. H. cites not my words to the full. I deny not, <note place="margin">A sort of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but the question is mis-stated.</note> but he that enters a fixt member of a congregation, <hi>comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a new relative state of a virtual covenant,</hi> and so does he that enters a member of a Christian Army, of a Family, of a Society in a Ship. But the state of the question is not touched: for the state of the question is not, Whether this <hi>new Covenant make the adjoyner a member of the visible Church, where as he was no visible member before;</hi> that is, whether a born English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by being made a citizen of <hi>London,</hi> was made an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a born Subject of <hi>England,</hi> whereas he was not a born Subject before?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether doth this New-covenant give him right and claim to Church-ordinances, and seals of the Covenant of grace, so as without it, the man hath no right at all to Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Sure, its a great sin to lay more weight on either the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or the Ark than God hath laid on them. But this Covenant so used is a fancy.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. A Church newly erected becomes a sister-Church with others, yet she needs not a new Covenant (saith Mr.</hi> R.) <hi>to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish</hi>

                  <hi>it.</hi> Ans. <hi>No certain, our Covenant once entred, all the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that depend thereupon are included in the first Covenant. A woman once being married, all duties to the husbands kindred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults from the Marriage-covenant, there is no need of a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Yea, but a Church newly erected becomes as really a part of a Synodical body that is really obliged to engage for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation, saith Mr. <hi>H. (and its both lawful and useful)</hi> as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">Survey, par. 4. cap. 1. concl. 1. pag. 1, 2.</note> becomes a member of the single congregation.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There be too many wayes to the Well here. I said, <hi>the new covenant makes the new adjoyner a member of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Yea, I adde, A member of the visible Church, whereas he was no better then a heathen before, and the Churches of <hi>New England</hi> say with me; Though Mr. <hi>H.</hi> say, That never <note place="margin">Way of the Churches, c. 1. sect. 1. pag. 2. prop. 3. For all the joyning of faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians into the fellowship, and estate of a Church, we finde not in Scripture that God hath done it any other way, than by entring all of them together (as one man) into holy covenant with himself, to take the Lord as the Head of his Church for their God, and to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to him, and one to another in his fear, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>one of them said any such thing.</hi> And sure this is one Church-covenant by which persons are made fixed members of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are by this covenant made members of the visible Church, whereas they were as pagans before. But there is another Church-covenant, by which pastor and people are married, and every member so married, as they cannot act as Church-members without their own congregation, and he cannot act as a pastor toward any, but toward his own flock. Hence a new Quaere, Whether there be two different Church-covenants?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its without question, that the family of <hi>Abraham</hi> was Gods covenanted people before circumcision was instituted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. nor is there any ground for a formal Church-covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting among themselves. And it speaks against all Scripture, to say there was a Church covenant in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 1, 5. for they were not made Church-members, for members they were before, by these covenantings with God. And this is Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his own consequence, <hi>They are members be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they chose their Pastors:</hi> Ergo. So I retort.</p>

               </p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. It is a dream to say, that when the Apostles came to plant Churches, that private men, not the Apostles converted them; Where is the man (of ours) that will affirm that all (All) are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by private Christians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The reply auswers not a whit to the Charge of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> now when the Apostles are not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apostles, by our Brethrens way, are not Pastors so much as extraordinary nor, publick men, for extraordinariness destroys not the nature of Pastors; and to our Brethren Pastor and flock are relatives; but the heathen are no fed stock, nor these who now teach the Gospel to the heathen, Apostles nor Pastors. <note place="margin">All are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, or by no pastors by our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns way.</note>

               <p n="3">3.

men, except there be a middle preacher between a preaching officer, and a private man, but this every where is taught by our brethren: now this middle uncalled man, must be the ordinary converser of all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> teacheth that the Church homogeneal, in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, now when there are no Apostles, is before Baptism and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry; now this Church is all the visible sovieties of confederate <note place="margin">Survey par. 1. c. 11. p. 55.</note> converts on earth. Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> tell us who converted them: not Pastors, for they are a framed Church in <hi>esse</hi> and <hi>operari,</hi> the Fathers and sole Creators of all Officers.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. <hi>It is unwarrantable to say Pastors now convert not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">By our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, pastors, convert not Indians.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Enough is a feast. Converters of Heathen now are either Apostles, Evangelists, or Ordinary Officers and Pastors, or of some middle new Officers: this latter cannot without Scripture be said, not the former, for they want the gift of tongues and miracles; nor are they ordinary Pastors. For Pastor and flock, saith Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Shepherd called, and Church chusing, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife are Relatives. But Indians are no chusing Church.</p>

who say, they <hi>are Apostles, but are not, and do lye, Rev.</hi> 2. and a married wife hath no marriage-power over any man but over her own husband; nor is it to be heard, which Mr. H. saith, <hi>I but she may put forth an act of love and counsell to all men.</hi> But I ask, may she put forth a certain act of matrimonial love, or perform a certain matrimonial duty to all men on earth? this would be too near unchast acting. So let Mr. H. answer, whether these three, <hi>Iames, Cephas,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> gave Apostolick publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that <hi>Paul</hi> should be received an Apostle, or only a private counsel.

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether or not a company of Believers destitute as yet of Officers, and combined together by this new Covenant, be truely called, and be in truth and indeed a Church?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>R. <hi>Hooker</hi> moves the question, whether such a <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>H.</hi> par. 1. c. 8. pag. 89.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> stands obliged either to form the question in other terms, or to shew which is the only instituted visible Church in the New Testament: for the Discipline-book of <hi>N. E.</hi> saith, that <hi>Church</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> in his Gospel hath <hi>instituted, to which he hath committed the Keyes—the Officers, Censures—is</hi> coetus fidelium, <hi>a combination of the godly—called a particular visible Church.</hi> And Mr. <hi>H.</hi> comes to

our hand, and (so with a trumpet giving an uncertain sound) he tells he speaks of the Congregational Church, as it goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Officers; which is a Man in the Moon, and proved by no Scripture at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The trumpet here gives an incertain sound.</hi> M. <hi>R. expressions are so full of variety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is a groundless charge, except you bring expressions of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ambiguities, which is not legible to the <hi>Reader:</hi> I blow the trumpet alwayes against such a visible Church as Mr. H. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth by arguments from the word, which are not answered.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. <hi>A Church ministerial is taken two wayes. 1. Generally,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pa. 8. par. 1. p. 90, 91.</note> 
                  <hi>as implying any delegate power in the exercise of any Church-acts, under Christ. So a company of visible Saints hath power of admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of members, and election of officers; and in case they prove here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, to reject the officer, and make him no officer. All these are granted by</hi> Mr. <hi>R. Ministerial power is taken strictly, as it includes an office power, so it is not ministerial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. H. dictates, but neither teaches nor brings one word of Scripture to prove a distinction that hath neither head nor feet.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The members of the distinction are coincident; for to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain officers, and excommunicate them is governing strictly and most properly; as is in the second member. And yet in the first <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>H.</hi> makes a Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Rulers, to be a Ruling Church to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain officers, and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> Keys c. 4. par. 2 as the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery cannot excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the whole church (though Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states) for they must tell the church—so neither can the church excommunicate the whole Presbytery, because they have not received from Christ an office of rule, without their officers. M. <hi>Cot.</hi> contradicts M. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </note> member, to excommunicate makes a ministerial Church largely so called.

These Epistles (I say) are written to <hi>Timothy</hi> and to <hi>Titus,</hi> not as little Monarchs, with preeminence above other Elders, but to them as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting all faithful Officers in the Colledge of that Presbytery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. who are to keep that <hi>command unviolable, to the second appearing of Christ,</hi> 1 Tim 6. 13. and they are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to Elders as having dominion over the faith of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If these Epistles were written to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> not as representing Officers, but as the Church representing the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58837:92"/>
people, yet wanting Officers, and so in a Church-capacity, then it should be <hi>Pauls</hi> minde that the people in that case destitute of Elders, should <hi>preach the word in season and out of season;</hi> as <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 1, 2. and that the people, in that capacity, should, as the <hi>approved workmen of God, divide the word of truth rightly,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 15. as well as they ordain Elders, and make and unmake Officers, by the places, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 22, 2 Tim. 2. 2. Tit.</hi> 1. 5. yea, and the Apostle should not have ordained <hi>Titus</hi> to appoint Elders in every city, for he should have appointed the Cities and Churches of onely believers to ordain their own Elders.</p>
               <p>Yea 3. the Church void of Elders, by our Brethrens way, are the onely society and visible Church on earth, who make and unmake, call and excommunicate Officers, and Officers have no hand in it, but accidentally: for, <hi>Elders are made, and if he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, rejected</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>H.) by the people, having no Elders at all. Ergo,</hi> these Epistles must be written to the believers of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi> that yet want Officers, that they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed how to <hi>behave them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Lastly, saith Mr. <hi>H. All these are granted by Mr.</hi> R.</p>
               <p>Whereas in many pages I dispute against this new visible Church, and grant no such thing, but suppose all the Officers should turn heretical in this, in that case the people <hi>in tutelâ inculpata salutis,</hi> when they turn Wolves, may withdraw. But <note place="margin">Pauls Presbyt. cap. 4. ans. to ar. 6. p. 45.</note> I say not they can authoritatively excommunicate, and make and unmake Officers; and the Officers, when the people turn Familists, may withdraw and remove the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. God hath set officers in the Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 28. <hi>Therefore the Church is before officers.</hi>

                  <hi>The setting of the candle in the candlestick presupposeth the candlestick; the Church is the candlestick,</hi> Revel. 1. 20. <hi>the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are the candles. Mr.</hi> R. <hi>answered, It was not good Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>I yet maintain this to be naughty Logick,</hi> and a naughty

Grammatication: and if this be the best Argument for this <note place="margin">The Logick of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> God set officers in the Church; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church without offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers is a ruling Church before they have Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, is naughty. So Mr. Robinson, Justif. of Separat. Pref. p. 9. Bishops and Elders are the onely ordinary Governors in the Church—But not essential to the Church. Sure they must be essential to the governed Church. Mr. Robinson ib. p. 295.</note> new conceit, it cannot stand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> (saith <hi>Moses,</hi> Gen. 2. 7.) <hi>formed man of the dust, and God breathed in his</hi> (that is) <hi>in the nostrils of the man, the breath of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> He is a living man before the soul be <hi>breathed in him.</hi> Its naughty Logick like this.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. God made man of earth,</hi> i. e. <hi>the body of man of the earth, and he breathed into the nostrils of that body so made by that mean, the breath of life: to affirm the body was made before the soul was infused; and that the body, which is the subject, to receive the soul, must be in nature before the soul, is very good Logick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Logick is yet naughty: for <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>God brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in man a living soul,</hi> therefore <hi>Adam</hi> is a living man before his soul be infused. By this Logick</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will but change my consequence, parallel and large as good as his. And have it thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God breathed in mans body as the matter, a living soul as the form.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>the body is in nature before the soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall not deny that consequence: but 1. The antecedent is not the Grammatical phrase, and the figurative speech of <hi>Moses,</hi> as my antecedent is. God breathed a living soul in the nostrils of man: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was man before God breathed in him a living soul. So I desire Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to answer the like quirk of Grammar, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God createth the spirit in the midst of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was a man before God created a spirit in the midst of him.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God gives breath and spirit to the people, and to those that walk on the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Argument,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the people are a living people, moving and walking upon
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58837:93"/>
the earth, before God gave them breath and spirit.</hi> What more absurd?</p>
               <p>So Mr. <hi>H. God hath set officers in the Church:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the Church is before the officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So God hath set the members, pastor and people, eye, ear, hands and feet, &amp;c. every one of them in the body, as pleaseth him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 18. this is as much as, <hi>God hath placed single be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> also (for believers are not members visible without Gods setting) <hi>not yet clothed with adjuncts (as they call them) of officers in the Church,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>or in the body visible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore by the consequence and grammatication every way alike,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The body or Church visible of combined believers, shall be before the body or Church visible of combined believers.</hi> But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is absurd. What then hath Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gained by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Of necessity then, when the Apostle saith, <hi>God hath placed in the Church Apostles, Prophets;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word <hi>Church,</hi> must be the visible Catholick organick Church, which is made organick by such organs as Apostles, Prophets, so seated.</p>
               <p>Like this, <hi>God hath created a soul in man,</hi> and yet he is a man by the soul that is created in him, and is not a man before it be created in him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Beside there's advantage to the cause, that not onely the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 92.</note> 
                  <hi>subject in which these officers are, is</hi> totum essentiale, <hi>but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of her choise which is causal of the officers, they are there, saith Mr.</hi> H. <hi>and therefore in reason must be before them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Its a great disadvantage, and an untruth, to call the <note place="margin">By Mr. H. the adjuncts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the sons the fathers.</note> Elders and Rulers of a politick ruling visible Church, which is an organical body, the adjuncts thereof: for the members and organs of an organical body, are the integral parts, and so in a physical consideration, the essential parts of the whole integral are not adjuncts by any Logick I know: and if you take away the integral parts wholly, you destroy the integral whole; but if you remove the adjuncts or accidents, you destroy not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What Logick is this, to make the Fathers, Apostles and Pastors who beget, and the Ministers by whom we believe, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58837:93"/>
visibly believe, <hi>Rom. 10. 14, 15. Eph. 4. 11, 12. 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 5. the separable adjuncts of begotten children? This is strange Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, Whiteness begot Snow! And this is as strange, that this Church of believers is the cause, and the officers the effect; that is, the adjunct is the cause, and the children, the Church of believers, or the subject is the effect, and the effect begets the cause, and is before the cause, and the fruit hath being before the tree, and the children before the father: for if we speak of a constant Rule, as now we must do, when Apostles are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if the Church of believers be a visible Church, having the Keyes and using them, even to admit officers, and to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them, they</p>

               <p n="3">3. Who begot them by the preaching of the Word? and if they were heathens, and are now converted, who either did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them or baptize them? for there are no officers as yet: Did every one baptize another? or did unbaptized members baptize their own Ministers who are yet unbaptized? and this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument must be strongly retorted: The officers cannot be the effect of this Church, for they are the onely causes of the very materials of this Church; for officers must convert, gather a flock to God, and baptize them, if it be true, that faith comes (in the Lords ordinary and instituted way) by hearing of sent Pastors, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14.</p>

                  <hi>simply without candles and lamps; the Church Ministerial is the candlesticks, and the Ministers the shining torches and candles. Its cross to all mens apprehensions, saith Mr.</hi> H. <hi>that the candlestick should be no longer a candlestick than the candle is in it: They are bought and sold for candlesticks.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Its indeed unknown Logick, that officers the fathers should be adjuncts, and the Church of believers begotten by

I see no inconvenience, why a Corporation may not out, and lay aside all their Aldermen and Major, if they turn Lions and Leopards, and so destroy the present individual Government, while they labour their own safety, and the safety of their priviledges. But the case is not alike, except Mr. <hi>H.</hi> prove, That the Church of believers hath the same positive power of Government intrinsecal without their officers, and onely fathers who begat them to Christ, to use the Keyes, and formally to excommunicate them, as a free City hath over their Magistrates.</p>

But Mr. H. answers, Yet they are called tents fit to receive shepherds, and are the same they were before the shepherds were chosen, and remain the same: To remove the candlestick is to remove the Ministery, because Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery and Ministers have their dependence on the Church; destroy the man the whole, you destroy the parts; but it holds not contrariwise: its true in a Ministerial Church,</hi> i. e. <hi>an</hi> organicum totum, <hi>when you take away any part, you lame the integrity of it; but you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destroy

But M. H. makes it clear, as he sayes, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church is before the Officers, and may be, and is without them, therefore officers can be no essential parts of the Church of the New Testament. And so this Church void of Officers, must be to our brethren, the first and principal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all Government, Rule, Keyes, Officers, and what not?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. being to evert Presbyterial Government, he begins <note place="margin">Pag. 94, 95.</note> at the Pillars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:58837:97"/>
                  <hi>The Presbyterian Church consists of three Pillars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There must be several congregations, made entire of such members to make up an integral body of Rulers and Ruled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a crack in this Pillar, it is not essential to a Presbyterian Church that all the congregation be entire, <hi>and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The two first Pillars of a Presbyterial Church, to wit, 1. framed Churches. 2. Formal commissioners sent to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, are to us no pillars, to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> they are.</note> 
                  <hi>Churches, having their own Officers distinct from the offices of others,</hi> we cannot determine that <hi>Matthias</hi> had a determinate flock, to which onely he was a fixed Pastor, and <hi>Peter</hi> another, and <hi>Iohn</hi> a third; we rather judge the whole twelve fed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, sometimes in one congregation, in this house, dayly, and sometimes in another; but all the huge thousands could not feed in one house, otherwise many congregations framed and fixed, or not framed and fixed, are all under one Presbytery, as the Learned and Reverend Assembly at <hi>Westminster</hi> teacheth. If the Pillars be dreams, the house that M. <hi>H.</hi> storms is also a dream.</p>
               <p>To the second Pillar we shall speak hereafter, if the <hi>Lord will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>These Churches send Rulers, by way of delegation, to whom they submit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This also is a faulty Pillar.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They so send as they may be present to hear, dispute, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to what is amiss, nor are the Pastors delegates.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They submit to them not simply.</p>
               <p>But first, reserving judgement of discretion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and with liberty to appeal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The whole Elders of six congregations in a City may all meet in one common Presbytery, without any delegation; and that is a Presbyterial Church, as is the meeting of a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Eldership.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> H. <hi>To their power of Iurisdiction the Churches must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit—but it ariseth from a power of order or office to preach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Well said, then cannot they exercise the highest acts of jurisdiction, to excommunicate all the Elders, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, <hi>page</hi> 92. they do, for the people hath no power of order or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial power to preach the Gospel, and administer the Seals, <hi>page</hi> 92. and yet Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, they may communicate all their officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:58837:97"/>
Mr. <hi>H. There is a Iurisdiction official that issues onely from the office, this the officers have.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Lenitive is a Corrosive. Here is the matter, the people have jurisdiction, and do excommunicate, but not by an official jurisdiction, but by another power: So a Midwife bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth in the Roman Church, but not by a power of Order, as a Priest, but its valid. An Usurper judgeth, but not by a power derived from the Royall Power of the Soveraigne Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By what Scripture can any power of the Keyes given by Christ onely to the Church of believers, be given to separable adjuncts of the Church?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. None is a steward, unless appointed over the Family by Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 27, 28. <hi>Hence Papists and Prelats erre, officers and offices are coronation-mercies, and proceed from Christs ascension,</hi> Eph. 4. 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They are means of worship instituted by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He onely can blesse them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. None are stewards to put in and put out stewards and excommunicate them, but such as are appointed of God: But believers without officers are no stewards at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Censuring and excommunicating is an authoritative way of edifying, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 8. 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5. 1 Thess.</hi> 3. 14. shew in <note place="margin">People that are no stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards have no authority to censure, or thereby to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</note> all the Word, where believers and private Christians are to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and build up in the faith their Pastors, and that in an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative way. The people so must</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be <hi>coronation-mercies, and gifts given of Christ,</hi> ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to heaven for the <hi>perfecting of</hi> the Pastors, and <hi>the work of the Ministery, to gather in Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors</hi> to <hi>Christ.</hi> Whereas the Text saith the contrary, That Pastors were given to gather in the people, and the people, or unofficed Brethren, were not given to gather in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Excommunication be a Worship administred by the Brethren upon Pastors; then must a promise be made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officed Brethren, who excommunicate, <hi>Behold, I send you,</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 16. This we reade not.</p>

                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:58837:98"/>
Mr. <hi>H. He that is called and appointed an officer according to God and the Rules of the Gospel, as he needs no other power but that of his office, to authorize him to execute it; So there is no power by rule or right that can hinder him in the due execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a ground against both Episcopacy and Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Presbyters may preach in other congregations than their own, if they be officers over it, as Bishops may in many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. <note place="margin">How pastors are regulated in the exercise of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Pastor, if called of God, may do his office, without horrowing a power from the Pastor of pastors to do it; but he must preach <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> in an orderly way, upon a day, and time of the day appointed by the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He hath an office to preach and administer the seales any where, yet must he have the call by desire, consent, or some other way, before he can do it in another congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor can he rule or administer censures as his alone, <hi>extra collegium,</hi> without the authoritative concurrence of the Elders, and tacit consent of the people, though he be an appointed officer of Christ. So this ground is weak. Other weak grounds we shall consider after.</p>

                     </gap>. par. 1. p. 99.</note> 
                  <hi>power than they had before they were combined, they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise no more Iurisdiction than before; and therefore have no Presbyterian power, are no Presbyterian Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But they have no more power after their combination, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Assumption, where the doubt onely lies, is made out thus: They who have no more office and officers than they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they have no more jurisdiction; as in the first ground, power of jurisdiction flows from power of office. But they have no more officers, for each send their own; therefore they have no more power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> says, The doubt is onely in the assumption, and <note place="margin">The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches united have more power exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively after they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but not intensively, &amp; in nature more</note> takes the proposition for undeniable: The major is false; for by this argument, two single congregations each a hundred in number, lying so near as they may most conveniently meet, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lawfully unite in one Church, for the better attaining the end of Christ, which is edification: for say they be the same number of offices and officers, then they can exercise no more power of jurisdiction, after the combination over two hundred, than each of them did over one hundred. But the Conclusion is absurd. Yea, this Argument destroys the Synod, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. for suppose the number of offices and officers to be equal in the Synod, after the Synodical combination, and in the Church of either <hi>Antioch</hi> onely, or <hi>Ierusalem</hi> onely, before the combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a facile and ordinary supposition; then they can exercise no more Synodical power (it matters not what be the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58837:99"/>
kinde, whether of power of jurisdiction, or not) after the combination of these Churches than before; and so the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Synod should be no more than the judgement of a Congregation. But the consequence is absurd. Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> see to it, and deal with Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> to answer him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the Proposition. If the Churches combined have no more power extensively, feeding a larger number after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination than before, <hi>then they can exercise no more jurisdiction,</hi> no more, <hi>by way of extension;</hi> it is false: for their united power is extended to a larger number now, then the divided power was before to each single flock. If the Churches combined have more power <hi>intensively,</hi> of the same species and nature after the combination than before, then they can exercise no more jurisdiction <hi>intensively</hi> than before. Its true, it is the same power of Christ, the same valid Excommunication, the same binding and loosing as to the specifick nature of binding and loosing, that is exercised by five Churches in a City, and exercised by ten Churches about. We multiply not species, to make all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations to differ in nature and specie, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Logick; whereas they have the same essentials, Christ the Head, the same Ordinances, Seals, the same Faith; but then it shall never follow, <hi>Therefore they have no Presbyterian power over</hi> many Churches, and therefore they <hi>are not distinct Presbyterian Churches</hi> in local distinction; <hi>magis &amp; minus non variant speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> Nor are Presbyterian, and Provincial and National Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches different in nature, but onely in extent of Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its a wide mistake, That a Presbyterian Church hath its formal essence from a voluntary actual combination in such <note place="margin">Actual volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Church.</note> bounds, or such a circuit more or less: that is not a Pillar of Presbyterian Churches; for their near association, by dwelling where they may edifie or scandalize one another, gives them right to be an associated Church, not simply habitation, but the habitation of such and such professors in covenant with God, baptized, and giving themselves up in profession to Christ as disciples, before there be a formal consent, they are obliged to associate: yea, nor doth that voluntary combination make a Presbyterial Church.</p>

Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Arg. 2. <hi>If the Presbyterian Ministers have Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 99, 100.</note> 
                  <hi>then, over all the Churches of the combination, or onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver some; not over some onely, for that is against the definition of a Presbyterian Church: Therefore they must have Iurisdiction over all the Churches, ten or sixteen. If they have Iurisdiction over all these, then they are Officers, Pastors, Teachers, Ruling-Elders in office to them all; for there must be an office, and so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer before Iurisdiction; and there is no Iurisdiction exercised but by an officer. To say they are Pastors of them all, is to make a road and ready way for Pluralities, Non-Residencies.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives us, as also the Dissenting Brethren in <note place="margin">Twelve pastors feed 12 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations in Jerusalem, or in some large city in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, not being fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any of them to any one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, all the 12 are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors to all the 12 congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; yet it is not possible physically, that any one man can reside in all the 12 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; here shall be divers Non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents &amp; Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists, but not in a Prelatical sense.</note> the Assembly at <hi>Westminster</hi> did, in stead of Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of supposed incongruities, which with equal weight fall upon their own way, as upon ours. For suppose that the twelve Apostles, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. &amp; 4. &amp; 6. for divers years were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors to the many thousands that made up divers, eight or ten congregations, who daily convened from house to house, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 46. &amp; 5. 42. in <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and that all the twelve feed all the ten congregations in common, <hi>Matthias</hi> not being a fixed Pastor to this congregation more than to this; nor <hi>Peter</hi> a fixed Pastor to this flock rather than to this, which is a thing most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in great Cities, where there be 12 Flocks, and 24 Pastors, and variety of gifts by interchange, proves more edifying. All the Pastors have jurisdiction, yea and Pastoral charge over eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the twelve. Then 2. must they be <hi>Pastors and Teachers</hi> to every one of the twelve, and because all the 24 cannot every one of them be residents and dwellers in all and every congregation of the ten or twelve Churches in <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> (that is physically impossible) here shall be <hi>Pluralities and Non-residents,</hi> and that which our Brethren call <hi>Diocesan Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Presbyterial preachers be pastors and teachers, <hi>habitu,</hi> and <hi>actu primo,</hi> and in common to all the Churches of the combination, in acts of common concernment, though they be not <hi>actu secundo,</hi> actual labourers, proper and fixed pastors, residents and dwellers in every congregation (for that was physically impossible to the Elders of <hi>Ierusalem)</hi> to all and every congregation, is not absurd, but necessary; and the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58837:100"/>
charge of <hi>Pluralities, and Prelatical Non-residents,</hi> follows by no Logick, except you call the twelve Apostles, who preached fixedly at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> some years, Non-residents, because that they could not every one of them dwell in every family of so many thousands at once: In which sense, multitudes of Independent Ministers shall be Non-residents; and suppose there shall be a common Treasury to pay the labourers their wages, and that collected out of the goods of all the thousands so combined, the Independent Ministers upon the same account must be Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists, and receive wages from many, to whom they neither are nor can be fixed, and proper and peculiarly <hi>feeding Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Wisdome may forbid the Brethren to use this Argument, <hi>There is no jurisdiction exercised, but by an officer:</hi> for the whole people, men and women, the onely Church instituted in the New Testament, or their unofficed Male Church, the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity exercise the highest Jurisdiction, and excommunicate all their officers, and yet they are not officers by their own principles.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Mr.</hi> R. <hi>denies the Assumption, That they bear the relation of proper Pastors to every one of these Congregations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Proper Pastors they must be to all. If the relation of Eldership to a Classical Church be founded upon the same office that a Pastor hath to his particular congregation, then the Elders bear that same relation of Watchmen to a Classical Church, which a Pastor doth to a particular flock: for where there is the same office of a Pastor, there is the same relation of Watchman and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, the one issuing from the other. But the first is said by Mr.</hi> R. Lib 2. 335. <hi>also they put forth authoritative acts, which issue onely from proper Pastors, they are proper Pastors to those upon whom they can exercise such acts, else they had no warrant to put them forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I yet in this sense deny the assumption, that they are proper Pastors, that is, actual imployers of their labours of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, both by fixed teaching and governing, to all the flocks of the classical Church; for that is unpossible, except they could be in many Congregations at once so feeding. But I deny not, but constantly teach, that the Presbyterian Pastors are properly,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58837:100"/>
that is, <hi>formally, essentially, habitu, actu primo,</hi> Pastors in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The Elders of the Presbytery are fixed and proper Pastors, only to one flock and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to all the rest of tho associate Churches.</note> to all the flocks, not of the classical Church only, but of all the visible Churches on earth. As a Physician by covenant actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally imployed to attend all the sick of such a City, suppose <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> is their proper Physician, yet so as he is essentially a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician to all in <hi>England,</hi> who shall by providence employ him. An exquisite Gardener by paction, is a proper Gardener to such a man who conduces or hires him a certain time, to labour such a plot of ground, yet so as essentially and <hi>actu primo,</hi> he is a Gardener to all the Country round about who shall employ him. So is one a proper School-master to teach Grammar and Rhetorick to the children of such a City, yet so as he is a School-master to all the children of the country who shall employ him. Christ sends his Pastor <hi>Archippus</hi> intentionally to feed all his flocks in all fields, and he is essentially a Pastor to them all; but for the more convenient attaining of Christs end, he fixes him by the choice of the people to the Church of <hi>Coloss,</hi> not as a Husband to a Wife.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> With his little finger aims not to twitch the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Where there is the same office of Pastor, there is the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Watchman and Pastor.</hi> It is false, a Physician, a Pastor providentially fixed to cure and feed this City by special cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, hath a more near relation to cure and feed this City; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a twofold relation, both by the calling in general of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician and Pastor, and by a special solemn oath, and hand-writ to this City; and both the Physician is the same publick Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and the Pastor the same publick Watchman <hi>officio,</hi> by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice essentially, <hi>habitu, actu primo,</hi> to all the sick bodies and sick souls in the country.

               <p n="3">3. It destroys Synods and all communion of Churches; for Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> yeildeth, as <hi>truth of the Gospel taught by a Minister of the Gospel, bindeth to faith and obedience, not only because it is Gospel, but because also it is taught by a Minister, for his calling sake, seeing Christ hath said, whoso receiveth you, receiveth me; they bind not only materially, but formally, for the Synods sake.</hi> I see not how this can be answered, though indeed the Discipline of <hi>N. E.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> say the contrary both of this and their own grounds; for Elders in Synods put forth authoritative and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal acts, to these Churches of which these Elders are not proper and fixed Pastors; but Pastors they are to these Churches, as to all the Churches of the combination, else they cannot war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably put forth acts pastoral, for their feeding and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to edification, except it be said, a Synod is no ordinance of Christ; which all the Brethren and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> himself deny. All acknowledge a Synod to be an ordinance of Christ. But the truth is, they but mock the Reader in so saying, for they give no more to it, but an act of charity, to counsel, as one brother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels another: <hi>Intuitu charitatis,</hi> saith the Discipline of New <hi>England.</hi> And so Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, what 1. availes it more to say a Synod is an Ordinance of God, because they can give a charitative counsel, then to say one single Believer is an Ordinance of God, or a Woman who can counsel a man? The Synod then is no positive Ordinance of divine institution; for upon the same ground, if a Synod be an Ordinance of God, because they may counsel the Churches, we may appoint a new Ordinance of a Synod. For, first, one refuting. Another for rebuking. A third for confirming. And a fourth for comforting.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:58837:101"/>
2. It is but a mocking of the world, to say the association of Churches is an ordinance of God, for they can give counsel to the Churches of the bounds (what may be replied, had I time, is soon washed away.)</p>
               <p>But first, so can twenty other Churches without the bounds <note place="margin">Private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men giving counsel to men may as well be called an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Christ as a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.</note> of these Churches; so can many eminent Christians in another Congregation, not in office, give a counsel by way of charity to a Synod convened synodically, shal they for that be a Synod of a Synod? and shall they be an Ordinance of Christ distinct from a Congregational Church for that?</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>Abigail</hi> a woman, a captive maid, gave, the one a divine counsel to <hi>David,</hi> and the other to <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian.</hi> Shall women therefore be made new ordinances of God? and if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one counsel nor the other have any weight from the givers of the counsel, but only from the word; it is in vain to name the one an ordinance of God, more then the other: as for reverence to the persons, a Synod of Elders, more then one single mans counsel, adds not the eighth part of a feather as touching authoritative weight to the Counsel, if the Synods counsel amount to nothing more in point of a divine ordinance; then Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, any Counsel <hi>may lay a burthen upon any</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Survey. par. 4. c. 1. p. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>mans conscience;</hi> so any Christian that shall publish and preach that 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 18. flee fornication</hi>—may lay a burthen upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry soul, not from the authority of him that speaks, but because it is <hi>Scripture that is spoken;</hi> and this is all the authority of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods. Would the Lord appoint Men, Elders, and Brethren, and Churches to come many hundred miles to heal rent and spoyled Churches, and the result of all is a meer counsel which a woman at home may give? for the Scripture by the law of Nature warrants women to give this as well as men, 2 <hi>Sam. 20. 16, 17—21, 22. 1 Sam. 25. 25, 26, 27.—32, 33, 34. 2 King.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 13. And God reveals to women, servants, poor ones, as much of this as to others of higher place.</p>
               <p>Nor shall it help the matter, to say, it is safer to seek counsel from men then from women, from many then from one; <hi>for in the multitude of counsellers there is safety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true.</p>
               <p>But 1. This is no ground to seek to a Synod of Fathers and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58837:102"/>
Elders of the bounds of these, who are no Pastors nor Elders to us, and can put forth upon us no Synodical, no Pastoral acts; upon this ground, we should select Counsellors out of one or many Churches, that have no relation to us; and so this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for such a Synod, but only for many gracious Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, private or publick, nothing at all for a Synod of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When all is done, their Counsel is but a Counsel, that hath as much weight, as it hath conformity with the rule of the Word, and so hath the counsel of a Woman, or a servant. And it is considerable that the book of Discipline of New <hi>England</hi> hath no Chapter nor Discourse of Synods, which shews they little value them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. These authoritative actt which are put forth in other</hi>

                  <hi>Churches issue from him, either as a Pastor, or as no Pastor; If as no Pastor, then acts of Iurisdiction may flow from him that is no Ruler.</hi> Mr. R. <hi>will gain-say this, if they proceed from him as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, then either as Pastor of his own Church, which cannot be; or of another Church, and then one man may have two Pastoral offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And all these Churches must be either his flock, or not: his flock they must be, if he be Shepherd to them, for that the nature of relatives requires, the combined Churches are many distinct flocks, and he cannot be a Pastor of many flocks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is the former argument with a new dress, <hi>quod fui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58837:102"/>
were four flocks, because he preacheth pastorally to some, and administers the Lords Supper to others, as to strangers.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> taketh for granted, that the place <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. is a Rule for removing onely private scandals: 2. And that by the word <hi>(Church) Matth.</hi> 18. is meant onely his own Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent congregation.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. He supposes it must be onely one single man that tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth against a brother, but if ten, or many sister-Churches transgress against sister-Churches.

The obstinacy is not proper to that congregation, if publick, the offence of it stumbles the neighbouring Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But</p>

                  </gap>, in cities, where many thousands were baptized, purging their own body, and its not to be supposed that actual government for ordinary scandals should be by the personal presence of the Elders of remote Presbyteries and Provinces, far less of the Elders of the whole Catholick visible Church. For Nature, Reason, and the practise of the Apostles would say, Except the scandal be more than ordinary wide and spreading, only the Churches nearest to be edified or stumbled, should have hand in healing and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring; though the whole Catholick and visible Church have also here some influence, to wit, tacit and virtual in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rule of Discipline which regulates the whole Catholick body, as is said hereafter.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The second difference assigned by Mr.</hi> R. <hi>is, that the Presbytery takes care rather of the regulating of the acts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning in all these Churches, than the governed Churches.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> should have added my words to the full, that the Reader might have seen my minde. What I speak compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would not hold it out to the Reader, as if I meant it absolutely. For</p>

Ans. <hi>But I assume (saith Mr.</hi> H.) <hi>the Elders there are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Pastors of their own particular congregations; therefore they must (if at all) be so here.

They are Elders to the Churches in the <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Judicature; but <hi>separatim</hi> out of that (say I, pag. 326.) <hi>they do not watch in such a way for all the souls of the Presbyterian several congregations, as they do for the single congregations of which they are fixed Pastors.</hi> And this is enough to make different relations pastoral (which is my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) between the Elders, in order to their own congregations, and to the associated congregations, as the Elders of <hi>Antioch</hi> are Elders judging in the Synod, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. one way to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and other to <hi>Antioch,</hi> where they have their proper fixed charge to teach and rule: and I shall not stand to yield that they act as Elders, and by the same office of Eldership in the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial,</hi> and in the congregational Judicature, but an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal difference there is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its most unfound that Mr <hi>H.</hi> saith, That a Pastor cannot <note place="margin">A pastor is not a pastor onely to the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Mr. H. saith, but also to them all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, and to this or that single person of the flock.</note> teach, admonish, excommunicate, but in a congregational meeting. This is first to make him a congregational <hi>Pope</hi> or Prophet, as the <hi>Papists</hi> do the Pope, onely <hi>in Cathedra,</hi> in the pulpit, or before the congregation. 2. All the dayes of the week, except in the actual congregational Assembly, he is a private man by this reason. But the Word shall warrant the pastor as a pastor to visit, to warn from house to house, <hi>Col. 1. 28.

               <p n="3">3. By this reason a pastor is so a pastor, a husband, a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the flock actually assembled onely, but not a pastor to give an account of this or that man or womans soul to God in the flock; then if this or that man perish through the fault of the Elder, who gave not warning, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath taught the Minister a good excuse: <hi>I cannot be charged as an unfaithful

watchman with the blood of this single man who is lost, Mr. H. saith, I am onely a Pastor in relation to the flock assembled Church-ways, but I am not a Pastor nor Watchman to one single man.</hi> But ah! this distinction shall not save the man from the charge of blood! <hi>Ezek. 3. 18, 19, 20, 21. &amp; 33. 13, 14, 15. &amp; 34. 4, 5.

See Bilson, perpetual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, c. 5. c. 12.</note> forth authoritative pastoral acts, by the grant of Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> upon the several Churches distributively taken, yet are they not the proper pastors of these Churches, and Commissioners of Parliament upon persons of a single city, but as they have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not against the Laws of that city, but against the general Laws of the whole Nation and Parliament: But it follows not, that these Commissioners are Aldermen, or fixed Judges of that city; and so Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his consequence is weak.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. These Presbyterial Elders must exercise jurisdiction over congregational Elders, which is conceived by Mr.</hi> R. <hi>to be absurd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Pastors, with majority of official Jurisdiction over pastors of another lower species, as Bishops above pastors, I still look upon as absurd. But that Elders in a Synod exercise Jurisdiction over Elders of a congregation that are the same in nature and degree with them, is no more absurd, than for an Eldership of a congregation to exercise Jurisdiction over some two or three scandalous Elders of their own number, which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will not call Episcopacy.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Mr.</hi> R. <hi>addes, Elders of an Independent congregation, are not Elders of their single congregations, being separated from their Courts. It seems a paradox, for if separated from their Court, their office remain, then jurisdiction must remain.</hi>

                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:58837:105"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Its not a seeming, but a real paradox, my words are <note place="margin">Pastors can exercise no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being separated from the court, but pastoral acts of teaching they may in private exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, and that from house to house. Pag. 104, 105.</note> halfed. I said, They are not Elders separated from their court <hi>in the notion</hi> (these are my words omitted by Mr. <hi>H.) of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Church-jurisdiction;</hi> for they can exercise no juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, neither excommunicate, nor relax from excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being not in Court, except they be prelates.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> addes a real absurd paradox, that <hi>they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise pastoral acts of teaching, but in the Church-assembly;</hi> which refuted before.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> 5 Differ. <hi>Congregational Elders have power of order, and power of jurisdiction without the Court, but they have not power of jurisdiction but in the Court. Elders have a power of jurisdiction as watchmen, but a power of Church-jurisdiction they have not, but in the Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I never heard that their entring into the assembly should <note place="margin">Sitting in Court gives no new power of office to elders, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put it forth in formal jurisdiction but in the Court.</note> adde a new power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor did Mr. <hi>R.</hi> say, their entring and sitting in the Court addeth a new official power; they had the official power <hi>actu primo</hi> before, but they can no more put it forth in acts, being separated from the Court, than a pastor might excommunicate his alone in his private chamber; which were tyrannical and null.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The example of the great Sanhedrim toucheth not the cause, or then destroyeth it: Nor doth the example of Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Parliament; for they get a new office to sit in Parliament, but an Elder of a congregation by sitting in the Presbytery gets no new office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

The getting of a new office is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up nor down; the Commissioners of Parliament rule in that Court over all the Shires in the Land, and by that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission every Commissioner becomes not a Major of every City, or a Judge in every Shire. And by Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> grant, the Elders in a Synod exercise pastoral acts, and lay on bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,

                  <hi>Acts</hi> 15. upon the Churches, and get no new office thereby: But they do not for that become proper Elders and pastors over every single congregation in the bounds of the Synod.</p>
               <p>Yet to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> this is a principle, That if the Presbyterian Elders put forth pastoral acts upon all the congregations, then must they be pastors to all the <hi>particular flocks, for shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and flick are relatives, Arg.</hi> 2. 101. But the Conclusion is absurd. This is no less against Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> than against Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and against himself, who admits strangers to the Lords Supper, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. It is obvious to every man, that the Elder of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation hath the nature of an Elder in general, and so can and doth put forth general actions, that are common to other Elder. Where the act is, the object must be, in its proportion; and all this he doth without the Classis in his particular station: for the species determines the act of the genus, as</hi> Socrates <hi>confines the acts of the humans Nature to himself: and its known, the Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis meddles with the particular offences, that are as special as any Elder in an Island, doth meddle within his owne place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Its obvious to all men, That Mr. <hi>H.</hi> speaks new Logick, obvious to the understanding of no man, I doubt, to his own. For the Elders of a congregation, because indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and subordinate and countable to none on earth, but to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> (as <hi>Papists</hi> say of their wooden Head the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ) determine within themselves. Suppose they he but some twelve of the twelve thousands at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> if these be once a formal Covenant-wise married Church of people and officers, they do determine of the Doctrine of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, of the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> Acts 15. Rev. 2. 14. (for <hi>Pergamos</hi> is to them an independent flock) and of Arrianism, and of Doctrines and Scandals that concern many hundred Churches about; and whether they determine right or wrong, its against the liberty and power Christ hath given to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Body, of ten and twelve to tell the Churches: Oh! they must not part with their Soveraignty so; or if they consult, its but of courtesie: for, single <hi>Pergamus</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58837:106"/>
(say our Brethren) for not using their Church-power in a Doctrine that concerned thousands as well as them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What a mystery of Logick this may be, who is so happy <note place="margin">How wide Mr. H. is in his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Elders determine of special actions &amp; persons, for species deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the act of the genus.</note> as to divine? <hi>Every particular Elder can, and doth put forth general actions that are common to other Elders:</hi> Why? <hi>The species determines the act of the genus.</hi> The Reason contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the Conclusion which it is brought to prove: For if <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> confines the acts of Humane Nature to himself, they leave off now to be general actions, and by being contracted to the species (his species is <hi>Socrates</hi> a single person) they are now most special actions.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> takes our meaning to be, That the members of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and of the Presbytery, determine of the Ideal, general, abstracted Nature of Men, of Doctrines, of Actions <hi>in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni,</hi> that needs not (saith he) <hi>for the congregational Elders put forth general actions, but confined and contracted to Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi> So doth the Classis, the National, yea the Oecumenick and General Assembly put forth acts, determinations, both of general Doctrines, and condemn them also, as confined and contracted to <hi>Socrates,</hi> to <hi>Balaam,</hi> to <hi>Iezabel,</hi> to the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> and to the single men of that impure Sect. And Acts 15. 24. the Synod condemns some certain particular, individual men, <gap reason="foreign">

And this comes from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other wilde notion of Logick that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> teacheth, That the Catholick visible Church is the <hi>Genus,</hi> and under it is this or that Independent Church.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Its as undeniable, there be general acts in preaching and watching, which are common to all congregations, which the Presbytery neither do, nor can dispense conscienciously, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Pastor cannot attend them: It will not suffice to say, He was Pastor to the Catholick Church before, for then before the combination he had as good power to exercise jurisdiction, as

                  <hi>An.</hi> 1. Its undeniable, That the Apostles who were Pastors of the Catholick Church, could not attend acts of Teaching and Ruling in all the single Congregations, for that is phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically impossible. But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, Its morally impossible, and unlawful for a pastor to put forth a pastoral act in any Congregation, but that to which he is married, more than a man can perform marriage-duties to any but to his own wife: <note place="margin">Neither to be an Apostle, nor to be an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Pastor, doth so give right to any to feed the flock in Macedonia, nor in Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, in this flock and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and not in this, without the intervening of some special call of God.</note> which is shameful Doctrine.</p>

Nor is this against the Church not having power over a sister-Church, because a pastor of one Congregation hath power joyntly in a Synod to exercise pastoral acts Synodical over many Churches.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1 Official power is not from election, but from the saying on of the hands of the Elders, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 1, 2. 1 Tim. 4. 14. 1 Tim. 5. 22. 2 Tim. 2 2. Tit.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is true, that a Pastor cannot require by his office those of another Congregation to hear him preach, and receive the seals from him, nor censure them, if they refuse; but it is a bad consequence of Logick, therefore he doth not exercise these pastoral acts to them by his office, as the Brethren grant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Minister by his office may require his hearers to give much alms, pray much, read and confer much, both these of his own and other flocks; yet he cannot censure them for not coming up to the highest pitch of these affirmative duties, except he may rebuke them, and so may he do all who are remiss in reading edifying writings, and the Church may censure unsound books, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither Mr. <hi>R.</hi> nor any judicious man can teach that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a gift to write Books, or of eminent preaching, praying, exhorting, <hi>proceeds out of a power of office;</hi> it is a sanctified gift which the Church seeth and judgeth to be in any, before they call him to office; and any gift is by order of nature and time before the office, and so proceeds not from the office; and therefore it is not required that every Pastor should have a gift
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58837:109"/>
of writing books, but if the Lord have given it to any, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise it <hi>as such gifted officers</hi> as the Prophets and Apostles, as such Prophets so gifted did write Canonick Scriptures; so are Pastors, if gifted, to write and preach in their way, and both to write and preach by their office. Nor is it good Logick, that all in office should write books. because some by vertue of their office writ books; for a Minister gifted with four Talents is obliged to gain with these four Talents, and that as a Minister by vertue of his office; but it is weak Logick to infer, <hi>Ergo,</hi> all Ministers by vertue of their office are obliged to gain with four Talents, for many are obliged by vertue of their office to gain with only two to their Lord, and with only one.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was needless to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to prove writing of books doth not belong to the power of office, because a learned man out of office may do it with more authority; for Mr. <hi>R.</hi> had no such intention. For, sure if such a thing agreed to the office-power, as the office-power, then all Officers, Pastors, Elders were obliged to write books, and yet Mr. <hi>H.</hi> does not very happily prove it, because <hi>many learned men unofficed may with more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of truth write books, then officed men.</hi> It is only some offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced men he must mean, or it is not true. And then I retort it thus; many officed men may write books <hi>with more authority both of truth and of office</hi> (and two are better then one) then some unofficed men less learned. <hi>Ergo,</hi> some gifted Pastors do not as Pastors so gifted, and by vertue of their office relating both to the presbyterian Church, and their own Congregation edifie all the Churches about, by writing books. It follows not.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The classical course layeth no other burthen upon teaching Elders, by way of united jurisdictions in governing neighbour Churches that are the same body, and have the same seals common, as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> and his own Discipline agrees (as I often cite) then the way of Churches both associated by bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly association, and by Synodical and authoritative govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the same Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> teacheth, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith it is
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58837:111"/>
true, but not pertinent; and if it be true, why contend we?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is not pertinent to my purpose, is denied: Why? <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>Mr.</hi> R. <hi>his scope is to make a parity and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality between the burthen of Brotherly consociation and of Office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imposition.</hi> But that is a change of my words, and therefore must lie upon Mr. <hi>H.</hi> as his, not my words, except they be wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Nor is it my scope to make an equality <hi>in quantity,</hi> as if there were, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> most mistakingly saith, the like care, onerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and labour required in duties of Christian watchfulness in a brotherly way, as in duties of office relation: But in equality of onerousness of answering to God for duties, the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, the like sincerity, the like faith of giving an account to God, is required in the one as in the other. And he leaves, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, out the word, <hi>in way of conscience, or in fore Dei,</hi> and saith my words are imperfect; but wherein they are imperfect, he sheweth not, which maketh his own words imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: and therefore he turneth my Negative, That <hi>we are to do no more in governing sister-Churches, than in counselling and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly advising,</hi> into an Affirmative never dreamed of by me. That brotherly association tieth us to do as much, as if we had no further warrant; and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> we are to do by his way as much in brotherly duties to all Christians in other Provinces or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in <hi>France, Germany, Holland</hi> with whom we can by no physical possibility be present, <hi>and whose faces we never saw,</hi> as we are to do, by fixed office, to the single congregations to which we have a providential call, by the election and choise of the people, for whom <hi>we are to search the Scriptures, and study pleasant words, and for whose souls we are to give an account.</hi> But</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its a fruitless dispute to prove in sundry pages what Mr. <hi>R.</hi> grants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he proved from my words (from his own he may) that these are necessary consequences, he had done as became a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He cannot from what I say deny, but granteth, That bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly consociation tieth teaching Elders to do no more in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning neighbouring Churches, than brotherly advising, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58837:112"/>
admonishing, tieth us unto, <hi>in point of onerousness and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious care,</hi> and so it well follows, That there is no more laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Presbyterial Elders in governing neighbouring Churches, than is laid upon their counselling, and brotherly advising El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in point of daily occurring scandals, as is clear in the Rise of Familists, Anabaptists, Antinomians, &amp;c. and many scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous persons arising in sundry Churches lying together.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="5">5. This same Argument is thus retorted upon Mr. <hi>H.</hi> if the Apostles, as Church-members, as Believers, be obliged all the world over, to eat the Lords Supper, as <hi>Paul</hi> did at <hi>Troas,</hi> Acts 20. 11. a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Its not enough to say, That the Apostles</p>
               <p n="1">1. Were priviledged persons, and so might eat the Lords Supper all the world over, for they eat not the Lords Supper as <note place="margin">Apostles were t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Is it enough to say, They were occasionally onely to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge these Christian duties, as they should be locally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, for so are teaching Elders to perform official duties to these neighbour Churches with whom they occasionally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse

               <p>But if the foundation of governing classical Churches be the love and union of the members of one body of Christ, then there is much care, onerousness, and labour, which is required in brotherly consociation to help, as the care &amp; onerousness which is required in officership.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Ans. <hi>The proposition hath no truth, because I love all consociated in one Synod, whom I never saw, and with whom I could never meet to do good, or receive good. But if I should be bound to put forth the like onerous and laborious care for their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good, as for these, to whom by way of office I am bound in the same Congregation.

Reader judge; for the toil, care, onerousness and labour <hi>in point of conscience</hi> in the kind, and sphere; I urge in both, by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a divine command: but the like care, onerousness and labour in quantity, in the use of more means, in constant prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, personal comforting, to all the Christians on earth, as to the single congregation, I utterly deny. But can Mr. <hi>H.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but the Apostles and Brethren, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. did ow as much care, onerousness, and labour <hi>in a binding conscientious way</hi> in laying on synodical burdens, which bind not onely (saith Mr. <hi>Cotton) materially for the weight of the matter imposed by divine</hi>

               <p>And I put this quere to the Brethren, what warrant of Christ is there that a member of an Independent Church ow Church-care to watch, teach, admonish, rebuke, comfort, as <hi>Col. 3. 16.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a repeated blast of an old horn; there is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that Churches about, by their silence approve him as Pastor to one single Congregation; but that all Congregations make a special election of him to be their fixed Pastor, is no more required, then that the Churches of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> chose the Apostles and Elders, who yet <hi>Act.</hi> 15. exercise pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and official acts over them by the grant of Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> and our Brethren.</p>

These are words</hi> (saith Mr. H. <hi>to darken:) the Elders met here, have a new power distinct from the power over their several Congregations, a Commission,</hi> i. e. <hi>a new Creature.

the eighth Argument repeated from <hi>Survey, c. 8. Arg. 1. pag.</hi> 99. is answered.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The power of a Congregation, and of a Presbytery, and their acts</hi> (saith Mr. R.) <hi>differ not essentially. But Elders</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Par. 1. c. 9. pag. 122.</note> Mr. H.) <hi>do, and must preach, watch and feed, by vertue of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of their office, therefore they have acts formally d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That Elders do act as Elders, and put forth specifick acts of Elders in the Congregation, and in the Presbytery; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Their acts in one differ in nature from the acts in the other: it no more follows then this, <hi>Peter</hi> laughs to day, <hi>ergo</hi> it shall be rain to morrow. That Elders must constantly and fixedly teach and feed the Churches, whom they govern synodically, is denied <note place="margin">It is, and must be the same office of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the congregation, and in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Presbytery &amp; Synods superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.</note> by Mr. <hi>Cotton:</hi> and that they must put forth all the acts of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the office, and that constantly and fixedly to all the Churches congregational, presbyterial, synodical, to which they are referred as pastors in their several relations respectively is most false.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. If it be one and the same office of a Pastor to the Classis, and to a Congregation,</hi> as Mr. <hi>R.</hi> saith, <hi>l. 2. 329. then the office relates one and the same way to both the classical and congregational Church; then if the congregational Church be their proper flock, so must the classical Church be,</hi> quae sunt idem inter se, sunt idem uni tertio.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> the first consequence is naught; <hi>If it be the same office, then the office relates the same way to both the classical and congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church.</hi> A Pastor hath the same office to the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and to one single man, to whom he preaches; for he is not two Pastors, one to the whole, and another to the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58837:116"/>
part. An Elder is the same officer to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and to the Synod at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Act. 15. for he is not two officers in reference to these two. But it follows not that the office relates the same way to one man, and to all the Congregation; nor is he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Synod as the fixed and constant feeder of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, but he is referred to a Congregation of <hi>Antioch,</hi> as their fixed and constant Pastor; it is wild Logick, that <hi>one and the same office must relate, one and the same way, to one and to ten hund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The thumb is referred to the hand, as a member, and also to the whole body as a member; yet it is referred to the hand as a nearest and proper member; but to the whole body in a more common relation, as the toe is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the body, yet is not the toe a part of the hand as the thumb is, but both are parts of the body.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The combination of Churches gives no office, and so no</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That they were Elders before the combination, and made and ordained by the laying on of the hands of the people, which is your homogeneous Church, is an unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> A bishop is rather a Pastor to Pastors, then to the Churches: Envy cannot say this of the Elders of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The formal essence of a Pastor is not in being fixed to one Congregation, as a Husband to a Wife; so that it is adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to act as a Pastor either in a Synod, or in another Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> teacheth; for so Elders in a Synod, Apostles and Evangelists <hi>should not have the formal essence of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is false that he is not bound to preach and minister the seals to another Congregation, or members thereof, if he be called thereunto. But the Bishop is a Byshop <hi>ex officio,</hi> is bound to preach to none, but a Sermon to the Clergy once a year, and not that he may be a Bishop and never preach.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Pastor of a Congregation as a Pastor hath power of jurisdiction in <hi>Collegio,</hi> and hath no majority of jurisdiction and ordination at all, as the Bishop hath.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Pastor of a Congregation, yea, all the officers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, poor men have no jurisdiction without the people, yea, the people without them have majority of jurisdiction to make and unmake all the officers, which is the formal essence of a prelate by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his way; the prelate is the virtual Church: <hi>tell the Church,</hi> i. e. tell one single man, the Prelate, who need neither do by vote, or consent of other Elders or people, as the prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical way teacheth. Our Elders are neither over the saith of the people, nor can they dispence censures contrary to the mind of the Godly. So Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath not found the prelate with us: but the Male, Church which is above all their officers, and all others is the prelatical Church.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of a Church in an Island.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>H. If a Church in an Island may dispense all Censures,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Par. 1. c 9. sect. 3. p. 125.</note> 
                  <hi>and all Ordinances, then every congregation may: But such a Church may. For 1. it is a City and a little Kingdome of Christ. 2. The essential notes of a visible Church agree to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The consequence from a broken arm to a whole arm <note place="margin">The indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Church in an Island is its affliction, not its power.</note> is not good: or, because <hi>Iames</hi> the day before he be beheaded in strong prison, cannot discharge all Christian duties to bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to neighbour Churches, therefore he is not <hi>actu pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> a Christian. A Church in an Island is not actually associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with other Churches, and so cannot in the full extent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense all Ordinances of rebuking, comforting neighbour Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and of withdrawing communion from them, because of the want of the object, not because of defect in the subject: I might retort the argument, Therefore associated congregations cannot dispense all Ordinances of rebuking, comforting, &amp;c. But the latter is absurd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An homogeneal Church in an Island void of pastors and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58837:121"/>
men able to teach, cannot administer the Seals by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Church so divided, and not associated, is imperfect, and may remove scandals within it self; but it follows not, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> every associated Church may remove scandals within it self, and without it self also independently, and without any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to united powers of the associated congregations, it follows not, the notes of a visible Church agree to such a Church imperfectly; except it be said, That the same Church from its own intrinsecal and internal independency can dispense censures, it proves nothing; but the independency here is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal and objective, and so accidental, and the affliction, not the power of jurisdiction in this Church.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. There be all the officers in such a Church in an Island, and all the operations,</hi> operari sequitur esse—<hi>and the end is the same in both, the perfecting of the Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There be neither all the Church-operations, because <note place="margin">There are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the same perfect opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor the adequate and complete end of edification in a Church in an Island.</note> there is no dispensing of pastoral acts, censures, Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukings, Church-warnings to neighbour Churches; nor is there the same adequate end, which is the perfecting of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible body round about, as far as may be, which is the complete end of an associated Church: the perfecting of one single congregation, is a mangled and imperfect end.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> 3 Ground. <hi>Where there is an office or power appointed of God, there needs no other power, but the office to authorize the work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is nothing more false. Every pastor hath a power to preach, but there is need of a call of God to preach to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> not to <hi>Bithynia,</hi> Acts 16. There is need of a call to preach fixedly to this, not to this flock, and to ossociated Churches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How is it proved? its but begged that there is a power independent in an associated congregation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. If the power be the same, and the end the same, the power must be vain, if it be not put forth to the end: the power</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 126.</note> 
                  <hi>and institution of Christ should be wronged, if it should be hindred in attaining its end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is also a false ground. Power of admonishing, of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58837:121"/>
rebuking, of preaching, is not wronged, when the object, to wit, neighbouring Churches, are not; and the Lord cannot wrong his own institution. Its a carnal reason, to say an institution is in vain, &amp; a power, when they are not put forth in all possible acts. <hi>Steven</hi> is stoned, <hi>Iames</hi> is beheaded, <hi>Paul</hi> imprisoned, the Church scattered, that they cannot by a physical impossibility meet to remember the Lords death, preach the Gospel, dispense cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, is therefore the power given by Christ to do all these in vain?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Neighbourhood of other Churches, is but a separable adjunct, it can adde nothing to the constitution, and so to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Church; for death and dissentions may take away some Churches, and may nullifie them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is for me. Neighbour Churches are extrinsecal to <note place="margin">The non-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches addeth nothing to the power intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to rule the associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Churches if they were.</note> the nature of a Church in an Island: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church in the Island hath a ministerial and official power <hi>actu primo</hi> to rule, and joyntly edifie the neighbour Churches, if they be. If any say <hi>Evah</hi> was accidental to the nature and to the operations of <hi>Adam,</hi> will it hence follow, a power of procreating children is accidental also to <hi>Adam?</hi> no more does it follow from the not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence of neighbouring Churches, that the Church in the Island hath no power to edifie, and joyntly rule those nighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches, its poor Logick, because the object is not, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the power: Such a man is in a dark dungeon, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he hath no visive faculty; and because light and colours adde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the visive faculty, or to its nature and essence; <hi>Ergo,</hi> if light and colours be removed, the visive faculty is removed. So associated Churches are accidental to the Church in an Island; <hi>Ergo,</hi> that Church is deprived of all politick power to govern associated Churches, if they were, it follows not.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Suppose a Church be gathered in a wilderness, any lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 126.</note> 
                  <hi>Church planted beside it, cannot binder nor abridge the liberty, power, authority and operations, that all are from Christ; and when the same intrinsecal power of constitution according to God, remains unaltered, the operations remain the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. A Church or Churches added, do not hinder or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, nor bring any privative power; but the added Churches bring a perfecting, helping and cumulative power to perfect
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58837:122"/>
objectively in complete operations the former Church in the Island, in things of common concernment, in which hoth that Wilderness-Church, and the added Churches must be either edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or scandalized.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the same intrinsecal power remains unaltered, the operations may be altered to the better, and perfected. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> deviseth much Logick of his own: When the visive faculty of a man brought out of a dungeon who could not see the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, seeth now, should the operations remain the same, when he is brought forth; <hi>Ergo,</hi> as he saw not before, so he sees not now.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. If it be said the Church in an Island should submit to a combination of Churches, as well as combine as members of a congregation:</hi> Ans. 1. <hi>This is to beg the question. 2. Suppose they will not (submit) then th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> other Churches cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand that, no more than a particular congregation can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand me to be a member. 3. They ought not so to combine, as to prejudice the operations of that power they have received of Christ, and there is no warrant of Christ to hinder the operations of a Pastor or ruling Elder, more in one act of his office than another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The contrary is a begging of the question. For <note place="margin">The adding of associated Churches to a Wilderness-church doth strengthen &amp; perfect, and not nullifie the intrinsecal power of the Wilderness-church.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Church in an Island should submit to the counsel and advice of new added Churches, as to the Lords Word, by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his grant, <hi>Ergo,</hi> a new addition of Churches, as an addition, doth help, and not hinder the power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The addition of a new power of jurisdiction to the power that was in the Wilderness-church, and that in matters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon edification, as in dogmatick points, by grant of Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is no prejudging, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xcept they over-vote, in a corrupt way, the Wilderness-church. And we say, <hi>Christ</hi> never gave any power of erring, or male-administration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The adding of 50 members to a Wilderness-church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of 25, shall have the same inconvenience: for the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness-church is to submit to these added members, if added according to God (as we suppose) as to as lawful a Church-judicature as the Wilderness-church was before the addition. But <hi>what if they will not submit?</hi> Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> see to that. I should think, by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his grounds, they ought to submit, for
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58837:122"/>
they are added according to the Rule of Christ; and by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his grounds they ought not to submit, (which is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.) For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The power of the Wilderness-church, the authority within themselves, offices, officers, were before complete, were all from Christ. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the operations should be the same, and they should vote and conclude as they did before, without the addition of 50 members.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Those 50 added are separable adjuncts to the constitution and nature, and <hi>so to the operations</hi> of the Wilderness-church. For by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> the Wilderness-church being of 25 members, was complete in essence and operations, before the addition of 50 members.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The 50 members <hi>over-vote and nullifie the righteous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the poor holy Wilderness-church of 25. Ergo,</hi> here the power of a single congregation in the Island and the Wilderness must be over-turned by these three Arguments of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Let his defenders see to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A congregation may command me a visible professor so and so, dwelling near the Fountain, to confess Christ before men, and so to be a member.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The addition of any thing besides an office, addes no</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> True, but it extends the right of the Wilderness-church

to so many members added, to 50 Infants to be baptized when born, to ten Churches about, when the Lord shall adde them, not to rule over them, but to rule joyntly over the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination with them, for promoting the Gospel in all.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The ground of the combination is of no force, to wit, the preventing or curing the taint and pollu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion that a scandal will bring, by the nearness of combination. Therefore the combination is of no force, the scandal falls out in another Classis. 2. In the outside of the combination, nearer the congregation of another Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis than their own. 3. It goes far to another Province and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The righteous proceeding according to the Rule of Christ, is a cure appointed to remove it, whereever it falls out, farre or near.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> By combination, we do not mean onely a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Presbytery, but also of a Province, Nation; yea, of <note place="margin">When scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals fall out far off or near hand, how as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation of Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth them.</note> all the sound Christian Churches on earth, as the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> 1618. condemned the unsound Doctrine of the Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, by writing to all those either within or without the Church, and nearness of habitation is not the adequate ground (though a ground it is, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 1. It is reported there is among you forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp;c.)</hi> of the danger of pollution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reason, <hi>Because the scandal may fall out without the combination of the Classis,</hi> is no reason why the combination is of no force, for the combination is upon other grounds also, to wit, the establishing in the faith, the increase of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 4, 5. the gathering of the Saints, and perfecting of the body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12. edifying the body, beside the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and curing of scandals.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its to beg the question, to say, that the proceeding of the Independent congregation of <hi>Antioch</hi> (say it were so) is a cure for the scandalous Doctrine of salvation by circumcision, preached at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Acts 15. 1. troubling the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> Acts 15. 23, 24. Yea, this is for Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to say, the holy Ghost used not a sufficient cure. As for that, to say scandals should not be prevented and cured by the combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because they may fall out without the combination; his meaning is, without the combination classical, or congregation, it makes Christs remedy nonsufficient, that either there can be no
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58837:123"/>
Provincial, no National scandals, contrary to experience, or then Christ hath provided no Church-remedy to remove them, but onely the power of a single congregation, which hath no power at all, but over themselves. Hence this rotten principle, <note place="margin">The limiting of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying and Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting to one onely congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien whereof the man onely is a sworne member, is an unwarrantable and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less way.</note> That Church feeding is due to none under the New Testament, but to persons hampered into the Pinfold and Judaical Prison of one single congregation, against which 1. it licenseth the most godly Saints on earth, residing at <hi>Corinth,</hi> if they be no Church-members of that Church,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To deny Christ and Church-ordinances before men, when Christs sends out his servants, as <hi>Mat. 22 3, 4. Luke</hi> 14. 16, 17. for they may say, the Lord calls none to Church-ordinances at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but members of that Church, and such are we not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It licenseth them to despise Church-prophecying, Church-praying, Church-praising.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To disobey a Gospel-command, though they have visibly to the conscience of all tried themselves. <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> whereas Christ limits his invitation to all <hi>who can discern his body.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> must say its adultery for the members of the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> to remember the Lords death in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That Doctrine is not of God, which debars the birds, sheep, and children of God sojourning in what fields or land soever (as it were) from feeding as his Eagles upon the carrion, in every lawful Church-way; or from watching at the gates, and waiting at the posts of the doors of Wisdom, except in that onely congregation to which they are sworn by marriage oath, or from seeding at any table of the Lord, or dwelling all the dayes of their life in the New Testament-sanctuary, to <hi>behold the beauty of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 8. 35. 36.

               <argument>
                  <p>Arguments against a Presbyterial Church taken from the Name and Nature of the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. are discussed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>H. A Church in the Gospel is never used for the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mr. H. par. 1. c. 9. p. 127, 128. sec. 4. 3 ground</note> 
                  <hi>onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is never used in the N. T. for men onely who govern, secluding women and children, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> takes it; nor for the people secluding the Elders as a governing Society; but of the signification hereafter. But it cannot be a binding and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative loosing Church.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. There cannot be a definition given that will agree to a Congregational and Presbyterial Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. Ergo,</hi> There is no Presbyterial Church, it follows <note place="margin">One and the same nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to the congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Church, &amp;c. Pag. 127. 128.</note> not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As we take a Congregational Church for the Eldership ruling, it is false. One and the same nature of a Ruling Church agreeth to the Congregational, Presbyterial, Provincial El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership: and so they differ <hi>per magis &amp; minus,</hi> as is said.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. If the Congregations be</hi> species specialissimae <hi>of a true Church, then there can be no lower species resulting or arising from them, as this doth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> No Logick can say, the Church of <hi>Boston</hi> so existing <note place="margin">The congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Churches are <hi>species spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialissimae.</hi>
                  </note> hath other species of the Church of <hi>Boston</hi> under it. The hand of <hi>Socrates</hi> cannot be called <hi>species specialissima;</hi> nor is the hand, to speak Logically, a species; it is a part, and an uncomplete part of the body. If Mr. <hi>H.</hi> mean, as it seems he doth, that we make Presbyterian, Provincial Churches, lower species and kindes of Congregational Churches, the pious man refutes Presbyterian Government, which he understands not. For
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58837:125"/>
                  <hi>species specialissima praedicatur de inferioribus,</hi> according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> his, <hi>Ramus,</hi> and all Logick. And O what Monsters feed we if this be true properly (a Presbyterial Church is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church) or (a Congregation is a Presbyterial Church) for the congregation is an integral part of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Church, the Presbyterian likewise an integral part of the Provincial: but neither of them is species to other, except we say, <hi>Euphrates</hi> is the Element of Water, the Element of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. <hi>H. If every congregation hath all the integral parts of a Church, then it is an intire and complete Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Therefore it is an intire politick Church in its associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">How a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is an intire church. Tertul. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polog.</note> with other Churches, it follows not. But what then? <hi>London</hi> is an intire city having all the integral parts of a Society, Major, Sheriffs, Aldermen, Rulers and ruled, <hi>Ergo, London</hi> is no part of <hi>England,</hi> nor ruled by the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> VVhat Logick is this? But if the meaning be, that the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation associated in the midst of ten congregations, is so a city different in species and in nature from all other congregations, and so married to its own Pastors, as the husband and wife are, so that to exercise Church-acts, official acts without themselves, is adultery and unlawful; and so as this Church is no integral part of the body Catholick, its against Scripture and sound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and a begging of the question.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Every</hi> integrum <hi>is made up of his members, therefore in nature they are before, therefore Churches before Classis; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what each have they receive from them; therefore they have no office, but from them; therefore both ordination and jurisdiction come from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I <hi>desider at</hi> a Syllogism.</p>
               <p>Every whole Incorporation is made up of its members that are before the whole, and hath power, offices, ordination and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction from these members. It is denied by us, and nakedly asserted by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> For <note place="margin">Though the Churches of believers, men and women be before the Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors, Presbyteries, Synods, yet it follows not, therefore must Apostles, Pastors, Synods have their calling and authority from those Churches.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Churches are before the Apostles, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had their immediate calling and power of jurisdiction

from the Churches. It is against Scripture: as women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are by nature before officers; <hi>ergo,</hi> officers have their ordination and jurisdiction from women and children. 3 Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are before counselling and advising, yea as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> saith well before, pastorally and authoritatively determining Synods, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Synods have all their synodical power to counsel and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storally teach from the Churches, they came from, it follows not, not will our brethren yeild the consequence.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.

Sure, though they had no Officers, they are a homogeneous true visible Church, as Mr. <hi>H</hi> teacheth, <hi>page 1. c. 5. page</hi> 5. and so here, or six Churches (if we contend not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout names) under one Presbyterial government, which is the yeelding of the cause, and yet at forty miles distance, and yet by no will or appointment can they meet in one place, <hi>O but they are all one Church in our account!</hi> one congregation in Christs account. Shew us Scripture for this acception of the word <hi>Church</hi> in Old or New Testament; that they are one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle congregation, otherwise Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his account is no account: If they be one Church, because they have one and the same power, jurisdiction; officers they had before.

power and jurisdiction, covenant, seals, saith, Christ, hope of glory; so we agree. Why dispute we, if the meaning be, that all these six swarmes (for a thousand will be a number too great for one congregation, if not sufficient) are but one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual congregation, though now separated by forty miles, and meeting in six sundry places.</p>

               <p>M. <hi>H. But when the Congregations are fixed, and they esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in peace, and setled with support about them, not more then may comely and comfortably meet together, to partake of all ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, should be one Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If the six swarms, which issue out of the numerous <note place="margin">Mr. H. must be forced by his own principles to grant there is one visible Church which cannot meet conveniently <gap reason="foreign">

The Eldership or Presbytery over these six swarms, so separated by many miles in divers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, may either meet and exercise discipline, and dispence censures to these six swarms not yet setled, and provided with Officers, or they may not meet. To say they may not meet for that end, is to deny that they are under one Presbytery of the same chosen Elders, contrary to what Mr. <hi>H.</hi> said. If they may meet to dispence censures, here shal be ruling Elders, &amp; no physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal possibility of teaching the swarms so separated as fourty miles, they may haply hear of written Decrees, as <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 4. but cannot be edified by preaching.</p>

                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:58837:126"/>
2. So this Church congregational which <hi>cannot comely and comfortably meet to partake of all the ordinances,</hi> is no ordinance of Christ, and so no congregational Church. But such are these swarms that are fourty miles distant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Church is either visible, or not; neither can be said by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his principles, as elsewhere is proved.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Hence an answer may be easily accommodated to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples which Mr.</hi> R. <hi>brings for a Presbyterian Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That of the Apostles will no wise suit his end for to make up a Presbyterial Church; there must be many congregations, many Elders appropriated to these congregations, which have power over their own only, and not over others; and these must combine, and upon the combination, the Elders must assemble and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But there were no Elders at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>appropriate to their several charges and Churches, which had power only over them; and such Elders the Apostles could not be, because though they had all power in them, yet they had no power limited for that should contradict their Apostolick commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>

               <p>

I should say, any other save this worthy man, (whom I much loved and ever honoured) who would write a Book against Presbyterial government, and yet did not understand the constituent elements of a presbyterial Church, deserves to be censured; for Mr. <hi>H.</hi> yieldeth all the presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Church that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> pleads for, or that the famous Synod at <hi>Westminster</hi> desire; where there were eminently learned men, who well understood Presbyterial government, and all adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries thereof. An eminent man Mr. <hi>Ier.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58837:127"/>
only the Dissenters did hold, there was but one single congregation at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in which they are redacted to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable absurdities; and in these two Mr. <hi>H.</hi> contradicts them: let them compose their domestick contradictions.

                  <hi>were ten congregations, and twenty officers, feeding and ruling them in common, not one of them fixed to any one congregation. This kind of Presbytery would pass for a lawful government: and none of these incongruities or absurdities are charged on them, by this argument: and it shall not follow that ruling and teaching are not commensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as the Holy Ghost makes them commensurable.</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

It is most weak, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, that the Apostles could not be fixed Pastors to them, <hi>for then they should be limited Pastors to them, and so not Apostles:</hi> for there can be no contradiction between Apostles and Pastors, for their fixed preaching, and fixed administring of the seals.

               <p>Nor could all the many thousands, who had power of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Elders, as our Brethren say, <hi>meet in one place come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and comfortably</hi> to act: and therefore Christ so must never have appointed such a judicature, to rule all these congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who are entitatively one; so must they say what we say, and more. For all the congregations on earth are entitatively and in nature one, and yet our Brethren will be far from saying, that they are all under one government, as they say that these meetings at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>H. The rest of the examples of</hi> Antioch, Ephesus, Rome, <hi>though it were granted upon their greater growth, and increase, and so want of Elders, they might meet in divers places for the while, these might still be under one presbytery, their officers in a distinct manner attending upon them. And therefore</hi> Gerson Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerus <hi>in his answer sayes here,</hi> Quis adeo ineptire sustinuerit, &amp;c. <hi>Who can say; that because they meet in divers places, they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der divers Presbyteries, or Elders?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is a short way of answering, with a leaving out of the Church of <hi>Samaria,</hi> a great City, wherein <hi>all both men and women were baptized,</hi> the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

2. And yet there is no lesse cause to say all the Saints <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>H.</hi> well near also yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that there was a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Church at <hi>Antioch, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus, Rome.</hi>
                  </note> at <hi>Rome, Antioch, Ephesus, Samaria</hi> could not meete in one place, then that these of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> could not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they might meet in divers places, <hi>for the while, and yet be under one Presbytery;</hi> Here is a <hi>Presbyteriall Church of many Congregations, for a while.</hi> Here is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall and Antichristian Government, <hi>for a while,</hi> at least ordained by Christ.</p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>H.</hi> writes a Book with a huge noise of absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, with which he burdens his Brethren the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians; yet he will suffer their Church to stand, <hi>for a while.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Who told Mr. <hi>H</hi> that a Presbyterial Church may stand <hi>for a while,</hi> during the time of the growth of the the Church of <hi>Ierusalem, Antioch, Ephesus,</hi> but no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? for when the swarmed out Churches are once set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Presbyterian Church must downe againe, since the Scripture speakes nothing of this. Who gave Mr. <hi>H.</hi> leave to set up an Antichristian Tabernacle (for so is the Presbytery to him) for an houre, and pull it downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a wonder that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> should cite <hi>Gerson Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> cuttedly, as a Witnesse so much for a Presbyteriall Church, not in the swarming out of Churches onely (of which <hi>Bucer</hi> hath not one word) but in the setled state of the Church: for <hi>Bucer</hi> contradicts Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and all his as foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly erring, when they say such Churches meet in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places for the Word and Seales; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent in their government, and cannot be under one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon government. <hi>Bucer</hi> saith, if they lie near together, it is folly to say they are under divers Presbyteries, and so say we.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. 2. It doth not appear out of any Text, nor any evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Argument gathered therefrom, that (setting aside the Church of</hi> Jerusalem) <hi>they should needs meet in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Then the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> met in sundry places, by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his argument: but this shall offend the dissenting

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3.

               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>H. If Christ allude to the Synedry, then must</hi> Mat. 18. <note place="margin">Par. 1. c. 10. p. 130.</note> 
                  <hi>be expounded of a Presbyterial Church. Mr.</hi> H. <hi>both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and Assumption is denied.</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> leaps from one Book to another. I no <note place="margin">Mr. R. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mat. 18. from allusion unto the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Sanhedrim abused, not answered.</note> where frame an Argument from a meer allusion: but so, if Christ so allude to an authoritative company, that hath power of binding and loosing, as the Jewish Sanhedrim in this <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. then he judgeth the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. to be a Juridical Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its a poor Argument, he alludes not to the Jewish Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, because that Synagogue had no power of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as this Church <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. hath, saith he: but can there be <hi>no allusion to a Iudicature, except the one, to which allusion is made, and that of which the present speech is, have the like power?</hi> Then cannot the Scripture allude to earthly Princes, who place their greatest Courtier upon the right hand, because earthly Princes have not the like power with the Father of Jesus Christ. This destroys all allusions, which abound in the Scripture; as <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 10. 18. alludes to the Sun; <hi>Malachi</hi> compareth Gospel-worship to the burning of Incense, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. shall it then follow, that the one is of the nature of the other? <hi>That allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions bring little light,</hi> is said without ground; for they being grounded upon Metaphors often, which bring light, must bring much light.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Synagogues had no power to excommunicate, seems to bring darkness, and not light. The contrary is <hi>Iob.</hi> 9.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We send no man by a loup to a General Councel, but the grieved man may appeal to the nearest Judicature; and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will have him to loup to a General Councel at the first, being accused of a scandal, which declares, that he would elude all the Government of Christ, between him and that Judicature.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Arg. 2. <hi>The Church of believers is that which meets for prophecying and for praying: but this,</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>especially for binding and loosing, and censures. Mr.</hi> H. <hi>The Church of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is assembled mainly for prophecying and praying, yet not onely, but for censures also, the Word being ended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That is indeed in question, That men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren meet ordinarily every Lords-day for to act in all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and after Sermon to leed witness, binde and loose, and that under the notion of believers, for neither here, nor in Scripture, is there warrant for this.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Arg. 3. <hi>The Church</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>is such a superiour and judicial Seat, as is to be obeyed in the Lord, under the pain of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication: But a multitude of believers are not such a seat. So Mr.</hi> R. <hi>Mr</hi> H. <hi>The Major is the question, and the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is to be proved, whether a particular congregation be the highest Tribunal, or the classical Church: and Mr.</hi> R. <hi>takes one part of the Conclusion to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve the other: If the congregation be not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, then the classical must be. The Minor should have been proved, not nakedly propounded.</hi>

                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:58837:131"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I propound a Syllogism, and for answer to the <hi>minor,</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> transforms my Argument, which I dreamed not of, and sayes, <hi>I take one part of the conclusion to prove the other, If the congregation be not highest, then the classis is.</hi> But, Sir, that is not one part of the conclusion to prove another; but since you bring it, its a lawful Syllogism, Either the congregation or the classis is the highest Tribunal: But not the congregation. Yet this is Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Arg. not mine.</p>
               <p>The Church <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. is such a superiour seat, as is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, as being over us in the Lord, &amp;c. But no Scripture, no <note place="margin">Pauls Presbyt. c 8. p. 88. The Church, Mat. 18. is to be obeyed in the Lord by the people, but the Church of the people is not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed in the Lord by the people.</note> Divine in the world saith, That the multitude of believers (I use not there the term Congregational Church at all) is such a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Seat, that is over the Guides, and whom the Guides do obey in the Lord, or disobey under the pain of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This <hi>minor</hi> of mine is not nakedly propounded. The Scripture saith, the officers are over the multitude of believers in the Lord, 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 12, 14. 1 Tim. 5. 17. Heb.</hi> 13. 17. But the contrary is never said; they do not awake that say, this is to <hi>take one part of a conclusion to prove the other;</hi> for its a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion proved by a <hi>medium,</hi> that is no part, neither subject nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of the conclusion.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Arg. 4. <hi>of Mr.</hi> R. <hi>Whatever the Church may excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, every member thereof convened with the Church may inflict all inferiour censures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But all the members cannot inflict lesser punishment; for neither women, nor aged children, nor the unofficed brethren, can rebuks, exhort, or, by the Word, openly convince the officers.</hi> Ans. <hi>The consequence is feeble, as appears from the nature of delegated power, which is committed by Christ to persons capable thereof, which women for their sex, children for the want of the exercise of understanding, cannot do. People have power to choose officers, therefore women have power to put in their voices. The Body of a Corporation may put out a Major upon desert; therefore women and children may do it. No, the wise God hath included the votes of women in the male.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Nay, but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> shall not so elude the Argument. Whatsoever the judging, binding and loosing Church of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers may do, that every member of the joynt community may

               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>Both propositions may be denied. Neither a Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out officers, nor as having them, is here onely understood; but the second sense is here firstly attended. For both people and Elders have their power, parts and places in a right order and manner; when its said, a Ministerial Church is here understood, Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial notes either Ministers without the body exclusively, and that is false, or Ministers with the body inclusively. Now a Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Church in the fairest sense aims at both. In the first sense,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:58837:132"/>
the proposition is false; in the second it doth not conclude to whom the essence and definition of a Ministerial, i. e. of a Church of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, without the body, having power to excommunicate, doth necessarily belong: These and these onely are here understood.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Well then Mr. <hi>H.</hi> denies the conclusion; then both a Ministerial Church, and a Church of Redeemed, meeting to partake of Ordinances, have their part here: <hi>Ergo,</hi> women have their part here.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

4. Nor can the officers binde and loose as officers, nor hath Christ given this power to the officers as officers, by this way of our Brethren. For they say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Keyes were given to <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 16. as to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, not as to an officer.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Here is strange work! the Keyes were not given to <hi>Peter</hi> as an officer, but as a believer, and yet he useth the Keyes as an officer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Church is not made Ministerial by us, without the body exclusively wholly (for Christs Government is voluntary) nor ought any new thing to be concluded in our Assemblies, while the people hear of it: for if the Romans used <hi>rogare &amp; suadere legem,</hi> and obtain the consent of the people thereunto, far more are they not to be acknowledged as Church-laws, that are to be obtruded upon the godly against their will and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and much more if they be against the Word of God, and former godly acts with consent agreed unto by the Church; that is, whether the people consent or not, but yet without the body, whether they exercise acts of jurisdiction or not, for no act of jurisdiction is due to them; and to exclude the consent of women, no less interessed in practise of conscience than men, is to be Lords of their faith.</p>

Mr. <hi>H. Arg. 10. of Mr.</hi> R. <hi>The onely apparent argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this interpretation is weak, and therefore this sense hath ne strength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>Both parts fail: 1. There may be other Reasons given. 2. It doth not follow, that the different sense is clear, because many better Reasons haply may be rendred, than were alledged. Mr.</hi> Ball <hi>according to his sagacity and sharpness of dispute, seeketh far and wide where to finde, where the word Church noteth onely the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but all cometh to this, One may suppose such a sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> denies the Antecedent and the Consequence, <note place="margin">The word Church can signifie no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the ruling Church Mat. 18. and the notation of the word Church in our brethrenssense is neither Mat. 18. nor else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. See how Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Perpetual G ve n. c. 4. mistakes in this.</note> and proves both to be false with the same Argument, Because many better <hi>Reasons may haply be given;</hi> which is bad Logick: for other Reasons may be given (and <hi>Separatists, Morellius, Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Prelatical</hi> men have besieged, but never taken in this Text) but if this be the onely seeming and apparent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son given for popular jurisdiction, yea or that can be given, the consequence is not proved by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Adverb <hi>haply,</hi> which implies <hi>No</hi> as well as <hi>I.</hi> And when Mr. <hi>R.</hi> saith, the Reasons against our sense are Sophisms, its not an answer to say, <hi>I. but stronger arguments haply may be rendred by others, such as never were alledged before.</hi> What if one should say stronger Reasons and <hi>clearer Scriptures yet than ever have been alledged, may haply be rendred</hi> for unwritten <hi>Traditions, Image worship, Praying to the Dead?</hi> Papists should be little stronger than they are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Argument is but this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the word Church in all the Scriptures so often mentioned, be never taken for the Elders onely, it a strong suspicion it is not so taken in this place,</hi> Matth. 18. <hi>But the word Church—is such.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>major</hi> is denied. All the judiciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Interpreters finde a word onely in this sense in this place, and that it cannot bear sense according to the analogie of faith, but in this sense onely, as scope, matter and circumstances of the place inforce; and yet the same word must be otherwise taken in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And when all is done, the conclusion of the apparent reason amounts but to a suspicion; and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> of his own addes the qualification of strong suspicion, and Mr. <hi>R</hi> hath leave upon better grounds to adde, that his own suspicion is weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:58837:135"/>
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> wrongs that eminently learned and godly man, Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> who proves the Elders here must be meant, and no other Church, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> touches not with one finger his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I retort the Argument. If the word <hi>Church</hi> of the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med meet to partake of all Ordinances, Word, Seals, Censures, &amp;c. often mentioned in Scripture, be never taken for Brethren onely, excluding believing women, sons come to age of 15 or 16 years, which are the far larger number of the Redeemed, confederate, visible Church, called, sanctified, as 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 1. 2 Cor. 1. 1. Eph. 1. 1. Col. 1. 2. 1 Thess. 1. 1. 2 Thess 1. 1, &amp;c.</hi> then can it not be so taken, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and the Assumption must be as strong, That the word <hi>Church</hi> in this sense is <hi>destitute of the least loving look of the allowance of any Text, that might be a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in the field;</hi> as is the Rhetorication, in place of Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> therefore we desire a parallel place for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> answers not, when he tells us, that <hi>Women for their sex, and children for want of the exercise of understanding, are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from governing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That is another question, whether they be excluded from <note place="margin">Though wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, children of age, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from governing, yet the question now is a farre other thing, Whether the word <hi>Church,</hi> Mat. 18. if it be the Church of Redeemed ones meeting to and for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the same place, include not women, &amp;c.</note> governing from this, what is the notation of the word <hi>Church, Mat.</hi> 18. and whether women, children come to age, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, be not essential parts, and the far larger part of the <hi>Church of believors, fed, redeemed, of the Church which Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

E.) of a combination of faithful godly persons, meeting for that end, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of all the Ordinances of God in one place-built on the Rock, Mat.</hi> 16. If such a signification of the word <hi>Church</hi> be not in all the Scripture, is not this to have in the bag <hi>a stone &amp; a stone,</hi> when we say, <hi>Tell the Church—and if he hear not the Church, Mat.</hi> 18. is the Church-meeting in one place for hearing the Word, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the seals, professing the faith of <hi>Peter</hi> built upon the Rock, which essentially includes women, aged children, servants, but yet <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> is not <hi>Tell the women,</hi> aged children and servants, for they are excluded from governing (say they) true, but they are not excluded from being members of the Church,

               <p>Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> though not far from our Brethrens way, hath said the very same; for which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> refuteth Mr. <hi>R.</hi> And if Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> shews my mind in that, when Mr. <hi>H.</hi> refutes therein M. <hi>Parker,</hi> I yield; but he contradicts Mr. <hi>Parker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. It is said</hi> Acts 18. 22. <hi>Paul saluted the Church at</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, <hi>it cannot be thought in reason, that the Elders only were saluted; because the scope of</hi> Paul <hi>was to confirm the hearts of the Disciples, and therefore had an eye to the weakest, and those that wanted his sweet refreshing, who heard of his arrival, and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to give comfortable entertainment to him, and to be comforted by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Argument must then be thus, if any: <hi>Paul</hi> salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and kissed (for so is the original word) as many as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and encouraged in the way of grace at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:58837:137"/>
he confirmed in that way, all and every one, man, woman, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, rich, poor; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he kissed them all, and saluted them all. Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> see to the conclusion, it is all his own.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Argument is not brought to prove that the word <hi>Church</hi> there noteth precisely only the Elders. Nor does Mr. <hi>R.</hi> alledge it upon that account precisely; but that the word <hi>Church</hi> may note some eminent professors, and note a Church of all, men, women, children, yea the thousands who meet in <note place="margin">The place <hi>Act. 18. 22. Paul sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the church</hi> is wronged by M. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </note> sundry places, by the grant of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> came not out to meet <hi>Paul,</hi> and were saluted of him; for to be saluted, was but a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of courtesie, though Christian, but to be comforted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the faith is another thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The word</hi> Church <hi>in the Hebrew and Greek used by the Septuagint, notes the Rulers of the Church, not always the body; and it is granted without any hurt to our cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Since the signification of words, and of the word <note place="margin">The word <hi>Church</hi> is not in scripture, as our brethren take it. Nor is there a place in Old or New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Divines, imaginable for the sole male-Church.</note> 
                  <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets use them, is frequently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the New Testament by the Evangelists and Apostles; it is clear, our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. departed not from the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved signification of the words in the Old Testament used by the Septuagint. And so the word, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> hath a better warrant to be expounded. <hi>Tell the Rulers,</hi> then, tell all the faithful men, women, children, and servants; therefore <hi>the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion is so strong,</hi> as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> said, that there is no parallel Text for this signification of a male-Church excluding women and officers, who may excommunicate all officers; and whereas he so much contends for the signification of the word <hi>Church,</hi> Let him answer what is meant there, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 16. If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Christ.</hi> If the meaning be, that the congregations mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the same place, contend not among themselves; what if they so should do? who should right them, by our Brethrens way? and if that be the Church that meets in one place onely, when shall the Church Catholick which Christ loved, and gave himself for, meet? not until the day of Judgement? and did the Brethren testifie of the charity of <hi>Gaius, 2 Ioh. 16 before the Church,</hi> was that in the convened together congregation? or was it not before the men of the Church? And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> answers not one word of Scripture for telling the complaints to the Elders. Christ saith, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> that is, tell all the visible Saints, say our Brethren.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the incestuous Corinthian was rebuked legally of many, that is, of the Elders and Brethren, or Male-Church only, that is said, not proved. If we speak of judging by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of discretion, he was rebuked of Elders, Brethren, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, aged Children, Servants, for it concerned them in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to have knowledge of it, and to yield to withdraw from him, and to forgive him, upon his repentance to joyn with him, else their obedience must be blind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>minor</hi> is false.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For though they judge <hi>Heathen with the judgement of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> it follows not, that therefore Brethren, Women, aged <note place="margin">It cannot be denied but all in their owne respective ways officers, men, women, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. did rebuke and censure, and also forgive the incestuous Corinthian.</note> Children, and Servants should not also judge an excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate person by the same judgement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The probation is faulty, for I appeal to the conscience of our Brethren, whether there be not sundry kinds of judgement of discretion, and whether Church-members have not one kind of judgement of discretion toward the excommunicate man, who is now under a medicinal Church-cure, and another judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of discretion toward them that are without, and were never members.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is little Logick in dividing the power of private judging, which every one owe to another (no man is a Church to his brother) into a power of rebuking, and a power of Church-judging; for that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. is the Church-judging
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:58837:144"/>
by excommunication: so the face is where the neck should be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The rebuking, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. is indeed in order to Church-rebuking, and to excommunication; yea, to rebuke is a duty of the law of nature, <hi>Lev. 19. 17. Ps.</hi> 141. 5. but by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his way, I must rebuke none but offenders of my own congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. May I not then rebuke, but hate brethren of another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? for so <hi>Moses</hi> expoundeth <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If to rebuke be a judicial Church-rebuking; I pray you, may not women rebuke women and men both, and labour to gain them, if they trespass, and to <hi>tell the Church?</hi> sure, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigail, Pilates</hi> Wife, <hi>Sarah,</hi> and other godly women did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, counsel, and complain of offences, and they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from this duty of the law of nature. Doth not then M. <hi>H.</hi> clothe women with a Church-power? and why but as <hi>Iezabel</hi> and wanton widows are censurable, <hi>Rev. 2. 20. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 12. may they not rebuke? and it appears that a brother <hi>must forgive until seventy seven times</hi> (for upon this occasion <hi>Peter</hi> moves the question, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 21, 22.) but not so, women, aged chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and servants, for they must be less apt to forgive then men.</p>

And howbeit the rebuker be the superiour as he rebukes (which yet is not true in an unjust rebuker, for he is inferiour) yet either too much shall be taken from, or too much given to godly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his way.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> objects, <hi>If the people should censure the Pastors, then there should be Pastors of Pastors, and the Sheep should be Shepherds, not the Sheep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>The consequence is feeble, because the people judge not as officers, but as members of the whole, to whom by vertue of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Laws of combination they have subjected themselves to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, for the common good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H</hi> fathers not this argument upon me, nor upon any of ours, but <hi>Stapleton, Grego. de Valen. Toletus, Pererius,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:58837:144"/>
Esthius,</hi> and other Papists, who urge the like to exime their <note place="margin">By Mr. H. his way, the flock are over the shepherds, the flock feed, and watch for the soul of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</note> Clergy from being subject to civil powers. Own the Argument, for then the shepherd should be subject to the sheep, which is not absurd, in <hi>diverso causarum genere.</hi> But these who gave power as officers to excommunicate, are here ruled by such as have that power, and such, to wit, the people and flock, have that power, have the keys.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are to edifie by excommunication, 1 Cor. 5. 5. 2 Cor. 10. 8. 1 Tim. 1. 20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Rulers are to obey the people, as such, <hi>who watch for their souls, Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Take heed that they perish not, and therefore must give warning and rebuke, lest these perish over whom they have the power of the rod that way. And so the people authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively watch for their shepherds, and the shepherds, to wit, all the officers must submit unto the sheep, the people, <hi>as being over them in the Lord,</hi> having the power of excommunication above their heads.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is but a conceit, to say, that the brethren excommunicate <note place="margin">It is but a poor evasion of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that the people doth excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, not as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, but as members; for none are <hi>sure</hi> to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, but as scandalous and rotten members.</note> not their pastors <hi>as if they were officers,</hi> for they excommunicate them, as having received the keys to use them against their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, as the Church having authoritative power over their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, as members of the Church; and it hath no sense to say, that the Church excommunicates, not as the Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17, 18. nor can members as members excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; but saith he, <hi>the officers are not excommunicated as officers, but as members.</hi> Nor are any the most scandalous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated as officers, or as saints, or as members, but as scandalous officers, or scandalous professors, or as rotten and leavening members corrupting the whole lump.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Suppose the members of a Class offend, the rest who censure them are not Pastors of Pastors to these whom they censure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The whole watch for themselves, and rule, and govern themselves, as the Parliament do rule their own members. But it is non-sense to say that the sheep <hi>are in the Lord</hi> over the flock, for the Scripture saith the contrary, <hi>Heb. 13. 17. 1 Thes.</hi> 5. 12, 13. v. 7.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Suppose the Pastors turn Hereticks, the ruling Elders

with the rest consure them; here are the inferiours judging the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is to beg the question, for if there be none to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate the Pastors, but only the ruling Elder with the <note place="margin">The ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with the people have no power by the Word to judge the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</note> people, Christ committed not half a Key to any society.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. If there be more teaching Pastors with the ruling Elders, then an heretical Pastor may be censured by the whole Judicature, and by the ruling Elders <hi>in Collegio,</hi> where he hath an equal vote with the teaching Pastor, and doth not as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour judge the teaching Elder, but as a collateral and joynt Judge censure with the whole Judicature.</p>

                  <hi>none of them can, by the rule of the Gospel, compel him to joyn with one more than another. He may freely choose what is most suitable to his heart, and may be most to promote his spiritual edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Neither Civil nor Ecclesiastick power here hath place. 1. This staple Rule (Mr. <hi>H.</hi> abounds with staple Rules which are much irregular) except it be proved by the Word, is a staple untruth. No man by Nature hath a spiritual power, either gift, office, or grace: But <hi>by Nature</hi> here is opposed to free consent.

                  <hi>The Church cannot by carnal weapons</hi> (saith he) <hi>impose any Church-constitution, as Nature gives not this power Ecclesiastick:</hi> true, it is a free gift of God: <hi>So a civil Ruler</hi> (saith he) <hi>should not impose it,</hi> that is a poor consequence, <hi>he should impose all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil duties that are external,</hi> and which the mans baptism and profession ties him unto. <hi>What ever is done here</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the constitution of Churches, is done by an Ecclesiastick Rule, not by a Rule of policy.</hi> This yet is most weak. <hi>The Magistrate</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Ruler makes no Church-laws, but he may compel Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, yea and subdued hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in some case to obey them when they are made.</note> 
                  <hi>makes no rule of constitution of Churches,</hi> nor any Ecclesiastical Rule, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith. But it follows not, therefore he cannot impose it, when it is made. The <hi>Magistrate</hi> makes not the hearing of the Gospel to be lawful; but it follows not, <hi>Ergo</hi> as the preserver of both Tables of the Law, he may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Christian subjects to hear the Gospel: yea, to me its most probable, he may compel heathen people lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered to desist from Idolatry, blaspheming of Christ, and to hear the Gospel.</p>
               <p>The man comes from <hi>China</hi> acknowledging God in all his wayes, as <hi>Abraham</hi> left his Countrey, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. if he be an Idolater, they should not lodge him, 2 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. he comes not as indifferent to be married to this or this Church, or to none at all; as a man sins not if he marry none at all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. but if he be a professor that joyns to no Church, he lives scandalously; therefore the adequate cause of membership, or to this mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, is not mutual consent, as in marriage, but both parties are under a command to confess Christ before men; and its a selfish thing to make a mans own heart the Judge and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his membership, and not the Churches led by the Rule of the Word: and so the Church is obliged to receive him, and he is obliged to joyn a member, according to <hi>Cant. 1. 7, 8.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. A divided power in many, is not an united power from many. The peoples is a divided power, lying in many combined, and therefore not the same. Hence the power of judgement is not

the power of office, and therefore the fraternity may have the one, when they have not the other.</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

Mr. <hi>H.</hi> brings no argument of the weight of a feather on the contrary.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. However the Elders are superior to the fraternity in regard of office, rule, act and exercise, which is proper onely to them, and not to the fraternity, the people or Church are superiour to the Elders in point of censure, each have their full scope in their own sphere and compass: The office of Major, King, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is not prejudged, because the Corporation, Parliament, Princes and States for faults may depose them.</hi>

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58837:147"/>
he calls it without all Scripture, the <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> as if wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <note place="margin">If brethren &amp; Church be all one, women must be no members of the Church.

Whereas he makes the people or Church superior to the Elders (all of them if Hereticks) in regard of censure, not of office and rule: He makes censuring or excommunicating no part of rule, contrary to Scripture.

               <p n="2">2. Because the Presbytery is called <hi>Antichristian,</hi> prelatical, formal, by our brethren.

E.</hi> But there be not many, to my knowledge (I say no further) for the congregatonal way, but
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58837:151"/>
they are for toleration in non-fundamentals: and how few fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals there be possibly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What they are, who can define? so that this way seems to me no less new, then other sinful ways of Arminians and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians; and what mischiefe toleration brings forth in <hi>Britain</hi> also.</p>
               <p>Lastly, we hold that censures should not be dispenced against the peoples mind; for as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, the censure shall not <note place="margin">August. contra Donatistas.</note> edifie, if most of the people be infected with the same scandal; and if the people shall not in their practices yield, it may breed a separation and a schism.

For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Elders may abuse their power, and so hinder excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; and without them, saith Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> no act of <hi>ruling and excommunicating can be;</hi> shall therefore excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be no ordinance? persecutors do hinder the preaching of the Gospel, shall the preaching of the Gospel for that be no ordinance of God? but the people lawfully may withdraw their consent, and then there shall be no excommunication. This yet proves not; <hi>If the peoples power lawfully used hinder undue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, then the Elders onely have not power.</hi> For the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples power lawfully used, hindered King <hi>Saul</hi> to put <hi>Ionathan</hi> to death, and hindered all the Judges from doing the same; <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> King <hi>Saul</hi> and the Judges only have not judicial power of life and death, but the people have it also? it follows not: yea, but (saith he) that Christ shall appoint a means of reformation, and purging the Church, that in an ordinary course shall not attain the end, is deeply prejudicial to the faithfulness, wisdom, and power of Christ: any manner of way this is an argument carnall and humane.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where hath Christ interposed his faithfulness and wisdom,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:58837:151"/>
that if officers and brethren make use of the judicial power he hath given to them, the Church shall be actually purged, is not this the question?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where hath he promised a reformed Church, in case these who have power to reform, stand in the way, shall Christs wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be accused, or the Gospel reproched, because either men hinder it to be preached, or these to whom it is preached, believe it not? or does the faithfulness of God fail, though <hi>all men are lyars?

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Learned Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Liegh, Beza, Beda, Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, Augustine, Ierom, Cyprian,</hi> tell us that the keys noteth ministerial power, never since Learning and Tongues were in the world, given to unofficed and private men, to exercise and make use of them, but to the <hi>oeconomus</hi> Master-houshold, or steward. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the learned Annotator, who answers <hi>Pamelius,</hi> make <hi>Stantes</hi> distinguished from these who fell a part of the Church, because they are not utterly to be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>ut prophani &amp; canes,</hi> as prophane, <hi>ab omni rerum Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carum cognitione,</hi> but never indued with juridical power, as the Rulers; to these Mr. <hi>H</hi> answers nothing: onely all such means (saith he) <hi>as are sufficient, private, or publick, to open and shut Heaven, may be called the keys.</hi> All means of promises and threatnings in the mouths of women. <hi>Abigail</hi> and others of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58837:152"/>
ged children and servants, yea, and of these of another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation are sure means of the word, for opening and shutting Heaven; shall these women and children, and servants, for that bear the keys of the Kingdom of God?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The key of Royalty is only in Christ, the key of charity in the hand of all believers, who out of Christian love lend some help, but have no power judicial to proceed. There is the Key of subordinate power which only such and all such have as are combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a special corporation, and come under the external govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Scepter of Christ; such have good law to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as will not stoop to the rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. What the Brethren have more then <hi>the key of charity,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Women, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, &amp; others have the Key of love as well as the Male-Church.</note> to lend help out of love, is the debate; sure if women be not excluded from the Law of Love, this key cannot be taken from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If only such, and all such</hi> (omne &amp; solum) <hi>as are combined in a speciall corporation, have the key of subordinate power;</hi> this power essentially and universally must agree to the so combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned body. But women, aged children, servants, are especially combined by the Church-covenant, as is easie to prove from Mr. <hi>H. quod convenit omni &amp; soli convenit reciprocè &amp; universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter. Ergo,</hi> only the combined Church-members, and all the Church-members (so women) must excommunicate, and all for them; then the officers, as members combined, not as officers do excommunicate; I quit all Logick, if this can be eluded. Now Mr. <hi>H.</hi> sayes that confederate Saints, all, and onely have the keys.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Pro. 3. <hi>The keys of subordinate power are seated firstly in the Church, and by vertue of the Church, they are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to any that in any measure or manner share therein: heat to first in the fire, as its proper subject, the faculty of sense belongs first to the sensitive soul, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. The power of the keys</hi> belongs to the Church of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <note place="margin">How the Church is the subject of the Keys, 1. Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. 2. Formal. 3. The Object.</note> of men and women, as the first virtual subject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the rulers and guides, as to the formal subject; as heat is in the fire, so every part of the fire is formally hot, as a part of the first formal subject: as iron is hot by participation, by the fire. But by this Mr. <hi>H.</hi> must say all the parts of the Churches
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:58837:152"/>
of Believers are endued with this power of binding and loosing, as the partial and incomplete subject. So yetmust women, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and servants be endued formally with the judicial power of the keys: but this is false.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The keys are in the whole, in the exercise, in the rulers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally by the judicial power inherent in them, in the people, men, and women by consent, not by any inherent formal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er juridical.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The keys belong to all rulers, ruled, men, women, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, servants, parents, children, objectively and <hi>finaliter</hi> for the edification of the whole body, and every part thereof, <hi>Eph. 4. 11, 12. 2 Cor.</hi> 10 8.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Is suits not with right reason to cast some part of the power firstly upon the people, some part upon the Rulers, as though there were two first subjects of this power which the letter of the text gainsayeth, to thee will I give, not to them: it were to speak daggers and contradictions to make but one first subject of the power, and yet have others to share in this power, is more wide from the mark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Judge if it suits with reason, which judicious and godly Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> saith, <hi>when the Church of a particular Congregation</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Keys, cap. 7. 3 Prop. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>walketh together in the truth, all the brethren of the Church are the first subject of Church liberty, and the Elders thereof of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authority, and both of them together, are the first subject of all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The subject of the Keyes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. Cotton.</note> 
                  <hi>Church power needful to be exercised within themselves, whether in Election, Ordination, or Censures of their own body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They may distinguish between the power of the keyes, and between Church power. But it suits as little with reason to make two, to wit, Elders and Brethren, the two first subjects, or one complete first subject of Church power, as to make them one complete first subject, or two first subjects of the power of the keys. Nor is it against reason, that the body organick be the first virtual subject of the Keys, and the same body be the first formal subject of both the Keys, and of Church-power in the exercise, the Rulers acting their way, and the people their way, as is said; nor are there for that two subjects of power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Argument by which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> proveth this is most fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

Now see, he gives the keys of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge principally and firstly to the people, and secondarily to the Elders <hi>who labour not in the word and doctrine,</hi> in so far as they concur to make the word effectual. Nor can the Lord have given the Key of only ruling to the preaching Elders, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he speaks to <hi>Peter</hi> as representing two subjects.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is neither <hi>dagger</hi> nor weapon of blood, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick visible Church of the first-born including rulers and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, be the first subject of free redemption, of all power of the Keyes in their saving fruit, of all styles, the Spouse, Body, Love, &amp;c. the saving priviledges of special note, that one promised in the covenant of grace, the new heart, remission of sins, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, ruling in the visible kingdom by binding and loosing, and that your particular congregation and society share of all these at the second hand. And Mr. <hi>H.</hi> must be content that we look upon it as weak Divinity, that Christ gave himselfe for the Catholick Church, and bestows all upon her firstly, and that this be the first natural recipient subject of all these, as the element of fire, not this or that fraction or fragment of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement is the first adequate, natural recipient subject of heat, as is above explained.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Prop. 4. <hi>The power of the keys take it in the complete nature thereof, is in the Church of Believers, as in the first subject, but in the manner and order of ruling that Christ appointed, in the parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> speaks not distinctly, and should have told us what the power of the keys is in its complete nature, and what in its incomplete and half nature it is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When he sayes the Church-congregational, and the male-Church of Believers so consederate, is the first subject of the Keys, he saith an untruth like to this, this particular fragment of the Element of fire is the first subject of heat.

                  <hi>A particular Church or Congregation professing the faith taken indefinitly, for any Church (one as well as another) is the first sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all the Church Officers, with all their spiritual gifts and power—whether it be</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>all are yours (speaking of the Church of</hi> Corinth, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 3. 22.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> must prove that <hi>Paul</hi> there speaks of a <note place="margin">The place 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 21. All things are yours &amp;c.</hi> misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by Mr. <hi>Cotton.</hi>

It were a most comfortless Doctrine to limit that soul delighting priviledge, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 21. all things are yours,</hi> then Christ, and Grace and Glory are yours. And vers. 23. <hi>ye are Christs,</hi> onely to Saints, as they are a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meeting in one place. What is this, but by the scope of that place, you have right to Christ and Salvation, and Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promises, as the first subject only under the reduplication of a congregation meeting in one place, as an organized Church. <note place="margin">If the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <hi>in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracto,</hi> as the congregation, be the first subject of all officers, gifts, graces, by this, <hi>All things are yours,</hi> then the godly Saints visible are excluded from Christ onely, because they are not members of a congregation, and no promises of a new heart, of remission, are made to any, but to and for the congregation.</note>

               <p n="2">2. What agrees to Believers, as Christians, and Believers, to believing women, aged children, servants, and to the scattered Saints. Now in no such Church state, as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> imagines the Corinthians to be in, and to <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Pathmes,</hi> and to the Apostles as believing Apostles, that cannot agree to a congregation as the first subject, which reciprocally and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiveth this power. But such is this, <hi>Revel. 21. 7. He that overcomes shall inherit all things, all are yours,</hi> death in the sweet fruit of it belongs to women, and to Christians as Christians, though in no congregational state; <hi>Ergo,</hi> women, and the whole Catholick Church, whether in such a Church-state or not, must be the first subject of the Keyes. And it is wretched Logick; <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>all things are yours, and ye are Christs,</hi> to a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that meets in one place: <hi>Ergo,</hi> such a promise is made to a congregation, as to the first subject, and as to a congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: then may I infer the promise <hi>to eat of the Tree of Life, to receive the hidden Manna, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if so, these priviledges must agree to the congregation firstly, and to all other for the congregation, as that agrees first to the fire, and then to iron, to water for the fire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Paul</hi> saying, <hi>all are yours,</hi> whether <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. he cannot mean <hi>Paul,</hi> as an Apostle, is proper to you as a congregation, in all his Apostolick travels, for that is false: nor can the meaning be, <hi>Paul</hi> as a fixed Pastor is yours, for he was no fixed Pastor to them, tyed to that congregation only. Then the meaning must
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:58837:154"/>
be, <hi>Paul,</hi> and by a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> all the Apostles and Pastors, and the World, and Life and Death, in their labours must be for you, and the Catholick Church, and all the Saints all the earth over, whom they must gather in, and perfect as Christs body, and parts of his body, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. and not as a congregation; so our Brethren in this as in many other points abuse, but expound not the word.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The power of the keys is in her (the Church congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal of Believers) as in the cause subordinately under Christ, and it may thereby here be acted as</hi> potestas judicii, <hi>in admission of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in the absence of Ministers, in censuring by admonition, for each man is a Iudge of his brother, and there is a judicial way of admonition, when the parties are in such a state as in</hi> foro exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori, <hi>they can make process</hi> juridicè, <hi>against each other, so there is a power of gift in all elections. Or else this power of the keys is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from her to the officers, the soul doth not see but by an eye, makes an eye and sees by it, so that the Church makes a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and dispenseth Words and Sacraments by Officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We seek Scripture, and see only Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his naked assertions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The power of the Keys is <hi>radically</hi> in the Church of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed <note place="margin">The Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Male-Church exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding women.</note> ones, to wit, the <hi>male-Church</hi> of redeemed ones, a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for name and thing, not in the Word.</p>

               <p n="3">3. In the absence of Ministers this is done, then Ministers and Elders with the male-Church excluding women, aged children, judicially admit members, then all female members, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and servants with blind obedience must own these mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and watch over them: prove this, for women have neither consent nor vote.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That every one may judicially process another, that is, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially accuse one another and complain, and bring witnesses against one another, and prove the scandal: that is true, and may judicially accuse before the Church the daughters, or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant women, yea, or men that are incorrigible after private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, but that the members of the male-Church judge one

There is <hi>Potestas doni,</hi> a power of a gift in all elections, well; a power of a gift of discerning &amp; trying, who shall be my Pastor, sure women have their gift of discerning; why should Pastors be obtruded upon women blindly? should men have dominion over their faith? I am glad that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives no juridical power to the call and making of Officers: but only a power of gift, <hi>Potestas doni.</hi> But the Church communicates this power of the Keyes to the Officers, that is, the male Church of redeemed Brethren. This is proved by no word of God, but by a similitude, in which it is said (by poor Physiology) <hi>The Soul makes an Eye,</hi> and the Brethren make their Officers, which we deny: God makes them by the laying on of the hands of the Elders, <hi>Acts 6. 6. 1 Tim. 4. 14. 2 Tim. 2. 2. 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 22.</p>

                  <p>Whether Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> his Arguments conclude strongly that the People have a power of judging.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>H. 197. The power of judgement is in the Rulers dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively (as formally in the people) they out of an office power, leading the whole proceeding therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I never heard that a chief member, either Speaker in <note place="margin">All power of office is by Mr. H. only in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating and opening the Assembly, which is no power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</note> Parliament, or President in Councel, or Chair-man in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, or Moderator in Assembly, was a place of juridical power, or office over the Judicature, or Members of the Church; a place of priority of order it is, which one may have to day and want to morrow: for the nature of order requires that one open the Assembly, and moderate the meeting: if this be all, the official power that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives to officers, is weak, and of no worth:</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no power, no act of ruling and governing given to the Pastors above the Brethren. For,</p>

               <p n="3">3. Ordination is, and may be (according to our Brethren) and creating of Officers, though Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> make it peculiar to Officers, because of <hi>Act. 6. 6. 1 Tim</hi> 4. 14. as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> cites; yet Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, the Brethren may do it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is no act of the Key of Authority, that the Elders o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the doors of speech more then that one speak before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or that <hi>Elihu</hi> speak more then the rest of the friends,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:58837:156"/>
is no act of the power of the Keyes. Nor,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is the preparing of matters, and receiving of complaints, by our Brethrens way proper to them then to other officers more, since Mr. H. saith all equally have the power of the Keys from the Church of Brethren. What power of the Keyes the Pastors have in preaching and exhorting, they have it rather over the congregation, then over the male-Church of Brethren; nor is it so properly a superiority of rule, as of doctrine, which in Synods they have over Churches; nor can the Pastor have a <hi>directive</hi> power as a Pastor over the brethren; since by M. <hi>H.</hi> his way, they may judg and censure him. Can the King be their Judg with a <hi>directive</hi> power, who not being a Parliament, may judg authoritatively whether he should be King or not, and may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne him?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Arg. 1. <hi>Ejusdem ist instituere &amp; destituere, The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have power to consure and depose Officers in case of heresie, or otber iuiquity, for they gave power by election to Rulers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is ordinary to our Brethren to prove in a Circle, the fraternity have power to chuse Officers, ere they have power to depose; and they have power to censure &amp; excommunicate, he whole being above the part: <hi>ergo,</hi> they must have power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain: we deny the Fraternity can either make or unmake officers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That is not so undeniable a proposition, an Assembly of Officers, a Church of thirty may constitute themselves in a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, and so may a Parliament, by an intrinsecal power in themselves: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they may for heresie and scandal against the Law of Nature destroy and censure themselves, it followeth not.</p>

               <p>

               <p>M. <hi>H.</hi> 3 Arg. <hi>Either the people have a causal virtue in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or onely a consent; the latter cannot be: To consent to evil is sin; to dissent from a just sentence, makes them to hinder the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of a just sentence.</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is already answered, and hath not the weight of the some of the water. Elders have either a causal virtue in judging, or onely a consent: the former I see not how they have.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Mr. <hi>Tho: Goodwyn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Philip Nye,</hi> give them <note place="margin">M. Tho.

               <p n="2">2. The officers cannot consent to a sinful sentence, its not their duty to sin, nor can they dissent from a just sentence, for then they might hinder the execution of a just sentence, and the officers shall keep communion with a man whom the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple excommunicates; and that the people may erre, is too well known, in the condemning of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of others, And whereas he saith, The dissenting <hi>shall blemish the wisdome of God,</hi> its answered already: It blemishes our folly, but not his wisdome, when people are divided from Rulers, and Rulers from people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a midst between consenting to an unjust sentence, and a dissenting from a just sentence, to wit, a consenting by the judgement of discretion tacitly to a just sentence, in which there is a causality popular, nor judicial nor juridical, coming from the inherent power of the Keyes.</p>

                  <hi>understand the Church.</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>of the Elders onely: Suppose three Elders in a Church all have been convinced before witnesses</hi>

                  <hi>in private of an offence; they will not hear; the offended brethren must tell the Church: that is, they complain to these three Elders of these three Elders, and make the guilty both judge and party in their own cause. 2. Suppose of these three two be offenders, the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:58837:158"/>
grieved party must tell the third, and so one shall be the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This inconvenience follows clear from the hampering of all power of the Keyes within one single congregation, in the midst of six congregations round about.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Book of Discipline of <hi>New England</hi> saith, A Church Independent may consist of four officers and three brethren, three brethren are offenders, if they cannot in this case tell the Elders onely, for they are not the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. saith Mr. <hi>Hooker; Ergo,</hi> the three offending brethren must complain to the three offending brethren, and make themselves both Judge and party; therefore the Argument necessitates us to tell the Elders of associate Churches.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Arg. 5. <hi>If the power of judgement be in Rulers, then</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The issue of this Argument is to strip the officers naked of all power of Rule, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> must take it away off his own way, as well as off ours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The teaching Elders are <hi>worthy of double honour</hi> above the ruling Elder, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. for they speak <hi>to us the word of the Lord,</hi> Hebrews 13. 7. and are the <hi>Ambassadors of God, who in Christs stead beseech us to be reconciled to God, 2 Cor. 5. 20. Their feet are pleasant,</hi> because of their message, and in this have power above ruling Elders, and those who serve Tables, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and above the brethren and Church, as being sent of God with pastoral power, not onely <hi>vi materiae,</hi> by vertue of their commands, but as in an Epistle is spoken judiciously to this purpose by Mr. <hi>Tho.

Nye, Epist. to the Reader prefixed to the treatise of the Keyes.</note> their Ministerial Authority. Now how they can be equal in commission of judging to the people, is the question: for as the woman is independent in regard of intrinsecal power of consenting or dissenting in point of marriage, the Parents di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective power of commanding extrinsecal, as the judicious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facers say, so the Fraternity is the onely judging society by them. Yea, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, The Elders are superiour to the fraternity or

                  <note place="margin">Pastors &amp; ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders are equal as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching power juridical, but as touching the power pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal of the Keys of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they are not equal, but the pastor is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the other</note>

How are leaders and overseers in the same managing of censures, equal in power, and not above those whom they lead and oversee, yea, to whom they are to yield obedience, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> cites to that purpose the place <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. are Parents equal in power who do command the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, whose it is to consent to the marriage?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the godly Reader consider, whether the Brethren, though believers, yet ignorant of the mystery of <hi>Balaams</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and of <hi>Iezobils</hi> teaching, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and of the learning and qualification of pastors, and of the deep and subtile Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies for which pastors must be cast out, are by the Word of the Lord equal in judicial power, and trying of Doctors and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, with the Rulers, whose office it is to know more of the minde of God, than Brethren? and whether are they by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution so?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. If Rulers alone have power to excommunicate by</hi> Mat. <note place="margin">Pag. 198, 199.</note> 18. <hi>then may three Elders excommunicate 400 or 500 brethren; and if so, Rulers should not onely censure the fraternity, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy themselves: for where no flock is, but all are excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, there are no shepherds.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Observe in all these six Arguments, there is not one jot of Scripture, but the one <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. where yet Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will not stand to the signification of the word <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 They are not there alone to excommunicate the Church of believers, without the consent of the Church; and we judge it no way of Christ to excommunicate not 400 onely, but six thousands, who all made one congregation of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> say our Brethren: But Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> saith well in the case of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a congregation to blasphemy and persecution, and no help by a Synod is to be hoped for, the Elders may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and separate disciples from them, and carry away the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances with them, and denounce judgement against them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>D. Ames.</hi> whose name is savoury in the Church of Christ, saith, But if a Church should be excommunicated, then a body
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:58837:159"/>
having and retaining its essence, should be cast out of it self. No Judge can properly punish himself, but the Presbytery and Synod may declare a Synagogue of Satan to be a Synagogue of Satan.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is against the meekness of Christ, and not warranted by any Scriptures, that faithful pastors that are pastors to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church should be unpastored, because this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular flock to which they were sent, leave off to be the flock of Christ, that is as much, as because they are faithful in his house, Christ will have them cast out of his house.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath quickly expeded my Arguments with <note place="margin">Due right of Presb. c. 1. sect. 2. p. 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Veni, vidi, vici;</hi> It is a scorn to say, without all proof, that the <hi>office-power is a little part of the power of the Keys:</hi> For the includent by no Logick is a part of the thing included, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not a part of the House which is a part of the City; but the contrary: now the office-power in Rulers includes preaching, <note place="margin">The office power is not a part, but the whole power of the keys.</note> administrating of the seals, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> grants, and also it includes a power of binding and loosing, and of ordaining, since the holy Ghost gives rules of right ordaining of Elders to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and to Teachers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, &amp; 10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 22. 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 2. Tit.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7, &amp;c. as to Pastors, not as to Believers, and by this to rebuke, censure, shall be no ruling at all, if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> deny ruling power to agree to Pastors as Pastors, or to be a part of office-power, because ruling power in officers is common to both officers and brethren.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He begs what is in question, for the brethren are ruled and to obey, and not Rulers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be said ruling power is not office-power; its replied that <hi>Mr. H.</hi> saith that the <hi>Elders are superiour to the Brethren or male-Church in regard of office, rule, act and exercise.</hi> Now if ruling <note place="margin">Page 191.</note> be common to both officers, and the Brethren, or such a male-Church of the redeemed; then are not the officers as officers superiour <hi>to this Church in rule; yea, this Church giveth power, and taketh away the power of governing</hi> by way of censure, from the officers: and so the brethren in ruling must be above the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as for the superiority official in preciding and managing the actual dispensing of censures, as Mr. <hi>H</hi> violently alledges <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. to this purpose, it is a ruling over the ruling of the Brethren, the like whereof was never heard, the mouth of a Judicature ordereth, but judgeth not the ruling, and judging of the Judges. Again, if officers be both officers in teaching, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrating the seals, watching over the manners of the people, and also in dispensing censures with the Elders, then must office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power take up and include both official acts, and also judicial acts and power in governing; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the power of office is not a part of the power of the Keys, but the whole power of the Keys.</p>

               <p>But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith cap. 11. sect. 2. page 192. <hi>The power of the Keyes is committed to the Church of confederate believers, as the first and the proper subject thereof.</hi> Pro. 1. page 193. <hi>That the power of the Keyes is seated in the Church as the proper subject is no novel opinion.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I pray our Brethren, do the Fathers mean the Church
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:58837:161"/>
of visible Saints, the multitude of Believers? or go our Divines <note place="margin">The church of believers built on the rock is not the formal first, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per subject of the keys.</note> in troops along with them in the <hi>formal, first and proper subject of the Keys,</hi> as fire is the first formal subject of heat. As Mr. <hi>H.</hi> page 193. Now I judge Mr. <hi>H.</hi> means his own only instituted visible Church in the new Testament, that meets together in one place for the ordinances; if I should say the whole element of fire is the first proper and formal subject of heat, and yet exclude four quarters or parts of this body, as utterly uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of heat, were I worthy to be called a Philosopher? But the same way Mr. <hi>H.</hi> maketh the Church confessing as <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 16. such a formal subject, and saith the fourth part of this subject, women, children of age, &amp;c. are not capable of the Keys; if it be said, the organical body is the proper subject of seeing, of hearing, &amp;c. yet neither legs nor hands are capable of either seeing or hearing.</p>
               <p>I answer: Then 1. the organical body is not the first and formal subject of seeing, but Arms and Legs are capable of touching; but women, aged children, servants, though essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of the visibly confessing Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally capable of no power, of no exercise of the Keyes at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God give the power of seeing to the eye, as to such a watching member, then gives he not the power of seeing to the organical body; but if God give the power of seeing to the eye, as to a member and part of the body: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he gives the power of seeing to all the members, <hi>Quod convenit, qua tale, convenit omnibus; Ergo,</hi> he must give the power of wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to women who are members.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Office-power is but a little part of the power of the Keys, and therefore it may be in Officers, and yet the power of the Keyes not be firstly in them, but in them who gave Office-power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is, as if one would say, the power of a Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houshold and of a Steward, is a part and a little part of the power of the Keys of a family; when these only under the Lord of the house have the Keys committed to them, shew in all Oeconomies in state, a family where the Keyes are committed to any but to those in office, and such as are subject of the power of the Keyes, <hi>a part and a little part of the power of the Keys,</hi> is
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:58837:161"/>
not the Key, the nible of a Key is not the Key. Yes, but it may be said, the <hi>Queen and Mistress of the Royal Family is above the Officers of the Royal House, since they are her Servants, no less then the Kings Servants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The officers are the believers servants objectively and <hi>finaliter,</hi> for the building of their souls, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. but the question now is, whether they be subjectively sent <hi>Potestate mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionis,</hi> by ordination, and laying on of hands (the ceremony to <note place="margin">How the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are above the Church of Believers, and the Church of Believers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them.</note> me is Oeconomy not to be despised, but for the thing it selfe I contend) of Elders, or people, and in an official power of the Keys to shut or open Heaven, either by preaching, seals or discipline; there is not any above the officers, not the Church of believers in an authoritative way; as for a way of Christian dignity, believers are, without all doubt, above all the officers on earth. And when the Mistress is a society of sinners, that she hath the power of the Keys in any authoritative way, over her selfe, or any other way committed to her, but by a whole consent, or godly withdrawing when the Rulers turn Wolves, is against Scripture and all Reason.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Not only the Officers, but Offices also are included in the Keys, as being of that ministerial power by which Heaven is opened and shut; and Officers and Offices are ordinances, and Christs gift to the Church,</hi> Eph. 4. 11. <hi>He gave some to be Pastors, &amp;c. As</hi> Mr. K. <hi>with</hi> Chrysostom <hi>acknowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">The offices &amp; officers are with as little sense included in the keys, as if we would say, the King and the royal office are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the royal power.</note>

The ruling Elders vote, if according to the rule, is of as much weight as the teaching Elders vote; and it is not absurd, but necessary that all be alike here, except Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hold a sort of Episcopacy of Rulers over Rulers in the same Judicature. This conceit (for there is no solidity of reason here) might prove that the King and Parliament, the General and Councel of War, the Major and the Aldermen are not the first subject formal (for of the virtual subject we speak not) of their respective military power, or civil State powers. Yea, the Pastor as a labourer in the Word and Doctrine, is in honour and power above the ruling Elder; the King and General acting severally, are above their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councels.

And it is like much Logick I have here met with; the <hi>ruling Elders cannot so lay on hands, and so receive witnesses as the teaching Elders; Ergo,</hi> teaching and ruling Elders for all that may well be the first subject of the Keys; my meaning is, they lay not on hands so, that is, by any pastoral teaching power. But as for the people, they bear not the Keys at all over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor are they in any sort Stewards to feed themselves;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:58837:163"/>
and therefore they are no more the subject of the Keys then pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate servants of the house, to exercise the Keys authoritatively: the Ethiopian is not white at all, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not so white as a Raven.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. To whomsoever Christ giveth the Keys, to them he gives</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 401.</note> 
                  <hi>a ministerial spirit by way of special Embassage to remit or retain sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>This is unsound, for the Keys are given to ruling Elders, who have no such ministerial spirit; it is not enough to say, that power of preaching is not formally given to ruling Elders; yet it is</hi> effective <hi>given in the fruit to them,</hi> as Mr. R. saith: <hi>for they who receive the same commission, or equal power of the same commission, must receive the power of the keys formally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Keys in a ministerial way of special Embassage, to remit and retain sins, are given to teachers by a concional way of remitting and retaining sins, and to both teachers and ruling Elders effectually (saith Mr. R,) <hi>in the judicial and authoritative</hi>

The ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al spirit of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining sins in the external Court, though not in a conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal way, is due to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as to the teaching El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> 
                  <hi>application in the external Court of Christs Church:</hi> but believers as believers, and as visible Saints confederate, have no such pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er judiciall formally, or effectively. Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> prove this, and it shall be seen there it sticks, <hi>hic haeret ei aqua:</hi> nor is it deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ruling Elders have the same power of the Keys formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as touching the judicial application of the word preached in the external Court: For the whole Court, Teachers and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, do formally, in a judicial way, apply to the conscience of the incestuous Corinthian his sin, thus; <hi>Thou by name hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted incest, we, by the formal power and ministerial spirit given to us by Christ, deliver thee to Satan, &amp;c.</hi> All have alike formal and effective, and so causal influence in this sentence. 2. I also thus frame the Argument:</p>
               <p>To whatsoever society Christ hath given the Keys, to some of that society he hath given the spirit to remit and to retain sin by way of concional preaching the Gospel, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 21, 22. <hi>Matth. 28. 20. Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. for there is a binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing chiefly in the preached Word, and to all of them he hath given a formal power of binding and loosing in the Court of Christ, conjoyned with the former binding, and not to be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it. Give us in the word Excommunication separated
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:58837:163"/>
from the preaching of the Word. But Christ hath given no power judicial of this kinde to excommunicate all the officers, to ordain all the officers, to the society of brethren destitute of Pastors. And give us leave to keep this ground of vantage, we can produce Scripture for this practise, that the Elders laid on hands, and ordained Elders, <hi>Act. 6. 6. 1 Tim. 4. 14. &amp; 5. 22. 2 Tim. 2. 2. Tit.</hi> 1. 5. Let our Brethren shew, where the male-Church of onely unofficed brethren did the like, and give pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or promise, and we are silent.</p>
               <p>We may justly ask, By what power unofficed men may make <note place="margin">The male-Churches or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ. Pag. 202. Pauls Presbyt. c. 1. p. 10.</note> officers; there must be an institution for this, and its hard to prove positive institutions by far off consequences.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Ruling Elders do not effectually</hi> (he should say effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I do, which is a far other term) <hi>apply the word in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Court: why? because the application of the word thus dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, implies that it is issued and ended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If the meaning be, the Sermon is closed and done, and <note place="margin">Its childish to say, because a Sermon is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before the censure be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no application of the word made to the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the incestuous man repents not, therefore all place for judicial application of the Word to the conscience of the scandalous man in the Court of Discipline, is ended: How weak and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is such a consequence? except we say that the whole Court of Teachers and Elders do not apply medicinally to the man in the externall Court the Word preached; which to say, were to destroy all Church-discipline.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. There is a Iudicial power in making application of the word preached by any of the members who have power to admonish judicially.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That is to beg the question: for none have power to admonish judicially as the Church, but the officers, and those that are stewards, who bear the Keyes; otherwise women have power to apply the Word, and to rebuke, and to exhort.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This contradicts the former just now spoken. The Elders cannot <hi>effectively</hi> apply in the Court the Word preached; why? the <hi>Word dispensed and preached is ended:</hi> But here every member may judicially apply out of the Court, though the Word dispensed be ended.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Mr. <hi>R.</hi> Arg. 4. <hi>The government of the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in officers, their number, their dispensed censures of binding

and loosing without any power of the keyes in the people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is superfluous; yea, if the believers have power there alone to excommunicate all the officers, as Mr.</hi> H. <hi>saith, the Elders in governing must be as superfluous as the sixth finger in the hand.</hi> Ans. <hi>Though the people have power of judging, yet they have not power of office, which is necessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Power of office is necessary to the preaching of the <note place="margin">Officers are superfluous in dispensing censure, by M.

I hope Mr. <hi>H.</hi> questions not the necessity of a standing Ministery to the end; but since officers are created, and all the officers may be excommunicated by the onely bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as Mr <hi>H.</hi> saith, contrary to Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> and the Word (now ordaining of pastors, and excommunicating of them are the highest acts of Rule) then the Elders are as superfluous as the sixth finger to the hand, in the highest point of Ruling, and officers must be onely necessary <hi>ad bene ess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>M. <hi>H. Mr.</hi> R. Arg. 5. <hi>The multitude of believers must have this power either from heaven or from men; if from heaven, either from the Law of Nature, or a positive Law of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. There is a positive Institution,</hi> Mat. 18. Mat. 16. <hi>Mr.</hi> R. <hi>saith, God hath not made all Rulers, and have left none over other in the Lord.</hi> Ans. <hi>To have the power of the Keyes is one thing, and to be Rulers another.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> grapples with my Arguments by two's, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers them all with a begging of the Conclusion. Its good that these two onely places, which are sometimes expounded of the <note place="margin">Way of the Churches, c. 1. sect. 1. prop. 1. p. 1, 2. Survey, ch. 10. arg. 5. p. 133.</note> Church of believers meeting in one place for the Ordinances, and that includes all Saints visible male and female, as your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline; sometimes Mr. <hi>H.</hi> expounds <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>the Church,</hi> firstly, as it is an integral body of both people and Elders; and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:58837:164"/>
3. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> takes it for the Church of the Redeemed, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends that Mr. <hi>Rall</hi> and Mr. <hi>R.</hi> takes <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. for the <hi>governing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Survey, ch. 11. par. 1. p. 186. Mr. H. takes the word <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> Matth. 18. &amp; 16. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Saints, male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male. 2. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the Church of Elders. And 3. here, for the male-Church without officers and women, and other visible Saints.</note> 
                  <hi>Church.</hi> Now 4. here the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of the word <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. &amp; 16. must not onely he the male-Church of selected brethren; so doth the sick man love to change his bed. Now <hi>Ted the Church,</hi> must be, <hi>Tell the male-Church, Mat.</hi> 18. which is built on a Rock, against which the gates of Hell shall not prevail; as if there were no fixedness on the Rock for women, aged children, and believing servants, but they must all turn Apostates, and onely the male-Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. persevere in grace, and dwell finally upon the Rock.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To have the Keyes, and to be Rulers, are so one thing to us, as twice three and six are one thing. And its a wide mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to say, that members covenanting are to submit to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, in a Church-way, judge one another, by rebuking, <note place="margin">Members judg and censure, &amp; excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet they bear not rule over one another, as M.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this is to distinguish between <hi>Isaac</hi> and the son of <hi>Abraham.</hi> 2. Do not women covenant to gain the younger women in their way, by rebuking, by <hi>Mat. 18. 15. Lov. 19. 17. 1 Sam. 25. 25, 26, 27. Tit.</hi> 2. 3, 4. both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? and do they for that rule, as the male-Church? and by what Oracle? am I not to rebuke a trespassing offender of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other congregation dwelling within twenty cubits to my door, and being my beloved brother in Christ? are not the brethren <note place="margin">If all be rulers mutually one to another, as M. H. must say that word, <hi>obey them that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you in the Lord,</hi> must be spoken only to women and children.</note> both rulers and ruled, both the stewards using the Keyes, and members of the house, both shepherds and flock; and what sense can that have? <hi>Obey them that are over you in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Thess. 5. 12. Heb. 13. 17. except it be a speech to onely wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children, and servants, whereas he wrices to all, and directs such exhortations to all, except to officers, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Divines whoever before our brethren so expounded Scripture; yea, he should have said, <hi>Obey one another, for ye are all over one another in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The comparison of Major and Aldermen halts, except
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:58837:165"/>
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> say, the Citizens have power of ruling authoritatively over, and to depose from office both Major and Aldermen, if delinquents.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. There is a peculiar office-power in the officers that is not in the flock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> In order to preaching there is, but in order to juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ruling there is none at all; and so the eighth Argument stands untouched.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> The 6 and 11 Arg. of Mr. <hi>R. If the power of the Keys be given to believers as believers under that reduplication, then all believing men and women and children have authority over the congregation, for</hi> à quatenus ad omne valet consequentia, <hi>and all should be pastors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>Its strange that Mr.</hi> R. <hi>so often acknowledges, that we require onely charitable Saintship in members, yet he frequently supposeth that we require sincerity: 2. The believers as believers scattered, are not the first subject, but as covenanting and fitly capable, and counted so; which women are not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To this I before answered: Nor is it strange that I should charge real contradictions, which by good consequence follow, upon my Adversaries repugnant principles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The question is now, What is the first subject of the power of the Keys? but whether the place <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. proves (as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith) that the first subject is not believers as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, but believers with three limitations. 1. <hi>As visible to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious charity. 2. As covenanting Church-wise. 3. As capable to Rule,</hi> excluding women and children: but all the three are forgedly added to the Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. The first is added; for <hi>Peter</hi> in this confession represents not Saints as visibly to mens account, but real Saints. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Christ pronounces <hi>Peter,</hi> and all that confess truly and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Peter</hi> was not visibly blessed, as <hi>Magus,</hi> Mat. 16. nor did he represent hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites like <hi>Iudas,</hi> who are M. H. his saints and make the same confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </note> really (though visibly, for these are not here supposed) Christ to be the Son of the <hi>living God,</hi> really and truly blessed, as <hi>Peter,</hi> whose heart the Lord saw. But <hi>Peter</hi> is not blessed, nor all whom he represents blessed, by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his way, and by his wresting of the Text onely in a visible way, as <hi>Iudas,</hi> who might give the same consession with other rotten hypocrites, and not be blessed, but cursed.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:58837:165"/>
2. All who give this confession, as <hi>Peter,</hi> have received the Spirit of revelation from the Father, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch is neither visible nor audible, but is as <hi>the hidden Manna,</hi> known to the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and to God onely.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All that so confessed, are really upon the matter differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from all the false Religions and Sects, of which, some said <hi>Christ was Iohn Baptist;</hi> some, that he was <hi>Elias,</hi> &amp;c. as is clear otherwayes, if Christ speak of a visible confession, which <hi>Magus</hi> and other Church members like him may give; the so confessors were no more blessed, than the wretched <hi>Herodians,</hi> who said Christ was <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> risen from the dead, and denied him to be the Son of the living God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The so visible confessors are the Church, whom <hi>Christ builds on the Rock,</hi> that shall prevail against all temptations of Hell, and be saved, but such are the really and eternally saved onely, not the so built on the Rock, as <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Magus</hi> were, and therefore that is but sand, not a rock, which is given to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in charity combined, and who <hi>are counted fit by Christ and capable, which women, children, deaf and dumb are not.</hi> So Mr. <hi>H.</hi> doth make the Text or our Saviour say, <hi>I charitably judge</hi> Peter, <hi>and</hi> Judas, <hi>and</hi> Magus <hi>are blessed, are built upon the Rock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The other two limitations are as blasphemous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">M. H. deprives all women &amp; believing children of age of all comfort from confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Christ as <hi>Peter</hi> did, and of being built on the Rock, because they are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Keyes.</note> to the scope of the Text: for our Saviours scope is to furnish solid consolations of sound faith not to <hi>Peter</hi> onely, not to seeming believers onely, not to Church-members onely as such, but to all persons who renounce false Religions, such as <hi>Heredians</hi> were, and others, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. men and women, <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and others, who by this very Scripture do really, and with the reality of saving faith, from the Spirit of the Father of Christ, confess Jesus to be the living God, as <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. And I appeal to the consciences of our brethren (I say not any thing to those that are asleep in the Lord) whether <hi>Magdalen</hi> and others should in sincerity confess, that Christ is the Son of the living God, and had received the anointing, and had received no Keyes, no visible membership like to what they say, may not as well claim to this place and blessedness as <hi>Peter.</hi> And if Christ should answer them, <hi>Ye women, who by the Spirit of the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58837:166"/>
Father of Christ confess me to be the Son of the living God, and for that suffer death from</hi> Herod <hi>and other persecutors, are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; but ye have no right to real blessing by</hi> Mat. 16. 15, 16, 17, &amp;c. <hi>for I count you women not capable of the Keys.</hi> O what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting <note place="margin">Mr. H. gives to none the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the faith, joy of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, peace, con solation in the like confession of <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 16. but only in &amp; through vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of a single congregation, which is as due to Magus the forcerer, as to all real belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Pag. 104.</note> of the Word of God is this! Surely Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in his Parallels hath more reason for him to prove that women share of the honour of the Keyes as well as men, from <hi>Mat</hi> 18. and <hi>Mat</hi> 16. But of this hereafter. Shew me a place in all the Scripture where Christ saith, <hi>I give the Keys to the Church of Redeemed ones.</hi> 2.

                  <p>The rest of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> his Arguments proving that the Male-Church of onely unofficed Brethren have no power of the Keyes, are delivered from the unsatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Replies of Mr. <hi>T. H.</hi>

                  <hi>have received the anointing, can discern the voice of Christ and follow him, are able to choose to themselves Pastors, as being able to relish the savour of spiritual administrations, and to feel what key will best open their lock, can see and discern what courses be sinful and scandalous, persons obstinate and pertinacious therein, therefore they may choose and reject officers—They need not the tongue of the learned, they are reproved for careless watching, in not purging out the incestuous man,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. My Argument is mangled. And whereas I, with the Word, say, If the male-Church be Rulers, Watchmen, the onely men appointed to rule, make and unmake officers, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. <note place="margin">The Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and to <hi>Titus</hi> must, by Mr. H. h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whether the crime of usurping be theirs, and not the Prophets, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23. and yet they are the onely feeders, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Judges of all to the highest censure of Excommunication.

                  <note place="margin">The spiritual qualifications for calling of Ministers, as Mr. H. descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth them, as being able to relish the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern &amp; know the voice of Christ &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, &amp;c. are given to women and to all.</note> 
                  <hi>what key will open the heart,</hi> to some few male-believers: 1. Aged; 2. Incorporate, so and so. But I retort it thus: To whom Christ hath given the onely qualifications spiritual of Rulers endued with power of judging, those hath he called according to the rule of the Gospel to be such Rulers, and they must dig their Lords talents in the earth, if they improve them not for that end. But the Lord hath given to all Beleevers as Beleevers of the same or of another flock, whether in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches this way, or not, to women, as to males, in some measure, the anointing grace to know Christs voice. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it be observed, that the tongue of the learned, <hi>Esay</hi> 50. of which <hi>Mr. R.</hi> spoke, to absolve and open heaven to a man swallowed up with griefe, and a gift of a son of thunder, to shut the gates of heaven against the obstinate, and such as are to be delivered to <hi>Sathan,</hi> are not required in the exercise of the keys of the Kingdome, but onely such gifts as are in women; is this a good frame of Church discipline?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. God gives to men no calling to a place, but he gives</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> My Argument is mistaken. If there be Rules in the <note place="margin">The argument of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> that there be no rules in the Word how the male-Church should rule &amp; judge, <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is no such judging Church, stands unanswered. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his way overturns the Ministry.</note> Word how Officers should acquit themselves, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, &amp;c. how Judges, Kings, &amp;c. so ought there to be Rules how unof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed brethren, the onely Judges, (for Church-officers do but order and regulate judging, as our Brethren say) should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves. But this is not by our Brethrens way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reader may observe all along, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and his way lays the Ax to the root of the Ministery; for he ascribeth the Church acts of office, of opening and shutting heaven, of the learned Tongue, of Excommunicating, &amp;c. to unofficed men; or then he denies that there is any necessity of such in judging, and ascribes such acts and qualifications as are in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to their judging Church; the very way of Anabaptists and rigid Separatists.</p>

               <p>The edifying one of another, and comforting one another, and withdrawing from dividers, are acts of love required of men, women, and of Christians of all ranks, and by no word tied to those of the same single congregation, but to all the Catholick Church; should not women withdraw from dividers? and therefore these places, 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 11. 2 Thess. 3. Rom.</hi> 16. are abused.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Ambrose, Theophylact, Oecumenius, Paraphrastes, Beza, Calvin, Marlorat,</hi> nor any Interpreter dreamed the place <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. was meant of unofficed brethren, who watch and must <note place="margin">Ch. 11. p. 191.

Mr. <hi>H The prwer of the Keys is larger then the power of office, and therefore the Lord requires not so much abilities in the brethren as in the Officers.</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The difference is said, not proved.</p>

them to continue in the faith, so they should have commanded them to use that radical power, to create officers and not have encroached upon their power of the Keys.</p>

Heb.</hi> 3. 13. by women and children of age we deny not, but a Church edifying without Pastors, or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the body without officers, <hi>Eph. 4. 11, 12. 1 Cor. 12. 12, 13, &amp; 28. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 4, 12. we find not. (2) Your male-Church edifying without Pastors, must also edifie as an organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> tell how <hi>God giveth breath to them that walk on the Earth,</hi> Isa. 42. 5. Was there breath before there was a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">The Church is no politick Church before they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</note> man walking on the earth, or was there a living man walking on the earth, before there was breathing?

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:58837:169"/>
to the faith and baptized. <hi>Noah</hi> before the Vineyard, which he dressed, God planted Apostles and Teachers, even in the organical politick Church, before it was a politick organical Church; for by setting Organs in the body, he made it an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical body; but it is a senseless inference, <hi>Ergo,</hi> these Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, who are both Organs and Fathers, and causes procreant of the Church, had no being before the politick Church had being; for natural organs in a physical body are only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, but not causes of the natural body, but politick organs may be both, and in this case are both.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. To these are the Keys promised, who are Stewards of the mysteries of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1. <hi>servants of his house,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 5.</p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>The Servants are Pastors and Teachers in these places, then the ruling Elder shall bear no Key.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Yet the conclusion is strong against the unofficed bearers.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>The Assumption is denied, for the Church to whom the Keys are firstly given, though they have a virtual power to call men to office, yet they have not formally official power; nor is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial power, which in great Apostasies may fail, of like stability with the visible Church, which can never totally fail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> My Argument is not faithfully repeated (of which I often complain) if the Ministerial formal power of ruling, and creating and unmaking of officers (a virtual power of which he of new speaks, I know not, for who hath the formal power
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:58837:173"/>
of calling officers then?) be given to believers, though desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Pastors, because believers are in a congregational frame <note place="margin">If to be built upon the Rock be to be built in a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church-frame, then the gates of Hell cannot prevail against the office, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible frame of congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Some of our Divines make the Church of believers, men and women, the virtual subject of the Keys, and of all Church-power. But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> maketh them more than a virtual subject, for he must make the formal calling and creating of officers, and excommunicating of them, and so preaching, as was the Apostle <hi>Peters</hi> case, Act. 1. 15. and the Prophets, Act. 13, 3. who prayed and laid on hands on <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and sent them as Apostles to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, a formal act of the Church of Redeemed ones, men and women, servants and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for which we have no Scripture, and as little Reason, for we may so say the Flint formally makes fire. Hist. Magdeb. Vol. 1. Cen. 1. l. 1. c. 4. p. 138.</note> built upon the Rock, nothing hindreth but ministerial power, that is the power of the Keys given to believers, which is but a gift given to hypocrites often, should be as firm as though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers were built on a rock. Mr. <hi>H</hi> denieth the Assumption onely, and seems to yield the Proposition. I appeal to the Reader, if these words, <hi>I will build my Church</hi> (in the frame of a Congregation Independent) <hi>upon the Rock Christ,</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of <hi>Peter,</hi> have any such sense; for in all Scripture the building upon the rock hath no such sense, but noteth Christs building of real believers on himself in the most holy faith, which building cannot sail. And whereas Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, <hi>The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church cannot totally fail,</hi> as our Divines say, they mean the Catholick visible Church, and not your Independent congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of which they knew nothing who teach this Doctrine. So this Argument of mine stands. Promises of never falling are made in Scripture to things, not to persons, as to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to the Gospel, to the Dominion of Christ, <hi>Psal. 72. 8. Isa. 9. 7. Luke 1. 33. Isa. 55. 11. Psal. 110. 2. Mat. 24. 14, &amp;c.</hi> but ever in order to persons, especially to that excellentest of persons: But of temptations to offices, and institutions and promises to such, as here, we reade not.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Those to whom (saith Mr.</hi> R.) <hi>Christ giveth the Keyes, do represent the person of Christ, and who despiseth them, despiseth Christ, and who honour them, honour Christ,</hi> Mat. 10. 40. <hi>Now Scripture never saith so of believers, They that hear and obey believers, hear and obey me.</hi> Ans. <hi>The Proposition is false, to represent Christ as stewards, belongs onely to them who have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice power; but the Spouse had power in the family before the stewards and officers were.</hi>

                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:58837:173"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Yet that must be meant of believers, men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <note place="margin">Those who bear the Keys represent Christ as sent by him. But this do not the male-Church.</note> He that despiseth the preaching male Church, despiseth me.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Those to whom the Keys are given (saith Mr.</hi> R.) <hi>do authoritatively forgive and retain sins: The fraternity (saith Mr.</hi> H.) <hi>forgives judicially,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. <hi>the officers authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</hi>

               <p>BEfore I examine Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Reasons, take notice of what <note place="margin">Chap. 11. pro. 2. p. 215.</note> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, which may conduce to this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Keys and power (saith Mr.</hi> H.) <hi>must be given to a single society,</hi> i. e. <hi>to a sort and condition of men under some special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, To thee will I give, &amp;c. as to a single society, not to them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That the Keys must be given to a single; that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his sense, to a single Independent congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely, that they may exercise Jurisdiction onely within themselves, and that all others, though as free Churches as it, are <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. His Argument, <hi>Because it is said, To thee, as a single so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi>

                  <hi>not to them,</hi> is naught: Did not the Lord give, in <hi>Peter,</hi> the Keys to the twelve Apostles, and to six or ten sundry socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> but they were one Church; so the combined Elders in a Presbytery is but one single society: yea but saith he, they are many Churches. <hi>Ans.</hi> They are, and may be but four societies meeting in four sundry places, and scarce all eight

hundred, and therefore a more single society than eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and above, which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith made but one congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> And is not the society of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod Provincial or National, one single society also by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let the Reader judge how our brethren use the word <note place="margin">Way of the Churches of Ch. m. in N. E. c. 1 sect. 1. pro. 1. p. 1. 2.</note>

               <p n="2">2. In an active sense, its false, that to women, understanding children, the dispensing of Censures, Seals and Tables are committed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The power of the Keys are not committed to the Church instituted, as to the proper subject, but onely by those pious Authors, to a limb or wing of it, the male redeemed are never called, <hi>The instituted Church of the New Testament.</hi>

               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="6">6. Nor is it either didactick or suitable to a Systeme of Church-policy, <hi>That the administration of all Christs publick Worship and Ordinances, is committed to a company of believers,</hi> for the active administration of Baptism and the Lords Supper,

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. What is meant by the Catholick and visible Church, I cannot know by Mr.</hi> R.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. To what principal subject hath the Lord</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>R.) given reason, and the faculty of discoursing? Is it to</hi> Peter <hi>or</hi> John? <hi>No, its for and to the race of mankinde,</hi> Lib. 2. p. 291.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. We say a congregation of visible Saints covenanting to walk in the Ordinances of the Gospel is the prime and original</hi>

                  <hi>To that Church which Christ principally intends to bring to the unity of the faith, Christ hath given the power of the Keyes, as to the first subject.

               <p>It is 2. taken more largely, as the Catholick visible body comprehends all that hear, and profess subjection to the Gospel, elect and reprobate, and the Lord gives a ministry, seals, and visible membership to all, and every one of this body; to <hi>Esan,</hi> to <hi>Iacob,</hi> to <hi>Iudas</hi> the traitor, as to <hi>Peter</hi> a beleever, not to bring all and every one of them to the <hi>unity of faith, and to the acknowledgement of the Son of God,</hi> but for other unlike ends, <hi>finibus disparibus,</hi> to save some, to make others inexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Christs act of building is either absolute or conditional: if absolute, then saith Christ, <hi>I inchurch you upon the Rock, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye believe or believe not;</hi> but Scripture never tells us of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>

Then must the real holiness of officers be known to <hi>Timothy</hi> and to <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4.

               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>H. We have dispatched the first member of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Survey, par. 1. c. 13. p. 229, 230.</note> 
                  <hi>That the power of the Keys doth not appertain to the Guides of the visible Church; take it as</hi> totum genericum, <hi>or</hi> universale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The first member is so dispatched, as the power of the Keys is by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> dispatched and banished out of its due seat and subject, and lodged in the congregation of redeemed visible Saints, sometimes onely unofficed Brethren, sometimes the Church of visible Saints, confederate men and women.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No man of ours (let him be named, if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> or any for him can name him) ever said, <hi>that the Keys appertain to the guides of the visible Church, taken as</hi> totum genericum &amp; universale. For the Guides of the visible Church is, to all our Divines, the Guides of the Catholick Universal Church, made up as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Body of all Churches, National, Provincial, Presbyterial and Congregational all the earth over.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. There be two things, wherein stand the qualifications of members that are Commissioners: 1. Gifts and fitness. 2. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation, which is the</hi> formale, <hi>as that they are sent by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The Churches, if they follow the pattern, must send, beside Pastors, Teachers and Elders, learned and holy men, that may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonate and represent the whole Church. This is made the hinge and casting difference betwixt us and Papists, whereby our men vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> How can Mr. <hi>H.</hi> speak of a pattern of Oecumenick <note place="margin">The unofficed Brethren are not by our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines those that have a decisive voice in Councels.

Mr. <hi>H.</hi> cannot name the man of our Divines, except Separatists, who draw nigher to Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians and Arminians in these points, than to our Divines, who 1. Ever taught, that the male-Churches of a congregation, are the onely Churches who send Commissioners to an Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick Councel? which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith hath neither warrant in Scripture nor in Antiquity for 300 years after Christ. 2. The controversie between Papists and our men, was, Whether onely Bishops <hi>soli Praelati,</hi> say <hi>Whittaker, Willet, Professors of Leyden, Calvin, Bucanus, Tilenus, Windelin,</hi> have a decisive voice, and ought not also Pastors, Doctors, Elders learned and holy, to have a decisive voice in Synods? And whether the people should be excluded from debating, reasoning, consenting; for Papists debar Laicks as profane, and say, <hi>If such Beasts touch the Mountain,</hi> and meddle with holy things, they are to be <hi>thrust through with a dart.</hi> But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his <hi>hinge of a question</hi> is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely unofficed Brethren, members of the male congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are the onely members of an Oecumenick Councel, or with them officers, but as sent by those male-societies, otherwise they want the essential form of members, according to our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines judgement? He is a great stranger in the Writings of our Divines, who so guesseth at a new question, though I judge Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath read them diligently. See what the Jesuits of <hi>Rhemes, Bellarmine, Cornel. à Lap. Lorinus</hi> and others, if ever they dream of such a <hi>hinge of a controversie.</hi>

                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:58837:192"/>
M. <hi>H. The representative body is but a part of the Catholick Church, not the whole of it, and represents the whole—what the commissioners do by their delegation, it is all one, as if the body did it; the Keys cannot then be firstly in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is a mistake wide enough, there is a twofold repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Apostles in receiving the Keys, <hi>Matth. 16. Iohn 20, Matth.</hi> 28. represented all officers, even those not born, but they had no commission from unborn men. And so <hi>August. Serm. 13. de verbis domini. Chrysost. homil.</hi> 55. in <hi>Matth. 16. Hieronym. l. 1. contra. Iovian.</hi> and our Divines, <hi>Calvin, Pareus, Luther, Melancthon, Willet, &amp;c.</hi> say, that the Keyes in <hi>Peter,</hi> who represented all the Apostles and faithful Pastors, were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all Ministers. Now if Mr. <hi>R.</hi> say that the Keyes were given first to this representative body Apostolick, let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> or any man beat him with strong arguments, and that is a good revenge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. These whom the Churches, (not the male-congregations, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith) send as Commissioners to a Synod, are not to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> Key. Two sorts of Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered by, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners neither carry the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples conscience to the Synod, not does their Commission give them a new office.</note> upon.</p>
               <p>As 1. If the <hi>Churches were resolved aforehand how far they will follow them; for why then</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Cotton) do they send to the Synod for light and counsel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither as if they were sent to carry the faith and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to the Synod, and the people in and through them did teach <hi>Synodicè,</hi> and the people must follow their determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be it right or wrong. And so it is a wide mistake, to say what <hi>Delegates do or say, it is all one, or the like reason</hi> (saith Mr. H.) <hi>as if the Represented did, or said it.</hi> For if the Synod say the Gospel is not the word of God, the Church did not say either <hi>personally</hi> (for that is impossible) or <hi>legally</hi> the same: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Churches send them to pray &amp; enquire the mind of God
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:58837:192"/>
from his word, and engage they shall follow them, in as far as they follow Christ.</p>
               <p>Nor is delegation the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of determining synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, it is only a necessary condition of determining, and of synodical judging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But Mr. <hi>R. saith Amen to this distinction of Mr.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> True; these two, fitness and gifts, together with a commission, make a man a commissioner and messenger of the Church; but delegation makes him not a formal Definer and a Judge: nor do the Churches send them as officers, but as such eminently able and faithful men, who have hazarded their lives for the cause, as <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 25. and they determine as such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently holy and able officers; their delegation is a thing of meer order, because all cannot be sent, nor doth it create them of new officers, nor yet such eminent officers, for they were both these before, only their delegation puts them in an actual or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly capacity to determine formally, <hi>Ut approximatio ligni aridi ad ignem non est formalis ratio comburendi.</hi>

Yea, This special power of the Keyes is but a part, or a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind and species of the power of the Keyes in some rare and extraordinary things that belong to the Catholick Church. But we are now disputing of the first seat and subject of the power of the Keyes in general, in the latitude of binding and loosing, opening and shutting the gates of heaven by preaching and censures. And I deny expresly that an Oecumenick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel is the first subject of the power of the Keyes in this general. And so Mr. <hi>H.</hi> fights with a shadow. <hi>Non concludit negatum.</hi> So my Simile is never touched by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> as <hi>pag. 305. The light is first in the whole body of the Sun, as the first and prime subject of light; yet supposing now the received opinion of Astronomers, that the Sun doth exceed the quantity of the Earth 167, it doth not follow, that this or that part of the Sun hath no light in it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal, but that which is derived from the whole body of the Sun, for then this or that part of the Sun should have light derived to it (extrinsecally) from some other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the power of the Keys is in the whole Catholick Body of Apostles, Pastors, Doctors, Elders, all the world over, as they act respectively in Congregations, Presbyteries and Synods of all sorts, so that one part of the Catholick integral body of the Catholick Church, for example, hath not that power of the Keys due to them, derived from the Presbytery to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Eldership, or from the Synod derived to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and so forth, by either ascending or descending: But when Christ gave the whole power of the Keys to the body of the Apostles, <hi>Mat. 28. 19. &amp; 16. 19. Ioh. 20. 21, 22, 23 Mar.</hi> 16. 15. they were the Body Representative (I never call them an Oecumenick Councel) and did immediately represent any Apostles to be chosen, <hi>Matthias, Paul, Evangelists, Pastors, Doctors, Elders,</hi> that were to be, even to the second coming of Christ, and he promiseth his Ministerial Spiritual presence to them all immediately, <hi>Mat. 28. 20 Go teach and baptize—lo, I am with you always,</hi> (administring Word, Seals, Censures, according to the Rule) <hi>even to the end of the world.</hi> Now the Apostles were not to live preaching and baptizing <hi>to the end of the world,</hi> therefore the promise must be made to them all, though not yet born. Now we reade not of deriving of any
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:58837:195"/>
power to Synods, Presbyteries, Congregations, by mediation of Churches, for Christ instituted Synods, <hi>Mat. 28. 16. Act. 1. 12, 13, 14, &amp;c. &amp; 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. &amp; 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. &amp; 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c.</hi> and that immediately he instituted Presbyterial Churches, <hi>Act. 2. &amp; 4. 9. &amp;</hi> 5. 21, 42. and Churches congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational to meet in one place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 17. And as one part of the Element of water (suppose we make 24 parts of all) hath not natural moistness and cold from the other 20 parts, but hath it as intrinsecally, without the intervening influence of the other twenty three parts, as they have: So the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and Congregational Eldership have as primarily, intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, immediately in their sphere and orb the Keys due to them, according to the proportion of the associated body, as the whole integral-Catholick Presbytery and Church hath, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an Oecumenick Councel, or out of it.</p>
               <p>It is then a wide mistake in Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to tell us, If <hi>an Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Councel be the first subject of the Keys,</hi> (as it is not) <hi>that there can be no act of power in ordaining of Ministers, in excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of delinquents, but by vertue of an Oecumenical Councel gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their influence first to that work.</hi> For if the meaning be (as it must be) that a General Councel must prove an act, and put forth some actual Mandate, commanding such a man to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained an officer, such a delinquent to be excommunicate, else the Churches cannot proceed: for to take Mr <hi>H.</hi> his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, <hi>Richard</hi> or <hi>Ioshua</hi> cannot be a man, or apt to laugh, except the abstract nature of man give in his influence to the work. And since Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and his Brethren make the male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation <note place="margin">M. H. Survey, par. 1. c. 11. p. 186. Way of the Churches, c. 1. sect. 1. pro. 3. M. <hi>Cotton</hi> keys. c. 7. p. 31.</note> abstracted from this or that congregation, the first formal subject of the whole power of the Keys, what <hi>influence</hi> (I ask) doth the so abstract congregation give to the work of Ordination and Excommunication in a particular congregation? Abstracted natures do not send abroad mandates to all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations all the world over, before they can ordain, censure, or excommunicate. If it be said, this agrees to the nature of a congregation in general to ordain and excommunicate, but there needs no other actual influence of a command to come from the congregation in general to this individual congregation for their using of the Keys. True, there needs not, by the like,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:58837:196"/>
that any mandate pass from the Oecumenick Councel in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to this or that individual Oecumenick Councel in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of its Synodical acts.</p>
               <p>But (saith Mr. <hi>H.) if the Oecumenick Councel be the first formal subject of the power of the Keys, then inferiour Courts cannot ordain nor excommunicate without a warrant, and actual command from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is feeble: for beside that the Oecumenick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel <note place="margin">Inferior courts may use the keys without any influence of a command from a general Councel.</note> is not at all any such formal first subject, as is said, its a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty consequence; for though power of life and death be in King and Parliament as in the first subject, it follows not that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Judge or free City cannot put to death notorious Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Murtherers all <hi>England</hi> over, without the influence of some actual Mandate from King and Parliament to the putting to death of every Traitor. So when Christ gave power of Word, Seals and Censures to the Apostles, as representing all officers, (say we) or as representing all believers (saith Mr. <hi>H.)</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that officers and the male-Church cannot administer Word, Seals, Censures, without the influence of a new actual command from the Apostles, who did represent all such to whom Jesus Christ gave the Keyes, by this arguing of Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor does Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his first deduction follow, that if a General Councel be such a subject (as it is not) that <hi>therefore the exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Though a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>of such a Councel is as necessary as the well-being of the Church.</hi> For a Parliamentary power is necessary for <hi>England,</hi> yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by war, and other invincible impediments, a Parliament could not meet for divers years, yet neither power nor exercise of Justice do cease. So here Synodical power may be, and by the care of the Lord of his House, is continued in lesser As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, though such Councels exist not. But 2. the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent being true, the Consequence is null.</p>
               <p>Nor is the power of the Keyes in its latitude, as is said, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>firstly</hi> or <hi>onely,</hi> and so not <hi>perfectly</hi> in this Councel, but firstly and intrinsecally in the whole integral Presbytery all the earth over.</p>
               <p>Nor is it necessary that this General Councel, though it were <hi>the first subject of the Keys,</hi> always attain <hi>all its end in the use of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:58837:196"/>
the Keyes.</hi> For the male-Church void of Pastors cannot attain all its end, to wit, the pastoral preaching, the dogmatick and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial sentencing of delinquents, the right tendring of the seals, yet is the male-Church the onely formal subject of this power to Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>R.</hi> said well, that <hi>a General Councel can hardly excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hardly can a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church.</note> 
                  <hi>a whole National Church:</hi> for it could hardly be known to them, but many are not obstinate in the National Heresie and Scandal, who through weakness and fear of persecution dare not confess. And its enough that a National Church may be declared to be no Church: as <hi>Moses</hi> removed the Tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 7. and <hi>Paul</hi> turned away from the blaspheming Jews <hi>Acts.</hi> 13. 45, 46. and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other is the excommunicating of a National Church, for the word of the Covenant remained in the Nation of the Jews, after <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> turned from them, and preached to the Gentiles, <hi>Iam. 1. 1.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. To the Ministery and Catholick Guides of that visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, hath Christ committed the Keys as the first subject, to the which he hath given his Word, Ordinances, Sacraments, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery primarily. This is Mr.</hi> R. <hi>his</hi> in terminis <hi>determinate conclusion beyond all gainsaying. But to the Oecumenick Councel, as the Representative of all Churches, God hath not primarily given his Ministery, Word, Sacraments, Ordinances; then an Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Representive Church hath not the Keys given to it as to the first subject. The Assumption onely needs proof. 1. There was no such Councel for 300 years after Christ. 2. Councels consist pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily of Pastors and Elders; then must Ministers be sent to feed Ministers. 3. Word and Seals are not primarily attended in Councels, but scanning of controversies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I complain of unfaithful repeating of my words. The title is not of Oecumenick Councels, but chap. 10. sect. 10. pag. 289. <hi>Of the communion of the visible catholick Church. To the Proposition I answer; To the Ministery and Guides of that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick visible Church hath Christ committed the Keys, as to the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:58837:197"/>
first subject, unto which he hath given his Word, Ordinances, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Ministery primarily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This neither is conclusion nor principle of mine, but a same <note place="margin">Mr. H. sorc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>To this Church catholick visible hath the Lord given a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and all his Ordinances of Word and Sacraments principally and primarily, and to the Ministery and Guides of this Catholick Church visible hath the Lord committed the Keyes as to the first subject, and for the visible Church catholick, including also the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Church as for the object and end, hath he given his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and the power of his Keys; and the Ministery and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are not given to this or this congregation which meeteth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily in one place.</hi> So the Proposition which I own from these words, must be this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the Church catholick visible as to the first subject primarily, and as for the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d given all his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Word, Sacraments, Ministery.</hi> This is mine <hi>in terminis.</hi> And this also: <hi>To the Guides of this Catholick Church, not of a single congregation, hath the Lord committed the Keys as to the first formal subject, but for the Church catholick visible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, as for the end and object, that they may be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. H, his proposition is not mine, he devised it himself, and its false, gainsaid by Mr. <hi>R.</hi> to wit, <hi>To the Guides of that catholick visible Church hath the Lord committed the Keys as to the first subject, unto which he hath given his Word, Ordinances, Sacraments, Ministery primarily.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I know no Guides of any Church on earth, to whom the Lord hath given the Seals primarily, for God hath given the Seals primarily to his chosen people, to the Guides secondarily, as they are visible Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I know no Ministers of any Church to whom the Lord hath given the Ministery primarily: its a sensless saying.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I refer it to the Reader, if such a sensless proposition can be drawn from my words. The Catholick visible Church is neither the subject, nor first subject, but the object and end for which the Keys are given to the Ministers and whole Officers of the Catholick Church visible and invisible. Yea, I demonstrate
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:58837:198"/>
by many Arguments, that believers are not the subject of the Keys. I say indeed, not the visible Church whereof <hi>Magus</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> are members, is the prime subject, but the invisible Church is in the Lords intention such a subject of all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their saving fruits: but then the first subject is all one with the object and end of God in Predestination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Assumption is granted, but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his probations are naught.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There was no General Councels the first 300 years after Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>Simpson,</hi> and other grave Divines say, the Councel <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Simpson,</hi> Cent. 1. c. 1.</note> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Act. 15. is more worthy the name of an Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick Councel, than the Councels of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Such a Councel is not the first subject of the Keys, but onely of the Synodical Keys in such a General Councel, of the Keys Catholick dispensed.</p>

a General Councel were an Ordinance of Christ, the Lord should suit his providence to a peaceable meeting of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in a General Councel.

And should not the Lord have framed the like providence, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christ meet in day-light in congregational assemblies? For as the Lord made a special typical promise, when the males go up thrice a year to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to worship, the Nations were not permitted of God <hi>to desire their land:</hi> So must the like promise of providence suiting with the profession of Christ be in the New Testament, the Heathen Emperours shall not desire your lives.

                  <p>Whether the Congregation as the Congregation doth excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a delinquent? or is it the Catholick visible. Church which excommunicates?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>R.</hi> his meaning is, that the congregation excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth <note place="margin">The Catholick Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates antecedently, when a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates: but the Catholick Church hath not, nor put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth a deliberate act of citing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church act any.</note> not as a congregation, by a power which by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature is first in it self, but by a power which by nature is first in the whole Eldership; but yet not by an act coming from the privity, knowledge and conscience of all the whole Catholick Body of Officers all the world over. And so I grant, that the Catholick visible Church doth not <hi>anteced ntly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,</hi> leading witnesses, and summoning, and accusing, and sentencing the person before the congregation; as when <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> puts a Traitor to death, the State of <hi>England</hi> by the Law common to all <hi>England,</hi> in and by <hi>Norwich</hi> putteth the man to death: Nor doth <hi>Norwich</hi> as a single Corporation (though neither simply as a Representative) but acting as a part of the Body of <hi>England.</hi> And the whole State doth this antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because the City doth this by the same power of Law common to all <hi>England: quae sunt communi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Norwich</hi> puts this Traitor to death, not as an enemy to that single Corporation onely, but as a common enemy to the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The City doth this by an innate power, as an integral part of <hi>England,</hi> for the peace and safety of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: yet doth not the whole Kingdom knowingly exercise an act of deliberate judicial authority in this; for the man is put
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:58837:199"/>
to death without the privity and knowledge of the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>I used the comparison <hi>(to cousen the inconsiderate Reader</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>H.)</hi> I hate cousening) <hi>The left hand cuts off the finger of the right hand lest it infect with a Gangrene the whole body, acted by the natural instinct, and innate desire of self. safety, which is in the whole man.</hi> But (saith Mr. <hi>H.) the chief officers are not at the mind and will, and the other Churches as the whole man: but the rest of the brethren are as the whole man, who have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsical power for the safety of the whole congregation, to cut off an an infectious member.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Nor is the comparison to be strained; I shall onely desire it to be taken as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith. Its true, the left hand doth not cut off the contagious finger, but <hi>the whole man,</hi> deliberate will and reason consenting thereunto; and the finger is cut off, not by the power of the left hand onely, <hi>but the intrinsecal power of the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is so exactly in a particular congregation, <hi>the chief offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as the mind and will, and the rest of the Brethren as the whole, have an intrinsecal power from Christ to remove an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious member.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> They have a power to remove him (saith Mr. <hi>R.</hi> in his <note place="margin">The compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of cutting off an infectious member from the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick visible Church, is strained by M. H.</note> comparison) not from that congregation onely, but from the whole Catholick Body: As the left hand cuts off the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious finger, not from the right hand onely, but from the whole body. It wrongeth Christ to say, he hath given so selfie and narrow a power, to liberate onely a body of 10 or 20 Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent members from the contagion of scandal, but not to free five thousand, and the associate bodies round about: Let them perish, Christ hath given no Organick or Church-care to the congregation toward them all (saith Mr. <hi>H.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The comparison is not exact. When the fraternity excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates all their officers, where is the mind and will then? for they excommunicate their own minde and will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> never meant the comparison should hold in this, That the Catholick Church, as <hi>mind and will,</hi> should put forth acts of deliberate reason—antecedently to cite, accuse, sentence every delinquent in an Oecumenick Councel, or some Catholick
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:58837:200"/>
Judicature, and to excommunicate all Delinquents, before ever the congregation cite them. With divers arguments he refutes an antecedent excommunication, as if I held any such thing. So Mr. <hi>H.</hi> loves to prove strongly what Mr. <hi>R.</hi> never denied.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> speaks nothing to my Argument, if the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n be cast out, and <hi>bound on earth,</hi> he must be bound only on that tract of earth where twenty Independents are.</p>
               <p>But 1. Church binding in heaven, and the guiltiness of the scandal is alike in all places, and often more infectious to others, if it be a taking heresie, then to their own congregation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Who shall perswade that our Saviours sense is so ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered? <hi>Let him be to thee as an heathen,</hi> Mat. 18. 17. <hi>as thee only,</hi> who art a member of the congregation whereof he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; yea, as touching Church binding, neither is he a known guiltless visible Saint to all Churches on earth. It is nothing but a naked evasion to say <hi>he is consequently cut off from right to ordinances in all other congregations, for because one species of corporations hath condemned a man</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>H.</hi> page 236.) <hi>it follows not, that therefore all have condemned him to imprisonment perpetual, or the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Yea, what one City doth in punishing a Malefactor by Law power, common to all <hi>England,</hi> that same all <hi>England</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">He who is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate in one Church is antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in all.</note> doth in law: for twenty Sons have by the same Law and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Fathers right of twenty Tables of twenty Families of the Father. One is for sedition against his Father cast out of one Family, whereof he is a fixed member; the other nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, though they know nothing of the fact, and doe never actually cite him, yet do legally, and by the Law, and the same very wil of the Father, that ruleth them all, cast him antecedently out, or <hi>concomitanter;</hi> or then another Law must appoint the other nineteen Families to cast him out. So the same right <hi>idem numero,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> hath to Christ and Ordinances in one Church, he hath it in all; and that same act of the Keyes administred according to the rule of the Word, in one Church removing that right, removes it from him all the World over.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Visible Saints by this shall not be the same spiritually po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick body, visible, being of divers congregations: contrary to Scripture, expounded by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton, we being many
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:58837:200"/>

                     </gap>. Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence is no excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all.</note> of one bread and body of Christ. Now by this, as a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cut off <hi>Paul,</hi> is not a finger cut off <hi>Iohn,</hi> for <hi>Iohn</hi> hath all his ten fingers entire, and <hi>Paul</hi> hath his nine fingers only: So also if <hi>Thomas</hi> disobedient he cast out of only his own congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, he is never cast out of Church-right to Christ, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in the rest of the congregations; for excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by consequence, is only a declaring by witnesses (as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith pag. 242.) that the man is cast out of his own congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Now the declaring that <hi>Paul's</hi> finger is cut off, is not a cutting off of his finger, that is impossible. Far less is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the declaring that <hi>Paul's</hi> finger is cut off, can be either a declaring that <hi>Peters</hi> finger is cut off, or that that declaring is a cutting off of <hi>Paul's</hi> finger, or a cutting off of <hi>Peters</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Therefore <hi>Peters</hi> being cast one of his own Church-right, and Church only, is no casting of him out of other Churches, or real removing of his Church-right to ordinances in other Churches. For that which was never really removed, and <hi>Peter</hi> once had, it must remain with <hi>Peter</hi> yet: now <hi>Peter</hi> was never a member of any congregation but of one; then mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership to another congregation cannot be taken from him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A member is cast out as really scandalous; his adultery obstinately continued in makes him be deprived of Christian fellowship with Brethren as Brethren: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is deprived of the Christian fellowship of all Brethren. For <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And 5. It is thus confirmed; his visible scandal is a Church-offence to one of a Sister-congregation, and is apt to bring a Church-contagion to these of another congregation, who are <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, one body with him at the Lords Table; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they now to look on him as an Heathen. But who put him in that state, if he be not really and formally cast out <note place="margin">A strange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of that, he that heareth you heareth me; which follows from Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his way.</note> of that body, when his own Church excommunicates him?</p>
               <p n="6">6. He that hears not the Church, heares not Christ, and he that despiseth any Pastor sent in the name of Christ, despiseth Christ, <hi>Mat. 10. 4. Luke 10. 16. Iohn</hi> 13. 20. Now if this stand good, one that despiseth his own Pastor only, and his own congregation only, though he despise all the godly Prophets,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:58837:201"/>
Pastors, and soundest Churches on earth, despiseth not Christ nor his Father that sent him; nor is he first <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> bound in Heaven, and guilty before God, nor deserves he to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, for he hath not failed against that, <hi>He that despiseth you despiseth me.</hi> For that is true only when any despiseth their own Pastor, or their own congregation. And if so, then when one is cast out, and judgeth an heathen for not hearing of his own Church, he is not heathen in Heaven, and <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> as touching his communion with other Pastors and other congregations.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Peter</hi> before he was excommunicated, had a real right to the Lords Table in all Churches on earth, and so a sort of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership and visible communion with all these Churches. Now if by the act of excommunication in his own Church, this right be not taken from him, then must it be taken from him by all the Churches: and so all the Churches must excommunicate when one excommunicates: and by the like, all must admit one into membership, when one admits into membership.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The Sister Churches</hi> (Mr. <hi>R.) receive members of other Churches to communion, by an intrinsecal Church power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>By an authoritative Church power we can enjoyn our own members to come to the seals, or else censure them; but we cannot so deal with others, if it shall seem good to them to refuse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This only follows, that the congregation hath a larger Church power over their own members, both to censure them, if they come not, and positively to admit them, if they come: but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> must confess that the congregation admits strangers of other congregations, by a meer private p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. By no Church power is the Sacrament tendered to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of another congregation; so may the Minister give this <note place="margin">Mr. H. allows of private Communions.</note> seal to a stranger in his chamber, which is a private communion, for there is no authoritative Church power required to give it to some. Whereas <hi>Paul</hi> saith, it is a priviledge of the Church, coming together to eat the Lords Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 17, 18, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17.</p>

               <p n="4">4.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Then nothing is left to the neighbour Churches, but is he excommunicate or not, by one onely congregation, they had no hand in it, onely they must believe the man is rightly cast out, upon the word of five or six of the male-Church, who are both Judge and Party.

A child in Logick can conceive, the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick body savingly believing to be invisible, and also savingly professing what they believe to be visible. So the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. are both real, and so invisible believers, as no

So <hi>Peter,</hi> as touching his soul, is invisible and immortal, as touching his body, visible and mortal.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Adde to the observation, that in this I take not visible <note place="margin">What way M. <hi>R.</hi> puts <hi>visible</hi> in an equal latitude with <hi>mystical,</hi> what way not.</note> for Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his visibility, which agreeth to <hi>Magus</hi> and <hi>Iudas;</hi> but that sincere and honest visible profession, that for the most part is in the Catholick integral militant redeemed body, and mystical, well neer of an equal breadth and latitude. Not but that there may be, and are many beleevers members of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical body, who have little or no visible profession. But it is enough to assert as truth, that one and the same body is both invisible, mystical, and the saved body, and also visible, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with a real sincere profession; and that both these agree to the Catholick integral militant Church. Though I deny not, but that there be many hypocrites in this great body, whose mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial acts are valid. But the Catholick visible Church in that latitude is not then both subject, object, and intended end of all Ordinances. And I speak now of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. I cannot think that</hi> Mr. <hi>R. takes the Catholick Church for the whole integral body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>It is mistaking charity of me.</hi> Mr. <hi>H. that Church is meant 1 Cor. 12. in which God sets teachers, helps, ordinary officers, first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> v. 28. <hi>But God sets not such in the integral body; for they are set by the election of the people in particular congregations,</hi> Acts 14. 23. &amp; 6. 5.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is my own argument, but not rightly formed; that Church is here meant, in which the Lord hath respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed first Apostles—and Teachers, both Extraordinary and Ordinary Officers. But God hath not set Apostles fixedly and firstly over congregations, they being organs of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick integral body, and are sent to preach to Heathen (who after were Churches.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Arg. 2. <hi>In what Church Pastors are firstly set over them, they have firstly and primarily pastoral power in dispencing acts of ruling and preaching: But ordinary Teachers have not this over the Catholick visible Church. Congregations may justly refuse to hear other Teachers then their own; but their own may preach to them, though they refuse to hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Every word is censurable. 1. Apostles were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, firstly both in regard of dignity of Office, and of Apostolick Universality, sent to all Nations to preach, not to a single con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to exercise pastoral acts firstly over it, as fixed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By a catholick Church Mr: <hi>H.</hi> means <hi>(sed suis musis solus canit)</hi> a congregation. Now if the Apostles be firstly set in the congregation in general, they must be secondarily set in this individual congregation; then must the ordinary Teacher be set before the Apostle, who was often his sender, in the individual congregation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Proposition is false: A pastor may tender the Lords Supper to hundreds of a sister-congregation; but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I hope, will not say that a pastor is set over, and firstly over hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of another congregation. The Antecedent and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence are both Mr. <hi>Hookers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Its false that ordinary Teachers have not power to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise pastoral acts to those of other congregations. Nor is it proved, they cannot exercise <hi>pastoral acts over them, because they cannot censure them.</hi> Its an illogical consequence, ordinary to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> The Apostles, both as Apostles, by miracles and the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:58837:204"/>
gift of Tongues, plant Churches among the Heathen, and as pastors they exercise ordinary pastoral acts to the Heathen, in <note place="margin">Pastors may exercise pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward many whom they cannot cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</note> planting and preaching the Gospel to them, but they could not draw out Church-censures against the Heathen, yet remaining Heathen, because of the incapacity of the object, they could not cast them out who were not yet within: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12, 13. but this they could not do not through want of pastoral power over them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Its false, that other <hi>Churches may justly refuse to hear other Teachers than their own:</hi> For if their own be sick and dead, or if other Teachers have an earnest suit and desire from their own officers and some one of the congregation, they most unjustly refuse to hear, and come under the guilt of despising Christ in despising his Messengers, as <hi>Mat. 10. 40. Luke 10. 16. Ioh.</hi> 13 20. except the sense be, He that receiveth not his own congregational pastor, receiveth not me, otherwise not. A strange and new sense!</p>
               <p n="6">6. If the flock refuse all their own pastors to hear them, as being ravening Wolves, they unpastor them, and recall the official being, which our Brethren say they gave them in ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and so unjustly refuse to hear them; and they cannot justly preach to them, who so refuse to hear, for they justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Ans. <hi>At the common nature of a Corporation exists in all corporations; so the congregation-nature exists in this or this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation—So if the nature of a Corporation be common to all, and the King hath set Major and Common-councel in all and every Town: Therefore the Major of one Town may rule in another. So all States set Generals, Colonels, Captains in the Army. The King sets Constables in all towns, Sheriffs in all counties: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Constables are common to all towns, therefore a Constable may exercise his office in another town.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Argument must run thus: As the King hath
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:58837:205"/>
set in <hi>England</hi> the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, the Lord Chief Justice, the Sheriff, the Constable in every County and <note place="margin">Though the rulers of one City cannot fixedly govern in another, yet its not conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Pastor cannot act as a Pastor in divers Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> Town; so hath God set in his Church, that is, in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, &amp;c. But the King hath set in <hi>England</hi> the Lord Keeper, the Lord Chief Justice, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable in every County, in every Town, how many Great Seals, how many Lords of Chief Justice should then be in <hi>England?</hi> And do not our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. Neither major Proposition nor Assumption have any truth: for hath God set the Apostles, the planters and framers of Churches out of heathen societies, in no Chair, but fixed them to a congregational Pulpit onely? The Apostles have care of all things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. command Schismatick Churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8. plant and lay the foundation of Churches, as wise Master-builders, <hi>Acts 16. 12. 13, 14, 15, 16. &amp; 18. 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 6. 11. appoint new offices in the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. <note place="margin">God hath not every way se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted officers in his Church, as the King hath placed Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judges in the State.</note> Now if God have seated the Apostles in such a way in every congregation, as ordinary Teachers are, then the Apostles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place must be onely to water and confirm visible converts, and members of a fixed and framed congregation; where then are the Apostles Letters Patents to build, to plant, to lay the foundation?</p>
               <p n="3">3. When its said, as it must be, or it comes not home, the King hath placed in <hi>England</hi> the whole integral body of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> the Lord Keeper, the Lord chief Justice, the Constable, as he hath placed in the Church Apostles and Teachers in the whole integral Church: These extraordinary and ordinary officers it cannot be meant, the King hath placed a Lord Keeper, and a Lord chief Justice in every Town and City of <hi>England;</hi> so neither hath the Lord placed an Apostle in every congregation upon the same account, and he who is
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:58837:205"/>
an Apostle in one congregation, can no more be an Apostle in another, than a Major of one City can be a Major in another: and it must run so; The State hath placed a General, Colonels, Captains in their Armies, <hi>i. e.</hi> in every particular society of the Armies, and so every company must have a General, therefore hath the State set Generals, Colonels, Captains in their Armies in the plural number. Now the State hath set but one General over all the Army, as the Church is but one.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Argument run thus: As the Major of <hi>Norwich</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Let M.

               <p n="4">4. The Church here is the Church all baptized into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>whether Iews or Gentiles, whether Bond or Free, which all drink the same drink in the Lords Supper.</hi> Mr. H. <hi>In all these congregations are comprehended both Iewes and Gentiles, for the whole nature of the General is comprehended in the Particulars.</hi> Well; and the Spirit that is in all the body must be one <hi>Genere,</hi> and the drink in the Lords Supper must be one <hi>Genere,</hi> and so must the Christ of which we partake be one <hi>Genere</hi> Hence there being many species and kinds of congregations different in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there must be many Christs different in nature, many Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, many Bodies, many Lords Suppers different in species and nature, of which we partake. Who ever heard in the Church of Christ many Christs, many Baptismes?</p>
               <p>Yet Mr. <hi>H.</hi> makes many congregations so different in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as he that hath right to Christ, Seals, especially Baptism,

               <p n="5">5. Its absurd that Jewes and Gentiles are all baptized unto one single congregation. <hi>We do not think that the Apostles</hi> (ad <hi>Ioh.

               <p n="5">5. This <hi>(we are all one)</hi> must be in the head Christ, and by faith really apprehending Christ; yea, as the Father and the <note place="margin">How absurdly our Brethren say we are one body, 1 Cor. 12. 12.</note> Son are one, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 21, now not only members of an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent congregation are so one, but also all beleevers of a Province, of a Nation; yea, all that shal beleeve in God, through the word of the Apostles, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 20. and all given of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Christ: who shall behold the glory that the Father hath given to Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 24. and who abide in him as branches in the Vine tree, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15 4.

               <p n="7">7. By this interpretation, when <hi>Paul</hi> saith the body is one, he meaneth a generick body; and the particular congregations are subjective parts, suitable to the whole: Now it is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable to know how congregations are eyes, and ears, and organs to congregations, except there be an integral whole body, which they deny: nor do we think that congregations

Its true, the profession of the catholick Church is, because of the universality, of Saints remoter from our senses, and so less visible; which hinders not that to be true which our Divines say, that in time of great persecution, the Churches knew not one another, as saith <hi>Augustine,</hi> who also compareth her to the Moon, which <note place="margin">

But the first is plain, the Apostles would not take that soveraignty in ordaining Elders, therefore they would not allow their Scholars to arrogate to call so,</hi> Acts 14. 23. <hi>When they had created them Elders in every Church, (the</hi> Geneva, <hi>When they had ordained Elders by election of the people) and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fasted, they commended them to God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then the officers had a full call, and a full night to the execution of their office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laying on of hands, which is not necessary; and must not the setting in order things amiss be done by</hi> Titus, <hi>i. e. the Officers and the Church also?</hi> Tit. 1. 5.</p>

I have as good reason, that the peoples concurring in choosing was needless, though they did choose, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath cause to say, the officers concurrence is needless in ordaining, though in truth the Word of God require both as necessary.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Pastor and flock, <hi>i. e.</hi> a single congregat on (for this only Mr. <hi>H.</hi> means) are not adequate Relatives, for a Pastor is referred to all members of other congregations to whom he is <note place="margin">The relation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> must thus argue, <hi>a pastor chused and made a pastor is</hi> relatum, <hi>and referred to his own single flock, all and only chusing and making him a pastor:</hi> in which there is no sip of truth. He is not a pastor to them only, as is said, for he acts as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Dogmatickly, sure and what he sayes in the Synod <hi>binds not, onely because it is Gospel; but</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Cotton) also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Keys of the Kingdom, c. 6. pag. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>it is taught by a Minister, for his calling sake:</hi> (as Christ, <hi>who so receiveth you, receiveth me)</hi> the associate Churches, who never made him a pastor.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor are all his flock, whom yet he feeds with Word, Censures, and Seals, to wit, women members of the flock, and children, and servants, the far larger part of the flock, three
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:58837:218"/>
for one, the chusing correlate: poor souls they are as passive in acts of jurisdiction to make and unmake Pastors as brute sheep; nor can the argument be from feeder and fed simply, sheep as sheep made not their shepherd, but from feeder and the fed chusing, creating and marrying their feeder and husband; and should not Mr. <hi>H.</hi> say as true, <hi>Solomon</hi> is a married hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to three hundred women, and yet two hundred fifty of them had no causative influence, gave never consent nor oath to accept him as their husband. So neither can the Pastor be referred to two hundred and fifty women, aged children, and servants, as a part of his flock creating him a husband and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for the fifty males did make him a Pastor, and they only.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Amesius</hi> sayes, <hi>the man made a pastor without a flock, is a husband without a wife.</hi> And the Prelates did wickedly in so doing, for they were but hirelings going up and down to preach for hire, whereas the work requires a fixed labourer to every corner of the Vineyard: but its <hi>non causâ pro causâ,</hi> and no sip of Logick, <hi>Ergo,</hi> every Pastor is so referred to his own flock, as husband and wife, so mutual consent made him a husband to them only, and a Pastor to no other, and them a spouse and wife to him only. But should the Church loose some men from their fixed charges, and send them to visit and water many planted Churches with the word and seals, these men should be lawful and edifying Pastors, not husband without wives. See <hi>Amesius,</hi> who proves Classis and Synods to be lawful from, 1. The law of Nature. 2. From common Equity. <note place="margin">

               <p>But to return to what I had almost passed. <hi>If the laying on of hands be no specificating act of an office, because it is used in other performances, as in the sending of</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>to preach to the Gentiles,</hi> Act. 13. Then shall water not be essential to Baptism, nor drinking to the Lords Supper, nor blessing Sacramental in that Supper, because in Levitical Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the feasts Sacred, in the Passeover, in praying for a blessing to the Word preached, all these were used.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> cuts and divides my Arg. for it hath a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the truth of the Assumption. Christ hath establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the communion of Saints, and of all Saints in specie, and of Churches in Church-praying one for another, Church-praising one for another, <hi>Eph. 6. 18. praying always with all prayer</hi>—<gap reason="foreign">

Way of the Churches of N. E. c. 6. sect. 1. p. 103. We admit mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of other congregations to the Lords Supper with us, for we look at the Lords Supper not onely as a seal of our communion with the Lord Jesus, but also of communion with his members, and that not onely with the members of our own Church, but of all the Churches of the Saints.</note> are Saints. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives us the name of <hi>communion of Saints by advice and counsel,</hi> which is the communion of Pagans and Saints; for Saints owe Christian counsel and Christian advice to Pagans and Idolaters. And Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives us this goodly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, <hi>God never granted any right of communion between Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches therefore it cannot be taken away.</hi> Hence one congregation owes no more Church-communion to another, than to Pagans; contrary to their own express Doctrine: for if the Brethren hold a communion of divers members of divers Churches in partaking of one Lords Supper at the same Table, then must they hold a communion of Churches as Churches. But the former they held, as the words cited clear.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is pleased to answer my Arg. <hi>The proof is added where no need is, that which is feeble, false, that hath no shadow of truth, to wit, the consequence is not at all confirmed, nor any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt made to that purpose.</hi> Its well known a fixed pastor in his <note place="margin">A pastor as a pastor preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own flock, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert some of his own &amp; of other congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Lords Supper to both.</note> own Pulpit preaching to his own flock, hath in the same act been instrumental to adde to his own flock real converts. Let the Reader judge what truth it hath, that in the same numerical single act of teaching, the man acts both as a pastor, and as no pastor, but as <hi>Apollos</hi> a private man onely, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether it be feeble or no that a pastor tenders the Lords Supper to one of another congregation (which he may lawfully do, say our Brethren <note n="*" place="margin">Way of the Churches of Ch. in N.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It seems to me feeble, though the instances of the dispersed who preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and of <hi>Apollos,</hi> Acts 18. as private Christians, and as no officers, were granted (which to me is false) therefore when a pastor in one and the same Sermon and words, preaching to his own flock, converts one of his own flock and one of another flock, that be acts as an officer, and opens pastorally the gates of the Kingdom of Heaven to the one, and acts as no officer, as not sent of God, but as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man to the other: (except Mr. <hi>H.</hi> maintain the Socinian sending to preach) I see not how Mr. <hi>H.</hi> can here expede him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The issue is, the male-Church only hath this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to make and unmake officers: and they have of late, being not the fourth part of that which they call the onely visible Church of Redeemed Ones, taken all power of Censures, so <note place="margin">Presbyters may delegate messengers of the Churches.</note> that the rest have no consent, which is a popish domineering over their faith; whereas we hold, the Church not consenting, Censures are not to be drawn out at all: here is more popery and bratish domineering over the consciences of the officers in point of Heresie, to speak nothing of divers points of Popery, Anabaptisme, Socinianisme that goeth along with this way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Churches cannot delegate a power to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> their messengers, to determine in a Synod according to the Word, can be denied by none, but such as deny Synods, contrary to <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor knoweth the Scripture any rule from civil Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who both make and chuse <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> Rulers and Kings, to infer that the male-Church cannot preach nor admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister seals, but they both create and chuse Spiritual Officers. We may long call for Scripture to prove this, but in vain, it is a Tradition that we must believe, because so say our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. The mercies here promised are not all the particular blessings and priviledges that the parents were possessed of. Israel wanted circumcision fourty years in the wilderness, and in the time of the Iudges, and in the 70 years captivity they wanted sundry priviledges they enjoyed under</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Solomon; <hi>the mercy here must be grace and glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is for me: But when Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of nearest parents excommunicated, to be excluded both from Baptism and Covenant-mercy, and have them in the case
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:58837:229"/>
wholly with the Infants of Pagans, they must be excluded from grace and glory; else Mr. <hi>H.</hi> must shew, with Anabaptists, some way of Salvation of Infants who are without the covenant, and so have no share in that onely precious Name by which men are saved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I hope Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will not say, <hi>Israel</hi> wanted circumcision in the Wilderness for the sins of their nearest parents onely; there was a physical impediment; the Lord, who loves mercy better than sacrifice, would not have Infants wounded in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> must prove, that the people in the Wilderness, in <note place="margin">Ps. 85. 8, 9, 10. Heb. 3. 17. Judg 9. 19.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. This being the meaning, as</hi> Calvin, Zanchius, Junius, Perkins, <hi>what inference can be made for the conveyance of the right of Baptism from remote parents to children, I know not; for how doth this agree to children to love the Lord, and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, who are not yet capable, being not come to years to put forth such acts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I shall not invite <hi>Anabaptists</hi> to triumph in pulling this <note place="margin">Mr. H. denies covenant right to baptism to Infants, as Anabaptists do, because they do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually love &amp; obey God.</note> Argument for Infant-baptism from our Divines; for if the words must be expounded of actual love to God, and actual obedience in Infants; so that, if Infants be not capable of actual love and obedience to God, the covenant-mercy must be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off in all Infants who die <hi>before they can come to years to actually to love the Lord, and keep his commandments;</hi> And if the flux of covenant-mercy be suspended, while Infants come to be capable to actually love God and obey him; where then shall be covenant right in the males of the Jews to be circumcised, and in the Infants born of covenanted parents under the New Testament to be baptized? For the Argument, if any be, must be thus:</p>

But this want of age and capacity to love God and actually obey him, is in all Infants in Old or New Testament; except Mr. <hi>H.</hi> mean, that <hi>nearest parents</hi> can supply the want of capacity, and infuse actual understanding to Infants, that they <hi>may actually love God, and keep his commandments,</hi> which remote parents cannot do, which is a mystery I am yet to learn. But to the Reader it is clear, that Infants have <hi>no right to Baptism until they come to years</hi> to actually love God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they should not be baptized until they be converted. But again, no <hi>Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptist</hi> teacheth, that any are to be baptized by covenant-right from parents near or remote, except they personally believe and profess actually: and the very like Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Where shall we stand if a thousand generations have interest in Baptism? Then the children of Turks cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, for some of them are found between us and</hi> Adam.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Is not this to cavil at the Lords words, not at us? so they set this Conjecture down as a part of their Discipline; <hi>Its not above 66 generations from</hi> Noah <hi>to Christ,—and if Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to a thousand generations may fetch in the children of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated</hi>

                  <hi>persons, the same promise may fetch in all Turks and Infidels at this day.</hi> But I pray you are <hi>Turks</hi> such as <hi>love God and keep his commandments?</hi> are not Turks avowed enemies to Christ and the Gospel-covenant? and so for many generations have deserted the covenant and visible Church, so that they are no visible Church, the Lord having removed the Candlestick: Can this be said of children born in the visible Church, either of the Jews or of Christians professors, because their nearest parents are extreme wicked or excommunicated, since they are yet born in the visible Church where the Candlestick is? shall the children be cut off from circumcision, since the Lord for <hi>Abraham,</hi> for <hi>Davids</hi> sake, for the holy Roots sake (not the nearest, who were most unholy, and cast out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 7.) gives circumcision and Church-room to the branches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16?

Where then is his covenant-right to baptism? Its either from his remote parents, which we say; <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed:</hi> or from his nearest excommunicate parents. This latter Mr. <hi>H.</hi> denies: or from the Beleever, in whose house he was born. If so, we shall not contend, then the covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right is not broken and removed, because the nearest parents are excommunicate.

                  <p>A new device of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his two sentences, the official and dogmatical sentence of officers, yet not concional, nor juridical, and another juridical of the male-Church, is examined.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>H. It is the office of Rulers dogmatically to discover the mind of God, and the mind of Christ, in convincing by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>

And again, when the Elders themselves turn Wolves, who then can give out an official and dogmatick sentence against them? that must be wanting: and hath not the like of this brought forth among Brownists reciprocal excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications?</p>

                  <p>Of Synods and their Power.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>H. Synods are necessary for union in the Churches: In the multitude of Counsellors there is safety,</hi> Acts 15. Prov. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Union in truth and peace among Churches, say these Churches, must make one visible Body; then ruptures, rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <note place="margin">Union or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion among associate chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, say the associate chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, must make up one visible body.</note> scandals, must say there is in this body visible, a necessity of Government and Jurisdiction must be incident to that visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body, which they deny: for this union must be a professed union, to speak and think the same thing, <hi>Phil. 2 2. c.</hi> 4. and this is visible union; and so they must meet, not in their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (that is unpossible) and here is a visible Church meeting, (for Civil it is not) debating, advising about matters of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the House of God. So strong is truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. There are associations of divers sorts, Classis, Synods,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>Ambignity, darkness: to binde as a part of Scripture, is 1. That which is contained and clearly deduced from Scripture. Or 2. that this act of decreeing issuing from the immediate reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and assistance of the Spirit, maketh that which is decreed to be Scripture: in the former sense acts tie as good advice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel onely; in the latter they tie not as Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

<pb n="459" facs="tcp:58837:233"/>
I brought three members to clear the matter. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> leaves <note place="margin">Mr. H. his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of the acts of Synods, which is, that they tie the conscience on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the godly counsels of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men tie men. M <hi>Cotton</hi> of the keys, c. 6. p. 25.</note> out the third, and darkens all: for acts of Synods lay on bands neither as formal Scripture, for they come not from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inspiring Spirit, nor yet onely as clear and infallible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions from Scripture, for so the counsel of a woman <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail,</hi> infallibly deduced from the sixth Command, laid a burthen upon the conscience of <hi>David.</hi> And this is all the tie that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives to Synods, they tie as godly counsels of women and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. But Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and so Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> gives a third member, they lay burthens on the consciences of the Churches, not for the matter onely, as the godly advice of women, but <hi>formally,</hi> as from the Ministerial Authority of the Commissioners. And this power Mr. <hi>Tho. Goodwyn</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ph. Nye</hi> give to all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <note place="margin">Preface to the Treatise of the Keys.</note> over their congregations: So as these three shall be Judges of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his great mistake in this distinction. Hence two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions are here: Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives no power to Synods, but power of advising, such as women over men. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends at that, and sayes, that Synods have a Ministerial power over the Churches. In the former Mr. <hi>H.</hi> leaves his Brethren, and sides with <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi> And Mr. <hi>H.</hi> shall <note place="margin">Socin. contra Gabr.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That which is in question is not concluded, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Christian Nation into Presbyteries and Provinces ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to local bounds and Mathematical inches, is alterable; and so a congregation Independent of 350, rather of 349, or 360, is alterable, shall it not upon reason be an alterable device? The quantity of water in Baptism, of wine that every one drinks at the Lords Supper, how long the pastor shall preach, two hours or three, are alterable, as to the quantity, by men; but for that the Ordinances of a congregation, of water in Baptism, are not devices or forgeries of men, that there should be such associations of Provinces, of Territories, for convenient feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Page 6, 7.</note> governing, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> granted for counselling, Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> for command and use of the Keys yields also; so the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion shall not be of the subject, but of the power and of the bounds, <hi>where acts of free choice of rectified reason for civil ends also</hi> have place. But the Conclusion is naught. So, <hi>That which is not in the Word</hi> (saith he) <hi>is a device of man.</hi> I assume, the <note place="margin">Par. 4 p. 10.</note> frame of the meeting-house for congregational Worship, the number, names, trades, callings of members, the quantity of <note place="margin">Mr. H. his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual moral acts and the mixture in them.</note> water in Baptism, the quantity of Bread that every one eats a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

2. For the mixture of our actions; its cleare there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing physical in eating at the Lords Supper, as the word hath not set a rule concerning the physical quantity of Bread and Wins, so there be not too much, for it is not to feed the body, nor too little, for it must work upon the senses. And there is in praying, preaching, the tone, the accent of the organs, of the voice, and their motion: so that we eat and drink for God, and soberly and seasonably, is moral, and squared by the word; but a man sins not in eating quickly or lently, in the house, or in the garden, or sometime in his bed, sometime at midnight, upon necessity.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> errs not a little. in calling the acts of the Synod, <hi>Act. 15.

bodies meeting for the affairs of the Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Where there is no delegation of messengers by mutual consent, there is no right of jurisdiction, decrees onely bind the Churches who send them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. Antioch,</hi> Act. 15. 2. and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> sent messengers, therefore two Churches, at least were sent, and were bound; as <note place="margin">Absents from the Synod are tied to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> for delegation, we shall speak hereafter of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Its no prejudice to the care and wisedom of our Saviour, that the punishing of the congregational Throne be reserved to God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 60.</note> 
                  <hi>only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> When scandals between congregation and congregation, and members of divers Churches are greater in number and <note place="margin">It suits not with the wis dom of Christ that no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies should be for a scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Church.</note> offence, and necessity of edifying and scandalizing greater, his wisedom must provide for the more rather then the less.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. If when a Church offends, I must tell a higher, then must I at length tell an Oecumenick or General Councel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> General Councels being more abstracted from infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scandals of conversation, are rather doctrinal Remedies: nor are censures the ordinary possible adequate way of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Scandal. The Word and Censures exercised in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick integral visible Church, in parts integral is the adequate cause.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. If every man be allowed his appeal to an higher, then also to a General Councel, then for many hundred years, while the appeal be discussed</hi> pendente appellatione, <hi>the appealer cannot be censured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We allow only just appeals in case of oppression, to relieve the oppressed. <note place="margin">What appeals we allow.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In difficult cases, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. which rarely are such as call for a general Councel, in case of general defection in point of Doctrine, such may be; and the inferiour Churches, that truth suffer not, are to declare for the truth.</p>

3. The argument supposeth that we approve a towering up of appeals, even to a General Councel, as a liberty of every member, whatever unjust prejudice be in it: and that every such appeal may stop the actings of Christs visible Kingdom and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Pastors. Christ hath given no power to sin.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> makes all that Christians do as Christians and as Churches, that is, gathering of Churches, hearing, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of seals and censures, to be private actings not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Magistrate. Strange it is, that the convening of the ten thousand Subjects in the same place (as our Brethren say) belongs nothing to the Magistrate; sure it sides with peace or war. And yet Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, <hi>The Magistrate may compel men to</hi>

                  <hi>attend the mind of Christ, and solemnly to humble themselves by fasting and prayer.</hi> See how these two consist.</p>

And Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saves not the matter by saying, <hi>The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate hath nothing to do</hi> with the man, to punish him; I judge in these capacities, <hi>except he intrench upon his policy,</hi> that is, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he break his Laws. But sure, he can punish no man in any imaginable capacity, private or publick, except he break his Laws. Beside that, its neither Law nor Divinity, to say, that a man <hi>intrencheth upon the Magistrates policy,</hi> and violates his Laws, as <hi>Ethicus,</hi> a moral man, or a member of a family either
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:58837:248"/>
in private or publick; for more abominable it is to say. He vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates Laws, and Whores, Murthers, Robs <hi>as a Christian:</hi> for Christianity teacheth men to deny all ungodliness, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 11. for he must do all these as <hi>malus civis,</hi> as a wicked member of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I wonder more in what capacity the Magistrate can have to do with commanding and governing men, if not as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse morally with men, and in their families, as fathers and sons, as Masters and servants, and as Christians who both in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publick may perform duties to one another, or oppress one another; else the Judge could not punish the rebellious son, the wicked servant, or the murthering father, and the oppressing Master. Yea, the more secret that wicked acts are, a godly Magistate doth the more resemble God, who can say, as <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 29. 16. <hi>I was a father to the poor, and the cause that I knew not I searched out.</hi> Nor do men, except extremely flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, commit Villanies, Robberies, Murthers, Parricides, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, but <hi>in private:</hi> And it appertains to the Ruler the more to search them out, the more privately that they be acted. But if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> mean, that private actings of citizens, of members of families, of Christians, that are good and indifferent, do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the Magistrate, who is an adversary to him in this? Though all good actions done in private or publick deserve praise, reward and protection from the Magistrate, except Mr. <hi>H.</hi> expound that <hi>Rom. 13. 3. Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same,</hi> so thou do good in publick onely, as hypocrites: but thou shalt have no praise of the Ruler, if thou do good within doors.

But the next Reason is ill and worse, if <hi>because the King is a Nurse-father to the Church,</hi> he must be father, and a begetter both of Religion and of the Church, &amp; because he protects and defends the true Church, then true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion must be before him: As also when Mr. <hi>H.</hi> saith, that the <hi>Prince is a Nurse father to the Church,</hi> he means, the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Church onely, so that he owes no protection to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, nor justice to them. And if the Nurse-fathers care be, that there should <hi>be a right opinion and worship openly profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed within his Territories,</hi> the Magistrate is to do this no other wayes, but by the Sword, for another power he hath not; then must he with the Sword compel all within his Dominions to be <note place="margin">M.
