            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>'TIS a sad thing, when any Kingdoms are divided about the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Civil Duties,</hi> which must needs bereave vast Numbers of the Innocence, and more of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Quietness of Humane Life. But it is still worse, when this grows into a Division of Churches, and Breach of Religious Communions. For, besides that Religion is the chief of all things which can concern us, <note place="margin"> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
               </note> and whereon we must Build all our Hopes of Good in another Life: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Exercises and Assemblies, should be the properest, Cordial to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive our Spirits, and the best and surest Refuge for us to flee unto in the greatest civil Distractions. But such Division of Churches and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, unsettles and distracts the Hearts of Good and Pions People about this; and makes them at a Loss, where to serve God, and say their Prayers. And this must put all, who pretend to seriousness, or a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit, on shewing Compassion; and some, on endeavouring Relief, and on reaching out such things, as may direct and be of use to them, in a Safe and Conscionable Guidance of their Steps, at such times.</p>
            <p>And this is the Design of this Treatise. Wherein my Business is not at all to Dispute the particular Titles to any Crowns, or to examine the Claims of the several Pretenders to them. In that, I leave every Honest Mind to other ways of Informing and Satisfying themselves, and of Forming such Judgments thereof, as Truth and Justice shall happen to require in their particular Case. But when by those Ways, they are come to be resolved therein, I endeavour to shew them what things lie most upon Conscience, either their Pastors, or their own, as to Church Ministrations; and what way they are to take about Religious Offices and Communion, on such unhappy Divisions.</p>
            <p>These Matters I Treat of, not as they are State Points, like one who seeks only to be a Stickler in Civil Differences; or to help those, who, on such Breaches, Study only to make a Bustle in State Parties. But as they are Matters of Religion, and concern all, who would keep in the Favour of God, and in the right Way to Heaven. For my Design and Study all along, is to shew how they, who desire nothing more than to save their immortal Souls, may keep free from Guilt and Eternal Danger in these particulars: My great Care for them, and for my self in these Matters, being how we may truly and acceptably Serve God, more than any Temporal Interest, or the Cause of any Persons, or Parties in this World And this I offer to the Conscientious, who prefer Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb facs="tcp:44279:3"/>
Worldly Ends, and Eternity before this Life; And who in these Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, are Willing and Desirous to take the sure Way to Future Peace, and Everlasting Bliss, however the same may expose them here, to Worldly Difficulties, Uncomfortableness, and Persecutions.</p>
            <p>As for the Ways and Practices here spoken off, I have given warning of their Gullt and Danger with planeness. And this is necessary in all good Christians, especially in Ministers, who are <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>If.</hi> 5. 20.</note> 
               <hi>not to call Evil Good,</hi> or to give soft Names to ill things, and to palliate Unrighteousness instead of exposing and exploding it: which were to take part with Wickedness, and <hi>to</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 28, 20.</note> 
               <hi>sew Pillows</hi> for the Bolstring up of Sinners.</p>
            <p>I am sensible what need there is of Charity and Candor at all times, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially on the Bursting out of Differences. And how indispensable Christian Duties these are, not only in Men at Ease, but in Confessors and Sufferers for Righteousness towards their Persecutors. <hi>If I keep not Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, though I give my Body to be Burned,</hi> and Suffer Martyrdom, <hi>it Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth me nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 13. And when we see Men inapparently Wicked and Ungodly Ways, or Unrighteous Things done; 'tis the part of this Charity and Candor, to shew Favour and Easiness in Judging of the Dispositions of Mind wherewith they do them. Ascribing them, so far as it can find any reasonable Colour or Pretence thereof, to the most excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable Principles. As to their being Mislead by the plausible Arguings of Deceivers, or to an Error of their Judgments; rather than to their acting all the while against their own Belief and Convictions: And to their being over-awed by Fear of Princes, or of Popular Violence; or being Forced by Worldly Wants; and Necessities; rather than to their doing the same willingly and of themselves, or out of Malice. As our Blessed Lord, <hi>whilst he hung upon the Cross,</hi> most Candidly imputes the Wickedness of his Crucifiers, to their Ignorance: <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do,</hi> Luke 23. 34. It is also the Part thereof, freely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, and Friendly to desire, and endeavour their Return; rejoycing to have them see their Folly, rather than to see them suffer for it: And, without Upbraiding them with the Remembrance of former Errors, Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably to Welcome, and carry on the Change, when, through the Blessing and Grace of God, they are wrought upon by whatever Methods of Providence, and begin to come to themselves.</p>
            <p>But whist it is so Favourable, in judging of the inward Dispositions of the Persons; 'tis no Part of this Charity and Candor, either to think or to speak Favourably, of the Ungodly or Unrighteous things themselves, whch are set up, or driven on at such Times. The unlawful Practices themselves, it censures with Justice, being a Charity, that is Pure and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and that is careful for God, and for the Duties of an Holy Religion, in the First Place. Out of Love to God and Religion, it cannot Favour Vices, or softer and take part with any Sin. Yea, and out of Love to Men, it cannot speak softly of destructive Courses, or represent any ungodly


<pb facs="tcp:44279:3"/>
Ways or Things, as less Dishonourable and Offensive to God, or as less Dangerous to Souls, than in the End they will find them. So that, they are mightily Mistaken, who think it any Part of true Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Candor, to befriend ungodly Practices, or to minee and soften unlawful and unrighteous Things; which were to conspire with Sin and Wickedness against God and Religion, and to betray the Souls of Men, instead of befriending them.</p>
            <p>I am also sincerely and conscientiously srudious of Peace: and to keep Men unreproveable in that, is one intent, though not the only one, of these Papers. And before open Breaches are made, the Love of Peace will spend it self in endeavours to prevent them. But if they are made already, as they are to a great Hight, when the Espousers of ill things have proceeded to set up <hi>Anti-Bishops,</hi> which divide Church Societies; till by pouring in Oil they can be Cured and Closed again, one chief Business left then for the Love of Peace and Union, is to see that Peace and Unity be kept with the Right Side. And this I have here endeavour'd to assist the Children of Peace in, the best I can. For it would be a fatal Mistake indeed, to have the very Love and Desire of Peace abused to the Maintenance of Dividers, and to see well-meaning Men, whilst at such Times they are designedly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to avoid <hi>Schisms,</hi> to run Headlong into them. As they must do, if they mistake their Side, wherewith this Peace and Unity is to be kept; and, instead of the true Body, take part with the Seditious, and joyn themselves to those Members who are broken off, on such Divisions.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Peace and Union, which we are to seek in this World, must be such as may give us Peace at the last. It is not being at Peace in such Ways, as will fill our Souls in the End with Eternal Horrors. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not to be sought by our Violation of any Parts of Righteousness, nor by our consenting or giving way to the Suppression thereof, or letting fall our Zeal for the same. So that we must not seek to compass it, by Neutrality and Luke-warmness for Gods Holy Commandments. And much less by Treachery, in giving up them, and the Souls of Men, whose Eternal Weal depends upon the Observance thereof, as the Purchase of external Unity with any Society. When Worldly Peace can no longer be kept together with Righteousness, it is no Peace for Christians; or for Men, who would prefer the Peace of God, and of their own Conscience, before any false &amp; forced Shows of Peace &amp; Unity with any other Persons.</p>
            <p>And these Endeavours, to direct Men, whose Care is to keep Peace and Unity with any Societies, how they may keep them with the Right Side, when they are broken into Parties; and in such things, and by such Compliances, as will not intercept their Future Comforts: Methinks, should be acceptable to all sincere Lovers thereof, who would be directed how they may wisely pursue what they love, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot miss of their own Desires, and would fix at last on such a Peace and Union, as will not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, or End in Ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44279:4"/>
In treating of these Matters, I endevour to clear and confirm what I offer thereupon by the Authority of the Sacred Scriptures, and from the Reason and Nature of the things Discoursed of. And moreover, from the Doctrine, and Practice of the Primitive Church: Shewing what the Holy Apostles; and their Successors of the first and best Ages, would have said to Men, in the Cases and Breaches here proposed; and how, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, they would have determined their own Practice, had they been try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith, and placed in such Circumstances. This I shew from their own Rules, which they gave out to others, and acted by themselves, in their own Circumstances. And it would be a strange, and very Criminal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, for any now in our Days to sleight their Ways. For we all know, that our Holy Religion doth not begin with us, and that we are not the First Christians, but only their Successors, and that too at a great Distance. We all profess to be their Followers, and should think we have best provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our own Safety. when we have taken the Way to be found in their Company.</p>
            <p>In confirming any Points from their Doctrine, or Practice, I have given their own Words in the Margin, that the Learned Reader, having the very Words and Passages I Build upon before him, may be the better Enabled, and with more Ease to himself, to judge of the use which I make of them, and of the Inferences which I draw from them. But in the Body of the Book, I have only given the Translation, or put the Sence or Purport of the same, that the unlearned Reader may not be discouraged or hindred by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures of an unknown Tongue, but peruse the whole without Interruption.</p>
            <p>Thro' the whole, I am sincerely Careful, so far as I am able, to satisfie Conscientious and truly Religious Minds, what Way they are to take for Sacred Offices and Church Communion, on such unhappy Divisions. And seeking their Satisfaction in these Matters, I have offer'd the best I can to Resolve those Points, which I thought they were most like to be unsatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in; and to clear up those things, which seemed to me most liable to mislead them; and either to Answer or Obviate those Objections, which are already made, or, so far as I can at present Foresee, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably hereafter start up in their Way to unsettle them about the same. All which, as I have labour'd in, with an Humble Dependance on God's Grace and Assistance; so I now humbly recommend to his Blessing. Desiring nothing more, than that he may Graciously Accept the same, and Pardon all the oversights and well-meant Failures and Mistakes which shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be found therein, and direct and turn this Work, Poor and Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive as it is to the Uses and Interest of Truth and Godliness, and to the Edification and Service of his Holy Church. <note place="bottom">

And when these are executed accordingly, especially in much disputed Cases, it may be an afflictive Sight to many good &amp; Christian Minds, in just acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement to the extraordinary, and perhaps generally celebrated Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Some, and in due Compassion to the hard Measure of all the Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. But it will be much more impressive and lamentable, on the Score of that terrible <hi>Rent</hi> and <hi>Schism,</hi> thereby like to ensue in such <hi>Churches,</hi>


                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:44279:9"/>
which is so generally and deservedly dreaded and bewailed, by all Sincere Promoters of <hi>Unity,</hi> and unfeigned Lovers of <hi>Peace,</hi> and of the <hi>Prosperity</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Breach being thus made, on <hi>One Side, The Sufferers will be press'd to Submit, in Regard to the Deprivation of the State.</hi> And moreover, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves injured, they will be put in Mind of the justly magnified excellency of the Desirableness, and Necessity of <hi>Unity;</hi> and will be call'd upon as <hi>Good Pastors,</hi> who prefer the <hi>Flock,</hi> before themselves, to give up Private Claims to Publick Peace, and Personal Quarrels and Pretences to the Advantage and Edification of the Church. And this Preference of Peace to private Interests, they must own to be the Duty of all good Pasters, and as, becomes such, profess to set these things above all Worldly Profits and Considerations being ready, when call'd thereto, <note n="*" place="margin">

Or, that in Just and Necessary Remorse, for what they have done, they would penitently return whence they are fallen; and seeing their Error, so unhappily over-looked before, by coming into the old Paths, re-unite themselves to then Brethren again.</p>
               <p>But on the <hi>Other hand,</hi> they will be ready to put their Brethren and Accusers in Mind, that neither a <hi>State Deprivation,</hi> nor a <hi>Synodical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,</hi> had there been one, can discharge a Bishop from standing up, <hi>to keep off Damage and Danger to Religion,</hi> and <hi>to the Souls of Men,</hi> or from <hi>preventing their being nursed up in immoral Practices and Devotions.</hi> And that True and Faithful Pastors, are not so straightly bound to keep up ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Unity and Peace, as to keep up necessary Truth and Righteousness, and holy and unpolluted Worship, in the Church. Their Charge is, first, To provide against all things that endager or destroy the Souls of Men, and damnifie Religion; and when that is done, then to look how they may provide against all <hi>Schism,</hi> or breach of external <hi>Unity,</hi> with their Compastors or Brethren; but never seek to salve and secure this, by letting those alone.</p>
               <p>Besides, as to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> instead of carrying themselves off from <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> at such times, or any good People off from them, they will alledge, that they oblige all, who will make Conscience thereof, and observe them as they ought, to stick to them. For the <hi>Unity,</hi>


                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:44279:9"/>
which <hi>Christ</hi> requires, is, to keep united upon the Profession of true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and holy Worship, not of any damnable Errors and Corruptions thereof. And under our own Lawful and Canonical Bishops and Pastors, not under any opposite or Anti-Bishops and Pastors, <hi>Schismatically</hi> set up against them, and violently intruding into their Places.</p>
               <p>The determination of this Debate at all such times, &amp; on all such Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, is both of highest account, and of most general Concernment. And the design of these Papers, is to set down those things, whereon, in my Judgment, the clearing of it must depend; and by the help whereof, Sincere Christians, in such Divisions, may be enabled to resolve, both what is the Duty of the Sulfering Bishops and Clergy, in those Cases; and also, what is the Peoples Duty, and with which of the concern'd Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Men, who desire nothing so much, as to please God, and to keep a good Conscience, ought to unite and joyn themselves.</p>
               <p>As to the deprived Bishops and Clergy, at such times, the question is, Whether, <hi>not withstanding their Deprivation, they are Bound still to go on in the Exercise of their Ministry?</hi> Or, sitting down under it, and letting fall their Spiritual Ministrations, they Should <hi>content themselves to keep United the Anti-Bishops, and to their Adberents, as Lay Communicants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be their Duty still to insist on their Spiritual Powers, and, as they can, and at their Perils to exercise their respective Ministrations; those Churches are unavoidably left in a State of <hi>Flagr an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When the State deprives them; they must take up with what is independantly and originall their own, and not expect from it the Benefits and Assistances of any secular mixtures, which were derived to them by Incorporation.</p>
               <p>As to this point of <hi>Schism,</hi> several good Minds may think, that though, by setting up opposite or Anti-Bishops against them, in their respective Sees, others have already made it; yet may it be in the Power of the sein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured

                     </gap>tal Powers.</hi> That is, they are as true Bishops and Priests, as they were before. They are still endowed with the Powers of Orders, and their use thereof would be as valid, tho' not as to secular Claims and Privileges, which are the Gift of Princes, yet as to the real Effects of the Covenant of Grace, or to purely Spiritual purposes, as they would have been, had they not been so deprived.</p>
               <p>For these Powers are not derived from the State, nor from any secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Authority. They are called the <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Keys,</hi> not of any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this World, <hi>but of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 16. 19. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was a <hi>Spiritual King,</hi> disclaiming all secular Authority or <hi>Power of the Sword,</hi> and <note n="†" place="margin">

And when secular Powers turn'd Christians, they became the Members of an empower'd Church, and were let in by Ministers, and privileged to claim Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from Powers antecedently received from Christ; and not at all needing to be received from them, nor capable of being conferr'd by them, as having never been confer'd on them.</p>
               <p>Nor are these Powers to be held, only during the Will and Pleasure of the State. For then they could not be retained against its Mind: And so, not in a state of Persecution, when the secular Power sets it self to root out the Church, and all Church-Powers and Ministrations. Whereas, these Powers were given to the Church, <hi>bearing Christ's Cross,</hi> and labouring under Persecutions; and to continue in it always, even to the end of the World, under whatever circumstances, as well when secularly Oppressed, as when Protected.

               </p>
               <p>But this exercise, the deprived Bishops and Clergy are bound to, in Duty and Conscience at such times, <hi>If there is a need of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations then, to provide for Religion and the Souls of Men;</hi> or <hi>to prevent Men from being nursed up in destructive Ways,</hi> as <hi>Immoral Practices,</hi> and <hi>Immoral Worship and Devotions,</hi> must be confessed to be.</p>
               <p>To clear this, it may not be amiss to consider;</p>
               <p>First, <hi>What Immoralities come in, by a wrong, payment of Allegiance, to corrupt Religion, and to endanger Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>What Provision good and faithful Pastors ought to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such Dangers and Corruptions, by the exercise of their Ministry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I shall briefly consider, <hi>what Immoralities come in by a wrong Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Allegiance, to corrupt Religion, and to endanger Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether this is actually the case of any Kingdom, and the Allegiance required of them by their <hi>New Governors,</hi> be directed and paid wrong, I do not here discuss. That makes another dispute, <hi>viz. about the Right to the Crown contested betwixt the two Competitors in those Countries,</hi> and the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> or <hi>Unlawfulness of the New Oaths of Allegiance,</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereupon, which is exacted on such changes. And this, it is no part of the design of these Papers, to argue or meddle with.</p>
               <p>But when this really is the case in any Revolution, as in this World, <hi>God</hi> knows, it is too often; or among those Subjects, who believe this is their case, and that their Allegiance is call'd for to the Wrong, against the Right Person: Such as these are the Immoralities, that will every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where corrupt Religion, and endanger Souls, whilst such wrong Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lasts, and which should be thought to do so among them, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then all that time, whilst they are violently transferring their Allegiance from him, to whom it still Remains rightfully due, would Men in the general Practice of those Nations, be wickedly disobeying, and forceably resisting <hi>Gods</hi> Authority, or the Father of the <hi>Fifth</hi> Commandment, which extends to civil, as well as natural Parents. Then would they all that while be most openly, and horribly breaking through all former <hi>Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.</hi> Then would all, who have promised, and pay their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> to drive out their ejected Prince out of any part of his Right, or to keep him out thereof, be actors of bare faced Iniquity, and heinously un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, coveting and invading their Neighbours Goods. And all


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44279:12"/>
force used against him, or any other Persons, for their adhering to his Cause, would, in <hi>Gods</hi> Account, be oppression, and unjust Violence; all Spoils and Seisures of their Goods, would be Thefts and Robberies; and all shedding of their Blood, all Cries and Clamours for it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in it, would be horrible Murders; which, not only they who acted, but they who Wish'd, or Prayed for, or gave Thanks for, when accomplished, would be Guilty of. All which, are most dangerous and destructive ways, and amount to a general Breach of <hi>Gods</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to an open wast of Moral Honesty and Justice. And all these, would be the Dangers to Mens Souls in any Kingdom, were the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> such an unrighteous Perversion, really, and in it self. Or, they would be met, with like Pastoral Provisions, as if they were so Dangerous, should the deprived Pastors believe, and apprehend it to be such. For it would have the same effect, to awaken their Care and Ministration, if it appeared so to them, and brought all these Dangers on the People, in their Apprehension.</p>
               <p>Besides, it may happen, that in the Opinion of the much greater part of the Swearers themselves, this <hi>Allegiance</hi> shall be transferr'd and paid to the King <hi>Regnant,</hi> and profess'd by them to be so, only as to the <hi>King in Fact,</hi> leaving the other still to be <hi>King de jure,</hi> or to retain the <hi>Legal Right.</hi> Now, if any ejected Prince, is any where admitted to have the <hi>Legal Right,</hi> by turning their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to his Competitor against him, the Subjects of those Countries, would fall into all the same fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Practices. If he remains their <hi>Rightful King,</hi> 'tis <hi>Disobedience</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> or <hi>Resisting of Gods Ordinance, to take up Arms against him:</hi> or to abet, aid, and pray for the Prosperity and Success of those, who take up Arms against him. 'Tis a Literal down right Breach, of all <hi>Oaths</hi> formerly made to such <hi>Rightful King,</hi> to <hi>bear Allegiance to him,</hi> and <hi>to defend him therewith, against all Attempts made against his Person, or Crown.</hi> 'Tis to be Self-Condemned of the Highest Injustice, by Forcing, or Keeping him out of that, which they own to be his <hi>Right.</hi> 'Tis to be Guilty, of Murders, and Robberies, in all the Blood-shed, and Spoils, which, in the course of their <hi>New Allegiance,</hi> they have abetted, or prayed for, or attempted to make on him, or on his Adherents, for his Cause. For all <hi>Allegiance</hi> is due, and required by <hi>God,</hi> to be paid to <hi>Rightful Kings.</hi> And to those, who have, and stand upon their <hi>Right,</hi> whether they be in, or out of the actual Administration of their respective Realms. And this, to those who have the <hi>Legal Right,</hi> which is not set aside by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Possession. All which, they who please, may see proved, in a Treatise Entituled, <hi>The Duty of Allegiance settled upon its true Grounds, according to Scripture, Reason</hi> &amp;c. So that there would be a like wast of Moral Honesty, and Just Practice at such times, and like Danger to


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44279:13"/>
the Souls of Subjects, to call for the Preventive or Medicinal Help of their Ministrations, by their Swearing Brethrens own Principles, or should it prove, that the ejected Prince has the <hi>Legal Right,</hi> according to their Apprehensions, and Authorized Writings in this Case.</p>
               <p>And this Immorality and Dishonesty, would endanger Mens Souls at such times, not only as appearing in Practice, but also, as appearing in Worship and Devotions. For all these Unrighteous, Dishonest, and Immoral things, should they be found such, are not only daily acted by Subjects of such Realms, in the course of Practice; but use also to be daily offer'd and recommended to <hi>God,</hi> in their Solemn Worship and Devotions.</p>
               <p>For the daily Prayers for such Governments, use to be the same, as for any other preceeding, and confessedly most rightful Governments: <hi>viz.</hi> For <hi>the Prosperity, and continuance of their Administrations,</hi> for <hi>their overcoming all their Enemies</hi> and <hi>Opposers,</hi> and for <hi>Gods confounding all their Devices against them,</hi> &amp;c. When there is a State of Declared War and Opposition, between them and their Competitor himself, call'd by the Swearing Brethren, the <hi>King de jure.</hi> There use moreover, to be particular Acknowledgements and Thansgivings inserted, for the Subjects being <hi>delivered of their former King,</hi> and for having their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Governors to Reign over them,</hi> in his Place. And particular Prayers, for the <hi>Prosperity of their Arms, both by Sea and Land;</hi> when those <hi>Arms</hi> are employed particularly against him, and against those, who, as the Publick Acts at such times use to say, <hi>Rebelliously adhere to him;</hi> and when they are to drive him out of such parts of the Dominions, as he still holds from them; or to keep him out of other parts thereof, if he shall make any attempt to recover the same out of their Hands. And, besides that these things use to be daily recommended to <hi>God,</hi> as part of the publick Offices: They are further, an Occasion, made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Aim of other Solemnities of Religion, and Solemn and appropriate Times, are appointed on purpose for them, and devoted to them. As set Days of <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Humiliation,</hi> for ingaging <hi>God</hi> to give Success to these Arms and Expeditions. And set Days of <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Solemn Thanks to <hi>God,</hi> for any Victory or Success he has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded in that Cause, after they have received the same.</p>
               <p>Now these, in behalf of a <hi>Legal Rightful King,</hi> and where they are not made in any other Pretenders wrong, are Just and Pious Prayers. But if in any Time or Kingdom, they should be made by Subjects, for an unjust Possessor of anothers Crown, against their <hi>Lawful King;</hi> they would be Prayers put up, for all the sore-said Iniquities and Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Perjury and Rebellion, of Oppression, Injustice, and all sorts of unrighteous Violence. Or, if made against one, owned to be <hi>King de</hi>


                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44279:13"/>
                  <hi>jure,</hi> or the <hi>Lawful King;</hi> they would still be so unavoidably, according to those Persons Principles; and would be so held and accounted by them, if they, who profess to go, and act upon such Principles, would be true to them.</p>
               <p>And the bringing such heinous Immoralities and Iniquities, into <hi>Gods</hi> own House and Worship, I think would plainly be most highly affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and offensive to the Great and Dreadful <hi>God,</hi> and as dangerous to the Souls of Men, as can well be imagined. For these Iniquities and Immoralities, give high Provocation to <hi>God,</hi> when he meets them in any place, or sees them committed by those, who still retain that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for him, as to believe that he forbids them, and is Angry at them. But to bring them as an Offering into his own House, and to recommend them in Prayers and Religious Solemnities, is to make him a Party there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or pleased therewith; and to the Heinousness of those Ways, as they are Acts of high Disobedience, adds, moreover, an horrid, and more immediate Blasphemy of <hi>God</hi> himself. Such an Immoral Worship, is a charge of his being an <hi>Immoral God:</hi> Which <hi>Plutarch,</hi> a Wise, and Piously disposed <hi>Heathen,</hi> thought a more intollerable Reproach, than to deny his Being, and say, <hi>There is no God.</hi> Thus, as he observes, any Good and Virtuous Person would resent it, in his own Case. For, <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>I</hi> saith he, <hi>had rather have it said, and should think he wronged me less, who should say, there never was, nor is, such a Man as</hi> Plutarch: <hi>Than have another affirm, yes, there is such a Person: But he is a Man of no Steadiness, Mutable, Angry, Greedy of Revenge for every light Cause, that will fall out with you for Trifles, and if you are wanting in any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, would be ready to grew your Flesh, or stay your Son, or turn in Cattle to trample down and devour your Corn.</hi> And Answerably, the fixing these, or any such like Immoral and Blasphemous Characters on <hi>God,</hi> he thinks, is <hi>not less Impious,</hi> than <hi>Atheism</hi> it self is.</p>
               <p>And should these fore-said ways prove Immoralities, both in Practice, and in publick Prayers and Devotions; those few deprived Bishops and Clergy in any Kingdom, who suffer for standing out against the same, when the most run into them, cannot but see Men generally Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up therein.</p>
               <p>For, as to the <hi>Practice of those Immoralities,</hi> carnal Reasons, and the course of the Times, and the Terror of the present Powers, will make them go down with most Men. And their Spiritual Guides, will nurse and train them up therein, if once they themselves are generally got in to go along therewith, and to do the same. Nay, when a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Persecution is raised, to drive on the unwilling, and to force them


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44279:14"/>
to comply for external Interests; they will then stand ready to carry on the same, with regard to Conscience. If any start, or stand off, when consulted, they direct, and perswade them to come in, as they see they themselves have done, and tell them, it will be no matter of Guilt, or of Spiritual Danger to them. And when once they are got in, they speak, and Preach Peace to them, that they may feel no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse for so doing, nor Harbour any Thoughts of Returning. And to take off all apparant Inconsistence; from the Commands of <hi>God,</hi> and the Duties of Religion, about Oaths, and Obedience to Governours, and Common Justice, and not coveting or invading other Mens Goods or Rights, and the like, that are ready to fly in their Faces, and bear hardest on what they have done: They start doctrinal <hi>Salvo</hi>'s for all these Precepts, to cover their own Ways, from falling under the same, and to prove there is no Sin therein, notwithstanding all the seemingly plain, and Literal Opposition, which those Precepts and Duties bear to them.</p>
               <p>And then, as to these same Immoralities, in publick Worship and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions; if these ways should really prove Immoralities, at such Times they are plainly Nursed up in them, because they are part of the <hi>Daily Prayers,</hi> and, on Occasion, are the fet <hi>Fasts</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> in all the publick Churches and Assemblies. The authorised and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd Guides and Pastors, every where then observe and use them, (such States not Authorizing and Establishing, but Depriving the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusers thereof;) and put them into the Peoples Mouths, if they will follow and say after their Leaders. And this is to be train'd and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up in such Devotions, in such sort as People are trained up in any Devotions by their Guides: that is, by being convened and call'd to them, and, in the publick Ministration, lead on therein; the Pastors part, as to this, lying in Leading, as the Peoples doth in Following them.</p>
               <p>So that the People in such cases, are generally trained, and nursed up, in these Practices and Devotions. Which, if, for want of Legal Right or Just Title in their New Governour, and for the Continuance of the same in his Competitor, they prove Unrighteous and Immoral Ones; they would be nursed up, in Immoral Practices and Devotions. And what Obligation that would lay, on the Suffering and Deprived Bishops and Clergy of those Countries, for Pastoral Ministrations, will appear, by Considering,</p>

               <p>NOw, if under such Revolutions, for want of such Right and Title in the New Governor, and for continuance of the same in his Competitor, all the foresaid Practices and Devotions are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and immoral in themselves; this Exercise of their Ministrations, for provision and spiritual supply of all conscionable Adherers to Truth, and to Morality in Practise and Devotions, is to be expected of them, from the <hi>reality and obligation of things.</hi> If they think them to be so, and they are such in their Judgments; 'tis to be expected from <hi>Men of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,</hi> and for them to act so, is but to be true to their own Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. If their Brethren own the ejected Prince, to have Legal Right still, or to be King <hi>de jure; they ought to expect no other from them,</hi> since that alone makes all the foresaid immoralities, and they can do no less, if they will act according to that Principle, which is owned and professed by themselves. The only Ground, whereon in Truth they could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from this Exercise, and therefore on which alone it can with Reason be desired, or expected from them, is the <hi>Translation of the Legal Right;</hi> which would remove these immoralities. So, that they can only blame them for this Exercise, who believe the Translation of this Legal Right; nor can they make it appear, that they blame them with Justice, but by clearing this Point, and making Proof thereof.</p>
               <p>Their Obligations, to exercise their Powers and Ministrations at such times, are to provide against the wants and dangers of the Souls of Men, and against the corruptions of Religion. And that, which will be ready at the same time, to be alledged against it, will be the <hi>Inhibition and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of the New State,</hi> and the appearance of <hi>rending the Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> which is then become united under other Pastors put into their place, or of <hi>making of a Schism.</hi> And therefore, to give a clear Prospect, and for making a truer Judgment of the Obligations, which they stand under to this exercise on such Revolutions, I think it may be of use to consider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In what Cases, the good and faithful Bishops and Ministers of Christ, are Bound to stick to their Spiritual Powers and Pastoral Ministrations, and what Obligations they have to do so.</hi>

2. <hi>Of what force a Deprivation of Estate, or the Preservation of external Communion and Peace in the Church, ought to be, in debarring them thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> I shall consider, <hi>in what Cases, the good and faithful Bishops and Ministers of Christ, are Bound to stick to their Spiritual Powers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal Ministrations, and what Obligations they have to do so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I shall <hi>First</hi> speak to <hi>the Cases, wherein they are Bound to stick to their Spiritual Powers and Pastoral Ministrations, and are to go on acting as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Pastors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, this they are Bound to, <hi>when there is need of it in the Cause of Religion, and for the safety of the Souls of Men.</hi> For these Ministerial Powers, are Sacred Trusts. And the very end, why they are intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Bishops and Pastors, is, that thereby they may take care of Religion and the Peoples Souls, and provide for the needs thereof. So that they are always to be trustily Exercised, when these stand in Need of them: or, whenever the Souls of Men will be Endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd, and Religion Damnified, by the Pastors omitting such Exercise and Ministration, in the places where they are concern'd.</p>
               <p>I say, they are bound then <hi>to provide such Ministrations.</hi> For the Part of Bishops and Pastors, is not, like that of mere Lay Christians, to communicate as they can, in what is provided for them by others. But as Pastors, they are to make Provisions. The Work of Ministers and Pastors, lies <hi>in Feeding of the Churches. This Feeding of Ministers, is Feeding them with Religious Offices and Ministrations.</hi> These, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are to partake in; but the Pastors are to Provide, and Administer them. And this, as Religion, and the Souls of Men stand in need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And they always need a Provision of such <hi>Ministrations,</hi> both of the <hi>Word,</hi> of <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as may Edifie but not Pervert, and Purge but not Pollute those, that seek to communicate therein. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it lies upon them, I conceive, to provide and supply the Churches,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>With an Holy, or Sinless, and Unpolluted Worship, and such as may recommend the Worshippers to God, and is fit to be accepted,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing, <hi>that the Souls of Men may seem to need more, than such an Holy Worship.</hi> For the Worship of <hi>God,</hi> is that, whereby in an Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, they are to serve and please him: whereby, they must seek to expiate, and attone him after any Offences, which they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against him: whereby, they can gain his Favour, and Aid; it not only being the great means of their procuring, but also an establish'd Way of his Conveying and Deriving down to the Souls of his Servants, those Spiritual Graces and Blessings, which they need and long for. The Ministrations of Worship, are the <hi>Ministrations of the Spirit,</hi> to Minister and afford Grace to those who duly seek it; and so will be owned of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Necessity, to all who see what need they have of the Divine


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44279:15"/>
Grace and Bounty. And since the Worship of <hi>God</hi> is to stand them in so much Stead, they have need enough to have it Pure and Pleasing, that the Medicine be not turned into Poyson; that it do not affront and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke <hi>God,</hi> instead of gaining and appeasing him; and stop Blessings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of bringing them down.</p>
               <p>There is nothing also, that <hi>Religion lies more in.</hi> The Worship of <hi>God,</hi> is the most Direct and Immediate Act, and the most express and open Profession of Religion. It is a Service both Solemnly and Professedly Performed in the Presence, and immediately to the Person of <hi>God.</hi> And being so directly and immediately concern'd with it in Person, he is more nicely Tender of any Prophanation, or Wrong to him therein. 'Tis particularly in matters of his <hi>Worship,</hi> that he declares himself a <hi>Jealous God,</hi> in the <hi>Second Commandement.</hi> When Sin and Wickedness is sent up to him there, his own Person is immediately struck at. Instead of being Served and Honoured, he is Aspersed and Blasphemed by it. For such an Unholy Worship, Asperses and Slanders him, as if he were an Unholy <hi>God.</hi> 'Tis a Profession, to serve, and gain him, by wicked Ways; which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents him, as taking Pleasure in ill Things, and being ready to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize them; fixing upon him, our own Violences, and making him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as bad, as we our selves are. And this is a most horrible Prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Blasphemously foul Aspersion, thrown upon the purest of all Beings. It is a turning Piety into Prophaneness; and our very Prayers into Libels, and Reproaches. So that if Men would have their Worship, truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; or such as may truly Represent and Honour <hi>God,</hi> not Disgrace and Bolye him: they must take care above all things, to preserve it free from all Prophane Matter, and Sinful Mixtures. As the Worship, is of an <hi>Holy God;</hi> so must what is Offer'd to him, be an Holy Worship. <note n="†" place="margin">Psal. 93. 4. &amp; Ps. 26. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Holiness becomes his House,</hi> and more especially his Service. His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, must put up Holy Prayers, and not have their Prayers turn'd into Sin, or their Sins presented to <hi>God</hi> therein, which would turn Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into an Abomination.</p>
               <p>And this is True, of all sorts of Sins, either <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> or <hi>Immeralities.</hi> The needs of Religion, and of the Church require, that Worship and Devotions be kept free from both, and that neither of them mix and incorporate therewith. Immoral Prayers, as well as Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Ones, are a Blasphemous Libel upon <hi>God,</hi> and an utter Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Prostitution of Worship and Devotion; they turn Prayer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Abomination, and call down a Curse instead of a Blessing. And thus it was in the Heathen Devotions, which were not only <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> as being paid to False <hi>Gods:</hi> but too often <hi>Immoral</hi> and <hi>Impure,</hi> as being paid to Vicious and Dishonest Deities. <hi>Mercury,</hi> by their account was addicted to <hi>Theft; Venus,</hi> to <hi>Whoredom; Bacchus,</hi> to <hi>Revelling</hi> and <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness;</hi>


                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:44279:16"/>
as others were to other Immoralities. And setting up such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral Deities, no wonder they should be <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Dr.</hi> Hammond. <hi>Annot. in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Not.</hi> 1.</note> found paying them Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Services; and together with their <hi>Idolatrous Sacrifices,</hi> offering up also Immoral Services, as Uncleanness, Drunkenness, and Revellings, in their Temples. And these Immoralities, in <hi>Lasciviousness and Excess of Wine,</hi> as well as the Mis-applications of Worship therein, were the most Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prophanation and Blasphemous Reproach of <hi>God,</hi> and made them <hi>Abominable Idolatries,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> says, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
               <p>These Immoralities, whilst they find a place only in Practise, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in, stop the Acceptance of Devotions. And so <hi>God</hi> told the <hi>Iews</hi> by his Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> that till he saw a Course of <hi>Judgment and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, he should hate and despise their Feast Days, and not Smell in their Solomn Assemblies, nor accept their Burnt. Offerings or Peace-Offerings, nor hear their Hymns and Songs of Praise,</hi> Amos 5. 21, 22, 23, 24. And the same he declares to them, by <hi>Isaiah, Is.</hi> 1. 11, to v. 18. and by <hi>Ieremiah, Jer.</hi> 6. 6, 20. And if they have such Fatal Effects, when presented to him only in Practice; what will they have when presented to him in Solomn Worship and Prayers, which makes the Prophanation thereof so much more Staring and Audacious, and the Provocation abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more Hainous.</p>
               <p>Now these Sinless Prayers, free from Immorality, as well as from Idolatry, which Religion and the Souls of Men stand in such need of, it must be the Care of Pastors, to provide and Supply them with. As <hi>Ministers of Prayers,</hi> they must see that such be administred to them. Yea, as <hi>God</hi> himself <hi>is Jealous of his Honour,</hi> in these Services: So must they, as his <hi>Substitutes</hi> and <hi>Representatives, be Iealous for him,</hi> to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and preserve Purity therein. And that, to invite Honest and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Tempers, to resort to Prayers and Divine Service: as well as to prevent their contracting Guilt, and Prophaning <hi>God</hi> instead of Pleasing him, when they are met there. For wicked and unrighteous Prayers, extreamly disturb Righteous Petitioners, and drive away truly Plous and Devout Minds, making them <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I do not say, there is the same need of affording the People of God this pure Worship, <hi>free from the Company of Immoral Practisers.</hi> The Congregation of Worshippers, or Church of <hi>God</hi> in this World, is like to be a <hi>Mixture of Persons;</hi> or as a <hi>Field,</hi> wherein <hi>Tares will grow mixt with the Wheat,</hi> till at the general <hi>Harvest, they come to be seperated and Weeded out by the Angels,</hi> as our <hi>Lord</hi>

the Devotion of others, and intercept the Blessing from those good Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticers, who joyn with them in publick Offices. And this is the Error of those, among our Dissenters, who have insisted on the Plea of <hi>mixt Communions,</hi> meaning thereby, a <hi>Mixture of Persons,</hi> or of good and bad Practisers in <hi>Gods</hi> Worship and Service, which they pretend should be made up of <hi>Saints,</hi> or of <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Regenerate Souls.</hi> Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, I grant, in such Sort, as may be most Medicinal to the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themselves, and to preserve Religion from the stain, and the sound Members from the Infection of such Companions, are to remove such, (especially when the Immoralities are Gross and Notorious,) from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by Church-Censurers, so far as may be profitably and prudently done in Course of Discipline, and as Times and Circumstances, and the State of a Church in this corrupt and mixt World, will bear. But this will be no absolute Provision against them; and after all, the Church here will have a Mixture of Persons, or good and bad to meet together in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Offices, and 'tis not for any, to break Communion with it thereupon.</p>
               <p>But, though they are not universally to keep out Immoral Practisers; yet they are to keep out Immoral Prayers from publick Ministrations. For these are offer'd to all that come, though only fit to Poyson, not to Nourish them: And are put up to <hi>God,</hi> in the Name of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and so are a publick, visible, and professed Dishonour to him. So that they, who have the Care of publick Worship, must take care to Purge them out of it.</p>
               <p>It will be incumbent on them, to supply the Church,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>With the Ministration of all that Truth, which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be believed, or Practised.</hi> The <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Preaching of these Truths,</hi> is to bear up Religion, and to save the Souls of Men. And the <hi>Ministry of this Word,</hi> is committed unto them.</p>
               <p>This Ministration must be of <hi>all Necessary Truth.</hi> What our <hi>Lord</hi> intrusted with the Apostles, and, in them, with the Bishops and Pastors of the Church <hi>to the end of the world,</hi> is, <hi>to Teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded:</hi> Where <hi>all things,</hi> must needs take in all that are necessary. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his <hi>Cure of Souls,</hi> pleads himself <hi>pure of the Blood of all Men,</hi> as having <hi>deolared to them the whole Counsel of God,</hi> which their <hi>Blood</hi> might any way depend upon, and having <hi>kept back nothing that was Profitable to them,</hi> Acts 20. 26, 27. For in these Points, if the People perish through the <hi>Watch-Mans being Dumb,</hi> or for <hi>want of his giving warning;</hi> the People Die, indeed, and <hi>are taken away in their Iniquity, but their Blood will God require at the Watch-Mans Hand,</hi> Ezek. 33. 6, 8. As for inferior Truths, which are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly necessary for Christians to know and to be instructed in; but in


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44279:17"/>
their Nature, are more indifferent: They may be forborn for Peace, as need requires, and to prevent great Stirs and Divisions in the Church. But Truths of Necessity and Importance, must not be neglected, or given up on such Pretences.</p>
               <p>And it must be a Ministration of all that is necessary, <hi>whether in Faith, or Practice.</hi> That which makes either, to be a necessary part of their Ministration, is, because they are necessary parts of Religion, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the Souls of Men. And this makes an equal Necessity, of Ministring both. For Obedience, is as Necessary, and indispensable a Branch of the Gospel, as Faith: And Practical Opinions, are as much set by, as Propositions about Faith; and as much Dishonour may accrue to <hi>God,</hi> and as much Danger to the Souls of Men, by Practical, as by Speculative Heresies. Nay, many times more, since matters of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and Practice, are more naturally imprinted on all Mens Hearts, and are more easy and obvious to all Understandings. They lye open, to the Unlearned, as well as to Learned Men. Yea, the Ignorant and Unlearned, oft-times continue to see them, when the Learned overlook them: a little Skill, with a sufficient Degree of Honesty, qualifying Men to discern these Matters; and there not being so much need of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in those, who would descry, as there is in those, who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and mistake them. And this makes the Mistakes of Men, in these Points, both more Dangerous to themselves, and more Dishonourable to Religion. For being so generally known, or easy of Knowledge: There is not like Room in them, for Extenuation and Excuse, of Error or Ignorance; as there is in Speculations of Faith, that are of harder Examination, and lie further off; which renders Practical Heresies oft-times more <hi>Dangerous.</hi> And on the same Account, the Dishonour to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> thereby, is more universally noted, being more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly Apparant, and more sensibly Disgusting, to the Generality of Beholders: Which makes them also, more <hi>Disgraceful</hi> and <hi>Standalous.</hi> And therefore they stand particularly bound, to Minister the Word, and give warning, in these Points: Both as what would oft-times more surely, and irremediably shed the <hi>Blood of Souls;</hi> and as what would prove more Scandalous in the Sight of all considerate Persons, and make Religion more generally <hi>Despised, Blasphemed,</hi> and <hi>evil Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Particularly, it will be incumbent on them to supply the Church with the Ministration of Necessary Practical Truths,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When Dangerous and Immoral Practices are setting up.</hi> Especially, if they are setting up generally, and most People are in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn into them: As when they come dressed up, with Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and Recommendations of Wordly Ease, or Interests; or are

               <p>These Immoral Practices, tho' the Immoral Things are only Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but not Justified, are most Dangerous and Destructive to those Souls, who are involved therein.

They are the Spiritual Weaknesses, and Diseases of Souls, their Strayings, and Loosing of themselves, in Wrong and Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ways. And the Duty of Shepheards, is not to stand off, or to keep Silent when these Maladies have seized the Flocks; but to shew their Pastoral Care, and make Provision for them. They are, as <hi>God</hi> tells the <hi>Shepheards</hi> by <hi>Ezekiel, to Heal that which they find to be Sick, by applying proper Remedies;</hi> and <hi>to Strengthen that which is Diseased,</hi> Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with wholesome Doctrine, or <note n="†" place="margin">Bonit Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis.

               <p>I do not say Immoral Practices, are a Cause for Pastors to <hi>Seperate Communions.</hi> For Immorality, whilst confined to Practice and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, and not crept into Worship and Prayers, doth not hinder all Communion in Divine Service. Nor are we to seperate from any Church in Divine Offices. because of a <hi>Mixture of Persons,</hi> or of their having Moral and Immoral Livers among them, as I observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>But they are an obliging Call to them, <hi>to Minister the Word, to put a stop to them.</hi> And if they cannot be allowed to do this in Communion with others; they must do it however, by breaking off from them, and Officiating by themselves. And such Breach, to say nothing of other Grounds, is consequential upon the Ministrations of the deprived Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, on such Revolutions. They are by their Deprivation Secluded from Ministring in the Authorized and Established Churches; and so must act seperately, and Minister by themselves, if they are bound to Minister the Word at all.</p>

Which, having imbibed to corrupt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging to clear and justifie themselves; they will teach and propagate among others. And when, by venting corrupt Principles and Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, False Guides set up for Teachers of ill Things: 'Tis high time, for True and Faithful Guides, to open their Mouths, and to strive for Truth and Righteonsness against them. They are <hi>ill Watch-Men,</hi> if they are a sleep, or silent, at such a Time. And <hi>ill Shepheards,</hi> if they take no care to lay wholesome things before the Flocks, and to drive away unwholesome, when <hi>the Speakers of Perverse Things,</hi> are endeavouring to Poyson them. And <hi>Unfaithful Stewards,</hi> and <hi>Dispensers of the Word,</hi> if, instead of dispensing it out, they smother and suppress it, when the Church is in the greatest need to be informed thereof.</p>
               <p>Particularly, they are obliged to this Ministration, when the ill and Immoral Practices are <hi>Justified.</hi>

Both which happen, in Case of Injustice, to dispossessed Princes, and of turning Allegiance against them; which concern all the Subjects of such Princes, and will continue so to do, till the Competition ceaseth.</p>
               <p>Now these Immoralities in particular Cases, are the Immoralities, that will destroy Souls, when those Cases happen. It is in particular Cases, that particular Persons are Guilty of them, and liable to be condemned for them. So, 'tis in particular Cases, that they need to be warned against them, and shew'd the Danger of them.</p>
               <p>And the giving them this Warning, in such particular Cases, as they come, is the Business of the <hi>Watch-Man.</hi> For he is set to Watch particular Cases, and against particular Occurrences; and is to call out and give warning, as oft as he espies any Harm, or Danger approaching therein.

And if, like Men asleep, they take no Notice of Vices, when catching and over-runing their Flocks, nor open their Mouths against them; the Scripture brands and upraids them, as it did the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Watch-Men of Israel,</hi> with the Name of <hi>Dumb Dogs that cannot Bark:</hi> It being <hi>the Office of Priests and Prophets,</hi> to <hi>reprehend</hi> and open their Mouths, against approaching <hi>Vices, as it is of Dogs</hi> set to watch the House, to open theirs, <hi>and Bark against approaching Thieves,</hi> as <note n="†" place="margin">ad loc.</note>

               <p>It is the Office of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Shepheards,</hi> to have an Eye to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of Time and Place, and to Watch over their Flocks in particular Cases.

Their <hi>Feeding of their Flocks,</hi> must be by <hi>Strengthning them</hi> in any Case, where they see them <hi>Diseased;</hi> or <hi>Healing them,</hi> where they find them <hi>Sick;</hi> or <hi>Seeking after them,</hi> when they are <hi>Lost;</hi> and <hi>bringing them back</hi> at any Time, when they are <hi>gone Astray,</hi> or <hi>are Driven away,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> tells the <hi>Shepheards of Israel,</hi> Ezek. 34. 3, 4.

To see, that none of the <hi>Family</hi> Starve, or <hi>go astray</hi> for want thereof, in a trying Time; but that all have what <hi>Portion of it they need, in due Season,</hi> Luk. 12. 42.

               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:44279:19"/>
It is the Work and Profession of <hi>Guides of Souls,</hi> to direct them in all particular Occurrences, and to set them Right in all Cases: And if at any time, they see them about to mistake their Way, to shew them which Path they ought to keep; or, if they see they are gone wrong, to call out to them to come back again. They are such <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>Guides</hi> or <hi>Leaders,</hi> as are intrusted with, and <hi>must give an Account of Souls:</hi> And so are strictly bound to see, that they do not may, nor perish in any Case, for Want of true and careful Guidance and Direction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
               <p>So that particular Cases, which are the Times of the Peoples Needs, must be Times of the Pastors Ministrations. Especially such particular Cases, wherein the Generality are like to run into Deadly Sin, and are like to be daily Repeating the same, and, for ought appears, to continue long therein.</p>
               <p>And therefore in such Cases, if Immoral Things are not only practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but justified; the True Pastors are more highly bound to Warn the Church, and to shew the Guilt and Danger thereof. The mere Justification of them in such particular Case, without any further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions or False Doctrines about them, is enough to require this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration at their Hands. For, when such Immoral Things, are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; Sin is not only Practised, but it, and Death, are generally recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. Men are taught then, to <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>call Evil, Good;</hi> and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Sin, without Remorse or Shame; and to meet Death, without Fear, or Sence of Danger. And what is there left then to restrain them, from Corrupting themselves therewith, according as they are lead thereto, by their own Interests, Ease, or Inclinations; or by the Power, or Perswasions of others? So that Sin, and Death, here Ride Triumphant, and go on without Opposition. And that sure, is a loud Call for the Ministers of Righteousness, to stir up their Ministerial Powers, to put a stop thereto, and to save the Souls they are set to Minister to, from being polluted and destroyed by them. They would be <hi>ill Ministers of the Word,</hi> should they administer no Word, but keep silent; and <hi>ill Watch-Men</hi> for their several Charges, should they give no Warning; <hi>ill Stewards of the House-Hold,</hi> should they make no Provision; <hi>ill Shepheards of the Flocks</hi> should they neglect to Feed and Minister to them; and <hi>ill Guides of Souls,</hi> should they fail to shew the Way, and to give Directions, how they may avoid both Sin and Death, so fairly and invitingly recommended to them, and so hastily coming upon them, in these Cases.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV <hi>More of the Cases, wherein faithful Bishops and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, are bound to stick to their Pastoral Powers and Ministrations.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BUT when Immoral and Unrighteous Practices, are Justified in any particular Case: Since those Practices are litterally and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly Condemned by Moral Precepts, they who pretend to Justifie them, must find some way to reconcile and take off those Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. So that this Justification of Immoral Practices in a particular Case, will be sure to bring on another Step, which will make this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of all true Pastors still more Necessary, and that is,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>The eluding, or vacating of Moral Duties, and Precepts opposite thereto, by Doctrinal Salvo's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Men both act, and justifie immoral things, they do not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily renounce the Duties transgressed thereby, under their general and received Names; but start such Doctrines and Principles about them, for Salvo's, as elude, or vacate them in Practice.</p>
               <p>Thus, the <hi>Jesuites</hi> allow the sinfulnes of Lying. But they say, what is Spoken is no Lye, if they can make it a Truth by a <hi>Mental Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> or by the <hi>Aequivocalness</hi> and <hi>Ambiguity,</hi> of any Words or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, whereby it is Expressed.</p>
               <p>Thus also others admit the Damnableness, of <hi>Resisting the Higher Power,</hi> according to St. <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ro.</hi> 23. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> or of <hi>Raising Rebellion.</hi> But they say, this is only resisting them, whilst they keep to Laws, and within the Bounds of Legal Powers, and the Frame of the Government; not when they go beyond them. They own, that by the <hi>Fifth Commandement,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptural <hi>Precepts,</hi> Allegiance is due to their Soveraign Prince. But they teach withal, sometimes, as the <hi>Papists,</hi> that it is in the Power of the <hi>Pope;</hi> or, as others, that it is in the power of the People; to depose their Princes, and then they are no longer Soveraigns. And thereby, to Absolve and Discharge themselves, from owing and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them any more Allegiance. Which Positions, for <hi>Deposing Princes,</hi> and for <hi>Absolving Subjects from their Allegiance</hi> to them, have passed in the Account of our Laws and Church, for <hi>Damnable Doctrines.</hi> Or else they say, that this Allegiance, is due <hi>for the Sake of Publick Good;</hi>


                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44279:20"/>
and that whether the Soveraign himself, whose Right it is, Discharge it or no, Publick Good, when it interferes, will give a Discharge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Or again, that it is due, <hi>only on Account of Actual Administration,</hi> and is still to follow the <hi>King in Fact:</hi> And so is no longer Due to their Lawful King, if once another hath Forcibly Dispossessed him.</p>
               <p>Further yet, some allow the <hi>Sacredness</hi> and <hi>Obligations of Oaths;</hi> particularly of the <hi>Oath of Allegiance to Princes.</hi> But they teach more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, sometimes, that all this Sacred Obligation, is only to some <hi>Feigned Softning and lower Senses</hi> of their own, neither suiting with the Nature of things, nor with the Ordinary and Honest Use of Words, and with the Simplicity and plain Dealing of Promises and Solemn Declarations. Nay, nor with their own ensuing Practice and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof, they, who in Swearing, declared for a lower, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards paying and practising an higher Sence; as all will be call'd to do in course of their Obedience, who profess Allegiance to any as their Civil Governours. Or else, that all this Sacred Obligation of the Oath of Allegiance, is <hi>in Subordination to the Antecedent</hi> and <hi>Superior Obligation of Publick Good,</hi> and that it will Absolve and Discharge them from it.</p>
               <p>Again, they admit the unlawfulness of <hi>Stealing,</hi> or of taking another Man's Goods, or Crown, against the <hi>Eighth;</hi> or of <hi>Coveting</hi> them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Tenth Commandment.</hi> But they teach also, which roots up the Foundations of common Honesty and Justice, that if Providence has at any time assisted an Invader to get them from him, the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der has thereby got a <hi>Providential Right</hi> thereto, which is the best Right; and that after that, they may <hi>lawfully maintain him, in his Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Possession; and may Innocently keep the other, whom themselves own still to have the Legal Right, out of the Possession of his Right,</hi> yea; and may with a safe Conscience force any Remaining Parts out of his Hands, which he shall Happen to continue still Possessed of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> Admitting <hi>the ordinary Wickedness</hi> and <hi>Destructiveness, of such Breach of Oaths,</hi> and of open <hi>Injustice,</hi> &amp;c. yet many think all may be salved, by <hi>the Maintainance and Preservation of some other Duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, which are of more worth,</hi> as of <hi>Orthodox Faith,</hi> or of <hi>Purity of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Worship</hi> and <hi>Divine Service. Thus the Jews, who Sware by the Name of the Lord, but not in Truth, viz.</hi> Swearing Falsly what they never meant nor intended; <hi>nor in Righteousness, viz.</hi> promising to do what was very Unrighteous and Unjust. And yet, as <hi>God</hi> taxes them by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> they thought to salve all, and <hi>would stay themselves upon the God of Israel,</hi> by <hi>calling themselves of the Holy City,</hi> or by retaining <hi>God</hi>s Temple and true Worship still among them, <hi>Is.</hi> 48. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:44279:20"/>
Such as these, are the Doctrinal Salvo's, whereby Men, who in the General would continue to own, and to profess Moral Duties and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, do notwithstanding study to reconcile them with some beloved and Justified Practices, which are a literal and down-right Breach thereof.</p>
               <p>Now, though for Silencing of their own Consciences, or in Fear of Worldly Shame, in these, and the like Cases, Men still own the Duty in general Words: yet, by these opposite Principles and Doctrinal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo's, do they Elude and Vacate them in Practice. That is, under Shelter of these opposite Doctrines, they practice against those Duties, and Justifie themselves therein, as if there were no such Duties to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain, nor general Words to forbid them.</p>
               <p>Under the Doctrinal Solvo's, of <hi>Aequivocations</hi> and <hi>Mental Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,</hi> for instance, they think themselves true Men, all the time they are telling horrid Lies. And under the aforesaid Doctrinal Limitation, of the <hi>Damnableness of Resistance,</hi> to <hi>Legal Actings and Administrations of Princes;</hi> they believe themselves good Subjects, whilst they are most wickedly Levying War, and Rebelling against <hi>God</hi>'s Ordinance. Thus likewise, under the Doctrinal Salvo's, of the <hi>Popes,</hi> or <hi>Peoples Power to Depose Kings,</hi> and to <hi>Discharge their Subjects of their Obedience;</hi> of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance being Due, only to a King in Fact;</hi> or whilst the Payment of it makes as they conceive, <hi>for the Publick Good:</hi> may they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Unreprovable in Duty and Loyalty to their Lawful King, though all the while they appear both to <hi>God</hi> and Man, as if they ought him nothing; yea, tho' both by Prayers and Practice, they openly resist him, and oppose and set themselves against him. And by confining the <hi>Obligation of Oaths of Allegiance,</hi> to their <hi>own Arbitrary Senses;</hi> or, by Cancelling them, by <hi>Antecedent Obligations of Publick Good:</hi> They may Fancy themselves keeping Faith, all the time they are wofully breaking it; and that they are observing Oaths, tho, all the while at their extream Peril, they are Litterally Forswearing themselves. And under Shelter of the aforesaid <hi>Providential Right,</hi> to what an Invader has unjustly got into his Possession: They may take themselves for Just and Righteous Persons, whilst all the time they are wickedly and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly backing Violence and Wrong; and helping one to hold, what they believe and know he hath unjustly got; and keeping the injured and oppressed Person, out of his own. And this is making <hi>God</hi>'s Laws of no Effect in Practice, however they may still be owned, in general Names and Acknowledgments; since, in their Actions, Men may do Contrary, as Securely and Warrantably, as if there were no such Laws at all. Thus it was, with the Salvo of the <hi>Vow Corban</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to get clear of the Duty, of <hi>Honouring and supporting Parents.</hi> And


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44279:21"/>
with other Salvo's about <hi>Oaths,</hi> and <hi>other-Commandments.</hi> And these our Saviour call'd, <hi>a making void the Commandments of God through their Doctrinal Traditions,</hi> Mat. 15. 5, 6. and Cap. 22.</p>
               <p>And where this is the Case, it must not be said, on the Account of their still Owning and Preaching up the Moral Duties, under their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Names, that <hi>Men have made no Change of Moral Doctrines.</hi> They may have made none, but say the same, as to <hi>general Doctrines, viz.</hi> that in the General, there lies an Obligation upon Men, <hi>to keep Faith</hi> and <hi>Oaths,</hi> and to be <hi>Obedient and Passive under Governors,</hi> and <hi>to do Justice to Proprietors,</hi> and the like. And so the <hi>Pharise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> would in the General own, <hi>the Duty of Supporting Parents,</hi> and those other Duties, which they made void in Practice. But these general and abstracted Doctrines, lie further off; and some other Doctrines more circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate give them their proper Limitations, and teach the Obligation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and how far they are Duties in particular Cases, must come between them and the Practice of Men, which lies all in such particular Cases. And in these nearer, and more limited and circumstantiate Doctrines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the foresaid moral Duties, there is a Change, when Men fall to start the foresaid Salvo's. Yea, such a Change, as intercepts all the Force of the General Doctrines, and teaches and authorizes Men, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding those general Doctrines, to Practise otherwise. And such as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> made, for which they are charged by our Saviour, <hi>for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king void God's Laws;</hi> which certainly is to make a woful Change thereof. These salving Doctrines, are all changes of Doctrine; and the Preachers thereof at such times, make as great a change of Moral Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as is necessary to make a change of Moral Practices. And tho' they may not all Agree, in any one of these Salvo's, or changes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Doctrine; as Men are not so like to do when they are going wrong, the ways of Error being Infinite, tho' the way of Truth is but One. Yet if once they all Agree, not only in following; but in justifying and teaching the Immoral Practices; they must all do it, upon one or other of these new salving Doctrines, which Men, not hardy enough to decry moral Duties under their general Names, must each of them chuse for themselves as they see Cause.</p>
               <p>Now, when such changes of Practical Doctrine are introduced, and Moral Duties and Precepts are thus eluded and vacated, by Doctrinal Salvo's and Limitations: 'Tis more highly incumbent still, on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of <hi>Christ,</hi> to stand up in his Cause, and to administer his Word, in Defence thereof. They are Ministers of Religion, and must not see it suffer in any of its Articles, or Duties; but, as its appointed Officers and Advocates, must guard and maintain them. These Articles and Duties, are a Trust divinely committed to them. <note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O!</hi> Timothy, <hi>keep that which was committed to thy Trust,</hi> saith he again, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>Hold it fast,</hi> and <hi>in the Form of found Words,</hi> wherein it was delivered, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. He trusts to them; not only to keep and retain them, but to defend and plead for them. <hi>I am set for the Defence of the Gospel,</hi> Phil. 1. 17. To take care, that they be transmitted down to others, who shall come next in Succession. <hi>The things, that thou hast heard of me, the same commit thou to Faithful Men, who shall be able to Teach others therein,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 2. And having received such Sacred Trusts, they must shew a strict Fidelity, in Discharge thereof. St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs <hi>Timothy, to commit them to Faithful Men,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 2. And saith, <hi>Christ committed the Gospel to his Trust,</hi> and <hi>put him into the Ministry</hi> of it <hi>counting him Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 11, 12. And all this <hi>Fidelity,</hi> is to be the <hi>Fidelity of Ministers,</hi> who are intrusted, not only with the private Keeping and Profession; but with the publick Ministration of these Articles, and Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Duties. So that their Keeping, and holding fast to them; is their Keeping and Holding, to the Preaching, and Ministration of them; and by that same <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Ministration,</hi> are they to defend them in the present Age, and to deliver them over to Posterity.</p>
               <p>And therefore, when any Moral Duties or Precepts, deposited and intrusted with them, are endanger'd, and Attempts are made to elude or vacate them: They are tryed, how true they will prove to their Trusts, of <hi>Ministerial Keeping,</hi> and <hi>Defending,</hi> and <hi>transmitting of them down.</hi> And then, they must not desert them, but stand up and act for them, by a Faithful Administration. If others treacherously reject them, or bend their Wits to vacate them, and render them of no effect; they must not run in, to give their Voice with them; nor by their uncontesting Silence, and base yielding, betray, and give up that <hi>Sacred Depositum,</hi> which was intrusted to their Custody and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
               <p>This ministerial Maintenance and Administration of Moral Precepts, when thus changed and vacated by corrupt Salvo's, <hi>God</hi> expected from all <hi>True Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Faithful Shepheards</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44279:22"/>
Corruption of Principles. For they had made them first to believe, that there is no Sin in these their Doings; which they had studied to shelter by Salvo's of their own Invention, from the censure of those Laws, which seemed plainly to forbid them. <hi>They commit Adultery, and walk in Lies,</hi> i. e. in Lying Salvo's and Adulteration of moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, making the Preservation of <hi>Gods Worship and Temple,</hi> a Shelter for these Vices and Immoralities, as <note n="†" place="margin">

But now, when the <hi>False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and <hi>unfaithful Shepheards,</hi> set themselves by such corrupt Salvo's, to clude and vacate moral Precepts <hi>God</hi> expected of all the True and Faithful Shepheards, that they should stand up against them, for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, and Maintenance thereof. <hi>They should have stood in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and have caused his People to hear his Word, to turn them from those evil ways,</hi> which the False Teachers labour'd to strengthen and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them in, by their Lying Salvo's, ver. 22. If any <hi>Prophets had his Word,</hi> he expected they should <hi>speak it Faithfully,</hi> ver. 28. That <hi>his VVord should be in them like a Fire,</hi> bursting out with Violence, and not sparing any that stood in its way, as the False Prophets, those false and flattering Accomodators, were wont to do; <hi>and like an Hammer, that breaks the Rock in Pieces,</hi> striking on the most obdurate, when the other, in their soothing ways, were wont to stroak them, ver. 29.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> God complains of the <hi>False Prophets,</hi> for <hi>Daubing</hi> over Immoral Practices <hi>with untemper'd Mortar,</hi> i. e, with corrupt Salvo's, to cover them from the Censure and Condemnation of moral Precepts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 10, 11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their <hi>Daubing,</hi> was by such Covers, or Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as were <hi>Visions of Peace;</hi> or to shew the Evil-Doers, how they did not break with <hi>God,</hi> and moral Duties, by these their immoral Practices, ver. 15, 16. This he also calls, <hi>making Kerchiefs</hi> or <hi>Vales,</hi> their end being to hide all Appearance of Sin and Deformity in these Actings; and saith, <hi>they fitted them to every Stature,</hi> ver. 18, 21. And <hi>by these Lies,</hi> or Lying Salvo's, <hi>they</hi> made Men believe, that there was no Breach of moral Precepts in these immoral Practices, nor any Danger of Death thereby; and so <hi>strengthned the Hands of the VVicked, that he should not return from his wicked VVay, by promising him Life</hi> though he went on therein, ver. 22. But if any true Prophets, who saw this, should keep silence; or, out of selfish Subtlety, should Skulk, and keep out of those Dangers, which attend the ministerial Reproof thereof at

such Times: <hi>God</hi> brands them, as <hi>being like Foxes in the Desert, for not having gone up into the Gaps</hi> or <hi>Breaches</hi> to repair them, and <hi>for not having made up the Hedge for the House of</hi> Israel, by fencing it again with sound Doctrine, and with the Conscience of moral Duties, to keep out all further Eruption of such immoral Practices, ver. 4, 5. And else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where by the same Prophet, he denounces woes to them, and declares <hi>he will require his Flock at their Hands,</hi> if, instead of <hi>Feeding only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> they do not, as becomes <hi>good Shepheards, Feed their Flocks;</hi> and that, by the due exercise of their Ministrations, for <hi>Strengthning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seased,</hi> or for <hi>Healing the Sick,</hi> or for <hi>Reducing the Scatter'd, or Recovering the Lost,</hi> as the needs of the Flock shall require, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 2, 3. 4. 10.</p>

These cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Salvo's, and doctrinal Perversions of <hi>Gods</hi> Laws, are grievously complained of by the Holy Prophets, and still grew up among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to perfect the Wickedness, and to hasten on the Ruin of that Church. But whensoever these Attempts were made by False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Seducers, to pervert the Laws of <hi>God;</hi> it was incumbent on his true Ministers, to oppose them therein, and to Minister those Laws and Duties to the People in their true meaning.

                  <hi>ought not, for Filt by Lucres sake;</hi> they were call'd upon, not only to <hi>hold fast the Faithful VVord, as they had been taught,</hi> and to keep to it themselves; but also, <hi>by Sound Doctrine, to exhort and</hi>

                  <hi>teach others, and to convince, and stop the Mouths of Gain-Sayers,</hi> Tit. 1. 9, 10. 11.</p>
               <p>Thus are the Faithful Ministers of <hi>Christ</hi> obliged, to Feed the Church with the pure Administration of Moral, or other Gospel Duties; when the False Guides, by doctrinal Salvo's, and undermining Propositions, are shewing Men, how they may securely Vacate and Transgress them. They are not to connive at such Corruptions, and Adulterations of moral Precepts; but to cry out, and warn against them: Nor to smother, and keep up the real and injured Duties; but to Preach and Minister them out to those Souls, who are like to perish through their Ignorance, and Breach thereof. And this, as they will answer <hi>Gods</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Calls and Injunctions, or approve themselves True and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their Ministerial Trusts. To neglect it, or fail therein, would be Treachery and Falseness to that Sacred Doctrine, which had been deposited with them; and to those Souls, which had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them.</p>
               <p>And this Ministration they are bound to, tho' these corrupt Salvo's are only the <hi>Doctrines of the Pastors and Teachers,</hi> (as those foremention'd Salvo's of the <hi>False Prophets,</hi> and of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> too, I suppose, were among the <hi>Jews;)</hi> and are not yet made the Determinations of the Church. 'Tis not enough, on such Justification of Immoral Practices, or advancement of Immoral Salvo's by the Guides of Souls, to say, the Church hath not alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red its Articles, nor justified nor salved the ill things so, by any <hi>Synodical Confession.</hi> For 'tis a call to them for their Ministration, if these things are done by the Churchmen. Their Ministration, is to provide against the dangers of Souls. And they are allways endangered by damnable Practices, whosoever teach them, whether their particular Guides, or whole Synods. But particular Guides, are the Directors, which the generality of Men have for their Consciences and Practices. So that the Consciences and Practices of the generality are endangered, when they fall generally to teach them the Breach of Moral Duties by corrupt Salvo's. And then, true Guides are to warn them of these Dangers. <hi>VVhen Speakers of perverse things shall arise from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the Pastors are bid to take heed to their Flocks, and to feed them with the VVord of Truth and Righteousness,</hi> Act. 20. 28, 30.</p>
               <p>And instead of abating this Obligation, it will add to it, if, amidst all this Prevarication of the Church Men by such corrupt Salvo's, the Church it self continues right in these Points, and says the same it did in its publick Acts and Articles. For then, in these Ministrations, those Faithful Pastors have, as the Authority of Truth, so also the Authority of


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44279:24"/>
their own Church on their Side. Therein, they only minister out among the Members, what their own Church teaches: and show themselves, as <hi>Faithful Ministers of Christ,</hi> in standing up for his Truths; <hi>So Faithful Ministers of their own Church, in standing up for its Doctrines.</hi> As to the Point <hi>of separation from the Church;</hi> I Grant that true Ministers must not separate from a Church for any Doctrines, if the Church it self holds and maintains them, tho' the Churchmen should generally and shamefully defect from them. But this Ministration of those deserted Doctrines, is not to separate from it, but to stick Firm and Constant to it; yea, and to keep it up still as a Visible Body, for all its true Members to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to. And I hope true and faithful Ministers of a Church, may stand by it, in maintenance and ministration of the Truths and Laws of <hi>God;</hi> tho' that continue on a Breach, and keep them at a distance from those Revolting Pastors, who have defected and seperated themselves from both</p>
               <p>The foresaid Justification of Immoral Practices in such particular Cases, and maintainance thereof by Doctrinal Salvo's, will make the Consciences of Transgressors, Easy and in Rest at Sin. They will by this Means, see no Breach of Duty in what they do, nor danger of Punishment for doing it. They are taught in these Cases, <hi>to call E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Good,</hi> and <hi>to put Darkness for Light,</hi> whereto such Heavy Woes are <note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>Such is the Obligation incumbent on true Pastors, to Minister moral Truths, when immoral Practises are justified in particular Cases, and all the moral Duties opposite thereto, are vacated and taken off, by undermining Propositions, and Doctrinal Salvo's.</p>
               <p>And they are still more strictly obliged to this Ministration, if the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises justified by such Salvo's, are</p>

               </p>
               <p>All gross Violations, of common Honesty and Justice; and Breach of Faith, especially when confirmed by <hi>Solemn Oaths;</hi> and renouncing of Duty and Subjection to Superiours, more particularly to Patents and Princes; and such others; are immoralities, that all Sober Men think they ought to account Scandalous, and of highest Reproach. For the Duties transgressed thereby, are generally known to be of greatest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, for keeping up Society, and for securing the Comforts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life: Which therefore all Mankind, that feel such need of Society, and would find Comfort in Life, cry up, and utterly decry the Breaches of them. So that these Immoralities, are sure to bring the most general Infamy upon any thing that is Guilty of them; yea, and upon Religion it self, should it ever be found, or represented, as allowing, or giving Countenance thereto.</p>
               <p>Now the Ministers of Religion, are to be especially careful, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve its good Name, and to keep up an honourable Opinion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for it among Men. He has nothing of the Ministerial Care, or of a Ministerial Spirit, who is careless and unconcern'd, how ill, and irreverently Men think of Religion. Indeed, if they would keep Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion if self up in the World, they must keep up this Reverence, and good Opinion of it. For if once Mankind come to think ill, or despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of it, they are never like to trouble themselves much therewith, nor to Labour after much thereof. And if they would preserve Religion reputable, and secure of Mens Reverence, and honourable Opinion; they must watchfully keep all those things out of it, which deservedly


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44279:25"/>
loose and lessen Mens good Opinion. They must have a jealous Care to preserve it pure, not admitting, or justifying any thing, that, in the common Sense of Mankind, is Infamous, or of bad Name. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if any such things, (as all the foremention'd immoralities are in an High-Degree,) offer to creep in, or if <hi>Satans</hi> Ministers are Busie to introduce them; they must Oppose, and Minister against them with all their Might, and presently disclaim and purge them out, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may be clear of them. They must Watch, as far as they are able, to keep them out of the Practice of Men; least from such Practice of its Professors, the Lookers on should Harbour a Presumption or Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, as if Religion had some Toleration or Allowance for them. <note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1.</note>

But when these ill and infamous things appear, not only in Practice, but in Doctrines; and come, not as the blamed and prevaricating Acts of Professors, but as Justified and Preached up by their Guides and Leaders: Then Religion is more directly and planely brought in, and the true Ministers thereof are more highly obliged to oppose them in its behalf, to prevent its incurring any Scandal or Reproach thereby.</p>

               <p n="2">2, <hi>If they are generally Preached up by Seducers, and Men are every where Taught, and perswaded to them.</hi> Instead of giving any Discharge, to those few Faithful Ministers that remain; at such times, the general falling away and Corruption of others, adds to their Obligation. For <hi>God,</hi> and these moral Truths then, have more need of their Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And they can have no Pretence left, of puting off this Service to other Ministers, since they in effect Preach them down, and there is no Appearance of their being faithfully administred at all, if not by them. So that, what ministerial Trusts they undertook, or <note n="†" place="margin">Form of Ordination.</note> Promises they made, of <hi>being ready with all Faithful Diligence, to drive away all such erroneous Doctrine,</hi> are more pressing upon them, since then they rest on their Fidelity alone. And this will be to answer the Apostles Rules, of <hi>taking beed to all their Flocks, when the Speakers of Perverse things arise, to draw away Disciples after them,</hi> Act. 20. 28, 30. Of standing up against <hi>Deceivers, that Teach things which they ought not, and of Exhorting, and Covincing, and Stopping the Mouths of Gain-Sayers,</hi> Tit. 1. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Of making full Proof of their Ministry, when People have Teachers after their own Lusts;</hi> yea, <hi>will not bear sound Doctrine, but heap up such to themselves, having Itching Ears,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 3, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:44279:25"/>
Or,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If they come recommended by Suitableness, to Wordly and Carnal Passions and Interests,</hi> which, when once these Salvo's have reconciled them to Mens Consciences, will be sure to gain innumerable Followers. But especially, <hi>if the Serupulous and Unwilling are driven into them, by a sore and general Persecution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Case of <hi>Persecution,</hi> I grant, is an outward Discouragement to the true Pastors, from Performing this Ministration, because it will be sure to be hottest against them. And it will be an Hindrance too, from their Discharging it so fully, and generally, as they might do in a free and quiet Time. If Meetings then, are Fixt, and of free Recourse, and open<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Numerous, they will miss of their End, and the Effect will only be, to be disturbed, and carried before Magistrates, not to go on in Prayers and Devotions. Assemblies to partake in these Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, cannot be so regular, and constant to Times and Places; so free, and full of Communicants; and so easie and accessable to all those Members, who desire, and stand in need thereof; when the Church is daily disturbed, and persecuted, and driven into the Wilderness, as they may in Times of Peace and external Allowance. And thus, in the <hi>First Persecutions, the Disciples assembled in the Evening,</hi> and were careful to keep <hi>the Doors shut, for Fear of the</hi> Jews, <hi>Io.</hi> 20. 19, 26. And St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Meeting <hi>on the First Day of the Week at</hi> Troas, was held <hi>in an upper Chamber,</hi> and in the <note n="†" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>But so far as they can Minister the Word of moral Truths against them, in a persecuted and dispersed State, and in such sort as that will admit of; they have more Obligation to this Ministration, by reason of the Persecution. It makes the difficulty of this Ministration, to be the more; but the Duty of it to be never the less, but the straighter likewise. For, the more others Persecute moral Duties, and good Practice; the more need there is for the Ministers thereof, to stand up for them. And the more any Faithful Souls, are persecuted for them; the more need there is for the Guides of Souls, and the more Obligation lies on them, by the best Ministrations they can, to instruct and strengthen them therein. They are then to Minister the Word, not only to confirm them in their good Practices; but also, to support and comfort them under their hard Sufferings, and to assist and arm them at all Points against their Persecutors and Spiritual Enemies, that by Faith and Fortitude, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44279:26"/>
and Charity, they may bravely repel all their Assaults, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Triumph over them.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>God</hi> blames <hi>the Shepheards of</hi> Israel, because, <hi>when the Flocks were Scatter'd, none did search or seek after them;</hi> when any <hi>were driven away,</hi> none sought <hi>to bring them back again,</hi> nor <hi>to Strengthen what was Diseased,</hi> nor <hi>to bind up what was broken among them,</hi> Ezek. 34. 4, 5, 6. <hi>And when the Woolf is coming,</hi> to break in among <hi>the Sheep,</hi> and to rear and <hi>scatter them,</hi> i. e. When some cruel and imminent Persecution is before them: If a Pastor doth not stick by them then, and Minister and shew his Pastoral Care the best he can; but leaves them to themselves, and looks only how he may secure his own Person; our Blessed <hi>Lord</hi> tells us, he is no true Shepheard, as being destitute of the Pastoral Care and Spirit, but <hi>an Hireling,</hi> Jo. 10. 12. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy, to stir up the Gift that was in him, by the Laying on of his Hands,</hi> and not to be hindred, or discouraged from it, by the Persecutions of that Time: for that the <hi>Holy Ghost, conferr'd by</hi> God upon his Ministers by such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Hands, <hi>is not the Spirit of Fear,</hi> or <hi>Cowardice,</hi> whose Ministrations are to be stopt by Approach of Dangers; but the Spirit <hi>of Power</hi> or <hi>Courage,</hi> and <hi>of Love</hi> to Him and his Church, when thereby we expose our own Persons, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6, 7. <hi>Seeing we have,</hi> or stand charged with <hi>this Ministry, though Troubled, Perplexed, and Persecuted on every side,</hi> in the due Discharge thereof, <hi>we faint not,</hi> saith he, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 1, 8, 9. <hi>But approve our selves the Ministers of</hi> God, <hi>by the Word of Truth, and by the Armor of Righteousness on the Right-Hand, and on the Left, in all Patience, and Afflictions,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> the midst of <hi>Tumults,</hi> of <hi>Stripes,</hi> and <hi>Imprisonments,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 4, 5, 7.</p>

               <p>HItherto, I have insisted on those Cases, wherein true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pastors and Ministers of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> are plainly bound, as I conceive, to stir up those Spiritual Powers, which he hath conferred on them; and to act Ministerally as Bishops and Pastors, for supplying the needs of Religion and of Souls, or of the Churches which are intrusted to their Charge.</p>
               <p>And the Sum of what I have said thereupon, is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are bound to supply the Church, with the <hi>Ministration of Prayers,</hi> or of pure and unpolluted Offices, when the publick Service is corrupted, and Prayers are poyson'd, not only with Idolatrous, but also with Unrighteous and Immoral Mixtures. And with <hi>the Ministry of the Word,</hi> when they see Dangerous and Immoral Practices are begun to be set up. And more still, when they are offer'd to be Justified. Being obliged to this, when Immoral Practices are justified in some great and particular Cases, which are like to involve the generality of Persons. And higher ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged yet, when, for Justification of the same in such particular Cases, False Teachers set themselves to vacate all the opposite Moral Duties, by Undermining Propositions and Doctrinal Salvo's. All which still call louder for this Ministration, if the immoral Practices so justified, and Doctrinally Salved, are in themselves Infamous, and a Scandal to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; or, if they have numbers of Seducers and False Guides, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend or perswade them; or, if they are press'd and forced upon all Refusers, by a secular Arm, and driven on by a violent and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Persecution. When the Breach is so great upon Religion, and the Danger is so terrible to the Souls of Men, and is like to make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wast, and to seize and destroy such Numbers of them: True Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Religion, and Guides of Souls, ought not to be Silent, and to Sit still, under such Wrongs done to both. But are bound, <hi>Not to Neglect the Gift that is in them, by the laying on of Hanas,</hi> 1. Tim. 4.


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44279:27"/>
14. but <hi>to stir it up,</hi> and that out of a <hi>Spirit of Love</hi> to Religion and the Church, <hi>and of Power</hi> or Courage without fear of Dangers, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 1, 6, 7. To give Attendance to it, <hi>wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their Ministry,</hi> Rom. 12. 7. Not to be content merely to accept Seasons, as put upon them; but to seek them, <hi>Preaching the Word, and being instant, in Season, and out of Season.</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 2. <hi>To give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wholly to these things,</hi> and to persevere and <hi>continue in</hi> performing them, that <hi>in so doing, they may both save themselves, and those that hear them,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>But further to set off this Obligation, having said thus much <hi>to the Cases wherein they stand bound,</hi> I shall now proceed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>To Note, what Obligations of Actual Ministration, do lie upon them in such Cases.</hi> And these Obligations will appear, both from <hi>the Nature of the Pastoral Function,</hi> from <hi>the several Characters which they sustain,</hi> and from <hi>the Post or Station which they are placed in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Characters I shall consider, under this <hi>Threefold Respect,</hi> either as they relate to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> or to <hi>the Souls of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> I shall consider them, as <hi>they relate to God.</hi> And here this Obligation to the foresaid Ministrations, in the preceding and such like Cases, will appear plain upon them, as they bear the Character, and stand in Place,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Of his Messengers. The Priest is the Messenger of the Lord of Hosts,</hi> Mal. 2. 7. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>The Galatians received him, as an</hi>

Now, when a polluted and immoral Worship is offered up to <hi>God,</hi> or when Immoral Practices are set up, and the plain Sense of Moral Precepts is perverted or vacated to maintain them; <hi>God</hi> hath enough to say to Men, both for Caution and Prevention, and also for their Recovery from the same. And who shall tell them this, but his own Messengers? And how should they tell it, but in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Ministrations? So that by their Ministry, they must shew them the horrible Prophanation of an Immoral Devotion, and teach and afford them a pure Worship, which is according to his Mind. And declare to them the true force and Meaning of those Moral Laws and Duties, which others have Doctrinally Gloss'd away and vacated, to the end they may warrantably and securely Trangress them. <hi>As the Messenger of the Lord of Hosts, his Lips ought to keep up Knowledge</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People, <hi>and they are to seek the Law, i. e.</hi> the true Sence of it, as <note n="†" place="margin">

2. Of <hi>his Ministers and Ambassadors.</hi> They are not, as inferior Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, employed only to bear and tell a Message; but as <hi>Ministers of his Kingdom,</hi> they are Messengers impower'd, and authorized, to Negotiate and Transact for <hi>God.</hi> And this, not only in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thing; but at large, in all the outward Administration of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, or of Reconciliation between <hi>God</hi> and Man. <hi>Let a Man so account of us,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, as of</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>the Administration of Reconciliation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and sinful Men, 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19. and as of <hi>such Publick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,</hi> who are impower'd and intrusted <hi>to Minister the Gospel of God,</hi> Rom. 15. 16. Nay, being thus impower'd as <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Ministers, Publick Agents,</hi> and <hi>Ambassadors:</hi> They are not only as his Servants, who are to do his Business; but as his <hi>visible Representatives</hi> and <hi>Vice-Gerents</hi> here on Earth, who in all these concerns, are to sustain his Person, and to stand in his Place. This is the Part of publick Agents and Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, who Sustain the Person, and supply the presence of their Masters. Speaking to you as <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Ambassadors, God bespeaks you, and beseeches you by us;</hi> and praying you, as <hi>Ambassadors of Christ, we pray you in Christ</hi>'s <hi>Stead,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul to the Corinthians,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. And accordingly the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he says, <hi>received him as Christ Jesus,</hi> Gal. 4. 14. and in his <hi>Ministerial Actings,</hi> he declares <hi>he Acted in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 10. And they are sent thus to transact for him in all these Administrations, and to Sustain and Supply his Place, not only at some one Time, or on some particular and occasional Turn; but with standing Powers, as his <hi>Ambassadors in Ordinary,</hi> or <hi>Residentiaries</hi> here on Earth, who are to do the same still from time to time, as there is Occasion.</p>
               <p>Now, Standing thus, as his Ordinary Ministers, and Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives, who are to act <hi>Gods</hi> Part, and to supply his Place in these Matters; they must be bound to their actual Administrations, in the foresaid Cases.</p>
               <p>For being to act in those Cases, and in all others which providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially come before them, as <hi>Gods Ministers and Officers;</hi> they ought to do all therein, that is needful for <hi>Gods</hi> Business. They are unfaithful Ministers, if they do not appear, and concern themselves in their Master's Affairs, and so far as their Powers will go, prosecute his Business who imploys and intrusts them. And when sinful Prayers are presented to him, in his Solemn and publick Worship; his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is to have them purged out, and to have more pure and unpol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44279:28"/>
Prayers put up to him in their Room. When Immoral Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are justified, his Business is to have them generally Disclaimed and Condemned. When moral Precepts are Gloss'd away, and vacated; his Concern, is to have them faithfully expounded and maintain'd. So that, if they must officiate, and act in Prosecution of his Business; they must Officiate, and Minister in Prosecution of these things. And they throw off the Part, and work of his Ministers, if they will have no care of his Matters, nor afford him their Ministrations at such Times.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Gods publick Agents,</hi> and <hi>Ordinary Ambassadors,</hi> their Instructions are, <hi>to preserve the things of</hi> God <hi>safe.</hi> Then, they must see to guard his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship from Sinful and Polluted Mixtures; and his Laws from elusive Glosses, and undermining Salvo's; and the Practices of his People, from damnable Unrighteousness and Immoralities. And what sort of Agents would they shew themselves, should they refuse to Minister, and Act for him; what trusty Ambassadors, should they fail to pursue their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, when all these Wrongs and Violences are offer'd to his Affairs, and are attempted to be obtruded upon his Worship, his Precepts, and his People, at such times?</p>
               <p>As <hi>his Ambassadors,</hi> they are <hi>Ambassadors for Peace,</hi> and carry <note n="†" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 20.</note>

And when <hi>God,</hi> and any People are at Enmity, by reason of the foresaid Worship and Practices; would they approve themselves fit to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with this <hi>Ambassage of Peace,</hi> or to be Faithful in the Discharge thereof, who should not so much as tell the Offenders, that <hi>God</hi> and they are at Difference; nor minister and propose from him, the true Terms of making up the Breach. By failing to Minister this Word, when they are sent on purpose with it, and have undertaken <hi>the</hi>

And is any Failure or Falshood, more Fatal, as well as more inexcusable, than theirs would be in this Case?</p>
               <p>As <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Representatives,</hi> and as <hi>Sustaining his Person and Place,</hi> they are to say what he would say to any Offenders, and to act as he would act in these Cases, were he visibly to appear, and immediately to manage and administer his own Affairs. They must come into <hi>Christ</hi>'s Care and Administration, when they come to sustain his Person. For his Part on Earth, as he declares, was to <note n="†" place="margin">

Ministries, in the above-mention'd Cases. For, were he on Earth at such Times, he would surely see no want of these Ministrations, to preserve, or rescue, his Worship from being polluted, his Laws from being vacated, and the Practice of his People from such Ways of Sin and Death, as are then offer'd to be obtruded on them. To Minister against all these, was his Business when he was upon the Earth; and would be so, were he to appear again: And ought to be the Business of all, that represent and appear for him. If they neglect the Ministry, and Care of these things, and let them alone; what other Ministries are there left then, for them to represent this great <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>Bishops of our Souls</hi> in? If then they do not Minister his Word to the Church, <hi>in his Name,</hi> what becomes of the Communication, which they are to keep up between his Church and Him? For he is to speak to them by his Representatives, and says, <hi>he that hears them, hears him,</hi> Luk. 10. 16. And if his Representatives are silent at such Times, and say nothing from Him; that, instead of faithfully Maintaining, is to drop, and make an end of this way of Communication.</p>
               <p>Thus doth their very Office and Station, of being <hi>Gods Ordinary</hi> and <hi>Standing Ministers,</hi> and <hi>Publick Agents,</hi> and <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> and <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives:</hi> oblige them to <hi>actual Administrations</hi> in the foresaid Cases. Their Office, lies in supplying such Administrations, which are the Trust they have receiv'd from <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Business which they are set for. <hi>He hath committed to us the Administration of this Reconciliation,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 18. This faithful supply of such Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is call'd, <hi>fulfilling their Ministry,</hi> as in St. <hi>Pauls Caution to</hi> Archippus. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 17. For to intrust his things with them, as <hi>Ministers,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents;</hi> is to trust that they will act therein, and Administer the same unto his People. Accordingly they, who have <hi>received a Ministry,</hi> are required <hi>to wait on their Administration,</hi> Ro. 12. 6, 7. Or, <hi>every Man, as he hath received the Gift of Preaching,</hi> or <hi>Ministry,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>even so to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the same one to another, as good Stewards of the Manifold Grace of</hi> God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. Thus also they are call'd to <hi>Preach the Word,</hi> and Discharge these Ministrations, against <hi>Teachers Preaching to please Mens Lusts,</hi> and against People <hi>heaping up such Teachers to themselves,</hi> that they may thereby <hi>fulfil,</hi> or <hi>make full Proof of their Ministry,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 2, 3, 5. And are bid, <hi>not to neglect the Gift that is in them, by Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Hands,</hi> but to be the Peoples Monitors, against <hi>the Speakers of Lies in Hypocrisie,</hi> that they may be <hi>good Ministers of</hi> Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2, 6, 14. <hi>And to approve themselves, as the Ministers of</hi> God, <hi>by the Word of Truth, and by the Armor of Righteousness,</hi> in the midst of <hi>Afflictions</hi> and <hi>Persecutions,</hi> 2 Cor 6. 4, 5, 7.

                  <hi>Labourers together with</hi> God, <hi>the chief Worker.</hi> And <hi>ye are</hi> Gods <hi>Husbandry,</hi> whom, as <hi>Co-labourers,</hi> we Cultivate, Planting what is Profitable, and Rooting out every hurtful Weed. <hi>Ye are</hi> Gods <hi>Building,</hi> which we, as <hi>Work-Men</hi> together with him, are Spiritually to Rear and Build up, or to Repair the same when any part thereof is Broken down, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
               <p>Now, when any such Breaches are made, upon the Worship, or the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> and upon the Practice of his People in all the foresaid Cases, <hi>God</hi> is sure to be at Work with Men. His Providence, outwardly throws i Hindrances, and awakening Alarms; and his Holy Spirit, is inwardly Busie in their Hearts, by raising Holy Thoughts and Suggestions, to prevent the fall of some, and to recover and raise up others who are already faln, and to set, both the Celebration of his own Worship, and the Sence of his Precepts, and the Practice of his People, at Rights again. And whilst he is thus Working and plying them, both with inward Motions, and with outward Accidents or Occurrences; his <hi>Ministers,</hi> as <hi>Fellow-workers,</hi> should joyn their Ministration to carry on the same Work in them. And how are they <hi>Fellow-labourers,</hi> if at such times, whilst he holds on Labouring, they give it off? How are they true to the part of <hi>Co-workers,</hi> if they withdraw their Ministrations, and leave and let him alone to do all the Work himself?</p>
               <p>They are also said to be <hi>Co-workers with him of the Peoples Joy or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 24. This Joy can be had only in the Way of Holy, not of polluted Prayers; and of Maintaining, not of vacating <hi>Gods</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; and of humbly and industriously Seeking, to approve themselves to <hi>God</hi> by Good; not of justifying themselves, in Unrighteous and Wicked Practices. For in those Ways, they have nothing to do with Joy; but remorse, and Shame, and Sorrow are their Portion. So that if the true Pastors, are to be <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Co-workers</hi> of their Joy and Consolation, they must <hi>Minister</hi> and <hi>Co-work</hi> at such Times, to keep up pure Worship, and pure Precepts and Practices among them; because else, they would not have what they may justly Rejoyce and take Comfort in.</p>
               <p>Again, the Ministerial Characters, may be considered.</p>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:44279:29"/>
2. Secondly, as <hi>they relate to Religion.</hi> And here also they carry with them a plane Obligation to the foresaid Ministrations in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Cases.</p>
               <p>With Respect to Religion, they are styled <hi>Ministers of the Word. We will give our Selves,</hi> say the Apostle, <hi>to the Ministry of the Word,</hi> Act. 6. 4. Or, <hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> or of the <hi>Now Covenant. The Gospel, whereof I am made a Minister,</hi> Eph. 3. 7. Col. 1. 23. <hi>And</hi> God <hi>hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Cor. 3. 6. Or sometimes, lastly, <hi>Stewards of the Mysteries. Let a Man so account of us, as of Stewards of the Misteries of</hi> God, saith the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
               <p>Now, as <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Stewards</hi> of the <hi>VVord of</hi> God, of <hi>Religion,</hi> and of <hi>its Mysteries,</hi> they stand intrusted with the Charge thereof. The Part of <hi>Stewards</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> is to keep such Pearls of Price safe, to supply what is wanting to them, or improve them to advantage; of their Fidelity and Care wherein, they must give a strict Account to their Masters.</p>
               <p>So that, as <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Stewards, of Religion,</hi> and of <hi>its Mysteries,</hi> they stand obliged,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To keep, and preserve them.</hi> They must see, that they be not lost, nor injured in any Part; that the Word of <hi>God</hi> be not maimed, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; nor his Worship adulterated, and polluted; nor his Doctrines, and Precepts, either denied in Terms, or vacated by corrupt Glosses or undermining Propositions. This is the First Thing, which they owe to those good things, wherewith they are intrusted. <hi>That good Thing, which was committed to thee, keep,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 14. <hi>O! Timothy, keep that, which was committed to thy Trust,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 20. <hi>Hold it fast, and in the Form of Sound VVords, wherein thou hast received it,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 13. <hi>And Remember how thou hast received, and heard, and hold fast,</hi> Rev. 3. 3. These things, are <hi>a</hi>

up, and held fast in the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> So that these <hi>Keepers,</hi> of the pure and perfect Word, and Mysteries of Religion; must be <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> to exhibibit and deal them out, and <hi>Stewards</hi> to dispence them. The Part of <hi>Stewards,</hi> lyes in dealing of them out: <hi>as good Stewards of the Manifold Grace of</hi> God, <hi>Minister the same one to another,</hi> saith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 4, 10, 11. And the Part of <hi>Ministers,</hi> lies in <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations,</hi> or in <hi>Ministring the Gospel,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Ro.</hi> 15. 16. <hi>To be Ministers of the New Covenant,</hi> is to have the <hi>Ministration of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>the Ministration of Righteousness</hi> which is therein offer'd, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 8, 9. That is, to stand charged with the Administration thereof, by Affording People the appointed Ways, of Entring and Confirming it, in <hi>Administration of the Sacraments;</hi> and of being built up in the Duties, and of Supplying and Fetching down the Grace and Blessings thereof, in <hi>Administration of the VVord,</hi> and of <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> And thus the Scripture sets off being <hi>Ministers of the VVord,</hi> by having the Charge of <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Testifying it.

And <hi>the Ministry, which I have received of the</hi> Lord Jesus, <hi>to Testific the Gospel of the Grace of</hi> God, saith the Apostle, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 24. And they were then said, to have <hi>fulfill'd this Ministry of the VVord,</hi> when they had <hi>Preach'd it all about,</hi> Act. 12. 25.</p>
               <p>As therefore they are obliged, to purge out all Prophanation and polluted Matter, from Worship and Prayers; and all corrupt Glosses and vacating Salvo's, from the Doctrines and Duties of Religion, as their <hi>Faithful Keepers:</hi> So are they obliged, to exhibit the same thus purged and cleansed in their own Ministrations, that they may keep them up among others, as their <hi>Faithful Stewards</hi> and <hi>Ministers.</hi> And they are very much wanting to Religion and its Mysteries, if they do not acquit themselves, both as their <hi>Faithful Keepers,</hi> and <hi>Dispensers,</hi> in the foresaid Cases.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE last Respect, wherein the Ministerial Characters may be considered, is,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>as they relate to the Souls of Men,</hi> or <hi>to the Church.</hi> And these also most evidently oblige to the same Ministrations, in the foresaid Cases.</p>
               <p>For in this Respect, they are placed in the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> and set-over it,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As <hi>Watchmen. I have set thee as a Watchman to the House of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> saith <hi>God</hi> to the Prophet, Ezek, 3. 17. and cap. 33. 7. and <hi>they watch for your Souls, as they that must give an Account thereof,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb. 13. 17. Now the <hi>Watchman,</hi> is set to espie any Emergent Harm or Dangers, before they come; and to descry the Enemy, whilst yet he is only approaching. And this, to give Notice of them, that the People may not be Surprized, or Siezed thereby, but timely shun them, or prepare against them. So that his Office lies, <hi>in Ministring the Word of Warning. Being set as their Watchman, thou shalt warn them from me,</hi> Ezek. 3. 17. and cap. 33. 7. <hi>Warning every Man,</hi> who is in the Way of doing ill, <hi>and teaching every Man</hi> the Sin and Danger thereof, <hi>that we may present every Man perfect</hi> in the Knowledge and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> Col. 1. 28. And if he fails to minister this Word of Warning, as any Spiritual Need of theirs, or as any Approach of Sin and Danger requires the same, <hi>their Blood God will require at the VVatchman's Hands,</hi> Ezek. 33. 8. and cap. 3. 18.</p>
               <p>Now, Immoral Worship and Practices, are most Detrimental, and Dangerous to Souls. Immoral Prayers, Prophane <hi>God,</hi> instead of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring him; and provoke a Curse, instead of bringing down a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. And Immoral Practices, are Ways of Death, which Men must not trust to any Prayers to put by, or Atone for, till, instead of going on therein, they truly Repent of the same, and turn away from them.


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44279:31"/>
And when any Guides come, to recommend and justifie these to Men, and to vacate all those moral Precepts, which should make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy and afraid to be found therein; then is the Enemy approaching, and Guilt and Death stand Gaping to devour them. And then they who watch for Souls, ought certainly to administer the Word of Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to see that the People do not securely Sin and Perish, for want of their <hi>Blowing the Trumpet,</hi> and giving Notice. And the Blood of those Souls would be required at their Hands, should they treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously keep Silent, and fail to Preach and warn their Charge, on such Occasions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As Overseers</hi> or <hi>Inspectors. Take heed to the Flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers,</hi> Act. 20. 28. <hi>Taking the Oversight thereof, willingly and of a ready Mind,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 2. Now the <hi>Overseer of Souls,</hi> is to be an Overseer of their Worship, or of what they do in <hi>God</hi>'s House; of their Lives and Practices, how they demean themselves in those Duties, which <hi>God</hi> will require an Account of; of their Faith, how they retain the Belief and Profession of his Truths; and of any Spiritual Wants or Dangers, or other things, whereon the Salvation of Souls Depends. And the Part of these Overseers is, from time to time to observe, what their Wants, or Dangers are, either in Worship, Faith, and Practice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to minister Provisions and Supplies against them. Their Eyes are to be over them for these Purposes; the Over-Sight which they have undertaken, <hi>being an Over-Sight of Care and Kindness,</hi> for the right Conduct and Salvation of their Charge. Accordingly, as <hi>Overseers,</hi> they are call'd upon <hi>to take Heed to their Flocks,</hi> or to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spye and Provide against any Harm, that is coming upon them. And when they are in any Spiritual Want, either of Worship, or Doctrine, or of other Ghostly Provision, which is in their Power to supply them withal; <hi>to Feed them therewith,</hi> or <hi>to minister it to them. Feed the Flock of Christ, whereof you have taken the Oversight,</hi> saith St. Peter, 1 Pet. 5. 2. And <hi>take heed to all the Flocks, to Feed the Church, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers.</hi> Yea, such <hi>Heed,</hi> as befits the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versight of the most invaluable Things, this Church being the <hi>Churh of God,</hi> and <hi>a Church which he hath purchased with his own Blood,</hi> Act. 20. 28. And this Feeding of their Spiritual Wants, is Feeding them with their Spiritual Ministrations, those being the proper Food of Souls. So that, to shew themselves <hi>Faithful Overseers,</hi> when the foresaid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities are introduced into the Worship, the Doctrine, and Practice of the Church; they must take heed, both to espy the Guilt and Danger thereof, and to supply the Church with better and more whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Ministrations.</p>

                  <hi>Guides</hi> or <hi>Leaders,</hi> Mat. 23. 16, 24. and Mat. 15. 14.</p>
               <p>Now, the Business of <hi>Guides of Souls,</hi> is to shew them <hi>Gods</hi> Ways, and to carry them on in the same; and to keep them out of such, as are Evil and Destructive to them. In all things, where they are set to Direct, they must shew them the Right, and lead them on in it, as their Leaders in what is Good: and call out to them when they are going Wrong, and show them the Danger of holding on therein. They must not be Ignorant or mistake the way themselves, which is to be <hi>Blind Guides,</hi> as our Saviour taxed the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> Mat. 23. 16. And when they see the Right, they must not Conceal or Dissemble it; but are to be Guides, which <hi>speak to their People the VVord of the Lord,</hi> or tell them what he calls Right, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. And this they must do, with all carefulness; Seeing that none miscarry, or perish for want of Guidance; but only for being Deaf thereto, and Contumacious against all their Calls: wherein they must demean themselves, as they that <hi>VVatch for Souls,</hi> and <hi>must give an Account thereof,</hi> as the Apostle there saith.</p>
               <p>Now, as <hi>Guides of Souls,</hi> they are to direct and lead them, in accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and saving Worship, Doctrines, and Practices. And if, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to any of these, they see them going wrong; or, see Seducers busie to mislead them: as their true and faithful Guides, they must set them Right, and call out to them to have a Care of Wandring; or, if they are got out of the Way, to come back again. When others guide them into an Immoral Worship, or Immoral Practices, or into the Belief and Maintainance of such corrupt Salvo's as vacate Moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; they must Guide them out of the same. And they would be very unfaithful Guides, should they suffer Men, either on their own Heads, or at the Call of Seducers and False Guides, to run into wrong Ways; and should not diligently Discharge their Ministry, and do their Part, to lead them better, and set them Right in such Cases.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Shepheards. The Evangelical Ministers,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Pastors,</hi> Eph. 4. 11. <hi>They are set to Feed Christ</hi>'s <hi>Sheep,</hi> and under him <hi>the Chief Shepheard,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> Speaks, 1 Pet. 5. 2, 4. Of these, <hi>God</hi> foretells, that they should be <hi>Pastors after his own Heart,</hi> Jer. 3. 15. And the <hi>Priests of Israel, God calls the Pastors and Shepheards of Israel,</hi> when he sends to denounce <hi>VVoes</hi> against them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 1, 2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34 2.</p>
               <p>Now, the Part and Office of <hi>Shepheards</hi> and <hi>Pastors is, to Feed their Sheep. Should not the Shepheards Feed their Flocks?</hi> Ezek. 34. 2. And


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44279:32"/>
                  <hi>Feed the Flock of</hi> God, <hi>which is among you,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 2. <hi>The Food of Souls,</hi> are <hi>Divine Offices,</hi> and <hi>the Word of Knowledge.</hi> These are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, as <hi>the Milk,</hi> which they are to Suck, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. as <hi>the Bread of Life,</hi> wherewith they are to be Sustained, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6. 35. and <hi>as the Meat, which perisheth not, but endureth to Eternal Life,</hi> ver. 27. and ver. 47, 48, 51. And therefore the Feeding of the <hi>Shepheards of Souls,</hi> must be their <hi>Administration</hi> of this <hi>Spriitual Food,</hi> or Feeding the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the <hi>Ministry of the Word,</hi> or of <hi>Divine Offices: Feeding them with Knowledge and Understanding,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> promises the True Prophets should do, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
               <p>His part is also <hi>to keep them together</hi> the best he can, for joynt Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of these Ministrations, that, as one Flock, they may be Fed therewith. This <hi>Gathering,</hi> and <hi>Keeping them together,</hi> God takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in Shepheards. <hi>He that Scatter'd</hi> Israel, <hi>will gather him, as a Shepheard doth his Flock,</hi> Jer. 31. 10. When he carries them out to Feed, or to Minister this Spiritual Food to them; <hi>he calls to all his Sheep, that will know,</hi> and <hi>hear his Voice,</hi> and not <hi>Run after strange Voices,</hi> and <hi>leads them out, and goes before them,</hi> (the Sheep among the <hi>Iews,</hi> being used to <note n="†" place="margin">

And if <hi>any Woolf</hi> comes to break in, to <hi>Destroy</hi> or <hi>Scatter</hi> any of his Fold; he doth not <hi>Flee away as the Hireling,</hi> but stands to them at his Peril, to keep them together the best he can, and to Guard them against <hi>the Wolf</hi> by a diligent Ministration, ver. 11, 12, 13. <hi>He takes heed,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs, <hi>to Feed</hi> and <hi>Arm all the Flock,</hi> that they may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Prey to <hi>grevious Wolves,</hi> Act. 20. 28, 29. And if any of them are lost in the on-set, <hi>he seeks after that which was Lost,</hi> to recover it again; if any, by the Fright, <hi>were driven away,</hi> or <hi>Scatter'd,</hi> he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours <hi>to bring it back. He Strengthens, what was Diseased; and Heals, what was Sick; and Binds up, what was Broken</hi> in the Conflict. And without such Care, in Getting, and Keeping their Flocks together, by such Ministrations; <hi>God</hi> declares, <hi>they are not Shepheards that Feed his Flock, but that Feed themselves;</hi> and that <hi>he is against them, and will require his Flock at their Hands,</hi> Ezek. 34. 2. 3. 4. 8. 10.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Shepheards of the Flock</hi> therefore, they must see what Spiritual Food is Administred to it. If there is a want, of Necessary, and Saving Doctrine, and Worship; they must not see the Children starve for want of Bread, or the Fold pine away for want of Food, but <hi>lead out all that will know their Voice,</hi> where they may have it, and there Administer the same themselves, and supply it to them. Or, if others would Feed them with poyson'd Food, as immoral Doctrines, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral

Worship are; they are to warn them of the Harm design'd, and to Minister purer and more wholesome to them in its stead. And their Care must be, as much as the Case allows, to keep their Flock together with these Administrations. So that as Shepheards, who would <hi>shew Care of the Flocks,</hi> or approve themselves <hi>Faithful Pastors;</hi> they are bound to Feed and keep their Flocks together, by due and diligent Exercise of their Pastoral Ministrations, in the foresaid Cases.</p>

And <hi>to be ready with all faithful Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange Doctrine, contrary to</hi> Gods <hi>Word, and to call upon others to do the same:</hi> As all Bishops, according to our <hi>Form of Consecration,</hi> Solemnly Promise in their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</hi>

Now, sustaining the Office, and standieg in Place of such Teachers to the Church; the Ministers of <hi>Christ</hi> must necessarily be bound, to a diligent Discharge of their Ministrations, or to Administer the Word in the forementioned Cases. For then, both the Prayers and Religious Service, and the Lives and common Practice of the People, is corrupted by heinous Immoralities. And they want to be Taught and Shew'd, that there is any Harm in either; False Teachers having justified to them the Immoralities in both, and, by vacating moral Precepts, and by Broaching corrupt and immoral Doctrines, having labour'd to leave in them no Conscience thereof. And when People are thus Untaught, or Mistaught, in great and concerning Parts of the <hi>Depositum;</hi> they, who would faithfully Discharge the Part of true Teachers, must take Care to Teach them better. If they are <hi>to attend on it, to Labour,</hi> and <hi>give themselves wholly to it;</hi> how can they let it fall at such a Time, not appearing at all, or appearing very negligent therein. If they are to <hi>continue</hi> in Teaching these Things, they must not flinch from it, and give it off; if they are to do it, <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>out of Season,</hi> they must not sure be wanting, when the Season is so pressing; if <hi>against Deceivers, and Gain-Sayers,</hi> they ought in no wise to fail, when those <hi>Gain-Sayers</hi> are so busie at Work, for Perversion thereof. So that, as Faithful Teachers of <hi>Christs</hi> Church, they are not to suffer the People to perish for want of saving Knowledge, but are duly to Administer the Word in the foresaid Cases.</p>
               <p>I might also further Note the Necessity and Obligation they lie under to the foremention'd Ministrations, from their being set up by our <hi>Saviour, as the Light of the VVorld,</hi> Mat. 5. 14. and <hi>as the Salt of the Earth,</hi> ver. 13. For, <hi>as the Light of the VVorld,</hi> they must shine out, and give Light abroad; <hi>Men not Lighting a Candle, to put it under a Bushel,</hi> that it may shine only to it self; <hi>but put it on a Candle-Stick,</hi> that it may shine out and give Light to others, ver. 15. And such Light they give to the World by their Ministrations, when they Minister the Gospel, and all the Doctrines and Duties of it, with the Knowledge whereof, the World is to be enlightned. And as the <hi>Salt of the Earth,</hi> they must keep the Religious Service, and Morals of Men, from being corrupted; since the use of <hi>Salt,</hi> is to keep out Putrefaction and Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness. And this also, is by their Ministrations. For, by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in Administring Sound and Wholesome Things, they Season the Church, keeping it up in Purity and Soundness, and keeping out all Adulterations and Corruptions, when Endeavours are used to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them by Seducers.</p>
               <p>And thus, by all the Characters of the Ministerial Function, and the Parts of their Office, do the Bishops and Pastors of <hi>Christs</hi> Church


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44279:34"/>
stand bound, to an actual Discharge of their Ministrations, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Cases. And cannot Drop, or let them fall, without those Characters and Offices flying in their Faces.</p>
               <p>For how will they answer it to <hi>God,</hi> as having acted the Part of his <hi>Faithful Messengers,</hi> to a People so endanger'd and depraved, by pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Worship, Doctrines, and Practices, if they have stood Dumb and Speechless, and, instead of Ministerial Uttering and Delivering, have suppress'd and kept back the Word and Message they were charged with? How, as having well discharged the Place, of <hi>Ministers, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,</hi> of <hi>Publick Agents</hi> and <hi>Representatives,</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ:</hi> If they have been such <hi>Representatives,</hi> as would not act, or order any thing in their Names; Such <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> as would pursue no Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Such <hi>Publick Agents,</hi> as refused to acts; and such <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> as would not Minister or Officiate in their Masters Business and Affairs, yea, even in those of most Importance, and in their greatest Exigencies? How, as having been <hi>Co-workers,</hi> and <hi>Fellow-Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> if, whilst he was so busie at Work, with an endanger'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved People, by his Spirit and Providence; they gave over working, and left him to do it by himself, making him no Help or Furtherance by their Ministrations?</p>
               <p>How will they hope to approve themselves before him, to have been <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Faithful Ministers</hi> and <hi>Stewards,</hi> of Religion and its Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if they have not been, both <hi>Faithful Keepers,</hi> and <hi>Faithful Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensers</hi> thereof? will Religion and its Misteries, be judged to have been well kept, when it was suffer'd to be spoiled and rifled, and when the brightest <hi>Gems</hi> of this inestimable <hi>Depositum,</hi> have been broken, embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel'd, or made away; and its choicest Flowers pick'd out, and not only base, but poysonous and corrupt Weeds put in their Places? Or, will they be deem'd, to have been their Faithful Ministers and Dispensers, who have not Minister'd or Dispenced them on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to others, but concealed and kept them up to themselves? Or Dispensers of them, by Church Ministrations, at the Head of visible Societies; who have not Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Administred them to any Churches, or headed any Societies of Faithful Upright Christians, in the free and stedfast Profession and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance thereof.</p>
               <p>How can they expect, at the Great Day of Accounts, to pass for Men that have acquitted themselves, as <hi>Good VVatchmen,</hi> if all the Time, whilst Sin and Death were advancing to make the People their Prey, they could spie no Enemy; or, if they did, would speak of none, nor warn against them? Or, for Trusty <hi>Over-seers,</hi> if they over-looked the most pressing Wants of their Charge, or gave no Caution, nor made any Supply or Provision for them? They are ill <hi>Over-seers,</hi> that over-look,


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44279:34"/>
when they should espie their Peoples Necessities, or Dangers. And over-see, not as Keepers and Guardians, but Conspirators and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers, if, when they see them, they will not discover them, but let them silently and securely run into Destruction.</p>
               <p>Can they imagine he will call them <hi>Faithful Guides,</hi> who left a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were Ignorant of the true Way, to guide themselves, or to be misguided by Seducers; who would not shew the right Way, when all Endeavours were used to make them go wrong; nor, when they saw them Straying, would call out to them to come back again? Or, that he will repute them <hi>Good Shepheards,</hi> who have taken no Care to Feed their Flocks with Spiritual Ministrations, nor to Guard and Arm them against Wolves and Seducers, nor to keep them together, when they are in Danger to be Scatter'd; nor to bring them back, when they are straying from the Fold? Or, that he will receive and welcome them, as constant and faithful Teachers of his Church, who have let Men Sin and Perish, for want of Teaching; and could silently sit by, and hear them Mistaught by Seducers; and, instead of stopping their Mouths, give way to Gain-Sayers; whose Lips did not preserve, and keep up Knowledge among the People, but suppress and conceal it from them; and who, instead of Seeking, shun'd the Seasons of Ministring the Word, and of giving <hi>Gods</hi> People the Necessary Instructions?</p>
               <p>How will they hope to approve themselves at that Day, as having been the <hi>Lights of the World,</hi> if they held this Light as Dark-Lanthorns, ministring none to the World, but letting it sit still in Darkness? Or, as the <hi>Salt of the Earth,</hi> if, by pure and wholsome Ministrations, they did not season the Inhabitants thereof, but suffer'd them, for want of Seasoning, to run into Spiritual Corruption and Putrefaction? If they appear then, to have been such Salt, as did nothing to keep out Corruption, they will be in Place of <hi>Salt without Savour,</hi> as our Blessed Lord says, or of <hi>Insipid Salt.</hi> And such, instead of being set by, and carefully laid up, he declares to be <hi>Good for nothing, but to be cast out, and troden under Foot,</hi> Mat. 5. 13.</p>
               <p>So that all the Parts and Offices, the Titles and Characters of their own Sacred Powers, do most fully and lowdly proclaim to them the Duty of exercising their Spiritual Functions, and discharging their Holy Ministrations, in the foresaid Cases. And let them but look, to any of those Marks of Power and Care, which <hi>God</hi> has put upon them; or to any of those Stations, wherein he hath placed them; and they will effectually Remind them, how much they are obliged to stir up the Gift that is in them, when they see Religion wronged, and the Souls of Men endanger'd, by Immoral Worship and Doctrines, or by other great Invasions on Christian Worship, Faith, or Practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:44279:35"/>
Indeed, the Necessity of supplying the Church, with this Pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Faith, and Practice, is thought by some to go a great Way in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Ministerial Powers, on those who otherwise would not have them. And this is the Plea, for the Collation of the Ministerial Powers <hi>by Ordination of Presbyrers: without Episcopal Imposition of Hands, in some Foreign Churches.</hi> But not to examine that here, whatever force and Effect it have in that Case, of Conferring the Ministerial Powers on those who have them not; it must needs be a sure Call to the Exercise thereof, to those who have them, and are Endowed therewith.</p>
               <p>I do not say all Men are equally bound by the foresaid Characters, to exercise these Gifts; nor that the same Men are equally bound to it in all Places. The Blessed Apostles, had <hi>General Commissions,</hi> and were sent out expresly <hi>to all Nations,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. Other Bishops, have a more limited Inspection, and ought to be more especially Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over their own Diocesses, having more particularly undertaken the Charge thereof. But yet so, as to be the Bishops of the <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Part</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</note> Catholick Church, and for the Preservation of the Catholick Worship and Faith; who are therefore under Obligation of keeping these up, as far as they can, when they are Sinking and Over-Born in other Places.</p>
               <p>Indeed, in this Ministration, they are not to stand on Punctilio's of Obligation, doing no more than it can be proved they are bound to do in Rigor of Justice. But they are to shew Zeal and Affection, which doth not weigh Grains, but thinks that a Call, where it can do Religion and its Master any considerable Service; and that the more of this it can do, the better it is. <hi>The Spirit of Love,</hi> and Zeal, is the Spirit, which <hi>God</hi> requires in Pastors, to direct and Influence their Spiritual Exercises and Administrations. <hi>Lovest thou me?</hi> says <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> repeating this to him <hi>Three Times,</hi> when he charged him with the Pastoral Office, <hi>of Feeding his Sheep, and his Lambs,</hi> Jo. 21. 15, 16, 17. <hi>By the putting on of Hands in Orders, the Spirit, which God hath given us, is the Spirit of Love to Christ and his Church,</hi> and <hi>of Power</hi> or Firmness and Fearlesness of what Evil may befal our selves in prosecution thereof, says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. The Charge <hi>of Feeding the Flock,</hi> or the <hi>Over-Sight which they take,</hi> is not an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Charge, such as will go no further than it is compell'd; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>a VVilling and a Ready Mind,</hi> that, on any Call, is free and prompt of it self to Discharge it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
               <p>And this Spirit <hi>of Love,</hi> and <hi>Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which is the Principle of their Ministrations, stands not upon strict Terms: But, being full of Care for <hi>Christ,</hi> and for the Good of Souls, and Fearless of what may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by befal our selves, doth more or less, according as it's Measure and Degree is. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> had a great Measure thereof, and according to


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44279:35"/>
the Degree of <hi>it's working in him mightily, he laboured and strove Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly</hi> in the work of the Ministry, <hi>that he might present every Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Christ,</hi> Col. 1. 28, 29. He disputed not nicely, how far he was bound; but would readily go beyond the strict Terms: counting, whatever were the Over-plus, that it was to be expected from this Principle of Love and Zeal in his Master's Cause, and would abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly be made up by a surpassing Recompence. <hi>If I do this thing willingly,</hi> or beyond strict Command or Necessity, says he, speaking of some things in the course of his Ministration which he was not strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to, <hi>I have a Special Reward for so doing,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 15, 17. And proportionable to the Degree, of this Love and Zeal in others, will the Measure of their Service and Ministrations be likewise. They will still in any Places, be more Active to keep up the Catholick Faith and Worship; according as they are more perfect, in this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial or Pastoral Spirit.</p>
               <p>And thus, at length, I think it may fully appear, that <hi>Christ</hi>'s Faithful Ministers are on many Accounts Obliged not to suppress their Ministrations, but to supply the Church therewith, when that is Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to prevent a Peoples being nursed up in Irreligious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive Ways, like as are, not only Idolatry and Speculative Heresies, but also, Immoral Doctrines and Practices, and Immoral Worship and Devotions. And therefore should those things prove Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which, on any Revolution, happen to be justified in any Kingdom, and are every where Press'd and Recommended to the Peoples Practice, and are salved by the foresaid or such like new Doctrines, and are brought into Prayers, and publick Offices and Devotions in those Countries: The deprived Bishops and Clergy in that State, would be under all these Obigations to exercise their Functions, and to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to the Church in those Cases.</p>
               <p>And this would absolutely set aside the Argument, from the foreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sayings of <hi>Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and <hi>Chrysestom,</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> for the cessation of Rightful Bishops to the intruding Anti-Bishops. For these Cessations, are in a Cause that concerns only Personal Rights, not that touches the Interests of Religion, or the Salvation of Souls. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining the Truth of the particular Histories, wherein are Errors enough as others have made appear; it will also effectually put by all the Force of the <hi>Greek Manuscript in the Publick Library at Oxford;</hi> or of the Collection of Instances of Injured Bishops resting under unjust De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privations, and keeping in the Communion of the new Intruders into their Places, lately Translated by Mr. <hi>Hody.</hi> For those Instances of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescence and Communion, are brought, as the <hi>Author of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44279:36"/>
were <hi>Orthodox.</hi> And so, are no Instances for Acquiescence, in the Cause and Oppression of pure Worship and Doctrine, or of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Souls: But only in Competition of Persons, where the publick Offices to be administred, the Doctrines to be taught and upheld, and the Practices to be Pressed and Justified under them, were the same under both.</p>
               <p>And therefore there can be no pressing Silence, or Cessation, on the Deprived Bishops and Clergy at such times, with any Appearance of Truth and Reason, but by clearing those things which they stick at, and which they see everywhere imposed on Worship and Practice, of all Immorality and Unrighteousness. Which, on such Revolutions and Change of Masters, they can never do, who profess to transfer Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and to do all on the Plea of a <hi>King de facto,</hi> leaving the Dispossessed Prince to be still <hi>King de Iure.</hi> By which, in their own Account, they are acting all the while against Right, and against him that has it; which is to be, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says of <hi>Stubborn Hereticks</hi>

So that all those Brethren, who on such Occasions, have profess'd this, must condemn their own Principle, and all the complyance they have paid thereupon, before they can accuse the Deprived Pastors for holding on still in their Spiritual Administrations, or can perswade them to forbear, But that which alone can be effective to purge the things in Debate, of this Immorality and Unrighteousness, is the <hi>Clearing of the Legal Right,</hi> (which the publick Acts of such times, I think are not wanting to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,) as the Ground of all that is then call'd for, either in Practice, or in Worship. And the Discussion of this, is no Part of my Design or Purpose in these Papers.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Point, of <hi>their Obligations to these Ministrations,</hi> I only add in the <hi>last Place,</hi> that if, for keeping up pure Worship, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Practice, <hi>Christ</hi>'s Faithful Pastors are bound to afford these Ministrations in the forementioned Cases, <hi>his Faithful People will in the same Cases stand bound to adhere to them, and to attend on them for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Obligation will appear,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From that Adherence they owe to the things themselves.</hi> They are bound to Purity of Worship, Belief, and Practice, that they may Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiate and please <hi>God,</hi> and Benefit their own Souls thereby. As Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, or as Men Professing Christian Religion, they are obliged to U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite themselves to these, and to stick by them. And that, in Church So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and under Pastoral Administrations, to keep up <hi>a Communion of Saints</hi> in such pure Worship and Professions. And this must be under such Bishops and Ministers, as retain and stand true to them, when others fall off from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:44279:36"/>
As Members of a Church, 'tis true, good Christians stand obliged to adhere to their own Bishops. For the Bishops, are the Heads of Church-Societies; and 'tis the Duty of Members, to stick and keep United to the Heads of their respective Bodies. But this, as I shall shew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, is only whilst they keep to those things, wherein they are bound to head them, that is, to pure Christian Worship and Doctrines. It is for the having these Administred, that they are obliged to be under any Pastors, or to adhere to them. And so they must still adhere to such, as do Administer the same. Which, if their own Bishops fail to do, they are to stand off from them, to hold on with such pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Doctrine, and to have the Administration thereof from such other Bishops and Pastors, as keep True and Firm thereto, whereof I shall speak more at large, in its <note n="†" place="margin">Part 3. chap. 3. &amp; 4.</note> proper Place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Duty on their Part, in all the foresaid Relations.</hi> For those Relations, carry Duties on both sides, and call, as the true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors to Feed and Minister to the Church; so all True Members of the Church, to seek their Food from the Ministrations of such true Pastors. As it is the Part and Office of the One, to Administer them: So is it of the Other, to attend on their Administration, for Participation thereof. If they are <hi>Christs True Shepheards,</hi> to whom should <hi>his Sheep</hi> adhere, but to <hi>his Shepheards,</hi> and <hi>know and hear their Voice,</hi> and <hi>not give Ear to the Call</hi> and <hi>Voice of Strangers?</hi> Jo. 10. 3, 4, 5. If they are <hi>the Faithful Guides of Souls,</hi> to whose Ministerial Conduct and Direction, should the People of <hi>God</hi> commit their Souls, but to theirs, who will lead them out, and carry them on, only in Safe and Right Ways? If they are the <hi>Trusty Watchmen,</hi> under whose Watch and Guard, should Men, who seek nothing but to save their Souls, place themselves, but under those, whose Eyes are always open to see, and their Voice lift up faithfully to admonish and warn them of their Dangers? If they are <hi>the true Teachers,</hi> to whom should the Schollers and Disciples of <hi>Christ</hi> Resort for Instruction, but to them, and attend, as Obedient Learners, on their Preaching and Exhortation? If they are <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> his People must keep close to their Ministrations, and adhere to them, as to his trusty Officers and Representatives here on Earth. And if they are to be Fed with the Ministration of Holy Worship and Doctrines, and to be instructed and bore up, only in Righteous and Good Practices; if they must take Care, to be Warned and Guided, Taught and Helped on, only in these Things, which are the things alone, that are fit to please <hi>God,</hi> and to save their Pretious Souls: To whom must they Cleave, and keep United for them all, but to those Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, who daily provide them with this Food; and to those Guides, who conduct them in these Ways; and to those Watchmen, who fail

               </head>
               <p>HItherto I have endeavoured to mark out the cases, wherein the Bishops, and Pastors of Christs Church are bound to exercise their Ministerial Powers, and to proceed on duly in their Administrations. And to set forth the great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Obligations, which are incumbent on them in those Cases,</p>
               <p>And having thus laid out <hi>their Obligations,</hi> I shall next consider <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints,</hi> which at such times <hi>are most pleadable in these cases,</hi> by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> of <hi>what force a deprivation of state, or the Preservation of External Communion and Peace in the Church, ought to be in D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>barring them thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> One great thing, that may be alledged, to silence Faithful Bishops and Ministers of Gods pure worship and Righteousness, and to stop the course of their Ministrations in the foresaid Cases, is a <hi>Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of state,</hi> when the secular Power, by its Laws and interdicts, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids those Ministrations, and removes them from their Sees, putting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into their places.</p>
               <p>For Bishops and Pastors, as they are Ministers of Christ, so are they also Subjects of the state: And therefore, as some think, ought not to exercise their Ministry, at least <hi>not among their Subjects,</hi> nor <hi>in any</hi> Diocess <hi>of their Dominions,</hi> in opposition to it. And in Christian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the Church is incorporated into the state. And by the Benefit of this incorporation, Bishops and Pastors have their spiritual Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations back'd with secular Effects and Censures, as <hi>Excommunication</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, makes lyable to Temporal imprisonment, and incapacitates from carrying on any <hi>civil suit,</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> in the <hi>civil courts.</hi> They have also their jurisdiction extended thereby, to some secular matters; as the Bishops courts are to matters of <hi>Wills, Marriages, Benefices,</hi> &amp;c. And are encouraged therein, by <hi>Secular Benefices, Honours,</hi> and <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds.</hi> Now all these secular Fortifications, jurisdictions, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements in their Ministrations, conferr'd on the Bishops and Pastors


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44279:38"/>
of an incorporate Church, are the gifts of the state, and are secular additions, to what Spiritual Powers they received from <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> And what the state gives, the state, when it sees cause, may deprive them of. So that incorporate Ministrations, or Administring these Spiritual Powers in the mixt and fortifyed way of an incorporate Church, may seem, as some will argue, more subject to the state, to take out of some, and to put into other hands.</p>
               <p>Especially considering, that in grateful return and commutation for the benefit of incorporation, or for being made free of the state, and having the secular accessions; the Church, by Compromise, has parted with some of its priviledges to the Civil Power. Thus, since the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, has it, in compliance, given up to the state, the <hi>Nomination of Bishops and Metropolitanes,</hi> belonging anciently to the other Bishops of the Province, or to the Clergy and People of the Church. And that <hi>Rules agreed on in Synods, shall be no Canons, till they be approved and ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prince:</hi> And that there shall be <hi>no Admission, or Refusal of Clerks to Cures,</hi> or <hi>use of Discipline,</hi> but in <hi>consistence with,</hi> and under <hi>Regulation of the Kings P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erogative,</hi> and the <hi>Laws of the Land;</hi> and the like. And by these Cessions, they may seem, as some think, to have Cut off all Power of Contesting the States Nomination or Advancement to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or its Deprivation and Removal from them; as having, by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given up these Priviledges, in way of bargain and exchange, to keep on the benefits and State enjoyments of an incorporate Church.</p>
               <p>But as to this Regard, which they ought to have to State depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in bar of the foresaid Ministrations, I observe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> that this Regard is to be press'd, only <hi>under a supposed Legal and Rightful State.</hi> For 'tis to their Rightful Prince, that, as good and faithful subjects, they owe all their Obedience, which is call'd for in these cases. What Regard they are to pay as subjects, must be to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation. But not if they are deprived by an Usurper set up against him, who really has no Regal Authority over them, but only pretends to it, and assumes a Power which is none of his own. Especially, if he should deprive them, for their Adherence to their Lawful King: As if <hi>Athaliah</hi> had <hi>deprived Jehojadah,</hi> for adhereing to <hi>Joash</hi> his true Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; or as the <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ellious Parliament</hi> did depose, not only <hi>the Bishops</hi> and Episcopal Clergy, those Faithful Adherers to the Crown, but <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi> it self in <hi>King Charles</hi> the <hi>First's</hi> time. For then, as there is no real Authority, to bind on; so neither would there be any Equity, or Colour of Law, to back such a deprivation, or to oblige the sufferers to acquiesce therein. The Law, which still supports the Right of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King against his Usurpation, must needs support the Rights of all his Adherents against the same: And as still he would be the Legal King;


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44279:38"/>
so would they, not only be the real, but, in Eye of Law, the Legal pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, not withstanding his Forcible Removal of them. And therefore there is no room for this regard to a deprivation of State, on the Plea of a <hi>King de Facto,</hi> or on supposal of <hi>unrighteous usurpation.</hi> The <hi>Legal Right,</hi> asserted still by the <hi>Publick Acts</hi> on such Revolutions, will give it place to go as far as it can. But as for all those, who give up the Legal Right, 'tis not for any of them, (and 'tis well known how considerable a part they make among the writers, as well as among the practicers in this point,) to urge the Authority of a deprivation of State in this question.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> a <hi>Deprivation of a Lawful state,</hi> if supposed to pass on Bishops and Ministers, <hi>would be no conscionable discharge from keepeng on their spiritual Ministrations, against such immoralities as are set down in the aforesaid cases.</hi> For <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who gave them their Ministerial Powers, requires them, as his Ministers and as Pastors of his Church, to exercise them for him, and for the Souls of Men, as I have shewn, when those Cases happen. And if the State forbids what he commands, they are to hear or obey no state, or Power on earth, against him. But must answer, as the <hi>Apostles</hi> did to the <hi>Jewish Rulers</hi> in this Case; <hi>whether it be lawful in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</hi> Act. 4. 18. 19. 20. And thus it must needs be, in men who are call'd to be his Ministers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der persecuting States; and to be Ministers of a Religion, which is <hi>a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Cross,</hi> and bids them expect and prepare to bear Crosses un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der oppressive powers; as is plainly the Case of Gospel-Ministers. For if they must be his Ministers, and administer this Religion in persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they must hold on Ministring, when the state where they live breaks with them, and both most strictly forbids, and most cruelly persecutes them for so doing. And thus the <hi>First Ministers</hi> did, who were to plant Christianity, against all the Edicts and Oppositions, of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> or <hi>Jewish</hi> Magistrates. And so did all the Faithful Bishops and pastors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who, in all the succeeding persecutions of the Church, stuck firm to their Ministrations, against all the inhibitions and oppressive force of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Rulers; or else, our holy Religion had perish'd long since, and had never descended pure and perfect as it is, to our days. And so must all others do, in any present, or succeeding Tryals, (which, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have done, so always will seek to suppress Christs worship and Truth, by suppressing the pastoral administrations thereof,) that, by their Ministry, it may not fail in the Church, but be held on the same, and continued down to the worlds end.</p>
               <p>But this I say, as to their pure <hi>spirtual Powers, and Ministrations,</hi> which they neither did, nor could receive from the Civil State, on which he never conferr'd it, but which they hold independantly of <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> That is, what spiritual powers they have received from <hi>Christ, by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi>


                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44279:39"/>
                  <hi>of Hands</hi> continued down from the Apostles: for the feeding and governing of his Church, by Administration of the Word, of Prayers, and Sacraments, by leting into the Church, and excluding out of it; and for providing a constant succession of the same Ministrations, by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering or Ordaining others: These mere spiritual powers, they must exercise as his Ministers, without regard to any deprivation, or inhibition of Worldly Princes. For Earthly Kings, cannot deprive them of these mere spiritual powers, because they have them not from them, but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister therein, not by theirs, but by Christs Commission. If Secular Princes gave them their Commissions to exercise their spiritual Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, they might recall them: If they were the fountain of these pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and could make or ordain Bishops, they might have more plea to unmake and deprive them. But not originally proceeding from them, but from Christ himself, by a way of his own prescribing, in a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Apostolical imposition of Hands,</hi> through all Ages of the Church: They cannot be reversed, by their deprivation. Nor are the Bishops and Pastors, to be debarr'd the exercise thereof in any Case where Christ requires it, at their inhibition; because they are Christs Servants more than theirs, and must obey God rather than man. But</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> as for any <hi>Temporal accessions</hi> and <hi>enforcements of these mere spiritual Ministrations,</hi> which the Church receives when once it is shone upon by earthly powers, and made incorporate or free of the State: <hi>These Accessions are borrowed Powers, and the Gift of Princes; and under the deposition of a Lawful state, the Bishops and Ministers of Christ must not challenge or pretend to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to these I observe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the civil state hath Power over these Temporal Accessions &amp; secular endowments, because it confer'd them.</hi> When <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> turn Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>they come not in only as members, to partake in these mere spiritual Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but as Patrons, by their secular power, to back and Promote them.</hi> They must shew themselves <hi>Nursing-Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Nursing-Mothers,</hi> as was foretold <note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 49. 23.</note> by the <hi>Prophet:</hi> and <hi>serve the Lord as Kings,</hi> that is <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>In hoc Reges, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut iis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitus praecipitur, Deo serviunt in quantum Reges sunt, si in suo Regno bona jubeant, mala Probibeant, non solum quae p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying their Kingly Power to encourage and advance his service,</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>In hoc ergo serviunt Domino Reges in quantum sunt Reges, cum ea faciunt ad serviendum illi, quae non possunt facere nisi Reges.</hi> Id. Ep. 50. <hi>Ad Benifacium virum militarem.</hi>

                  <hi>doing him those services, which none can do but themselves,</hi> as St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells them.</p>
               <p>Thus, to give encouragement and leisure for the Ministers to attend on these Ministrations without distraction, the civil State endows them with


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44279:39"/>
benefices, or worldly freeholds, Honors, and priviledges. It also allots them publick and Authorized places, for these Ministrations; and makes Civil Laws, requiring people duly to resort to them, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishing all disturbers of them, and such as carry themselves indecently thereat. It likewise adds a secular jurisdiction, to the spiritual, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the spiritual jurisdiction, to the Cognizance of Wills, Marriages, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are Civil matters; and backing it by Temporal Accessions in the spiritual parts thereof, making a mixture and Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Religious and civil powers, in the spiritual Courts. For thus, the <hi>Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ricks,</hi> it passes into Laws; and the <hi>Canons</hi> also, which are the Rules of exercising that jurisdiction, it binds on the Subjects with the <hi>Kings Approbation,</hi> and <hi>Ratification,</hi> or with a <hi>Civil strengthing.</hi> And the <hi>Spiritual censures</hi> or judgements according to these Rules, it backs with civil penalties, as imprisonment; or with putting men under civil incapacities, as to plead in an Action at Law, or the like.</p>
               <p>Now all these Temporal Helps and Accessions, come not to the Bishops and Ministers immediately from Christ, or as they are <hi>Ministers of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> For <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 18. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>His Kingdom, is not of this world:</hi> Nor was he, whilst on earth, any judge in civil matters; Nor doth he confer any such worldly powers, or grant any such commissions. But all these secular benefices and fortifications, in all the parts of the spiritual Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, are the gifts of Princes. They flow from their favour to the Church, or from their taking upon them to be its Temporal Patrons, or it's <hi>Nursing Fathers</hi> and <hi>Nursing Mothers.</hi> And as the Bishops and Ministers of Christ, hold them only by their commission: So may they lose them by their recalling it. So that although the state has no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, either to give, or to deprive the Ministers of Christ, of their mere spiritual powers: Yet has it a direct Authority, to grant or deprive them, of these Temporal Additionals,</p>
               <p>And therefore the Bishops and Ministers of Christ in an incorporate Church, when they are deprived by their Rightful Prince, or by a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal State, must exercise their mere spiritual powers in the foresaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, without any of these civil effects or mixtures. That is, they can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Administer the Word, and prayers, and Sacraments, and let in mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by baptism, and on just cause cast them out by excommunication, and ordain others that shall hold on from time to time to do the same. But in discharge of these mere spiritual powers, they cannot claim the establish'd places, wherein to assemble for these Ministrations; nor any enforcement of Civil Laws, to make men duly frequent them, and to hinder all from disturbing them, or from demeaning themselves disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or irreverently at them. Nor can they claim any secular benefices,


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44279:40"/>
for maintenance of those who Minister therein; nor to have any Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, of Wills, Tyths, or other Temporal matters; nor to have their Canons, made Regal injunctions; or their Rubricks, made Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Laws; and the breakers thereof punishable by Civil Magistrates, in their estates, or Persons; nor their spiritual censures, to bring men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der civil incapacities, or make them lyable to civil punishments, or the like. The state, that gave these Civil Accessions to the Bishops and Pastors, in their incorporation; has call'd them back and taken them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, in their deprivation. So that now, to stick to Christ, they must quit the benefits of incorporation, and the Favor of Princes. And, as men left to their naked spiritual powers, which no rightful state can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of; be content to exercise their spiritual Ministrations in the foresaid cases, not as in an endowed and secularly protected, but as in a persecuted, or secularly destitute Church.</p>
               <p>And as the state has power, over all these secular endowments of the spiritual ministration, because it conferr'd them: So has it,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Over some other Powers, which belong'd to the Church, whilst it kept se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, but which it gives up to the Civil State during the benefit of incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it.</hi> For some powers the Church may have no necessity to insist on, either for the sake of Religion, or of the Souls of Men. And such powers, for the greater benefit of incorporation, it may be free to part with.</p>
               <p>Thus, provided the substance of Religion were secured, and kept up among men, in all necessary points of Worship and Doctrine; and the main of discipline were taken care for by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons already allowed, as it <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Provided, That such Canons, Constitutions, Ordinances, and Synods Provincial, being already made, which be not contrariant nor repugnant to the Laws, Statutes and Customs of this Realm, nor to the Dammage or Hurt of the Kings Prerogative Royal, shall now still be used and executed, as they were afore the making of this Act, till such time as they be view'd, search'd, or otherwise order'd or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,</hi> &amp;c <hi>according to the Tener and effect of this present Act. Statute of submission of the Clergy,</hi> 25. H. S. c. 19. 7.</note> was on <hi>the submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Church</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> made under <hi>King Henry</hi> the <hi>eighth:</hi> the Church might be free, by Compromise, to agree, that it would <hi>exercise no Canons already made,</hi> but such as were consistent with the <hi>Kings Prerogative,</hi> and the <hi>Laws of the Land:</hi> And that, in Case of any others, a stop should be put to the proceedings of the spiritual courts, by <hi>secular Prohibitions.</hi> And that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Clergy, should <hi>not meet</hi> to make more, or <hi>Assemble in Synod</hi> or <hi>Convocation,</hi> but when <hi>summon'd thither by the Kings writ:</hi> Nor any of their agreements should be given out for <hi>Canons,</hi> or <hi>Orders,</hi> but what he allow'd to pass under his <hi>Ratification:</hi> And that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were passed, in things <hi>Dispensable,</hi> on just cause in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar case, he should have the chief power to <hi>Grant a Dispensation.</hi> That all Bishops coming in to Govern this Church, according to the foresaid


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44279:40"/>
Rules and Prescriptions, should be of his <hi>Nomination.</hi> And that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of all Ministers, to beneficed and civilly fortifyed Cures and Administrations, should be according to the <hi>Rights of Patronage</hi> establish'd by the Laws; and such like.</p>
               <p>These, and such like powers, are naturally resident in the Church it self in a separate state, or when it stands-upon its own bottom, and is not incorporated. For, as a society, it must have power in it self, to make needful and wholesome Rules of Government, from time to time; and to have its Bishops and Ministers meet together, as they can, that they may make them; and to appoint persons, who shall be entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Administration thereof. And accordingly, whilst the Church was kept separate from the State, and persecuted by it, these powers were exercised by the Church, and by its Bishops and Pastors, under all the Heathen Persecutions. During which, the Clergy under their Bishops, and the Bishops under their Metropolitanes, were convened and met in Synods, and made Canons, and decided Controversies, and sentenced Criminals, and fill'd up vacancies in Presbyteries, or Bishopricks, having a New Bishop elected by the Metropolitane and Bishops of the Province, or sometimes by the Clergy and People of the Diocess; and the like.</p>
               <p>Indeed, as good subjects of the state, they are bound to keep all inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent state Laws; and cannot, by any devised Canons of their own, cast off their Obligation, or forbid themselves, or the Church, to pay a due civil obedience by observance thereof. So that they have no power in any condition, of making any Church Canons, which require subjects to act against innocent state constitutions. Nor may they Lawfully refuse, when the state calls them, to meet together in Synods, or otherwise: but, as Good Subjects, are obliged to pay a ready obedience, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon its summons. These, are only proper expressions of civil sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, from which the Church can in no state or condition plead exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, tho' they may not disobey the state summons; yet, when it meddles not therewith, in a separate condition, they have power to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble themselves, as they can, and as need requires, taking care to do it in such ways, as will make it least jealous of them. And when Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, tho' they can make, or inforce no Canons, to defeat any innocent civil constitutions; they have power in such separate state, to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are consistent with them, and to exercise the other now mention'd powers, as I say the Church did in the primitive persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But when it became incorporate, and was obliged by the favors and priviledges of the state, the Church, by <hi>agreements,</hi> partly <hi>express,</hi> and partly by Tacit and practical, carryed in prescription, and the practice

               <p>These, it parted with to the civil power, for its Greater Honor. And also to secure it, of its Good Behaviour; being tyed thereby to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance in things, which it was not bound to insist on, for the sake of Religion and of a Good Conscience; and to prevent all jarring and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfereing with that power, in whose Favor and Society it found so great benefit; seeking herein, to keep up that Beneficial kindness and Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, which is between them. And these it gave up to it, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and more in some places, and less in others: Being put upon parting with less at first, and with more afterwards; especially after the <hi>Papal Usurpations</hi> in the <hi>Western Church,</hi> grew so very troublesome and prejudicial to Princes and their Kingdoms, in point of <hi>investitures, Appeals,</hi> &amp;c. Which made them more sensible of the advantage, of having these powers quietly and uncontestedly lodged in their own Hands.</p>
               <p>These it might safely part withall, during the incorporation, as retaining still, what it could not part with, viz: <hi>a Power of stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by all Necessary Points of worship and Doctrine,</hi> and of <hi>doing what is necessary for the Souls of Men;</hi> and as being also fitted all the time in the main, with <hi>what is needful in Point of Discipline.</hi> And its parting with them, was in way of Compromise and Bargain, as a grateful Return, for the benefits and priviledges of its Enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisement and Incorporation; or on consideration of its enjoying a Freedom, not only of exercising spiritual ministrations; but of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising them in the way of an incorporate Church, <hi>viz.</hi> in holding Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, and in being back'd therein by secular Jurisdiction, Laws, and Priviledges.</p>
               <p>And whilst these benefits of Incorporation are held on in favour of the Truth, the cession of the Church in these Points is to be held on too, and not to be resumed back again.

               <p>But now all this giving up these, or the like powers, to the State, for the sake of this Incorporation, and in way of bargain and compromise; or other abridgement of its own ministrations; is,</p>

               <p>They can neither discharge themselves, I say, nor receive any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from Princes, of exercising these Powers, where Christ requires they should exercise them for the Service of Religion &amp; of Souls, as I have shewn he doth in the fore mentioned cases. <hi>In Stewards, it is required that they be found faithful,</hi> in dispensing out these Ministrations as he orders, not in suppressing them contrary to Order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 2. <hi>Necessity is laid upon me, and woe be to me,</hi> is here the Scripture denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>if they preach not the Gospel,</hi> or fail trustily to discharge that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry they have undertaken, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. No earthly Powers, by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them the benefits of Incorporation, get any Authority over <hi>Christs Ministers,</hi> to discharge them of Ministring to their Master in these matters. For this would be, to give the civil power, which ought to keep under Christ, a power over him. It would turn them, from <hi>Nurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fathers,</hi> who, by giving it a civil enfranchisement, undertake to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the true Religion; into <hi>devouring Wolves,</hi> who seek to make a prey of it. It is expresly declared against by the Apostles, who appeal to the


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44279:42"/>
common sense of mankind, <hi>Whether they are not bound to obey God, rather than men,</hi> Act. 4. 19. 20. And would leave no ministrations of true Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Worship and Doctrin, under any Christian state, which should fall from any necessary parts thereof, and begin to persecute them: as the <hi>Arian Emperors</hi> did, in the Persecutions they rais'd against the Orthodox; and as <hi>Popish Princes</hi> did, in like violences used by them at any time, against our Protestant Brethren or Ancestors. Than which, nothing can be worse calculated for any Church of God, but especially for the Christian Church, which is to continue a Church in persecution, and to bear up Christian Worship and Doctrin, by due ministrations of both, when any powers of this World fall, from protecting, most violently to bear them down.</p>
               <p>And this in all times has been the Opinion and Practice of God's faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ministers, when the State, which, by Incorporation, should have back'd and strengthned them therein, fell to discharge and bar them of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations in these cases.</p>
               <p>Thus God's <hi>Faithful Prophets</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> did in the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> who approved themselves glorious Confessors and Martyrs, in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string God's Word and true Worship, when the State fell to break in upon them, and, instead of backing and protecting them in those ministrations, according to the purport of incorporation, fell violently to discharge and drive them from officiating any longer therein.</p>
               <p>Thus likewise <hi>Athanasius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria, Paulus</hi> of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Bishops did, in the <hi>Arian Persecution.</hi> The civil State had then received the Church into it self, &amp; endowed it with civil Edicts and enfranchisements.

               <p>And thus also our own Ancestors continued to do, on the States turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, and, under Forfeiture of Incorporation, and all the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of a Bloody Persecution, forbidding them to go on administring the Word and Worship of God, according to the <hi>Reformation</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made by King <hi>Edward,</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time. For being to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster this Word and Worship, in duty to God, and in care of Souls, they set light by the Benefits of Incorporation and civil Advantages, and paid no regard to State-deprivations or inhibitions; but went on faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to administer the same, though at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eril of their Lives.</p>
               <p>I Grant, the desire of keeping on the publick benefits of incorporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may many times be a Reason for Bishops and Ministers, voluntarily to rest under State-deprivations and inhibitions, when 'tis a Case only of personal rights and priviledges. Such deprivations and inhibitions, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten affect persons only and not things, when, on the deprivation of one, the same Ministrations would be kept up by others: As was done in the depositions of <hi>High-Priests,</hi> so common in later times among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and of <hi>Patriarks,</hi> so ordinary at present among the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and may happen in other places. In all which, there is only a change of persons, but no change in ministrations; the Church being lead on in the same ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Worship, Doctrine, and Practice, under both. And here, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a breach with the state, and to keep on the way of spiritual ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the benefit of Secular Accessions, the Bishops and Pastors of an incorporate Church, (where it is not like to do the Church more hurt by an utter loss of its liberty in these points, than the incorporation desired will compensate,) may think there is more cause for the Churches sake, to rest under state-deprivations. They may esteem it their parts, to quit their own particular interests, to advance the Churches; and believe that the keeping on the publick benefits of incorporation, will abundantly compensate, for the wrongful encroachment made by such deprivation on a private person. But in Cases, which concern, not only the personal rights and priviledges of Pastors, but the substance of Religion, or the


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44279:43"/>
safety of Souls, and where Christ requires they should exercise their ministrations, as I have shewn he doth in the foresaid Cases: They must not let them fall, in regard to any inhibitions, or deprivations, even of their Lawful Princes. They must here slight all worldly benefit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and be willing, if need require, to undergo a persecution. And go on faithfully in their ministrations, as their bounden duty requires, and as in these Cases, Gods Faithful Ministers have done in all times.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly, what is so given up by the Church,</hi> for abridgement of its own power in spiritual ministrations, <hi>is only whilst it keeps united to the state, and receives protection, not when it is separated from it again, or falls under perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi> Its recessions, as I noted, were on consideration of State benefits, and as a grateful return for them whilst it was suffer'd to enjoy them. They are all upon the score of its union; and so cease when the State breaks off, and turns it up to it self again. For being made separate, it is no longer under any former tyes of incorporation, but acts again with the powers of a separate condition. And thus it is, when, instead of protecting, the State puts any necessary points of Doctrine or Worship, or part of their ministration, under persecution. When it separates its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, it separates it self. It drives out the Church, when it drives out any of those things, which the Church must stick to at all perils; and when, instead of incorporating, or civilly protecting the ministrations thereof, it falls to incorporate, and to protect the ministration of error and wickedness, in their place. It disfranchises pure Worship and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, when it enfranchises errors and corruptions contrary to them: And by turning to persecute the necessary ministrations of pure Religion, it breaks it self from them, and thence forward they are no longer <hi>one,</hi> but become <hi>two</hi> again.</p>
               <p>So that, whatever regard and complyance the Bishops and Ministers of Christ may shew, to such deprivations and inhibitions of the State where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into they are incorporated, whilst it inhibits no necessary Ministrations to Religion, or to the Souls of Men, but, in discharging all those, they injoy the priviledges and protection thereof: Yet are they not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged thereby, from ministring to the same in all the foresaid, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Cases; nor to be debarr'd of any of their spiritual powers, after once the state breaks with them, and, instead of yielding them the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of incorporation, puts them under persecution. But then, they must exercise these ministrations, only according to what they have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Christ, and from the Canons of the Church, so far as they do not interfere with any innocent State Laws, which restrain them as Good Subjects: Not with any Civil fortifications, and State Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ANd all this agrees well with the <hi>Ecclesiastical Supremacy</hi> own'd by our Church, and claimed by our Princes, <note n="*" place="margin">Can. 2. Eccl. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glic.</note> 
                  <hi>conformable to</hi> what was ascribed to, and claimed by <hi>the Godly Kings among the Jews, and the Godly Emperors in the Primitive Church.</hi> Whose <hi>Ecclesiastical Soveraignty, lyes not in their being invested with,</hi> or <hi>in their having a Soveraign Disposal of the Powers of Orders.</hi> But <hi>in retaining their Civil Soveraignty over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> whether <hi>Laymen,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticks.</hi> And <hi>in the subordination of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical courts and causes,</hi> which are content to act in subordination, on the score <hi>of their secular mixtures,</hi> as in <hi>beneficiary matters, censures,</hi> &amp;c.

Thus, <hi>King Henry</hi> the <hi>eighth,</hi> when he asserts his own <hi>Regal Supremacy</hi> over the Church, leaves all proper spiritual powers and Functions to spiritual persons; and, in the <note n="*" place="margin">Sta. 24. <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 12. 1.</note>

               <p>As to the <hi>Jews, it appertaineth not unto thee, O</hi> Uzziah! <hi>to burn incense unto the Lord, but to the Priests that are consecrated thereto,</hi> say the <hi>Priests to King Uzziah,</hi> when he would assume to himself the Priests Office, for which <hi>God</hi> miraculously <hi>smote him with a Leprosie</hi> upon the place, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 16, 18, 19, 20.

               <p>And the like appears, of <hi>the godly Christian Emperors,</hi> who were told by their Holy Bishops, and profess'd of themselves, <hi>That they were no Priests, and that their power of Empire did not swallow up the Sacerdotal powers.</hi>

And thus, by means of his civil Power over Spiritual Persons, has the King the like Power over Spiritual Acts &amp; Functions, <hi>viz.</hi> as he can require, and, by the civil Sword, compel them, whom Christ has empowered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in his Dominions, to exercise the same.

               </p>
               <p>The Foreign jurisdiction and Appeals particularly aimed at, is that, which was claimed here by the <hi>Popes of Rome.</hi> They had wrested from the Crown the foresaid Soveraignty, both over <hi>Ecclesiastical Persons,</hi> and <hi>Causes.</hi> For as to <hi>Ecclesiastical Persons,</hi> they claimed an exemption for

them, as not answerable in Civil Courts, but Cognizable only by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And as to <hi>Ecclesiastical Ministrations,</hi> as back'd by secular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; and Ecclesiastical Causes, as mixt in the Ecclesiastical Courts with Civil Priviledges and Jurisdiction; they disclaimed subordination to the Crown, and asserted a supremacy to themselves therein. For they made themselves <hi>supream</hi> here, in <hi>investitures into benefices and preferments;</hi> and to have the chief power; by their <hi>Legates,</hi> of <hi>calling our convecations;</hi> of <hi>passing, and ratifying, all our Decrees, Canons, and Constitutions;</hi> of <hi>granting dispensations</hi> from them; of <hi>having their decrees take place, of the Prerogatives of the Crown or of the Customs of the Realm;</hi> of <hi>holding courts;</hi> and of <hi>receiving Appeals from any of our spiritual courts, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catures,</hi> and the like. All which civil powers over Ecclesiastical Persons, and subordination of Ecclesiastical causes proceeding by the foresaid mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of secular fortifications, benefices, and jurisdictions; the <hi>statutes, Articles, injunctions,</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> of this Church and Realm about <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, abolish in the Popes,</hi> and <hi>assert to the Crown,</hi> to which they Ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did, and of right should belong.</p>
               <p>So that this <hi>Soveraign Civil Power, over all Ecclesiastical Persons,</hi> as their <hi>subjects;</hi> and this <hi>Subordination of all Ecclesiastical Causes to it,</hi> because of the <hi>Concurrence and intermixture, of the foresaid civil priviledges and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridictions therewith;</hi> and that <hi>in opposition to the papal pretences in these points;</hi> is the <hi>Ecclesiastical supremacy vested in the King,</hi> by our <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Laws.</hi> The Popes <hi>spiritual Usurpation upon this Church,</hi> was shaken off, by asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>the Arch-bishop of Canterbury the Brittish Churches Ancient, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant Primacy.</hi> Which did Right to the King too; it being against his Prerogative, that any Foreigner, who doth not own himself to be one of his Subjects, should have any Power in his Dominions. And his <hi>Civil Usurpation on the Crown,</hi> in respect to <hi>Ecclesiastical Persons,</hi> and <hi>Causes,</hi> among its Subjects, was thrown out <hi>by asserting of the Kings Supremacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the <hi>Supremacy</hi> speaks such a <hi>civil power over the persons of Ecclesiasticks,</hi> as they are its <hi>subjects,</hi> and such <hi>subordination of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal causes thereto,</hi> as they are united to secular benefices and jurisdictions: Yet at the same time, as I have shewn, doth it disclaim all pretence to <hi>meer spiritual powers,</hi> or <hi>to the Soveraign Disposal of the Powers of Orders.</hi> Of it self, it can neither give, nor recall them. Nor stop the Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, in any of those Cases where Christ requires them. All it can do there, is to withdraw its Civil incorporation, from those who have these mere spiritual powers, and are bound, for the sake of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and of the Souls of Men, to proceed in the exercise thereof. But still, that exercise and administration, which hangs on anothers Commission, will go on upon its own bottom, and must be discharged as it can, under the opposition, instead of the former incorporation of state, or under a civil Persecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44279:48"/>
And this continuance of such Ministrations in such Cases, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deposition of state, I think may fairly be concluded, from the Concessions of those, who have undertaken to plead for the Authority of <hi>state deprivations,</hi> and to press them on the suffering Clergy, at such times.</p>
               <p>We are told by <note n="*" place="margin">Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the New separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> one from Mr. <hi>Mason,</hi> that a <hi>state deposition of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, is not by way of Degradation, from his orders, as if he had them not; but of exclusion, from the exercise thereof. And that not absolutely,</hi> as if he could <hi>exercise his office</hi> no where; <hi>but after a sort, that he should not do it, as to their subjects, nor in their dominions.</hi> And by <note n="‖" place="margin">A Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of their Majesties Authority to fill the Sees of the Deprived Bishops, p. 18, 19, 20. (or as they should be marked, p. 22, 23, 24.)</note> another, that <hi>a state deprivation doth not concern the Character, or Ecclesiastical Communion, as an Ecclesiastical Deprivation doth; but only concerns the exercise of his Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Authority, in any Diocess within the Dominions of that State, or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Ecclesiastical Benefice in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, since such <hi>state deprivation</hi> neither <hi>concerns the Character,</hi> nor the <hi>Communion of the Church;</hi> 'tis plain he is a Bishop still notwithstanding their deprivation; and such a Bishop, as, without any fault in Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, all good Christians may Communicate with. And since <hi>his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Episcopal Powers</hi> is thereby excluded, only <hi>from the Dioceses and subjects of their dominions;</hi> it is still the same it was, as to all other places. And what is the hinderance, of exercising the same still in those dioceses, and among that Kings Subjects? One reason already cited is, because he cannot exercise them in the <hi>incorporate way,</hi> or <hi>in injoyment of any Ecclesiastical Benefice.</hi> But besides, another I conceive is sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, viz. <hi>Regard to state Authority,</hi> or <hi>civil obedience.</hi> Though <hi>neither the Faith, nor the Communion of the Church is</hi> here <hi>concerned;</hi> yet, <note n="*" place="margin">P. 20.</note> says the Learned Author last mention'd, <hi>the Authority of the State is, which obliges both the Clergy, and Laity, in these Cases.</hi> So that although neither his powers are thereby vacated, nor their dependance and communion with him is broken off on other accounts; yet in Civil Obedience, it seems, by his account both Bishops and People, on such state deprivation, are bound to acquiesce.</p>
               <p>But now, if they are left in full Possession of their spiritual powers, and of the communion of the Church; 'tis plain they cannot be debarr'd of their Ministrations in the foresaid Cases, nor the people of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on them, in any regard to secular inhibitions, or to shew Civil Obedience. For we must never hear Kings against Christ, or obey them, when they bar us of doing what he bids us do. And <hi>these Ministrations,</hi> he requires and calls for in the aforesaid Cases, as I have shewn; and also for the <hi>peoples communion</hi> with, and <hi>attendance</hi> on them. And it matters

not, that they cannot Minister any longer in the incorporate way, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shelter of Civil Laws, and enjoyment of benefices. For true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, and of Souls, must depise benefices and secular incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, when they come in competition with his service, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister his word and worship, at their hazard, and under persecutions.</p>
               <p>Besides, if, as he owns, such deprivation doth not affect the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church,</hi> it leaves the subjects of those dioceses still under the same Religious and Church Principles, of dependance and communion with their Bishops, as they were before it. For, though the state should not meddle therein, the Church has Principles of this dependance and communion, of its own. Christ requires his Church should be one; and that is by ahhereing to their Bishops, whom he has made the Heads of Union. And these, it seems, the deprivation of state doth not at all Cancel, <hi>only the Authority of state, as is</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>said, but not Church Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> being concerned therein. So that such Bishops deprived by the state, continue still to be Christs Bishops and Heads of Union in those dioceses, according to his Rules and Principles of Union. And then, how shall a mere command of state, dissolve the tye made by him, or break com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion betwixt their Bishop and them? Whilst Christ, by consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obligations of Church Unity, bids them adhere to their Bishop, and keep one with him; must they give ear to the state, that bids them, divide from him? I think on second thoughts, he will not make Church Union, or the dependance of people on their Bishops, so unsettled or precarious a thing, as either to have no fixt and conscionable principles, ingaging and holding all good Members thereto, of its own; or to have it in the power of a secular state, when it pleases to set them aside, and over-rule them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Remarques on the Preceding Account of the Force of State-Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and instances of Deprivations alledg'd to the contrary, consider'd, and clear'd up.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FRom what I have said in the <hi>foregoing Chapters,</hi> about the <hi>power of the Civil State, and the effect of its Deprivations,</hi> I think it may appear, that <hi>the Bishops and Ministers of Christ continue still invested with their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Powers, and can receive no discharge from the exercise thereof, in the formention'd Cases, by any State Deprivations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of this I observe, from what has been hitherto discoursed,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>First, That this is not to deny the Civil Power, the Cognizance of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Ministers, in Civil matters.</hi> Allegiance, 'tis true, is a civil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and most nearly concerns the civil peace. Indeed, it is not only Civil, but also Religious. For when men are requir'd to Swear it, and in all Churches to pray conformably to it, Solemn Oaths and Prayers, are most sacred and Religious Acts. And Allegiance in it self is a moral duty, for due payment whereof, all stand answerable to God in the last judgment; as well as a civil, or state-duty, for which they are answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the state in judicatures of this world. But it is such a matter of Religion, I say, as is also a civil matter, subject to civil Cognizance, or a point of State too.</p>
               <p>And if this is refused to a Rightful state, it is not only an offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Morality and Religion, which spiritual Judicatures and Synods may punish with Canonical Depositions: But also an offence against the state, which such Rightful state may punish by state punishments, as it may all other state offences; and in Ecclesiasticks, when they are guilty thereof, as in all other persons. And among these punishments, by <hi>Deprivation,</hi> though not of mere spiritual powers, (the state having no Authority to take away those mere spiritual powers, which it never gave,) yet of all that is Temporal in Church-Ministrations, so as that such refusers shall no longer hold benefices and preferments, or state endowments. Yea, and even as to those mere spiritual powers, it may make them of themselves to forbear any further exercise thereof, to keep state-favors and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Church, when their deprivation is in a case, that concerns only their own personal rights and priviledges, but not the Truths or cause of Christ, as was before observed.</p>
               <p>But if at any time, or in any Kingdom, this should be refused to an Usurping State, which has no Legal Right; but which calls for this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, Oaths, and solemn Prayers and Religious services conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44279:50"/>
thereto against him who has the Right: Then such refusal, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Religious, nor a Civil offence; neither against God, nor Gods Vicegerent, Divine or Humane Laws; but a due obedience to both. And this brings on the Case of all the foresaid immoralities, Damnifying Religion, and endangering Souls; wherein faithful Bishops and Clergy, whatever they incur by standing to their Spiritual Ministrations, must not let them fall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n regard to any Deprivation of Usurping Powers. Nay, nor in regard to the most rightful States, should they issue out against them state-deprivations, to stop their Ministrations against any such like immoralities, or other irreligious and endangering ways.</p>
               <p>And this Limitation, of the regard they ought to have to his depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>is not to deny the Rightful Civil Soveraign, any part of his just power over Ecclesiasticks.</hi> But only to deny him such a power, as would leave our Saviour Christ himself, who is his Master as well as theirs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o have no power over them. Or such a power, as should enable him to discharge them, of what Christ has given in charge to them; to take away what powers he confers, or to loose what he has tyed on. But under all this discharge of their foresaid Ministrations, notwithstanding his inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deprivations, it allows the Civil Magistrate as much Power over their persons, to mulct, banish, or put them to death, on just cause, as they are his Subjects, as over any others. And to have power also over the mixt way of administrations, so as to be able to deprive them, though not of all exercise of their spiritual powers, yet from holding or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising them with Temporal jurisdictions, effects, and priviledges, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the way of an incorporate Church. And to have those other fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Prerogatives, of conveneing Synods, passing Canons, sending prohibitions to stop any process in prejudice of the Prerogative, or of the Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which, for the favor and continuance of those secular mixtures, have accrued by incorporation, and belong to Christian Kings. And these things, which are <hi>allow'd,</hi> are as much, as any of them can claim of Ecclesiasticks, as they are <hi>Kings.</hi> And, on the other side, those things, which are <hi>denyed,</hi> are such, as they would abhor to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge or desire, who would own any subjection to Christ, or bound their pretensions as <hi>Christian Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> nor is it <hi>to set the Church above the State,</hi> as the <hi>Papal</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation pretended to do. But only to set Almighty God, and his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Son <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> above it. Not leaving subjects, whether Laicks or Ecclesiasticks, in complyance with any the most rightful state, to disobey God. Nor Ministers, to let fall any Services and Ministrations of Religion, or cure of Souls, which Christ calls them to exercise; yea, not only when the state is consenting, but when it gain-says it, and doth all it can, either to disable or discourage them from it; he not having thought fit to stand to the courtesy of any civil state, whether or no


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44279:50"/>
the Ministry, of saving Souls should be prosecuted, and whether he should be served, and have a Church on Earth.</p>
               <p>But at the same time, it sets God and Religion, above their Power; it subjects all, both Laicks and Ecclesiasticks, to the same in other things. Allowing every rightful civil state, the chief civil power over all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Persons. And the chief civil power over all Ecclesiastical Causes, so far forth, and so long, as they are mixed and compounded with civil benefices and jurisdictions. And a civil power to compel Church Men by civil penalties, to do the duty of their Spiritual Ministrations; and to hold them under a necessity, of <hi>not resisting by Arms,</hi> but of suffering with patience under them, when they punish and persecute them, not for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but for faithfully performing of the same. And this is to leave the civil power, to be chief in all civil matters, and to have several Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of Soveraignty in spiritual, so long as they proceed with civil mixtures: That is, to be supream in all, which it can call its own. Though at the same time it is not to be held superior to Christ, nor must be thought intrusted with the Supreme Disposal of the matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein men are empower'd of Christ by another sort of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
               <p>And from all these, 'tis plain, that it is no Revival of the <hi>abolished Papal Usurpations.</hi> For these, lay not in the Bishops asserting, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, of their own pure spiritual powers; or of their own indefeasible obligations, notwithstanding any state inhibitions and deprivations, to exercise them for the service of Religion and the Church, as Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires they should, in the foremention'd, and other like Cases. For this is no more, than has been done by the Holy Apostles, and by all faithful Bishops and Ministers, in all Ages. But in their claiming an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependancy on the state, in the exercise of spiritual powers and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, mixed and endowed with the borrowed adjuncts of secular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices and jurisdictions. And in their professing a dependance therein upon the Pope, seeking to him for investitures and confirmations, and making him the last judge by Appeals: As also depending on him, for conveneing Synods, for passing and confirming Canons, and granting dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations from them, and for other Matters, which, for their civil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of Churches, were granted to Christian Princes, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation accrued to the Crown. And Lastly, in their Challenging an Exemption of their persons from Civil Cognizance, so as not to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable in Civil Courts, and Coercible there by civil penalties, even for state-matters and offences. And the Retrenching of these Usurpations, was the business of our <hi>Reformers.</hi> But as for the independance of the Ecclesiasticks mere spiritual powers, and their obligations to exercise them in any Case, as may answer the Command of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and not the contrary inclination or inhibition of the Civil Magistrate, they were


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44279:51"/>
as far from intending, as from needing, to Reform it. Yea, soon after, they were most glorious Asserters thereof, in all their Ministrations for the service of Souls, and for the support of Truth; which they discharged against the deprivations and inhibitions of the state, as <hi>Confessors</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> during all the persecutions of <hi>Queen Marys</hi> Reign.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly, Nor is this to mistake, or to over-look the condition of an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate Church:</hi> But only not to over-value the Civil Benefits of Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration; and at the same time to under-value their Obligations, to Christ, to the Ministeries of Religion, and to the Souls of Men. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that Pastors and People, should keep obedient, and true to Christ: But it is not necessary, that they should keep in the favour of Princes, and continue a Church incorporate. Nay, it is necessary they should cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully take up the Cross, and be content to be a Church persecuted, when they can no longer enjoy the secular benefits of Incorporation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out yielding to an irreligious and ill Ministration; nor hold on Ministring to the necessary service of Souls, and of pure Religion, without incurring Persecution. For then, all Church-men of any Fidelity or Conscience, must shew themselves Ministers of Christ, not of Princes; and Guides, that watch for Souls, not for Benefices, and secular accessions: And, like their Great Master, and all good and holy Bishops, who were call'd by him, as we all are, to spiritual Ministeries, under whatever Persecutions of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, despise all state-favors and preferments in this world, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of fulfilling that Spiritual Ministry and most sacred Trust, which they have received from the Lord, and whereof one day they must give a most strict account.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is a very ill-grounded reasoning, which the aforesaid Author of the <hi>Vindication of their Majesties-Authority</hi> &amp;c. uses, to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize the deprivation of suffering Bishops at such times, for state-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by a mere Act of State, <note n="*" place="margin">P. 17.</note> thinking it well proved, if <hi>it is as certain a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d evident, as that the Church is, and must be incorporated into the State.</hi> For in the aforesaid Cases, for the service of Christ, and the sake of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of Souls, the Church is bound to break with the State, and to lay aside all thoughts of continuing incorporated, and submit to be persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It is then call'd to bear Christs Cross, for its stedfastness in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Ministrations; not to seek or court state-favors, by ceasing to Minister what is good, or consenting to Minister what is ill, in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Princes. And if, instead of being <hi>certain, and evident it must,</hi> 'tis <hi>certain and evident the Church must not</hi> be any longer incorporate, when it cannot purchase it, but on these Terms: Then in all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Cases, there is an end of all Arguments to perswade acquiescence, for the preservation of the incorporation of Churches in Christian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:44279:51"/>
But though this Principle, of <hi>Faithfully exercising their pure spiritual Minstrations in the foresaid Cases,</hi> without accepting any discharge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from mere state-deprivations, excludes all over-rateing of civil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation, or placing the Favor of Princes above the Favor of God, and benefices and preferments above the interest of Religion and of Souls. Yet doth it, at the same time, allow to an incorporate state, all that really doth belong to it. And therefore in these Ministrations, after depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a rightful state, it claims nothing, that came to Church-men by incorporation. But its Spiritual Ministrations, Christs Church then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, without the encouragement of state-benefices and preferments; without claiming the convenience of the establish'd places, for a free hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of its Religious Assemblies; or the guard and assistance of any of the foremention'd Civil Laws, jurisdictions, or other secular mixtures and state accessions, for the strengthning and furtherance of its exercise of any spiritual Functions. And what more should they look at in this <hi>state of incorporation,</hi> than to see, that as they do not let fall any spiritual service, which was not given up, nor can be stopped thereby: So, when devested thereof, that they do not challenge any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benefices, powers, or other endowments, which are dependant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>And this is not to make the claims and exercise of Ecclesiastical Powers by Bishops and Pastors, <hi>the same in all points at this day in an incorporate Church, as they were by the Ancient Canons, whilst the Church was separate from the state, under the Gentile Persecutions.</hi> It asserts them the same, as to Ministring all that is necessary in Religion, and in Care of Souls; which the Pastors are as much empowerd, and as much obliged to look to, under incorporation, as before it. And to be the same also in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points, given up and accruing to the State at the incorporation of the Church, as <hi>Naming of Bishops, Conveneing them in Synods, Ratifying of Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns, Dispensing with them,</hi> and the like; after once a rightful state breaks the incorporation, and puts the true Church from state-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and endowments, into a state of persecution. For then, the Church and State are divided again, as they were in the days of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Canons; and so they may be free, as Bishops then were, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise those powers by the Rule of those Canons, as they can, and as in prudence they shall see cause. But whilst the protection and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration holds, for the sake whereof it laid down its claim to those powers, and suffer'd them to become the States-Prerogatives; the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Ministers are not to pretend to them. And so, whilst the Church enjoys such incorporation, our own Church, by its <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> disclaims the exercise of these powers by it self, and confirms them to the Crown, as I formerly observed.</p>
               <p>Thus are the Recognitions, which Ecclesiasticks ought to make of the


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44279:52"/>
                  <hi>Supremacy of Princes,</hi> and all the Regard they ought to bear to the <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of the Church,</hi> fairly consistent with their Faithful discharge of their Spiritual Ministrations, after the State has deprived them, in the foresaid Cases. They stand bound to Christ there, to exercise the same, by manifold obligations, as I have shewn: And no deprivations of Princes, though they be Soveraign Governors of all their Subjects, and have endowed and incorporated the Chuch, can disable, or discharge them from it.</p>
               <p>And from this state of these matters, it may be easy to clear and take off the Force of <hi>those instances,</hi> which are brought of <hi>state-deprivations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrence of Ecclesiastical Synods,</hi> and to shew they are of no force in the foresaid Cases.</p>
               <p>The instances chiefly insisted on, are the <hi>Deposition of</hi> Abiathar <hi>by</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon; <note place="margin">Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of their Majesties Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to fill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 23. 24. 25, 26.</note> and the <hi>frequent,</hi> sometimes <hi>Annual depositions of their High-Priests by the Romans,</hi> when <hi>Judea</hi> fell into their Hands; the <hi>depositions of the</hi> Patriarks <hi>of the</hi> Greek <hi>Church, by the</hi> Turks; and the <hi>deprivation of Queen</hi> Maries <hi>Popish Bishops,</hi> by a <hi>commission of State,</hi> pursuant to an <hi>Act of Parliament, without a Synod,</hi> at the beginning of the <hi>Reformation under Queen</hi> Elizabeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, as for <hi>Abiathar,</hi> whom, for <hi>conspiring with</hi> Adonijah, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is said to have <hi>thrust out from being Priest unto the Lord,</hi> 1 King. 2. 27. it doth not appear, that <hi>Solomon</hi> did remove him from <hi>the dignity and office of High Priest,</hi> but only from <hi>the exercise thereof.</hi> For after this sentence was passed upon <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and after <hi>Joab</hi> the General also, his complice and conspirator, had been <hi>sentenced</hi> and <hi>suffer'd death,</hi> and <hi>Benajah</hi> was made General in his place, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 28. 34, 35: <hi>Abiathar</hi> is still reckon'd as <hi>Partner with Zadock,</hi> in the <hi>High-Priest-hood,</hi> 1 King. 4. For so, in the reckoning up of <hi>Solomons</hi> Officers, when <hi>Benajah the Son of</hi> Jehojadah, <hi>was over the Host,</hi> 'tis added, <hi>and</hi> Zadock <hi>and</hi> Abiathar <hi>were the Priests,</hi> v. 4.</p>
               <p>And as for the debarring him the <hi>Exercise of his High-Priests Office,</hi> that was the natural, and inseparable consequent, of <note n="†" place="margin">1 Kin. 2. 26, 27. and Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph. Antiqui. l. 8. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>his Banishment from</hi> Jerusalem <hi>to</hi> Anathoth <hi>for his Life.</hi> For the exercise of that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, was local, and fixed to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the <hi>Temple.</hi> In the <hi>Temple,</hi> were all the Priests tyed to officiate, whose Ministrations he was to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect; and in that was the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi>

                  <hi>his Fact deserved.</hi> So that <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar</hi> had nothing to contest in his Case, nor any mind to do it; being justly lyable to suffer so much more at the hand of the civil Power, than it was pleased to inflict on him.</p>

So that the Authority of a Deprivation of State, to unmake one, and to make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be a Bishop in their dominions during his Life, is ill-fetch'd from this Instance.

And where it doth not affect the state of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or the interest of Souls, but only their own personal Claims and Priviledges; God's faithful Ministers may be free, as has been observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to secure Protection and civil benefits to the Church, by not breaking with the State, but acquiescing under its deprivations. But what volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary deference were thus payable to a deprivation of State, in a case which doth not touch Religion, or the Souls of Men; must not be expected in other cases, which do touch, and damnisie and endanger both. And thus it is in the fore-mentioned cases, wherein I have been asserting the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of holding on their spiritual Ministrations, and not yielding to be stop'd thereof by any State-deprivations.</p>

And therefore, those deposed Patriarks, are not driven, by insisting on their spiritual Powers and Ministrations, to break this partial Incorporation, such as it is, for the support of pure Faith, Worship and Practice, or for

the Interest of Religion and of Souls; as I have shewn true and faithful Pastors are in the fore-mentioned cases.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fourth and Last Instance, is of <hi>Queen</hi> Maries <hi>Popish Bishops,</hi> deposed by a Commission of the <hi>Queens Council,</hi> without a competent and lawful Synod, and principally for a <hi>State-crime,</hi> viz. <hi>refusing the Oath of Supremacy,</hi> which was made a cause of deprivation by a preceding Act of her Parliament, under <hi>Queen Elizabeth:</hi> And of our <hi>Reformed Bishops com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into their Sees,</hi> upon such deprivation, during the others Lives.</p>
               <p>As to this Case of the <hi>Marian Bishops,</hi> or of other <hi>Popish Bishops</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Edward the sixth, Two</hi> Things are to be Noted in their Removal and Ejection out of their Dioceses. <hi>One</hi> is, from the <hi>Temporalities,</hi> the Benefices and Preferments thereof. And these temporal endowments, as I have observed, are directly subject to the temporal Power. So that the <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>Proceedings of the Council,</hi> and the <hi>Commission of the lawful State,</hi> took away all Claim to the <hi>Temporalities,</hi> and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them of their Bishopricks, as they were <hi>Temporal Free-holds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Other</hi> is, from the <hi>spiritual adherence and dependance of the People upon them, as on Heads of Church-Unity and Communion, for Religious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations.</hi> And this, there was no need for the State to deprive the <hi>Popish</hi> Bishops of; for they had already deprived themselves of it, by their own Corruptions, both in Doctrines, and Devotions.

And this was done by the <hi>Popish Bishops,</hi> who fed the People with false Doctrines, and polluted Prayers and Ministrations; which left no need of any thing more to deprive them of the Peoples Communion and Dependance, these <hi>Papal</hi> Corruptions of Religious Ministrations, being enough to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and drive them away of themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:44279:54"/>
So that the Reformed Bishops, when they were set at the Heads of those Diocesses, call'd none away, nor made them break off, from any just and due spiritual dependance on their former Bishops, whose own He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Doctrines and Corrupt Ministrations, had made the People cease from depending any longer in Conscience upon them. They wanted only to be lawfully empowered, and regularly ordained themselves, by Episcopal Imposition of Hands; as all those reformed Bishops plainly were: and the People were free from any Obligations to the Old Ones, because of their Errors, and corrupt and dangerous Ministrations; &amp; both lawfully might unite themselves to them, and were in duty bound so to do. And thus, coming to Head a People, whose dependance was broke off from others, by their spiritual corruptions and depravations of Religion; they were no spiritual Intruders. And coming into Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Temporalities, made vacant by the deprivation of a Lawful State; they were guilty of no civil Usurpation and Injustice. And this is enough, to justifie the Advancement of those first Reformers: Tho', where Bishops are Orthodox, and deprived for their adherence to Truth and Righteousness, both in their private Practice, and publick Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the People are still left spiritually to depend on them, and are not to be taken off by any deprivation, though of the most rightful state, as in the above-mentioned Cases.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, as to the <hi>Popish Bishops</hi> themselves, they thought otherwise of their own Worship and Doctrines, and took them for Christian and Gospel-ways and Truths, not for Anti-christian Corruptions. And had they really been, what they thought, as they were not but quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it had been their duty to go on in their Pastoral Cures and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, with Persecutions, for all their deprivations. And so we our selves should have thought, at least we all seem as if we should, if, by Gods Providence, the civil State had gone on to deprive our reformed Bishops, for sticking to the worship and doctrines of the Reformation, and had set up Popish Bishops in their Places. Notwithstanding which, I suppose both our faithful Prelates and People, instead of silently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescing, would have gone on ministring and communicating, in the reformed worship and doctrine of this Church.</p>
               <p>But whatever they thought of these things, or how consonant or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing soever their Actings were to their own Apprehensions in this case; it suffices for justification of our Reformed Bishops advancement to their Sees, without their being deprived by competent and lawful Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, which is objected as a thing most exceptionable therein, and as seeming most to deviate from Ecclesiastical Rule, that in reality <hi>they were not Orthodox.</hi> And that, for this want of Orthodoxy, without any need of recourse to the Authority of mere State Deprivations, to take off people from a spiritual Adherence and Communion with their Bishops,


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44279:54"/>
the People, before they could have a Synodical Deprivation, were loose from them, and at liberty to unite themselves to the Orthodox Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in their Room.</p>

            <div n="4" type="chapter">

               </head>
               <p>ANd thus, I think it may sufficiently appear, how the manifold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, which are shewn above to lye on Faithful Bishops and Ministers, not to suppress, but to exercise their spiritual ministrations in the foresaid Cases, are not set aside, or barr'd, by any inhibition or deprivation, though of the most Lawful Civil State. They will do it with more ease and worldly encouragement, when the State tolerates, and much more when it fortifies and furthers them therein. But they are not at liberty to give it off, but must go on exercising the same, when it is more troublesome, and when the State gain-says, and puts them under persecution for so doing.</p>
               <p>And thus it is, where the State will Act apart, and proceed <hi>without a Synod</hi> in depriving Bishops, and in discharging the Ecclesiastical Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and dependance of the people, Spiritually related, and united to them.</p>
               <p>But Deprivation of Bishops, who are Spiritual Powers; is more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily by a <hi>Synod of Bishops,</hi> who are a Spiritual Judicature. Great Reason there is, for the Deprivation of Bishops, to proceed in this course. The Civil-State, indeed, comes in, by Reason of Civil Accessions and Endowments, which strengthen and encourage the spiritual ministrations. But these Civil Accessions, are but Accessaries and Appendages; and their spiritual powers, are the Principal in their Ministrations, and in Church Communion and dependance on them. And therefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of their ministrations, and of the Communion and dependance of the Church thereupon, is never so fitly, and fully attempted, as by spiritual judicatures, who, being spiritual persons, have more directly to do with Church Communion, and spiritual powers. And accordingly, this has still been the course of the most Pious Princes, who have reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the deliberations about Religion and Church matters, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of Bishops, (which so closely affects Church Communion,) to <hi>Convocations</hi> and <hi>Synods of Bishops and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lergy.</hi> And when these proceed to sentence, it more directly affects the concerned parties: Church Communion, and Church Governors, being more directly under the Church-mens Cognizance; and not only indirectly and by the by, as it may ingage the deprived persons, when not bound to it otherwise, to yield and acquiesce in voluntary complyance for civil interests.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:44279:55"/>
But suppose a Concurrence of both these powers, and that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of the Rightful State is confirmed by Synodical Concurrence: Yet I observe in the <hi>last</hi> place, that <hi>this Deprivation by Synods, is not sufficient to bar or discharge Bishops or Ministers, from the foresaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their Spiritual Ministrations, in the above mention'd Cases.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Metropolitanes,</hi> are not more subject and dependant on <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods;</hi> than <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>people</hi> are on their <hi>Bishops:</hi> Our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his Holy Apostles, having appointed Bishops in his Church, and call'd for our subjection and obedience to them. But this submission of Priests and people to their Bishops, is with a Salvo to their Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and its Articles and Interests. And if any Bishops go against the Truths, or Laws of Christ, or against the interests of Souls, and of True Religion, we are not to follow them, or to depend on them therein. To stick to any necessary Christian Doctrines, Worship, or Practices, Christs Faithful people and Ministers must break even with their own Bishops; holding even them <hi>Anathema,</hi> as St. <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> directs, when they would lead them contrary <hi>to the Doctrine of the Apostles,</hi> as I noted before, and shall shew more fully <note n="*" place="margin">Part 3. c. 3. &amp; 4.</note> afterwards. And so must they with any other Bishops, or Number and Synods of Bishops, in like Case.</p>
               <p>All Exercise and Administration, of Church Authority and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, is tyed to Rules. Not only to Rules, of the Churches own making, or <hi>Ecclesiastical Canons;</hi> but above all, and in the first place, to the Rules laid down by <hi>Christ</hi> himself. And all the validity of Church Acts in way of external judicature, in Synods, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; is so far, as they go by them, or do nothing against them.</p>
               <p>Thus it is, in <hi>Decreeing Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or <hi>Determining Controversies of Faith;</hi> wherein, though the <hi>Church has Authority,</hi> yet is it thus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, and has no Authority, <hi>as our Church</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And thus it is also in <hi>Matter of Censures,</hi> or Ecclesiastical Sentences judicially past therein upon persons, whether Laicks, or Ecclesiasticks. We, in the <note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> Exercise of our Apostolical Power, <hi>can do nothing against the Truth,</hi> or in punishing and Censuring any for Faithful observance thereof; <hi>but</hi> all our Power is <hi>for the Truth,</hi> and to be exercised in its behalf, by punishing and <hi>not sparing,</hi> not those who stand to, but those who defect from it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8.

Great is your Reward in Heaven; for in the like manner did their Fathers unto the Prophets.</hi> Luk. 6. 22, 23. And thus, the Holy Apostles, and Faithful Adherers to Gods Truth, and Worship, and good Christian Practices, did in all times, when, for such Adherence, they fell under the <hi>Anathema's</hi> of <hi>Synods,</hi> or the <hi>Excommunication of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> during the Papal, or any other former, or later Persecutions. They joyfully received such sentences, and always owned one another, and held Communion in Adherence to Gods word and ways, among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; when they were cast out of the communion, of such corrupt and Apostatizing Synods, or Churches.</p>
               <p>And 'tis the same, when it shall <hi>deprive</hi> or <hi>discharge any Faithful Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> from supporting such necessary Doctrines, worship, and practices, <hi>by their Ministrations,</hi> as Christ requires. For then, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding such deprivations and discharge, by Churches and Synods, CHRIST'S Faithful Ministers must hold on Ministring, and his faithful People must hold on Communicating, and Adhereing to them therein. Thus, as our LORD <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 6. 22, 23.</note> Notes, <hi>their Fathers had Separated and cast out the Old Prophets,</hi> from Prophesying <hi>in their Company,</hi> or Assemblies: Who still went on Preaching and Ministring the Word, which they were sent out to publish. And thus the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> that great Synod of the Jewish Church, discharged the <hi>Apostles</hi> from Ministring Christianity, or <hi>Preaching any more in Christs Name;</hi> who told them, they could by no means desist thereupon, but must hold on their Ministration, being <hi>to Ovey God rather than men.</hi> Act. 4. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Thus also several Synods Deprived <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and the other <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Bishops,</hi> who were the stout Asserters and Maintainers of the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our Lord,</hi> against the <hi>Arians.</hi> Such was the <hi>Synod of Tyre.</hi> And such also was the <hi>Synod of Antioch,</hi> whose <hi>Deprivations of Athanasius</hi> and the other <hi>Orthodox Bishops,</hi> were a Blow made at the <hi>Nicene Faith:</hi> though their <hi>Canons,</hi> being good, and according to Primitive Usage, were by Orthodox Councils afterwards taken into the <hi>Book of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Canons,</hi> out of which, <note n="*" place="margin">As Can.

               <p>And when it was once clear, to any Persons, or Churches, that they were deprived for the cause of the Faith: they were not hindred by any Authority of external Judicature, in the Synods their deposers; but readily received, and communicated with them, as Christs true Bishops still in those places. For, notwithstanding these Synodical Deprivations, <hi>Athanasius</hi> was all the while own'd and adher'd to by the <hi>Faithful Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians;</hi> as <hi>Paulus</hi> also was by the <hi>Faithful Constantinopolitanes.</hi> And when they came to <hi>Rome,</hi> on their giving full satisfaction in this Point, <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>received them to Communion.

               </p>
               <p>This Reception of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and others, who stood deprived by the <hi>Synods of Tyre</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> &amp;c. to his Communion, was before the <hi>Synod of Rome,</hi> wherein the <hi>Orientals</hi> should have justified their Proceedings, had acquitted and received them.

                  <hi>complain of his having Communicated with</hi> Athanasius, <hi>and his Adherents, which</hi> they said <hi>was a Reproach cast on their Synods, and an Abrogation of their sentence.</hi> So that his disregard of the <hi>Synodical Deprivations</hi> of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and the other <hi>Orthodox Bishops,</hi> Deposed in the Synods of <hi>Tyre</hi> or <hi>Antioch,</hi> was not on account, of their having been regularly reversed, by any Superior External Judicature. But it was, as having been of no force and effect in themselves, because passing on Christs Faithful Pastors, for their Fidelity and Firmness to the True Christian Faith.</p>
               <p>Besides, when the <hi>Synod at Rome</hi> sate in the cause of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and the other Orthodox Bishops, and Synodically admitted them to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: I do not see, how, in the Regular way of External Judicature, this could take off the Deprivations by the foremention'd Synods.

                  <note n="*" place="margin">L. 3. c. 5. p. 501.</note> reports. And moreover, the <hi>Synod of Rome,</hi> consisted of Bishops, who lived more remote and further off, and were Subjects of another Prince, <hi>viz.

all the time of <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s forced absence from them; and are applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Pope Julius</hi> for the same. For, <hi>in his</hi>

               <p>And like to this, has been the Practice, I think, of all times. For still, as Errors and Corruptions, in Doctrine, Worship, and Practice, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed and became general in any places; on any considerable oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made to them by Christs faithful Ministers, to silence Gain-sayers, they have had the establishment of Synods. And these Synods, have anathematized the Truth, condemned and deposed the Preachers, and excommunicated and cast out the Adherents and Practicers thereof. But yet the Preachers and Ministers of God's Worship and Truth, have still held on their Ministrations, and God's faithful People have stuck to them therein: And under all the depositions and excommunications, of Councils or Churches, they have kept Communion with one another, in these necessary Truths and Ways of God, which Corrupt and Apostate Councils have anathematized. Or else, under that power of Error, which has so often tyrannized over the Truth, more especially in the <hi>Arian</hi> Persecutions, and in the several steps and advancements of the <hi>Papal</hi> Corruptions, the pure Worship and Doctrine of Christ, had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd, and all Face of a true and unadulterated Church had long since failed from off the Earth.</p>
               <p>This I say, in case of Depositions, or other Censures, <hi>for the Cause of the necessary Truths, or Worship of Jesus Christ.</hi> In deprivations for other things, or on pretence of mere personal Crimes, the Case, I grant, may be otherwise. For in them, though the Sentence be unjust, it is a personal Wrong, and affects the sufferers themselves. And in private suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, 'tis reasonable to bear much for Orders sake, and to be tyed up to ways of Order for Redress: So that such sufferers, shall be bound to rest under the judicial Injustice, till they can have it reversed in like sort as it was laid on, <hi>viz.</hi> in way of <hi>Judi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Though Synods therefore, are the most Venerable Ecclesiastical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature here on Earth; yet is all the Obligation and Authority, of their decisions or sentences, within this Compass. They have <hi>no Effect,</hi> or Force, <hi>against the Truth,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 8.</note> says, or against any for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to it. So that they are to affect none, who have Christ and his Truth plainly on their side.

I grant, there ought to be great deference to their determination; and all private Persons are to use great modesty, and care, in judging af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; and need to look, that the blow and destruction thereby made, to any necessary Truth or Practice of our holy Religion, be very plain, before they over-look and disregard what they order. But still, judge they must, because in all their belief and practice in these things, it is not any implicit dependance on men, or a blind obedience to any humane sentence or decision; but observance of the Truth it self, or of what Christ has appointed in his Word, that must justifie them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if on an humble and diligent examination, and by plain evidence, it appear, that in their definitions of Articles, or censure of Persons, they strike at the Truth, and seek the overthrow of any part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44279:58"/>
their Acts are to be esteemed as of no effect, and all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Parties, both Clergy and People, are to go on doing the same, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Ministration and Communion, as if there were no such thing.

               <p>BY what I have offer'd, about the Authority and effect of <hi>State-depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,</hi> yea, or even of the <hi>depositions of Synods</hi> too, I think it may appear, how <hi>the faithful Ministers of Christ are not disabled,</hi> or <hi>discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> by any such deprivations, <hi>from the exercise of their spiritual Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> whereto they stand bound, by so many Obligations, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Cases.</p>
               <p>But besides the <hi>deprivation of State,</hi> some think the <hi>maintenance of Unity in the Church,</hi> when that is like to be broken thereby, ought to stop them of that Exercise. And therefore, for a further clearing of their duty in those Cases, I shall procede,</p>

               </p>
               <p>Admit, say some, that it were their duty to go on in their Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the service of Religion and of Souls, in those cases where this can be done in maintenance of Unity, and whilst the Church continues one. Yet what will you say, if such Ministration must unavoidably make, or keep up a Schism? Do not we all own that, to be one of the greatest Banes to Religion, and a most sinful and mischievous thing? And if otherwise they ought to be held on, ought not such Ministrations to be let fall, rather than a Schism shall be made, or kept up in the Church thereby?</p>

That there will be a Schism in the Church, in such cases, is most apparent. And that Schism is most dreadful to the Church, full of Guilt, as it is both the Breach of Unity and the Bane of Charity, and an In-let of continual miseries, and disturbances, is no less appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. But in pressing the consideration thereof upon particular persons, or parties, for prevention, or redress, it is to be enquired, <hi>first, who makes it?</hi> That will shew who ought to mend it; but if they will not, it may be enquired <hi>next, who else can cure it?</hi> Or what the sufferers, in love of peace, and preferring the Publick before themselves, should give up for the Cure thereof, that they may duly prize external Unity, but not over-value it? Or if, through the Error or inflexibleness, (which God avert,) of those who are the Authors thereof, it be already made, and cannot be remedyed, all are to consider, <hi>lastly, how they are to carry themselves towards the Makers of it,</hi> and <hi>with whom they are to hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>

               <p>And this way of <hi>fraternal communion,</hi> as well as the other, of <hi>keeping under the same visible Governors by due dependance and subjection,</hi> is a way to Unite them, not only as a <hi>Sect,</hi> who all hold and profess the same Doctrines and Opinions; but also as a <hi>Society,</hi> or as <hi>one Body.</hi> For by this bond of <hi>fraternal communion,</hi> they stand obliged, not only to <hi>Unity of Doctrine,</hi> as men of the <hi>same sect;</hi> but to <hi>unity, as of internal,</hi> so of <hi>external society</hi> and <hi>incorporation,</hi> as <hi>fellow citizens.</hi> For such are the obligations, of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving mutually each others Member as their own free denizens;</hi> of <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their baptismal claims,</hi> and <hi>Church Priviledges;</hi> of <hi>Ratifying of their Church-Acts,</hi> and <hi>Censures;</hi> of <hi>Associating</hi> with their <hi>Church services,</hi> and <hi>Assemblies;</hi> and of <hi>standing together,</hi> as <hi>one body</hi> and <hi>brotherhood,</hi> for the same <hi>common Tenets</hi> and <hi>Religious interests,</hi> as if they were incorporated under the same <hi>External Heads,</hi> or were the members of the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church.

thing. Or, <hi>Tyrannical Usupation on their Brethrens Libertys,</hi> not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting other Churches to their Communion, unless they will give up their own rights and freedoms, and become their Subjects. When such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions lye against any Bishops, or against any Churches, they have lost their claims of union. But all <hi>Church-Members</hi> are bound, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, by all the numerous, and earnest commands, of <hi>keeping Unity,</hi> to continue subject to their Lawful Bishops; as all Churches are by the same, to keep up Communion with other Churches; if they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any such just obstacles in bar thereof.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Schism,</hi> is <hi>a sinful breach of this union of Church Society.</hi> Either, in <hi>the Members of any particular Church,</hi> when they unjustly <hi>break off their subjection and dependance upon their own Church.</hi> Or, in any <hi>Particular Churches,</hi> when they unduly <hi>break off Fraternal Communion with other Churches, denying to Assemble with them, or Communicating with such, as stand Excommunicated by, or have made a Schism from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>One</hi> Great way of <hi>Schism,</hi> is in respect of <hi>Particular Members,</hi> when, against the Gospel duty and Commands of Unity, they unduely <hi>throw off their subjection and dependance upon their own Bishops, and break off from the Unity of their own Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One</hi> way of Uniteing Societies, or Bodys of Men, is <hi>by uniteing them under the same Heads.</hi> They are all <hi>one Body,</hi> and Members one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as keeping under, and being United to the <hi>same Head and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</hi> Thus, of the Association of <hi>Man and Wife,</hi> which is the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Society, and makes a Family, which is the ground work of all other Societies, it is said, that <hi>they two are one,</hi> Eph. 5. 31. because <hi>the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is the Head of the Wife,</hi> v. 23.

               <p>Now, as the <hi>Union of any Churches,</hi> lyes mainly in <hi>keeping united to the Bishops:</hi> So <hi>Schism,</hi> which is a breach of Union in those Churches, will lye chiefly <hi>in breaking off unduly and dividing from them.</hi> Especially, in <hi>setting up of opposite Bishops,</hi> or in making a <hi>second Bishop</hi> in a Church, against a <hi>former Orthod x</hi> and <hi>Rightful Bishop yet living and cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ming,</hi> which makes a most plain, and consummate Schisin. For, in the same Church, two opposite Bishops, are two opposite Heads. And two Heads, will make two Bodies; those who set up the New One against the Old, as likewise all they who afterwards come over to him, making a New Body under him; which apparently destroys Union, and makes two out of one. And thus, we fee it doth in all Societies. If an Opposite Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is set up by a mutinous Party, it divides the Army; or if an opposite King is set up in a Realm, it makes a Sedition, and divides the Kingdom. Or, if the same is done in a College, a Family, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Societies, as well as in a Church, opposite Heads do unavoidably make opposite Bodies, and visibly destroy the Unity of any Society, by breaking into two Societies, or into as many, as there shall be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Heads thereof.</p>

               <p>Now from this Account of Church-Union in any particular Churches, and of Schism, which lyes in the unjust Breach thereof, I shall observe these three Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> That when a second, or opposite Bishop, is set up in any Church against a former Orthodox one, who is still Bishop thereof, <hi>the Anti-Bishop, and they who set him up and adhere to him, make the Schism.</hi> For the other, with his Adherents, as the same Head and Members abide still where they were, and are still the same Church. But the Anti-Bishop and his Followers, <hi>are gone out from them,</hi> which <note n="*" place="margin">Schisma apud Carthaginem a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris Principibus factum.—Non enim <hi>Caecilianus</hi> exivit a <hi>Majorino</hi> Avo tuo; sed <hi>Majorinus</hi> a <hi>Caeciliano,</hi> Optat.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Optatus</hi> gives as a plain Proof against the <hi>Donatist</hi> Bishops, that <hi>the Schism lay at their doors.</hi> They have broke themselves off, and by erecting themselves into an opposite Head and Body, make a new and opposite Church. <note n="†" place="margin">Alium Episcopum fieri consensisse, id est, quod nec sas est, nec licet fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, Ecclesiam aliam constitui, <hi>Cyp. Ep.</hi> 46. <hi>p.</hi> 89.</note> 
                  <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to set up another Bishop, they consented therein to set up another Church,</hi> as I observed before from St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> So that they rend that Body, which, by keeping wholly to one Bishop before, was but <hi>one,</hi> into several pieces, and break one Church into <hi>two</hi> Churches.</p>
               <p>This, I say, they do, if the former Bishop is <hi>Orthodox.</hi> For if he is Heretical, Heresie, as I shall shew, dissolves the Union, and cancels the Obligation of Adherence between such Head and Members. They are bound to own him as their Head, and to be one with him as his true and genuine Members, whilst he is at the Head of Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and necessary Truths; but not when he falls off from them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to damnable Heresies and Unchristian Errors.</p>
               <p>And if he is still the <hi>rightful Bishop of that Church.</hi> If he <hi>voluntarily quits his Right,</hi> and Relation to them, and gives it up by his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, they are no longer bound to adhere to him. For these U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Dependances, are contracted by the consent of Mens own Wills, and are kept up betwixt these Heads and Members, not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but voluntary Communications. So that, if a Bishop throws up his own Relation, and will no longer preside over them, as Head of a Church; they are no longer bound, to keep in Dependance and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, or to stick to him, as Members thereof. Or, if he loses it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Will, by a just sentence and deprivation, that also discharges the Members from their Union and Dependance, and sets them free to receive, and to unite themselves to another in his place. But if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Death</hi> has put an end to his Relation, nor <hi>he has thrown it</hi> up by his own Resignation, nor is <hi>deprived</hi> thereof by the <hi>finishing of a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Process</hi> and <hi>Synodical Sentence</hi> against him; he is still the Bishop

                  <hi>A Bishop can by no means be constituted in that Church, whose own Bishop is yet alive, and stands ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with his proper Honour, unless of his own accord he renounce his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick.</hi> And as to making a vacancy by deprivation, <hi>it behoves first, that the cause of him, who is to be cast out of his Bishoprick, be canonically examined, and the Process against him be fully brought to an end. And then, after he is canonically deposed, another may be promoted to his Bishoprick,</hi> say the <hi>Fathers</hi> in the <hi>Council of Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if even a Synod of Bishops shall deprive an Orthodox Bishop of any Church, for adhering to the Truths, or Commands of Christ; he is Christs true Bishop still in that Church, and his faithful Peoples spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Head, for all that unjust sentence. For Christ stands by him, who stands by his Doctrines and Precepts; and unjust Depositions on these Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, have no more validity in his sight, than unjust Excommunications for the same Accounts have, as has been already shew'd. But, if there is no Interposition of Synods, but a mere Deprivation of State, that will much less do it. For there is a spiritual Subjection and Dependance of People to their Bishops, especially to such as suffer for adhering to Christian Truths or Precepts, which the civil State cannot break or dissolve. Christ himself, by his Institution, has made a spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between them, and antecedently obliged his People to this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Adherence to them, as they are <hi>vice Christi,</hi> his <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Vice-gerents,</hi> as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ep. 59. p. 129. Ed. Ox.</note> says. Kings and Civil States, may come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and tye this spiritual Union and Adherence, faster on, by temporal Dependances and Enforcements. And what they lay on, they may take off again. But the spiritual Relation and Obligations, do not depend on them, but on Christ himself. Religion lays them on, and leaves it not in the Power of any Prince, to cancel or discharge them. They stood fixed, whilst the Church was separate from the State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any secular Powers came in to protect it; and will still continue, if they turn all their Power, to persecute and oppress it. Nor has our Lord left it to their courtesy, whether there shall be any spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation betwixt his People and their Pastors, whether they shall keep up their spiritual Relation and Dependance, and he shall have a Church on Earth, or no; as is before discoursed more at large.</p>

               <p>But for all this Deposition, both by the Imperial Edicts, and Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Sentences, since the true Cause thereof was his firmness and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Catholick Faith, <hi>Athanasius,</hi> as the foresaid Author owns, still kept on his spiritual Relation, and the People their spiritual and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Obligations to, and Dependance on him.

Their stedfastness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, must tye all faithful Members faster to them; but can never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as a conscionable discharge of their spiritual Obligations, and Dependance on them.</p>
               <p>If a Schism is made in a Church then, by a defection from the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Orthodox Bishop thereof, laid aside, either by a Civil State or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Synod, only for his faithful Adherence to the Doctrines, or Laws of <hi>Christ;</hi> or by turning over to an Anti-Bishop, set up against him: 'Tis plain, the Anti-Bishops, with their Makers and Adherents, make the Schism. They were all Members of the one Body, whilst they kept subject and united to the Rightful Bishop, who is the Head of it. But when they broke off from him, they divided themselves from the Body; and formed themselves under an opposite Head, into a new and opposite Body. But he, and his Adherents, still preserve the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the true Body. The breakers off, make the Division; but they, preserve their Union.

And they are no more charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the division for this, than the General and his faithful Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers would be in an Army, for not going over to the Mutineers; or than a King and his Loyal Subjects would be in a Kingdom, for not turning over and submitting to the Rebels. But as the Anti-Bishops and their Party make the Schism, by departing from the lawful Head and true Body, they must amend it by returning to it: And they stand answerable to God, so far as I see, for all the Guilt, and sad Consequences and Effects thereof, if they refuse so to do.</p>

               <p>And therefore the Scripture-Precepts, of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Brotherly Charity,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> must <hi>never be pleaded to draw men off from their own Orthodox Rightful Bishop, but to make them cleave fast to him.</hi> And to call men to unite with an Anti-Bishop, is not to call them to keep these Precepts, but to transgress them.

charg'd on any, for adhereing to their true Head, and Orthodox Rightful Bishop, but are justly chargeable on the other side.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first way of Schism</hi> therefore, <hi>viz. in particular Members breaking off unduely from the Unity of their own Church,</hi> and from their <hi>due Subjection and Dependance on their own Bishops,</hi> to omit other Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, 'tis plain a <hi>Schism</hi> is then made, <hi>when Bishop is set up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Bishop in the same Church.</hi> And the makers thereof, are the <hi>New</hi> or <hi>Anti-Bishop</hi> and <hi>his Adh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rents,</hi> if the former Bishop is <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and has not clogg'd his Communion with any <hi>unlawful Terms,</hi> or with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a <hi>throwing up of Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> and a <hi>Submission</hi> to <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous</hi> and <hi>Uncanonical Usurpations.</hi> Yea, though such former Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bishop, stand deprived by an Act of State, or even of a Synod; if what he is deprived for, be his firmness in sticking, either to the Doctrines, or to the Laws and Commands of Christ; and what the other is set up for, be his easiness in transgressing and forsaking them. So that in Religion they are Schismaticks, though the State espouse them, and set them up for the civilly establish'd and endowed Church. As the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> were in <hi>Israel,</hi> though the civil State formed that Schism; and the <hi>Arians,</hi> when they broke off from their Rightful Orthodox Bishops, albeit they had the Emperors to back them; and the <hi>English Schismaticks,</hi> when, in the days of <hi>the Great Rebellion,</hi> they fell off, not only from their Bishops, but from Episcopacy it self, and were settled and upheld therein by the Usurpers of that Time; and as the <hi>Anti-Episcopal Church of Scotland</hi> at this Day are, notwithstanding all that Establishment the secular Arm has given them. Yea, and nevertheless Schismaticks, though they can glory over the other, in having by far the greater Numbers; and in having sole Possession of the Publick Churches, and Places of Assemblies. And as the Anti-Bishop and his Party, in such Cases make the Schism; it lyes on them, and they must be applyed to, to mend it. And the Gospel-Precepts, of <hi>Charity, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> if they are truly press'd, must be urg'd to make his own Adherents stick to the Rightful Bishop, and to bring those Members, who are broken off, to return to him: but are not truly enforced, but corruptly misapplyed and perverted, even to call for what they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly forbid, if they are urged for uniting with the other side.</p>
               <p>But whoever are guilty of making a Schism, it would be a most pious and praise-worthy part in any that shall cure it. And in the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering side most of all, if, by over-looking their own personal and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Claims, and mastering all private resentments, as mortifyed and most publick spirited Men, they can make an end thereof by letting fall their own pretensions. And why, will many good Minds, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Lovers of Peace say, should they not do this for the Love of Peace, and for Religions sake and the Churches? Their Adversaries, indeed,


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44279:68"/>
can not have the face to ask it. And others, who may move better therein, would be modest in pressing liberality on Losers, and not go too far in urging them, who have suffered so much already from the Invaders, as if they had not taken enough from them, to fall upon themselves and throw them what remains. Yet they think it would be a noble Pitch in Vertue, full of Glory and Goodness, if of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they would prefer Publick-Weal before private Passions and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and be full of Care for others, when that needs to be shewn in caring least for themselves. Which Heavenly-mindedness and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-spiritedness, and Mortification to private Interests, God and the Church, they conceive, must needs take most kindly at their hands.</p>
               <p>But as to this, the suffering Bishops can not take this way of Cure, <hi>by giving up their Claims,</hi> where they are bound in duty to insist on them. And that they are bound to do, as I have already shewn at large, in the forementioned Cases. By their quitting there, they would surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Souls of their Charge, to become a Prey to Wolves and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, and to be trained up in wicked and corrupt Doctrines, Prayers, and Practices. And this, is not to be true to their Pastoral Trusts. 'Tis not faithfully to discharge their Cure of Souls, but perfidiously to throw it off. So that be they never so mortified, and negligent of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and zealously studious of Unity and the Churches Peace; yet in Fidelity to Christ, and to the People whom he has entrusted to their Charge, they must hold on their spiritual relation, I conceive, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently discharge it the best they can at such times; and not desert, but stick to the Church, over which the Holy Ghost hath made them <hi>Overseers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, the exercise of their spiritual Ministrations is loudly call'd for in such Cases, and bound on them and the suffering Clergy their Brethren, by all the Powers and Characters of the Ministerial Office; as I think may fully appear from what I have said on that point before. And not only the continuance of their former Relation, as the true Bishops still of those places; but this very exercise, must in consequence keep up a schism in the Church, at such times. For this exercise of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, must be <hi>in separate Bodyes.</hi> The state, incorporateing and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pousing the Anti-Bishops and their Adherents, will give them the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Churches: And Depriving and Persecuting the other and their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, will also be sure to keep them out thereof. So, their Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if they go on Ministring at all, as 'tis plain they ought, must be in separate places and Assemblies. Yea, and by different ways of exercise: the spiritual administrations of one, being purely spiritual, in the way of a destitute and persecuted; but those of the other, being mixt, in the way of an incorporate and endowed Church.</p>
               <p>And therefore in all the foremention'd cases, where the suffering Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44279:69"/>
are still bound, for the interest of Religion and of Souls, to insist upon their Episcopal Claims and their Relation to their Churches, and, with their brethren of the other Clergy, still to go on in a faithful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Ministrations; this way of Cure, can have no place. But as the Anti-Bishops, by breaking off from them, and from those Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Principles and Practices whereto they stand firm, have made the Schism; so they alone, by a Penitential return, are capable to mend it: It not admitting of Remedy in those Cases, and under such state of things, from any other hands.</p>
               <p>And this may be sufficient, as to the true and suffering Bishops, and shew how little the Arguments, from the desirableness and duty of Union, will affect them in those cases. When the Church is Rent by such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable schism, as the precedent discourse shews <hi>who make it;</hi> so this, I think, is enough to shew <hi>who can mend it,</hi> and to whom alone the lovers of peace and unity are to apply themselves for remedy at such times.</p>

And which is that <hi>one Holy Catholick Church,</hi> betwixt all the parts whereof the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> is to be maintained, as all Christians profess in the <hi>Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Union of all particular Churches <hi>as one Body</hi> under himself, our Lord has appointed to be kept up <hi>by all the Members thereof,</hi> as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is; but chiefly, by <hi>the Union and Accord of the Bishops and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi> who are the respective Heads of those particular Churches.</p>
               <p>This whole Church is made <hi>one Body,</hi> by <hi>one Spirit,</hi> Eph. 4. 4. so the Unity thereof, is call'd <hi>the Unity of the Spirit,</hi> v. 3. And one great

means of the Spirits keeping up this Unity, is by the Ministration of <hi>Pastors and Teachers, which he gave as Gifts,</hi> for <hi>the edifying,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacting and building up all Christians into <hi>this Body of Christ,</hi> v. 8. 11, 12.

But all those <hi>different Offices,</hi> are set for keeping all Christians <hi>in one Body,</hi> Rom. 12. 4. 5. and all the <hi>Diversity of Ministries,</hi> is to continue them <hi>the Body of Christ,</hi> and to cement <hi>the Members,</hi> who <hi>are many,</hi> into <hi>one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 27, 28. &amp; v. 12. 20. and all the <hi>variety of Gifts (i. e.</hi> of <hi>Offices,</hi> v. 11.) or distributions of higher or lower stations, are for <hi>edifying</hi> or laying together the Members into <hi>this Body,</hi> and for preserving the <hi>Unity</hi> thereof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 8, 12.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Head of this Body,</hi> is <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself. And from <hi>Christ the Head all the Body is knit together,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul; by those joynts and bands which minister neurishment, i. e.</hi> by the Pastors, who are set to feed it, Col. 2. 19. <hi>From Christ the Head,</hi> says he again, <hi>the whole Body is fitly joyn'd and compacted together, by those joynts which make supplies according to their measure,</hi> or according to their several stations in <hi>the work of the Ministry,</hi> Eph. 4. 15, 16. And on account of this use, of their uniting all Christians under Christ the Head into this one Body, or all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Societies of Christians into one Church; when this one Church is compared to a <hi>Natural Body,</hi> they are represented as the <hi>Joynts,</hi> and as the <hi>Bands</hi> or Ligaments, which unite and compact the Members, as they are by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in these places.</p>

To this it is requisite, that they <hi>profess the same true Faith and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Worship.</hi> This is the Foundation of all other Communion among them. The <hi>one Body,</hi> being made up of those, who hold to the <hi>one Faith,</hi> Eph. 4. 4. and the Communion in this Body, being required be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those, who communicate in this one Faith and Worship, as shall be shewn more fully <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 3, 4.</note> afterwards.</p>
               <p>And among all Orthodox Bishops and Churches, who profess the true Christian Faith and Worship, the Rules of Communion and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence, required by <hi>Christ</hi> for keeping up this Unity of his Body, are such as these:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That all Orthodox Bishops and Churches, receive each others Members, as if they were their own Members.</hi> All the Members of Christ's Church, are Fellow-Citizens, or enfranchised Denizens, wheresoever they come; and upon any new Change of Place or Christian Country, have no need of a new Naturalization. They ought to find a home in all Churches, and may claim their Baptismal Priviledges, or the benefits of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Coporation or Society, and can not justly be repulsed or denyed the same, as being free of the whole Body. For <hi>Baptism,</hi> which makes them Members, by the institution of Christ incorporates them all, not only into those several Churches or Congregations where they receive it, but into the whole Body or Fraternity. <hi>We are all baptized, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be Jews or Gentiles, into one Body,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. And accordingly no Church must exclude them, as <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 2. 19.</note>

For <hi>Ordination,</hi> as well as <hi>Baptism,</hi> is not only in respect to the Church of such a Place, but to Christ's Church at large. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations there are, as to the Exercise of these Powers, as may make for the preservation of Order and Union. And in care of Unity and Peace, Bishops and Priests of any Church must observe these, in acting Episcopally or Sacerdotally, whilst they converse in other Churches. But having any where received a Lawful and Canonical Ordination, they are to be owned as Ministers of Christ wheresoever they come, and need no more to be <hi>Ordained,</hi> than other Members need to be <hi>baep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised</hi> over again.</p>

So that they are Schismaticks, and break this <hi>Unity of the Body,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be kept up between all particular Churches and their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who reject the Members, or Canonical Ministers, of any other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Churches.

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of just Grounds to break off Communion, particularly of making impious and unlawful things, or unrighteous Usurpations and Incroachments, the Terms of their Communion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FRom what I have said in the <hi>Two</hi> preceding Chapters, without inquiring further into any lower degrees and instances thereof, I think it may competently appear, <hi>what Schism is,</hi> and <hi>who the Persons are that may justly be charged therewith:</hi> either as <hi>breaking off from their own Church,</hi> by unjustly throwing off, and dividing from their own Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and Lawful Bishops; or, as <hi>breaking off from other Churches,</hi> by unjustly refusing Communion to their Members, or by unjustly granting it to their Schismaticks, or Excommunicates. And more particularly, that they are guilty of this great and dangerous Sin of Schism, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly turn Subjects, or side with Anti-Bishops set up over them, against their own Orthodox and Lawful Bishops. Yea, though such Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors to the Anti-Bishops, make the greatest Numbers; or are set up by the civil State, as the civilly establish'd or endowed Church. And that all other Churches, and their Members, are guilty of the same, who shall own and come in to them, and admit them into their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and keep on Communion with them.</p>
               <p>I say they are Schismaticks, who by any of these ways shall break off from others unduly, and without just Cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:44279:75"/>
But some things, are a <hi>just Ground to breako ff,</hi> either Dependance and Subjection to our own Bishops, or Communion with other Churches: <hi>Some things,</hi> as I come next to shew, <hi>not being to be born, nor otqers to be parted with, for the Love of external Peace and Union.</hi> And when these can be justly and duly alledged for standing off, 'tis always justifiable, and commonly necessary, to break Communions. However, to break off Resorting to their Assemblies; though at the same, we should still al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Members to resort to ours. For this later, many times may be allowed longer, where it can be done without scandal; especially, before the Church has proceeded judicially to censure and excommunicate the offending Parties: as it was allow'd to the <hi>Romanists,</hi> and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, for several years in the beginning of Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign; and also to the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> in later days. And if there are such Pleas for breaking off, either from any Persons, or Churches, there is no Breach of Gospel-Union, nor Blame of Schism, in such Cases. And of these, I shall now,</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Second</hi> Place give some Account, That when we see any Persons or People, breaking off, either Subjection to their former Bishops, or Ecclesiastical Concord and Fraternal Communion with other Churches, we may understand where Schism is, and where it is not to be charged; and be more clear in several Matters of Importance in this Argument.</p>
               <p>Now such just Ground there is for the Members of any Church to break off Communion, either with their own Bishops, or with other Churches, when they can alledge either some things <hi>against the Terms of their Communion,</hi> or others <hi>against their Persons and Doctrines.</hi> 'Tis a just Ground to break off from them, if <hi>they make impious and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things,</hi> or <hi>unrighteous Usurpations and Incroachments, the Terms of their Communion.</hi> Or, though nothing of this can be alledged against the Terms, <hi>if Heresie can be justly objected to their Persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These, I say, are <hi>just Grounds,</hi> and <hi>give a Liberty to break off from the Communion of any Persons or Churches.</hi> And I chuse rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it, by this <hi>giving them a Liberty;</hi> than by <hi>imposing on them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable Necessity,</hi> to do so. For some Grounds, give a Liberty to break Communion, either with their own Bishops, or with other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which do not in conscience necessitate Men; as <hi>Unrighteous Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Incroachments,</hi> when they are made the condition thereof. For though Men need not submit to them; yet, if they are pleased to do it, they ordinarily may do so without Sin, and suffer such Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in then own Wrong.</p>
               <p>Besides, the Duty of uniting with any particular Persons, or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, is bound upon us by certain Things, or Qualifications, in those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or Churches, which oblige us to their Communion and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. And, as the Being and Presence of those Things and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44279:75"/>
binds it on; so doth the Failure thereof, unbind the same, and set Men at Liberty to go off from them.</p>
               <p>I say to go off from them, not to go off from all, and hold on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with none. For when they are no longer bound to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, with such particular Bishops, or Churches: yet are they still bound thereto with others, or under a general obligation to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. I mean, when they have opportunity for the same, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed to all obligation of actual Exercise and Discharge thereof, by this, like as it is by all other <hi>Affirmative</hi> Duties. The <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> professed in the <hi>Creed,</hi> obliges us to communicate as we have opportunity, in all Christian Offices, with all true Christians, who still retain those Qualifications I spoke of. Though it leaves us free to stand off from any others, who have faln from them; and tyes us up no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to communicate with them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> 'Tis always a just Ground to break off from them, if <hi>they make impious or unlawful things, the Terms or Conditions, of their own Members, or of others, keeping on communion with them.</hi> I do not say it is the only Ground, having mentioned others, but it is always a just Ground thereof: And thus it is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When they <hi>put impi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us, or unlawful things, into their saecred Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and mix sinful Matters in that Body of Prayers, or Administration of Sacraments, which they call others to communicate with.</hi> What Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances may be made herein, for a generally corrupt state of the Church; and how far, in necessity and want of others, good People may be at liberty still to resort to such, I shall consider afterwards. But such mixture of Sin and Prophanation, in what they are called to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in, I think sets People loose, and leaves them no longer bound to them.</p>
               <p>For the Communion, which all Christians are obliged to seek in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> is the <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi> This <hi>Saintship,</hi> though it be not always in <hi>Reality,</hi> must at least be always in <hi>Profession.</hi> The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> must all be <hi>profest Saints,</hi> whom we communicate with. And the <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> must all be of <hi>profess'd Saintship,</hi> which we are call'd to communicate in. And such, those publick Offices are not, that have any gross Sins or Wickednesses, which are all so many Prophanations, for the matter of them.</p>
               <p>This Saintship, wherein this Communion is to be held, lyes more especially in <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Worship.</hi> And where they fail in either of these, we are not bound to communion with any Assemblies. It is so plainly, where they fail in point of <hi>Faith.</hi> For <hi>Heresie,</hi> which is a corruption of Faith, will set us loose, as I shall shew <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> hereafter, from the communion of any Persons, or Churches. And <hi>Corruptions of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> are to the full, not only as offensive, but as openly dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44279:76"/>
to God, who is not more aspersed or provoked by a false belief and confession, than by a corrupt and wicked worship: So that among those, whose business in Religious Assemblies, is to see God honour'd, and to seek that he may be appeas'd, any gross Sins made the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Worship, which are a corruption of Worship, will do the same. They not only set God's faithful People free, to stand off from such corrupt Offices; but oblige his faithful Pastors, to stand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>up for him, and to minister or afford better, out of a just sense of the Peoples needs, and jealousie for God's Honour, as I <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 4. Par. 1.</note> shew'd before.</p>
               <p>Besides, our chief Obligations to unite our selves to any Religious Assemblies, is, as they are <hi>Assemblies for Worship. We,</hi> as so many <hi>live Stones,</hi> are joyn'd together and <hi>built into a Spiritual House, to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> says, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. Yea, and as they are <hi>purely for Worship;</hi> not partly for worshipping, and partly for prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God: there being Obligation enough on the Servants of God, to meet together to see him publickly honoured, but none to see him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly profaned. And therefore we are not obliged to make part of such Assemblies, as put up sinful Matters, and gross Wickedness, in their publick Offices. For Worship is a Profession of Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. But Sin and Wickedness, are Professions of Irreverence and Reproach; and so are not Worship, but Profanations. So that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations incumbent on God's Servants, to meet there, where Offerings are to be made that are for his Honour, yea, only such as are for his Honour; will not bind them, but, if they can serve him any where else, rather forbid them to meet there, where these Prophanations are.</p>
               <p>Thus is the Matter of Religious Meetings, or the <hi>Worship and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice there performed,</hi> the chief thing that carryes the Obligation to them. I say the <hi>chief,</hi> but not the <hi>only</hi> thing. For we are Members of a Church, as well as Professors of a Religion; and as Christians, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into a Society, as well as instructed in a Doctrine. And both these bind us to Religious Assemblies. For, as good Christians, we ought to meet there, to shew our Adherence to the Church as a Society, or our Union to it as Members; as well as to put up Prayers to God by <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> or to pay our Religious Worship and Service. That is, our Christianity obliges us to meet together, both to present our Religious Oblations and Acknowledgments to Almighty God, and to do it in dependance on our Lawful Pastors, or in the Unity of the Church.</p>
               <p>But this Obligation to these Meetings, as thereby keeping Union with the Church as a Society, is but a <hi>Secondary</hi> Obligation: and that of paying truly Christian and acceptable Worship, is the first and chief therein. For the end, why Christians were formed into a Society; was to keep up the Profession and Payment of that Holy Doctrine and


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44279:76"/>
Worship, which are necessary or peculiar to them, as they are a Sect or Religion. And the Members are bound to stick to it, whilst it stands upon this Doctrine and Worship, not when it starts off from it. It is the Religion, which recommends the Church. And we are to chuse our Church or Assemblies, for the Religions; not our Religion, for the Churches sake. So that their falling off from pure Christian Worship and Doctrine, which are necessary to the Religion, to its honouring God, or our acceptance by it; loosens the bond of Union to any Assemblies, and sets Men free to joyn with any others regularly empowered, who stick faster to them.</p>
               <p>Agreeably to all this, we find <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> spoke of, as the <hi>Great Ligaments,</hi> that are to bind and unite us to any Church. Of the Ligament of <hi>Faith,</hi> I shall treat in its proper place. And as for <hi>Worship,</hi> which lyes partly in <hi>confessions of Faith,</hi> but more especially in <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> it is a Ligament too, and Prayers and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are set off, as compacting us into <hi>one Body,</hi> or cementing us into one <hi>spiritual House.</hi> Thus, of <hi>Prayers,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> says we are set to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as <hi>one spiritual House,</hi> to send up <hi>spiritual Sacrifices,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. And of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> it is declared, that <hi>we are all baptized into one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. and that <hi>we are one Body,</hi> by <hi>partaking all of one Bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 17. and by <hi>having been made all to drink into one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. therein referring to the one <hi>Loaf,</hi> whereof we all eat, and to the one <hi>Cup</hi> whereof we all drink, in the <hi>Holy Eucharist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as that <hi>Faith,</hi> which is to unite and bind us to any Churches or Assemblies, is not any <hi>Erroneous</hi> or <hi>Heretical</hi> Tenets, as I shall shew anon, but the <hi>Orthodo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>c</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> Faith: So is that <hi>Worship,</hi> which is to do the same, not any <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>prophane,</hi> but a <hi>truly Christian and Holy Worship;</hi> or such an Oblation of Prayers, and Administration of Sacraments, as Christ has instituted and appointed, and will not reject and punish, but accept of. It must be a <hi>Worship,</hi> not only <hi>in Spirit,</hi> opposite to the way of carnal Sacrifices, and the Numerousness of <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Ceremonies and external Rites: but also <hi>in Truth,</hi> opposite to all false, superstitious, or otherwise sinful ways, which really are not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship but Prophaneness. For in Christianity, <hi>the true Worshippers,</hi> as our Lord says, are they who <hi>worship God in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> Jo. 4. 23, 24. Yea, as he adds, <hi>the Father seeketh such to worship him,</hi> v. 23. And if he seeketh such Worshippers, his devoted Servants, who have no other aim, but to find him, and to be found by him, must seek out such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, where such Worship is paid to him. And thus also St. <hi>Peter</hi> says of those <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> the joynt-communion wherein is to bind us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into <hi>one spiritual House;</hi> that they must be such <hi>spiritual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> as are <hi>acceptable to God through Jesus Christ our Lord,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>So that the <hi>Unity in Worship and Prayers,</hi> which we are bound to keep


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44279:77"/>
with other <hi>Christians,</hi> or <hi>Assemblies;</hi> is only whilst they meet to put up <hi>Holy Prayers:</hi> coming in among them as <hi>live stories,</hi> to make part of their <hi>spiritual House,</hi> whilst they <hi>offer up such Sacrifices,</hi> as may be <hi>fit to find acceptance,</hi> as we heard from St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And thus the <hi>Peace,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> orders us to <hi>pursue,</hi> is <hi>with those, who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart;</hi> not with those, who, as the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> were like enough to do, prophaned him by a sinful Worship, or impure Petitions, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 22. And <hi>the bond of</hi> external <hi>Peace,</hi> is where we may lawfully <hi>keep the unity of the spirit;</hi> which is not to be kept in sinful Offices, but only in pure ones, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3. or where, in <hi>following after the things which make for Peace,</hi> we may withal follow such things, <hi>wherewith we may edifie,</hi> not corrupt and ensnare one another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 19.</p>
               <p>Particularly, as to the <hi>Pactors,</hi> who are the Heads of those Assemblies, one chief Character of theirs as they are set over us, and chief ground of our Dependance and Obligations to keep under them, is as they are <hi>Ministers of Prayers.</hi> And that, as they minister such Prayers, as are fit to serve the necessary ends and purposes of all Prayer; that is, to worship and honour God, and to benefit us, or to bring down Blessings from him. And if we, who must seek out for Prayers, are tyed to them as Ministers of holy and acceptable Prayers: that Obligation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them ceases, when, instead of administring such, they fall to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister profane ones.</p>
               <p>And thus there is a just Ground to break off, or a Liberty of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating from Assemblies even of Rightful Pastors, for <hi>pure Christian Administrations.</hi> Not for Purity from <hi>mere Defects,</hi> or for Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations <hi>more edifying;</hi> which is the <hi>Pretence of</hi> our <hi>Anti-Episcopal Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters:</hi> but for Purity from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>wicked Mixtures.</hi> That is, that they may have a Worship and Religious Service, without mixture, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or of <hi>Immorality.</hi> That they may meet with nothing to reproach, or dishonour God therein; or to disturb, and wound a pious Affection, when they should be most helped and encouraged in exercise thereof, being come to serve and worship him. When they are thus barr'd out, by any wicked mixtures; unless necessity, and want of better drive them to make shift therewith, they are no longer tyed to resort to such Offices, but are free to seek out for better at the hands of any other Regular and Authorised Pastors, and ought to communicate in them if they can have them. For <hi>sinful Prayers,</hi> are a <hi>sinful Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi> as the <hi>Oblations of blemished, of blind, and lame, and sick for Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> were among the <hi>Jews, Mal.</hi> 1. 8. &amp; <hi>Levit.</hi> 22. 19, 20, 22. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 21. And whatever Toleration it might meet with, in want of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet, <hi>if any man hath in his Flock a Male,</hi> or one fit to make a legal and perfect Offering, <hi>cursed be he,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>that voweth, and sacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing,</hi> Mal. 1. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:44279:77"/>
But the Ground of this breaking off, is higher still, if,</p>
               <p n="2">2. They do not only put <hi>impious, and unlawful things, into their sacred Offices or Confessions; but admit none to communion, in any of the good parts, unless they particularly concur in these corrupt ones too.</hi> The former, sets men loose, that they lawfully may, and, where they have opportunities of better, ought to break off from them: But this, drives and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitates them, that they must do so, and can not, for the supply of any Necessities, stay to associate and assemble with them. And thus it is, when any Bishops will admit no Members, or when any Churches will admit no other Churches to communicate with them, unless they will agree, to believe, or profess some false Doctrine; or partake and go along with them, in those particular and unlawful Matters or evil Worship, wherewithal they have clogged and corrupted their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>Now when this is the Case, nothing can legitimate Communion with such Bishops or Churches. For though it is the duty, and ought to be the desire and care of all good Christians, to keep up the external Unity of the Church, both under their own Bishops, and with other Churches: Yet <hi>must not this ever carry them, to unite, or to go along with them, in ill things?</hi> To be one with them in these Matters, is to partake with them in their Sins; which is not the Unity and <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> or <hi>Christians,</hi> but of the <hi>ungodly,</hi> or of <hi>evil-doers.</hi> In such Points, the more united any Society is, the worse it is. Such is the Union of all <hi>Infidel Churches,</hi> who unite in utterly denying, and opposing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith. And of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who incorporate under their seducing Heads, to undermine or pervert it. Yea, even the <hi>infernal Spirits,</hi> are <hi>united Polities,</hi> without which <hi>Satans Kingdom could not stand,</hi> as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But all this Union or Agreement of Men, in damnable Errors or Wickedness, is only combining against God and their own Souls. And our Blessed Lord came not to bind up, but to break such Combinations, which the World then was full of. <hi>I came not to send Peace, but rather Divisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that the lamentableness of Mens not going all one way, is true here, where the Generality go the right way. But when they are going wrong, in ways of Guilt and Destruction, to unite in Sin and Misery is a deplorable thing, and there 'tis best, when the most divide and stand off from them.</p>
               <p>Nor may they be wanting to their duty in some Points, to keep on united to them in others. They must not purchase Unity, by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Omissions; or buy peace, with the loss of innocence. And therefore, as I observed, the watchmen must not be wanting in giving necessary warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor Faithful Ministers let fall their Ministrations, in the foresaid Cases, on pretence of preserving unity, or preventing Schism in the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is another just ground to break off from them, if <hi>they make unrighteous usurpations and incroachments, the Terms and condition of their Communion.</hi> Both Bishops, and Churches, may turn Tyrannical and Arrogant Usurpers upon their Brethrens Liberties, not admitting their own Members to their Communion, without acknowledging and submitting to their unjustly and illegally assumed powers, nor other Churches, unless they will give up their own rights and freedoms, and become their Subjects. And when they will allow Communion to none, unless they are content to purchase it at such rates; good Christians may pass them by, and unite themselves to other Churches, where they will be more justly and fairly dealt with. The Communion of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is a <hi>Commuuion of Brethren,</hi> upon <hi>Brotherly terms;</hi> not of <hi>Captives,</hi> who must submit to <hi>any terms,</hi> or bear what hardships and incroachments are put upon them by their Conquerors. They are not bound to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase unity, by enslaving of themselves; or any brethrens communion, by receiving their yoke, and giving up their own rights and liberties, as the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> demands all other Churches, both of the East and West, should do to purchase hers. And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares he would not give up their liberties, when <hi>false brethren</hi> turn'd invaders thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Judaizers</hi> in their pressing the <hi>Circumcision of Titus, to whom he gave place by subjection, no not for an hour,</hi> when they sought <hi>to bring them into bondage.</hi> Gal. 2. 4, 5.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Heresy a just Ground to break off Communion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe last ground which I shall mention, of breaking off, or of being set loose from the Communion, either of Bishops, or Churches, is, though none of the foresaid obstacles can be pleaded against the <hi>Terms of their Communion,</hi> if yet,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly, Heresy can be justly objected to their persons, and Doctrines.</hi> Church Members, are not bound to keep dependant on the persons of their Bishops; nor one Church, to keep Communion with other Churches, if once they defect from the true worship and Doctrine of Christ. This <hi>worship</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> are the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Foundation,</hi> of <hi>Christian Society</hi> and <hi>unity.</hi> The Church, is a <hi>Body of Men,</hi> Associated for them. And must be <hi>one Society,</hi> by keeping united under their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or Associated with other Churches in them. They must keep one, in standing together upon this bottom, not in going off, or departing from it.</p>
               <p>For clearing these matters, it is to be observed, that our Saviours <hi>first</hi> end in coming into the world, was <hi>to publish a Religion. I am come a light into the world,</hi> saith he of himself, <hi>Jo.</hi> 12. 46. <hi>I must</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 9. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Preach the Gospel, for therefore am I sent.</hi> Luk. 4. 43. On this account, he calls himself <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</hi> Joh. 14. 6. And tells <hi>Pilate,</hi> that <hi>for this end was he born, and for this cause came he into the world, that he should bear witness unto the Truth.</hi> Joh. 18. 37. And this Truth or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, lyes in his Doctrine of worship, faith, and Practice: Or, in his Teaching all his Disciples, what way they are to worship God; what they are to believe concerning him, or other things which concern their Eternal Salvation; and what they are to do for him.</p>
               <p>Now this Doctrine, was like to be most advantageously profess'd, and this Worship to be best paid, if it were not left to single persons, or to scatter'd Families, to do it separately by themselves: But had its several professors incorporated, into one Regular society and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted body, for the joynt profession and performance thereof. Such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular society, would hold it out, by more orderly and effectual Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration; and keep men to it, by the Authority of Discipline; and be a common help and spur, to excite and aid each other mutually, and carry them on; and a cover and shelter, to back &amp; embolden them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.

it. Accordingly, when Religion was left to be born out by smaller so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and sometime even by single families, as in the <hi>Patriarchical Age;</hi> we see it was sometimes almost lost, and always made a very small progress. But when a whole Nation was incorporated into one Church, for the profession and payment of it, as it was among the <hi>Jews;</hi> it spread further in power and influence, and gain'd more proselytes. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when all Nations, as fast as they turn'd Christians, were embodyed in one society for the same intent, <hi>as</hi>

               <p>And therefore our Lord intended and ordered in the <hi>next</hi> place, that all, who embraced this Religion, should incorporate or unite together in one Church or Society, for the Profession of it. Accordingly, he has made <hi>baptism,</hi> wherein every professor takes upon him this Religion, to incorporate him, or enter him a member of this Church: <hi>Baptism,</hi> as St. <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> notes, uniteing us all <hi>in one body;</hi> and <note n="‖" place="margin">Gal. 3. 27, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>as many, as are baptized into Christ, are all one in Christ Jesus.</hi> And requires of every professor of this Religion, that he Keep on professing it in the unity of this Church. And that all of his Religion, pay this worship, and profess this Doctrine, not separately by themselves; but socially, in joynt Communion with others. So that all, who come to embrace the Christian Religion, must perform the worship and profession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in Christian Society, or in the Unity and Communion of Christs <hi>Holy Catholick Church.</hi>

               <p>But we are <hi>first</hi> to be <hi>all of this Religion,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> to <hi>profess and perform it in the Unity and Communion of this Church.</hi> The <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> I say, which makes us Christians, are the <hi>Foundation of that Society and Unity,</hi> which is to be upheld in the Christian Church. Thus, on <hi>Peters Confession,</hi> our Lord declares <hi>he would build his Church,</hi> Mat. 16. 16, 18. And the <hi>Uniteing of Christians into one Temple.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, is by their <hi>being built on the Apostles and prophets,</hi> i. e. On their Doctrines, about worship, faith, and practice. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. 21.

                  <hi>in his Name,</hi> is <hi>forbidding them any more to preach his Doctrine,</hi> Act. 4. 17. 18. And so, when our Lord prays to his Father, that his <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples may be kept in his Name,</hi> to the end that they <hi>may be one;</hi> he notes the necessity of continuing in his Doctrine, to their keeping his so much desired Union, <hi>Jo.</hi> 11. 17. Accordingly he adds, <hi>that they may be one, as we are,</hi> viz. he and the Father. For their Unity, is by this way among others, <hi>viz.</hi> by keeping to the same Word or Doctrine, <hi>he teaching them what he had from his Father,</hi> v. 8.

Mens Salvation, nor so necessarily break off Communion, but that Men may hold on joyning in the same Offices, notwithstanding their embracing of some erroneous Opinions. And under such Errors, Peace, and one Communion, were pressed by the Apostles, I conceive, on the Churches in their Days. But these being more necessary, and essential to the Religion; are more necessary also to the keeping of Society and Communion, which is to be kept up among those, who are united and agreed in this Religion.</p>

Liturgies. But also as to <hi>Teachers,</hi> who are to give us true Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that is necessary in the way to Heaven, or to save our souls: they being set over us, and we being order'd to keep subject to them, as <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 4. 11. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Pastors,</hi> who are to <note n="†" place="margin">Jer. 3. 15.</note>

                  <hi>Teachers,</hi> as the Scripture says. Now to be taught aright, in necessary points of Practice, as well as of mere Belief, or Fundamentals of Faith, is necessary to these purposes: For Obedience, is no less necessary in Religion, than Faith is; and a defection from the true necessary Doctrine of either, is most dishonourable to God, and destructive to mens souls. And if teaching us aright, in all grand and necessary Points of both these, tyes us to them; will not their turning False Teachers, or falling, openly, and incureably, to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teach us in either, set us free to go off from them?</p>
               <p>Accordingly, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> treating of <hi>Servants Duties,</hi> whose <hi>Honour, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> and <hi>Fidelity towards their Masters,</hi> is necessary to prevent the <hi>Christian Doctrines being evil spoken of,</hi> bids <hi>Timothy, if any teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and consent not to the Doctrine which is according to Godliness, from such to withdraw himself,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 1, 2, 3, 5. And thus also, when he gives order to <hi>turn away from</hi> the false Teachers of <hi>the later days,</hi> the defection of those false Teachers, he sets out more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, in <hi>Practical Points:</hi> Such as were a <hi>denyal of the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> which lyes in practice; though still, as he says, they <hi>retain'd the form thereof,</hi> which lyes more in speculative Professions and Opinions. <hi>Viz.</hi> by being <hi>Lovers of themselves, or of Pleasure more than of God,</hi> so throwing off the Doctrine, of taking up and bearing Crosses; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>disobedient to Parents,</hi> Natural or Civil, and <hi>Traytors</hi> to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so discarding all sober Principles of Civil Obedience; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Truce-breakers,</hi> finding out ways to evade, or fly off from the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Promises, and Oaths; and the like, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>I speak not of such practical Errors, when got only <hi>among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> by means of some false Teachers privily creeping in, and dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same; but not among the lawful Pastors themselves: as seems to have been the Case at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where some Members had imbibed <hi>Gnostick Infusions,</hi> and thought it lawful to <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 8. &amp; cap. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>communicate in Idol-fcasts.</hi> For here, the sound may attend on the Ministrations of their Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Pastors, though they be to meet some unsound Members there, or to worship in <hi>mixt Communions.</hi> Their Brethrens Errors will not drive them to withdraw themselves, but they may leave them to be remedyed, or removed by <hi>Church-censures.</hi>

                  <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in Idol-Feasts:</hi> but not doctrinally maintain, and preach them up. And thus also <hi>Leontius</hi> did, whilst the Orthodox kept on meeting in the <hi>Arian</hi> Assemblies under him at <hi>Antioch.</hi> For though he secretly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd, and encourag'd the <hi>Arians,</hi> who used a <hi>derogatory Doxology, of Glory be to the Father, by the Son, in the Holy Ghost;</hi> not as the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, <hi>to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost:</hi> yet in <hi>repeating the Doxology at the end of the Psalms, he repeated all the first Part,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ'd, <hi>privatelhy to himself;</hi> and <hi>then only repeated aloud,</hi> when it came to <hi>in saecula saeculorum,</hi> or <hi>world without end,</hi> wherein both were agreed, as <hi>Theodorit</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Hist. Eccl. l. 2. c. 24.</note> reports.</p>
               <p>Yea, I may add, that at other times, when the Pastors preach them up bare-faced, they may <hi>do it generally:</hi> so that the People may have none else, but such <hi>Erroneous Teachers,</hi> to communicate with. As was the case of the <hi>Jews,</hi> I think, <hi>at our Saviours coming,</hi> when <hi>the Priests,</hi> I conceive, generally agreed in preaching up those practical Errors and <hi>doctrinal Salvo</hi>'s, whereby, as our Lord <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 15. 6.</note> charges them, they <hi>made void Gods Commandments.</hi> And in such a <hi>corrupt state of the Church,</hi> till they could have the same from more Orthodox Ministers; they were to go on communicating in Religious Offices and Sacrifices, whilst there was nothing but good in them, with these otherwise erroneous Ministers. And were not to disclaim Communion with their Ministrations, but to <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 16. 6. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>beware of the Leaven of their Doctrines:</hi> Or, in other Points, where they taught true, <note n="‖" place="margin">Mat. 23. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>to follow their Doctrines, not their Practices,</hi> as our Saviour cautions.</p>
               <p>But when they saw Souls endangered by such Salvo's, it was the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of true Prophets, and Priests among them, and would be so in all other places, on like occasions, by their preaching and Ministrations to keep up sound knowledge among the People in these Points; yea, tho' such preaching and ministrations made a Breach between them, and


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44279:84"/>
those defecting Teachers. And it was the Peoples duty to follow any among them, who would teach them better, when they could have such Teachers, as they had in our Blessed Lord, and his Apostles. Whatever Allowance, under the favour of Necessity, men may have to keep on with such, of which <hi>Plea of necessity,</hi> I shall say more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; yet, where there is choice of others more Orthodox, they are no longer tyed to such Pastors, as openly and obstinately preach up damnable practices, to disgrace Religion, and endanger Souls. Bear they may for a time, in hopes of Reformation; and, because it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier, to prevent, than to patch up Breaches, wise Lovers both of Peace and Truth, would not be hasty in coming to extreamities. But if still they will persist, and go on in such pernicious Ways and Doctrines; good People and Pastors may withdraw themselves from their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says in the places already cited.</p>
               <p>And the Reasons of breaking off, on such defections from necessary points, either of faith or practice, are still more urgent, if there is no Liberty left in any Churches, for other Pastors to stand up mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterially, or exercise their Ministry in defence of those necessary points, whilst they continue with, and adhere to them. For then, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment and Suppression of necessary Truths, is made a condition of Communion; and other Pastors, if they will hold on with them, must suffer <note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>that good thing, which has been committed to their Trust,</hi> to be extinguish'd, without standing up, according to their duty and solemn undertaking, to minister the same. Which will make it necessary for all, who will choose to stand by Christ and his Truths, rather than by such his Apostatizing Servants and Corrupters thereof, to depart from them.</p>
               <p>When therefore the Bishops and Pastors of any Church, fall off from ministring necessary Christian Doctrine or Worship; and especially when they come to allow their Communion to none, who will go on admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the same; they thereby loosen the bands of Union, and break that spiritual dependance and relation, which the People, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Pastors, ought to have upon them. They are no longer the true <hi>Joynts,</hi> to compact the Members; nor the <hi>Head of Unity,</hi> to keep together the Body of the Church. And thus it was at the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> under <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> with the <hi>Popish Bishops;</hi> whose corrupt Worship and Doctrine, yea, and rigorous exaction of complyance with both from all who expected to hold Communion with them, had set their Churches at liberty to go off from them, as I formerly observed, and to seek more Orthodox Bishops in their room. And so it would be in the case of other Bishops, especially of those who espouse a Schism, and communicate with Anti-Bishops in opposition to the true Bishops, if they fall from ministring necessary Christian Truths, whether of Faith, or of Moral Doctrine and Worship, as in the fore-mentioned Cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:44279:85"/>
And when the Church is thus loosed of its dependance on their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, by the defection of such erring Bishops; It may be free to unite it self, to other Orthodox Bishops. Either to receive such an one, for its own local Bishop, as was done at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> by substituting <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Reformed Bishops,</hi> into the Sees of <hi>Popish Bishops.</hi> Or, till it can have that, by receiving the Benefit of Episcopal and Priestly Acts, from any other Orthodox Bishops and Clery, as they can be met with. It may fetch all Orthodox Ministrations and spiritual Functions, from other places, when it cannot have them from an Orthodox Pastor, or in the Unity of the Church, at home. This it may do, says <note n="*" place="margin">Quid enim si in maripor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus suis ruptis, infestus &amp; periculosus esse Navibus coeperit; nonne Navigantes, ad allos proximos Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Naves suas dirigunt, ubi sit tutus &amp; salutaris introitus, &amp; statio secura?

               <p>And as the <hi>People</hi> of such defecting Bishops and Pastors, <hi>may seek out,</hi> and unite themselves to others, <hi>for all necessary Ministrations;</hi> so may those other <hi>Orthodox Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> who are sought to, <hi>be free to receive and supply them.</hi> This is plain of both, because the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one are Members, and the other are Bishops or Priests, is a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</hi> For being <hi>Catholick,</hi> its <hi>Baptisms,</hi> and <hi>Ordinations,</hi> are <hi>Catholick;</hi> and make, as the one <hi>Christians,</hi> so the other <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> that must be owned for such over all the Christian Church, and not only in some limited Parts, or Districts thereof.

                  <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation of False Doctrine,</hi> or leading the Church wrong, is such a just Expostulation, as <hi>Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> observes upon the <hi>Canon.</hi> These Rules, for preserving Order and Concord among Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Churches, are binding towards any Bishops, who are in the Unity of the Church, and are Orthodox. But if either they are faln to set up Unchristian Worship, or Doctrine; or, as I observed before, are turned Schismaticks, or set up as Anti-Bishops in Christ's Church: They bind none towards such Bishops. They are no longer Heads of Union, and so cannot claim the Benefit of these Rules for Unity; which, by their Schism, or Defection, is at an end towards them.</p>
               <p>Thus doth <hi>Heresie,</hi> or a defection from necessary Doctrine or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, discharge Church Members, from their Spiritual and Canonical dependance and union, with their defecting Bishops and Pastors. Priests


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44279:87"/>
are no longer tyed to such erring Bishops, nor the People to either, in such Cases. So that a defection to sinful Worship, and damnable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, bereaves Men of all Argu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ments from Scripture or Canons, for their Subjects to depend on them, or to unite with them.</p>
               <p>If therefore in any division of a Church, it can truly be Objected to one side, that they are saln from holy and true Worship and Doctrine; it is not for them to plead the duty of Union, or to tell People of their Obligations to unite with them. If before they were the true Heads, and the Regular and Canonical Bishops of those places; yet would their falling into those Unchristian Errors, strip them of those Claims. The Union taught by <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Holy Scriptures, and directed by the Rules and Canons of the Church, supposes Men Orthodox; but is not to unite with such defectors. Nor is any Charity, which they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to in seeking to keep all others united to themselves, the Charity which he requires. For that <hi>Charity, which is the end of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> must be <hi>out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. It must be <hi>out of a pure heart, and a good conscience:</hi> and so is only a seeking to have them one with us, whilst we go together in keeping the Commandments, or in the practice of good things; not like the <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Love of Thieves, and Murderers,</hi> that associates and <hi>binds them together in the practice of ill things,</hi> as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In Loc.</note> notes. And it must also be <hi>out of faith unfeigned;</hi> and so is a seeking to unite them to our selves, not in dangerous Errors, but only in Orthodox and Christian Doctrines. Whereas, the pains that is taken to bring all over to them in the Breach of Gods Laws, and embracing of Unchristian Doctrine, or to be one with them in Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Wickedness; is not Charity, but destruction, to those who are seduced by them.</p>
               <p>If such defection from pure Worship and Doctrine is their Case, the guilt of making a division lyes plainly at their doors. In such Breaches, St. <hi>Paul</hi> notes the <hi>Dividers from the Doctrine,</hi> as making the Schism; and not the faithful Adherers to it, who refuse to break off from <hi>it,</hi> in order to their keeping on with <hi>them. Mark those,</hi> as <hi>causing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions</hi> or Offences, who go <hi>contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned,</hi> saith he, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. And divisions made by such defection, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureable by any thing, but their own repentance and return to their former ways. Their Brethren can not heal, or close them, by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in their desection; because that is to be false to Truth, and to their own and others Souls, which are all in danger of perishing by straying from the same.</p>
               <p>Nay, should they do as they desire, and all come over; that would only be a false and seeming Cure, but really make the Breach wider. For the whole Body of Christians, from the beginning to the end, are


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44279:87"/>
but one Church. And those Christian Societies, which make up this one Church, are the several Churches of all times and places. <hi>All true Christians, which now are, or formerly have been, or hereafter shall be,</hi> are all Members of one and the same Body, as I formerly shewed.</p>
               <p>So that the Unity, which good Christians are to aim at, is to appear of one Society and Communion, with the whole Body of faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, from <hi>first</hi> to <hi>last:</hi> with all the faithful, who have kept to this Unity, and are now in Heaven; as well as with all, who either now are, or hereafter shall be in earth, doing the same. Or, to be found united, and in the Communion of that Body, or general Collection and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Saints, who shall all appear together as one Body, that has kept up the Faith and Unity of the Church, in opposition to all Heretical or Schismatical Oppugners thereof, at the last Day. And they are lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably out, and take their Aim too narrow, who look only at keeping an external Union, with the Assemblies and Religious Societies of their own place and time; though that be in breaking off from the Way and Communion, of all the faithful Christians of other places at that time, and of all that are gone before them, and will make them appear separately from the general Assembly and great Collection of Saints, at the last Day.</p>
               <p>Now true Doctrine and Worship, as I have shewn, are among the chief Ligaments, in this Body of Christs Holy Catholick Church. And if even any regular Bishops, or Metropolitanes, with their respective Societies or Churches, break off from any necessary Truths, or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Christ, they break off at the same time, from all this great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of faithful Christians of all other other places and times, who are all united and incorporated in them, and stand upon them. And if these defectors, appear to make the Generality, or great Number, in their own particular Times, and Countries; yet are they but a handful, compared to that General Body or Collection on the other side, whom they have defected and broke from, and who will stand all in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact Body against them, at the last Day. <hi>viz. the Catholick Church of all Times and Places.</hi> So that those few faithful among them, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue sirm, and stand out against their defection, do not go off from the main Body, or greatest Numbers, but stick to them; the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church of all Ages and Countries, which makes the vast Body, and infinitly the greatest Number, being in reality with them. The Catholick Church, consisting of our Saviour Christ, of Apostles and Prophets, Martyrs and Confessors, and of all the truly Faithful, who have gone before us, are now, or shall be after us, when all is done will make the Body. And those few Faithful Christians sticking to this, when the numerous Defectors in those Countries start from it, stick to the Body. So that, as the <hi>Council of Constantinople</hi> declares of <hi>those,</hi>


                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:44279:88"/>
                  <hi>who break off Communion with their Bishops, yea, before Synodical Sentence, when once they openly teach any Heresie condemn'd by the Holy-Fathers or Councils;</hi> by so doing, <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>they do not rend the Unity of the Church by Schism, but study to free, or defend it, against Schisms or Divisions.</hi> So at such times, they must bespeak their Brethren, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did the <hi>Confessors,</hi> who sided with the Schismatick <hi>Novatian.</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Cum Unanimitas &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia nostra seindi omnino non debeat, quia nos Ecclesia derelicta foras exire, &amp; ad vos venire non possumus, ut vos magis ad Ecclesiam Matrem, &amp; ad nostram Eraternitatem revertamini, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus possumus hortamentis petimus &amp; rogamns, <hi>Cyp.

                  <hi>Because we can not leave the Church, and come over to you,</hi> which, instead of patching up, <hi>would be to break and divide the Churches Concord and Unanimity: We beseech you, by all the ways we can, that you would return and come back again to your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church, an<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to our Fraternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By keeping then to the necessary Doctrines and Worship of Christ, of the Catholick Church, and of our own Church, we keep united to them; and so far, as we break off from these, we answerably break off from them. And therefore the running in of more into such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, instead of closing up the Schism, would increase it. It would only make the more People guilty, of dividing, and standing off from Christ, and from the Catholick Church, as that contains all Orthodox Christians and Right Churches, who are gone before us, or are now, or shall be after us. Yea, from all their Ancestors, during all the Successions of them to their unhappy defection, in their own Church. And even from themselves, in all their own best dayes, whilst they stood true to their own pure Worship and Orthodox Principles. Which is such a way of healing Schisms, as Rebellion is of remedying Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances; that is, instead of taking any off, it brings abundance more upon us.</p>
               <p>And this makes the Charge of Schism stronger, and more aggravated in the fore-mentioned Cases, where the Corruptions of Doctrine and Worship make them a corrupt Church, as well as the setting up of Anti-Bishops makes them a Schismatical Church. There is plainly a Schism in making of Anti-Bishops, which is a setting up of opposite Altars. But it is a more wicked and ungodly Schism, when these opposite Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars are set up for wicked and ungodly purposes, to head sinful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Worship and Doctrines. That Schism, is complicated with Heresie, or other dangerous depravation of Religion. It is not only making a Breach in the Church; but withal, it is forming a Party against Truth and Holiness. It is giving Religion a second Blow, to maintain a former; and setting up one ill thing, to secure a worse. It seeks to confederate Men in the Breach of Unity, that it may hold them


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44279:88"/>
fast in Breach of Piety, or Moral Honesty. And a Schism so set up to strike at Religion, is more impious in the sight of God, and of all good men, and the Guilt thereof is more flagrant. And besides, 'tis incureable by any, but themselves. For the Schismaticks run into such a Breach, to maintain a Quarrel against Truth and Righteousness. And in that, they must go by themselves; for none who will take any due care of their precious Souls, ought to bear them company. So, there can be no Re-union, till they return from their wicked and ungodly Schism, to the way of Truth and Righteousness, which they had forsaken.</p>

And


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44279:89"/>
accordingly St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> presses that <hi>Charity,</hi> which <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes so necessary to the acceptance of all other Vertues, even <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom</hi> it self; as indispensably obliging all good Christians, to keep in the Communion of their true and rightful Bishops, as I observed <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 1. Part 3.</note> before.</p>
               <p>And as these true and rightful Bishops, are at the Head of necessary Gospel-worship and Doctrines, when their Opposers fall off from them, good Christians are yet more bound to hold to their Communion. They are tyed thereto then, not only for the rightful Bishops, but also for pure Worship and necessary Truths sake. For true Christians, must seek to communicate in these. And that must be, by communicating in the Ministrations of those Pastors, which hold to them. Besides, these, in any competition, arê Christ's <hi>true Shepherds,</hi> and <hi>trusty Watch-men,</hi> and <hi>faithful Guides,</hi> and <hi>uncorrupt Teachers,</hi> and <hi>faithful Ministers:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the Men, who faithfully minister his Word, and give his Warnings, and dispense that Food, which is to keep those Souls alive whom he has given them the Care of. And all these, are no idle Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, but speak answerable Obligations in the People, as I have shewn <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 7. Part 1.</note> before, to attend on their Ministrations, and unite themselves to them. And this, the Scripture requires in those Precepts, which command us, <hi>in</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 15. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>glorifying God,</hi> to <hi>have one mind and mouth;</hi> to be <note n="‖" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>perfectly joyn'd together in the same mind and judgment, and speak the same things;</hi> and the like. For this <hi>speaking the same,</hi> is speaking the same with those who speak right, not with those who speak wrong. And this <hi>Union of minds</hi> and <hi>judgments,</hi> must be in uniting with men of Orthodox minds, or that hold all necessary Christian Doctrines: For if any fall off from these, we must not be of one mind with them, but of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent minds. I add moreover, that Association and Union of Church-Members under Bishops, is for visible Profession and Ministration of pure Worship and Doctrine. And therefore they must unite with those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, who profess and administer the same. Yea, their care of their own Safety, no less than the love of Truth, will make them fly to such Pastors: As the <hi>Saylors</hi> do <hi>to the next safe Port, when their own is sanded;</hi> or the <hi>Travellers to the next secure Inn, when their old one is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set with Thieves,</hi> as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ep. 68. p. 178.</note> observes in this Case.</p>
               <p>And as they are thus to <hi>hold Communion,</hi> and unite themselves to <hi>those rightful Bishops, who keep to pure Worship and Doctrine:</hi> So are they, on the other hand, to <hi>stand off from those, who make the Schism, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a sinful Worship, or corrupt Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not say, they are to look on these Schismaticks and Defectors, as quite faln from the <hi>Relation,</hi> and <hi>Title of Brethren.</hi> A Schismatical, or Excommunicate Christian, is still a <hi>Christian,</hi> not an <hi>Infidel,</hi> or <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi> And whilst they continue <hi>Christians,</hi> they retain, though not so

               <p>Such was the sense, which the Holy Apostles had instill'd, and

which the Primitive Christians had carefully retained, of their <hi>strict Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, to keep united to their own Orthodox rightful Bishops,</hi> and <hi>to shun the Communion of all Schismatical Opposers of them, or of Heretical Teachers.</hi> And this shunning of such Communion, must not be looked upon, as the effect of Anger, or Peevishness; or, as an Expression, not of Religion, but of meer human Passions, which took place in the Church, as Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty grew cold and wore off. For this was most, in the days of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posties</hi> themselves, and of their Contemporaties, and their nearest Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors; as may appear from the fore cited Scriptures, and Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian.</hi> When Charity was the highest, as it will be confest to have been in those times; they were the choicest in their Communions, and stood furthest off from all Schismaticks and Hereticks, refusing them the Commerce, not only of Spiritual and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Ministrations, but even of Civil Offices and Respect.

               <p>So that Charity, when at the height, was highest towards God, for sustaining his Worship and Doctrine, visibly bearing it up by the Church, and in the Unity thereof. But was not for being any ways wanting to a Church-Profession and Maintenance of them, in tenderness and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance to those who defected from them. But Christians abated of these first Rigours, in shuning all Commerce with such Persons, as the first Charity and Zeal for pure Doctrine and Worship grew less, and as they were driven thereto, especially in point of civil Commerce, by Hereticks and Schismaticks growing more numerous, and (through the lamentable Divisions of Christendom,) lying intermix'd in all places, which render'd the former renunciation of civil Commerce, as less ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseable, so less practicable in the Church. For when they fill'd all places, they would be met with in all places, and intermix in all deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And then, not to have any <hi>Company</hi> or <hi>Dealings</hi> with such, they <hi>must needs go out of the World,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives as one Reason of Relaxation and Allowance in this Case, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. So that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still to shun Spiritual, or Ecclesiastical Communion with such Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Schisms; especially for the setting up of a sinful Worship, and Unchristian Doctrines and Practices; is so far from being a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the <hi>Apostolical</hi> and <hi>Primitive Charity,</hi> that it is a keeping up to it, and is only a retaining of their <hi>first Love,</hi> which ought in all times faithfully to be kept on in all true Churches.</p>

Now as to the <hi>Persons whom this will affect,</hi> and whose Communion by this Rule is to be shuned in such Cases; it barrs this Communion with those, who <hi>set up and make the Anti-Bishops,</hi> or <hi>who side and take part with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It <hi>affects the Electors, who chose the Men;</hi> and <hi>their Ordainers and Consecrators, who laid hands on them.</hi> For these, give Heads to the New Bodies, and create the Schism. Others, may seditiously call for it, or come in to it when once 'tis form'd; but their part is to give it a Head, which formally constitutes and sets it up, so that they are Principals therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And <hi>those, who own subjection and dependance on these Anti-Bishops, in opposition to their Old Ones;</hi> and, as <hi>Members, unite and incorporate under them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is <hi>among the Pastors, by whom their Authority is received,</hi> and who thereby all break off from the rightful Bishop, to whom in all their Ministrations they ought to keep subject and dependant.

               </p>
               <p>But when the Priests and Deacons of a Diocess, <hi>turn over from their rightful Bishop to the Anti-Bishop,</hi> they live in a slagrant Breach of these Rules of Communion.

                  <hi>Like as where Jesus Christ goes, there the Catholick Church goes too,</hi> says St. <hi>Ignatius.</hi> But if they break away, from all Dependance on them, and from all recourse to their ministrations, to Depend on the Anti-Bishops, and to resort to theirs; that makes them all Schismaticks. For all these Assemblies of People and Pastors, make the Schismatical Bodys, whereof the Anti-Bishops are the Heads. As the Bishops, set up for the Schismatical Heads; So the Pastors and People, who turn over to them, and assemble under them, come in to be their Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Members. They Form themselves into one Church, by erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Ecclesiastical Union and Communion among themselves. And this is a Schismatical Church, as Consisting all of a Party of Members, broke off from their True Heads, or lawful Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Further, it may also <hi>affect other Bishops and Churches, who will take their Part, and Communicate with them.</hi> For <hi>Catholick Unity is to be preserved in the Church,</hi> i. e. <hi>Unity and Communion is to be kept up among all Churches.</hi> And this is, by Rules of Accord, and Correspondence, which give the same Church Acts or matters, the same effects in all places; Of which Rules, I have <note n="*" place="margin">Part 3. Chap. 2.</note> before discoursed more at large. And these Rules, will keep up <hi>Catholick Unity,</hi> and the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> between all Bishops and Churches; since, this way, they all Communicate, or all in Common refuse to do it, with the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>And therefore if any Bishop of one Church, would side and have Communion with Anti-Bishops, or with the Schismaticks or Hereticks of other Churches: He thereby broke the Rules of Union, as well as they, and became involved in Schism like one of them. For he was as much obliged as others, in care of maintaining Unity to keep off from the Communion of such Schismaticks: Yea, in care of Catholick Unity and Communion, to keep off from the Communion of those who make a Schism from other Catholick Bishops, as if they made it from himself. And if still he will Communicate, and joyn himself to them; he violates Unity, and joyns in a Schism, as any other Man would do, who should do the same. And being found in the Schism with them, he would have been treated as they were, and have fallen from the Communion of all other Orthodox and Catholick Bishops, whose Rule was, to refuse and shun the Communion of Schismaticks, and of their adherents and partakers. <hi>Communicating with men out of Communion, he himself would be put out of Communion,</hi> as the aforecited <hi>Councils</hi> say. And thus it was, with <hi>Marcianus Bishop of Arles,</hi> when he fell to Communicate and joyn himself to <hi>Novatian,</hi> who was set up as a Schismatical Anti-Bishop against <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the Rightful and Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Bishop of <hi>Rome.

Necessity, for all the suffering and oppugned Bishops, to insist upon their own Powers and Claims; lest otherwise the Church should neither have Bishops nor Priests, nor the People any valid Sacraments and Church Administrations.</p>
               <p>For the Anti Bishops receiving no Power or Authority for these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations, from their Ordainers, <hi>their Ordination being null,</hi> as he says: They can not be impowered, according to the Christian Rules of conferring Powers, without a <hi>New Ordination.</hi> The conferring of Orders, or of Ministerial Powers, is tyed, by our Lord himself, to a particular way, <hi>viz. Imposition of hands, by impowered Persons.</hi> In point of <hi>Orders,</hi> as of <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Holy Eucharist,</hi> the effect is affixed to the Rite of God's Institution. So that such Imposition of Hands, must give them. And if the former Imposition of Hands was null, in these Competitions they can not have these Powers of Orders, but by a New one. The receding of the former Bishop, or his ceasing to make any further Competition, were they already vested with these Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers by their own Ordination, would give the Anti-Bishops scope to exercise the same, and to do it alone, without any Rent or Division. But such Recession, is no Ordination, nor gives them the Episcopal Powers, if they had them not before. Yea, I add, nor would any <hi>mere Allowance,</hi> or <hi>after-Ratification of Synods,</hi> confer the same, as I conceive, without such <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Valid Imposition of hands.</hi> When Men pretend they have already received these Spiritual Powers, meet Allowance admits of their Pretences. But I see not, how that alone should confer the Powers, if before they wanted them. Nor doth mere saying, <hi>I allow thee to be a Bishop or a Priest,</hi> without Words not only <hi>pre-supposing,</hi> but actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and from that time <hi>conferring</hi> Authority upon the Persons, seem enough to make them such: Which in my Apprehension, would make little of the <hi>Power of Orders;</hi> and would be a very lax, and cheap <hi>Salvo,</hi> to make good the Usurpations, which either now, or at any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, have been made by Sectaries upon the <hi>Priests Office.</hi> Besides, when they would empower Persons, even <hi>Synods</hi> themselves, or Bishops met there, can not confer Orders, as I say, more than Sacraments, by what way they please, but are bound up, as I apprehend, to <hi>Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions:</hi> and are not left to dispose of Ministerial or Episcopal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, by way of Sentence, or of Legislation, but only by <hi>Imposition of Episcopal Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however it might be, in the Opinion of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Church of that Age; the <hi>Africans</hi> carrying the effect of Schism farther than others, to the Nulling of their Baptisms and Ordinations: I think this <hi>nulling of all Ordinations of Opposite or Anti-Bishops,</hi> or <hi>mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them null in themselves,</hi> is <hi>no Catholick Doctrine,</hi> nor did the Church tye it self thereto, or procede thereby in other Ages.</p>

               <p>In the Succession of Bishops in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> there have been numerous Ordinations of opposite or Anti-bishops, which have made no fewer, than 27 Schisms.

               <p>In the <hi>Arian Persecution,</hi> of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the <hi>Orthodox Faith,</hi> nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous were the unjust Deprivations of <hi>Orthodox Bishops;</hi> as of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> at <hi>Alexandria, Paulus</hi> at <hi>Constantinople, Liberius</hi> at <hi>Rome, Asclepas</hi> at <hi>Gaza, Lucius</hi> at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Besides all this, instead of Anti-bishops being absolutely null, and in reality no Bishops; to heal, and compose the differences, of a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly harassed and divided Church, on such Competitions it has been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times agreed, that, whichsoever of them were the Right, on the death of either, the Survivor should be owned, and the Church should have no other Bishop; and so all the Ordinations, and Episcopal Acts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, should pass through his hands, and stand on his Authority, whilst he lived.

                  <hi>Sozomen</hi> calls an <hi>admirable Counsel,</hi> and expedient, that, on <hi>the death of either, the survivor should hold the See alone for his Life,</hi> without being confronted and opposed, <hi>by the Ordination of any other Person.</hi> To prevent which, <hi>an Oath was exacted, of all in that Church, who seemed to stand fairest for the Episcopate,</hi> and of <hi>Flavianus</hi> among the rest, <hi>that on the death of either of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, they would not be Ordain'd Bishop of Antioch, whilst the other sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived.</hi> Which Agreement and Oath, being afterwards <note n="*" place="margin">Soz. l. y. c. 11. p. 717. &amp; Soc. l. 5. c. 9. &amp; 10.</note> broke by <hi>Flavianus,</hi> when, on the death of <hi>Meletius,</hi> he was Ordained Bishop against <hi>Paulinus,</hi> cost him so much trouble and difficulty, as he found to get himself received for the Bishop thereof, both in <hi>Egypt, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus;</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> and among the <hi>Western Bishops,</hi> afterwards.</p>
               <p>Thus, though Men in a Schism, did ill in Ordaining others: yet were not those Ordinations <hi>null in themselves;</hi> but <hi>really conferred the powers of Orders,</hi> which the Persons might exercise if the Church pleased. And when once the Persons were reconciled, and had satisfied the Church for their Schism, they have often been allow'd to officiate in Virtue of that Ordination, without being Ordained over again, by the greatest Councils, and through the early and later Ages of the Church.</p>
               <p>And this shews, that their Ordinations were not null in themselves. For if such Persons, had never received any Spiritual powers in their Ordinations, they had none to exercise. And had the Church been of this perswasion, it would never have admitted them to exercise those


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44279:97"/>
POWERS, which it believed were never Conferred on them.</p>
               <p>But, though these Men, even after they had faln into a Schism, or others who were Ordained therein, <hi>had Orders:</hi> yet was it in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Church, to deny them the <hi>Ministerial Exercise of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Men must have the <hi>Communion of the Church</hi> as well as <hi>Orders,</hi> before they can <hi>exercise their Orders,</hi> and minister to the Faithful in any Religious Assemblies. And though their Schism, doth not utterly devest, or exclude them from the Powers of Orders: yet it doth from the Communion of the Church, without which the Faithful, (who are not to seek, but to shun the Ministrations of Schismaticks, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate persons) must not partake with them in any Exercise of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And to this Communion, after once they have justly lost, and faln from it, they are to be restored again in Degree more or less, and to be received to the Communion, either only of <hi>Lay-members,</hi> or else of Clergy, and to officiate according to their former Honors, as the Church pleaseth.</p>
               <p>And as to this Admission and Allowance, <hi>to exercise their Orders in its Communion,</hi> the Church has acted variously, according as it saw cause. When Ordinations have been made against the Rules of Unity, though the Offenders thereby received Orders; yet, in care of these Rules, and to assert and keep up Discipline, it has at some times denyed, as well as at other times granted its Communion to them, for their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of the same, Where it judged that Rigor expedient, on their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, it, would receive them, to communicate as Lay-men. But, they should not be allow'd the Priviledges, nor permitted to act and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, as Bishops and Priests, in her Communion; nor should other Churches receive them, and joyn with them as such, till moreover sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction had been first given to those Rules of Unity in Ordinations, which had been broken in theirs.</p>
               <p>And this it has done, not only in case of this great Rule, of <hi>not Ordaining a Bishop into a full Church:</hi> but, also in case of other Rules, which are of less Account, than it is.

               <p>Thus, though their Orders were valid in themselves, without which they could have been received at no time; yet have they not always availed to Claim and obtain the Churches Communion, without which the persons could not be received by the Faithful to exercise the same. And this has been, when the Church saw fit and expedient, to insist upon the Rules of Unity in Ordinations, and more vigorously to assert Ecclesiastical Law and Discipline.</p>
               <p>And this, it might assert, or relax, as it saw Cause. Ecclesiastical

Law and Discipline, is not a Rule of indispensible Obligation to the Church; but such as it may, and oft-times has receded from, on great reason and necessity. What Rules the Church makes, the Church may alter and go off from in particular Cases, as need shall require, and as may best serve those ends for which it made them.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, Rules of Discipline, have not been one and the same in all Ages. For, to omit others, the ancient Councils asserted the <note n="*" place="margin">Can. 4. Conc. Nic. primi, &amp; Can. 13. Conc. Carthag.</note>

               <p>And such Rules of Discipline, as have been observed more strictly, have not had one equal and uniform Tenor of Observation; but have been sometimes remitted, and sometimes exacted and stood upon, as the Church was driven thereto by prudential Reason. Thus it has been with the Canons or Rules of Discipline, about Ordinations. Which, as the Church has sometimes insisted on, as I noted, to vacate the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations, which any Bishops made against them; I mean, to deny the Persons its Communion, without which, whatever powers of Orders they had received, they could not be received in any Assemblies of the Faithful, to exercise the same: So were they at other times relaxed and over-ruled by the necessities of the Church, and the Persons, on their reconciliation, admitted to officiate in vertue of such Orders, as I think may abundantly appear by the fore-cited instances. And this very Reason is given for it, by the <hi>African Fathers</hi> in the <hi>Synod of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> when they <hi>admit of the Ordinations of the Donatists, which the Transmarine or Italian Synod had rejected:</hi> telling <hi>Pope Anastasius,</hi> that <hi>this Reception of them to the same Orders,</hi> was <hi>for the</hi>

               <p>These instances and proofs, I think may be sufficient to shew, that Anti-bishops, and others of their Ordination, have Orders; though, being in a Schism, the Faithful ought not to joyn with them in their

use thereof. Their Schism, makes them Sinners in receiving, and in using their Orders, and shuts out others from communicating therewith.

               <p>The <hi>Donatists</hi> indeed, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> reports, asserted this, and taught, that <note n="*" place="margin">Ipsi ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicent quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum baptizati non pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit amitti, &amp; Sacramentum ordinati possit amitti: quoniam dicunt, recedens ab Ecclesia Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum non amittit, jus dandi tamen amittit, <hi>August. cont.

               <p>But as to the Bishops being <hi>the principle of Unity,</hi> that respects the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Duty, of holding Communion with him; his being the Principle of Unity to the Church, binding the Church to depend on him, and incorporate under him, and to communicate with him.

               <p>But though the Anti-bishop in any Church, can not oblige or hold all the Members thereof to himself, as the <hi>principle of Unity;</hi> yet may he have all, that is of the <hi>essence of Episcopacy.</hi> For, to be an Head of Union in the Church, is not of the essence of a Bishop. It may be separate from the Episcopal powers; as it is, in all Bishops falling into Heresie, or Schism. For they are no longer Heads of Union, since none are <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. 1 Part 3. c. 4, 5.</note> bound to follow them, but all are to break Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them. But yet they are Bishops still, and do not thereby fall from the powers of Ordination, nor, on their Re-union to the Church, need to be Ordained again.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, one main use of Episcopacy, is to be a <hi>means of Unity.</hi> But yet, it is not so for this use, as to be nnll, or cease, when it misses, or fails thereof. Even as <hi>Baptism,</hi> or the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> are for Unity: <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>We being all baptized into one Body;</hi> and being <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>one Body,</hi> as <hi>partaking all of one Bread,</hi> as the Apostle says. But yet, they do not always cease, or fail of their effects, when administred in breach thereof: and Baptism, as was held by the ancient Church, and as we all hold now, is still valid, though performed by Schismaticks.


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44279:101"/>
When they miss of this, they have other uses. As the Sacraments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides keeping Unity among the Members, enter and ratifie the Covenant of Grace. And Episcopacy, besides the use, of keeping the Church one and unbroken is for administration of the Word, of Prayers, and Sacraments, and for Ordaining others to do the same. And though all these ought to be exercised in the Unity of the Church, and 'tis a great Sin when 'tis otherwise: yet such sinful Exercises, are no Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as if the Persons had no powers, or as if the Administrations had no effect at all.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>State Monarchy,</hi> I grant, that the <hi>Regal Powers,</hi> and this use of their being a <hi>principle of State-Unity,</hi> are more closely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly connected. And that, as he, who has the Regal Powers, is the principle of <hi>State-Union:</hi> so he, who is no such principle, and to whom the People are not bound to unite, has truly no Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Powers. And in <hi>Elective Kingdoms,</hi> if, whilst the Throne is full, the Electors, (whose power of choosing is only in Vacancies,) pretend to choose another; they really confer no Regal power, nor make a King; but an Usurper. This is, because secular powers, are more limited to Territories and Precincts; and because no King, can be a King at large, but must only be a King, of such or such a Place, or Countries.</p>
               <p>But in the <hi>Spiritual Monarchy</hi> 'tis otherwise. For the Collation, and Reception of the Episcopal Powers, is not with precise Limitation to such a particular place or Diocess; but indefinite, or with respect to the Church at large. Or expressed, as it is in our <hi>Form of Ordination, by receiving of the Holy Ghost for the Office of a Bishop, for the Church of God.</hi> Which makes any person, not a meer Local, but a Catholick Bishop; or one vested with Episcopal powers, and under no want of inherent Authority to exercise Episcopal Acts, (if, as a Conscientious Lover of Unity, he be not otherwise restrained by Rules of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Unity and Order,) in any part of the World.

               <p>These local Limitations, and Appropriations of Precincts, to <hi>have every Bishop the Bishop of some place,</hi> and to <hi>have but one Bishop at a time in a City</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> are great and necessary Rules, 'tis true, of Order and Unity. And all the Pastoral Powers, are most highly served by having them to direct their Exercise; and would be mightily disturbed, and hindred of their end, by the want thereof: So that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously, and carefully to be observed, and maintain'd in the Church.</p>
               <p>But their Necessity, is for <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> not for the <hi>Being of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy.</hi> And when there are two Bishops, heading seperate Churches at once in a place; that duplicity, must only prove one to be a Schif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick; but doth not prove him, as I think may sufficiently appear from what has been here discoursed, to be no Bishop. Nay, while this separation of Churches could be without the Guilt of Schism, as it was in the first standing off of the <hi>Jews</hi> from the <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts, and as the blessed Apostles themselves allow'd it should be for a time, till the <hi>Jews</hi> could be brought to see the <hi>Lawfulness of communicating with Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> which was contrary to all their former received Opinions: I say, whilst such separation was to be tolerated without imputation of Schism, to suit the necessity of the Church during their prejudices, 'tis very likely there were two Bishops set up in the same place by the Holy Apostles themselves. Thus, in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> 'tis probable, that at first there were at once <hi>two Churches,</hi> one of <hi>Jews,</hi> and the other of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> gather'd there by the two Great Apostles, St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.

                  <hi>that it had never at any time had two Bishops in the same City at once, like other Cities.</hi> So that, what the <hi>having of two Bishops in the same City at once,</hi> strikes at, is the Duty of Church-Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But where it could be tolerated without imputation of Schism, and was not destructive of the required Unity, (as it was not in those first beginnings of the Church, when God was pleased for a time to tolerate the former separation between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> till the <hi>Jews</hi> had out-grown their Prejudices against <hi>communion with Gentiles,)</hi> it was not destructive of, or inconsistent with the Being of Episcopacy.</p>
               <p>Thus, is not the opposite or <hi>Anti-bishops Ordination,</hi> but only his <hi>Communion</hi> excluded, by <hi>having but one Bishop in a Church at a time,</hi> and by <hi>the rightful Bishops being the Principle of Church-Union.</hi> Because another is their rightful Bishop, he can not be the Bishop of that place or Diocess, since they can not have two Bishops at once. And because that other is their principle of Union, they are not to communicate with him, as I have shewn at large in the preceding Chapters. But though he is not <hi>their Bishop,</hi> nor is to have the communion of the Faithful by reason of his Schism; yet he may be <hi>a Bishop,</hi> and have the powers of Orders, by imposition of Episcopal Hands in his own Ordination. So that among such Anti-bishops and their adherents, we are to lament the loss of Unity and Church communion: but not of all Orders and Baptisms, as if, by such Schism, they were rendered utterly uncapable, either to baptize or ordain, and so were like to have neither Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood nor Christianity left among them.</p>

               <p>BUT under such Divisions, the rightful Bishops and Clergy, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the sufferers to be in the right, may be too few to give general opportunities, for all those good Christians who would keep to them, to communicate in Ministerial Offices. And in vast numbers of places, for the <hi>People</hi> to shun communion with the Clergy adhering to the Anti-bishops, or taking part with them, will be to have no communion at all in any Ministerial Offices, since they can not have them from any others. I do not say it will be so with the Clergy themselves, whose part and place being to afford Ministerial Offices, they need not want them unless they please: and if they can have any, though but <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> to joyn with them therein, they may minister in an <hi>Holy Assembly,</hi> who have <hi>Christ in the midst of them,</hi> as <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 18. 20.</note> he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self says.

And supposing the Schism, what is to be done by the People in this case? If they are careful to shun these Ministerial Offices from the hands of Schismaticks, <hi>in places where they can have them from others;</hi> may they not, without imputation of overlooking the criminalness of Schism, <hi>have recourse to them as a Make-shift,</hi> especially if they <hi>profess</hi> and <hi>give out</hi> that they do it only on that account, <hi>where they can have none else,</hi> or <hi>rather than live without any at all?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To perswade this, I observe, that <hi>Schism is breaking the one Body into Parties,</hi> or <hi>making sedition in the Church.</hi> And the spirit of Schism, or the malignity of having to do with a Sedition or Party, is as it is <hi>an owning or esp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

And much less is it to take their part, and stand by them against the true


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44279:104"/>
body: since this coming near them at all, is only for want thereof; and before they appear to oppose the right, they should be put into the opportunity of siding and closeing with it. So that where they can have no assemblies for right communion, the making a shift with the other for that time, speaks no opposition against them.</p>
               <p>I grant, to stand quite off from them, and to have no communion or correspondence with them in their separate ways, is the clearest disclaiming of any Schism, or Sedition. And this, as it may be payd, so is more reasonably exacted, under the settlement of a right Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But under others, when the disobedient have got all into their hands, and make the number in all places, this way of disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by <hi>refusing all communion and correspondence,</hi> admits of some relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and abatements. It doth so plainly in the <hi>Civil State,</hi> where some dealings and correspondence of the dutiful and well affected with the Rebels, which would have been sentenced as Rebellion in better times, will not then be reputed rebellious. And under like prevalence of Schisms, which leave no opportunities of communicating with any else, I think such abatements may also find place in the Church too. Especially, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the necessity of <hi>publick communion</hi> and <hi>Church assemblies,</hi> the great defectiveness and scarcities whereof had almost dropped and lost Religion in the <hi>Patriarchical Age.</hi> And also considering the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which our Religion in particular lays upon <hi>Communion, the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints</hi> being one of the things professed in <hi>the Creed;</hi> which may make it more reasonable to presume such abatements in favour thereof. when there is no opportunity of Ministerial Offices by any others, to communicate with.</p>
               <p>But that the <hi>necessity of having some Ministerial communion, will</hi> be an <hi>excuse in such case for the faultiness of having this at the hands of one ministring in a Schism, when it can not be had from others;</hi> seems reasonable to me, from considering <hi>the Nature and Importance of things;</hi> and <hi>the abatements God himself has been willing to make on such necessity, with other like Duties;</hi> and I think it was so <hi>held and practised by the Church and People of God, when they could have no Ministerial Offices but from Schismaticks,</hi> and also <hi>to give Relief in some other compassionable cases about communion,</hi> which have only <hi>like plea for abatements,</hi> as this case has.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Nature and Importance of the things themselves, publick worship,</hi> or <hi>communion in Ministerial Offices,</hi> is a duty more of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>essential Obligation;</hi> to pay such publick worship, being naturally incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on all men. And withal, it is so <hi>important in it self.</hi> For Communion in Ministerial Offices, or in common and publick Worship, must both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, or testifie the sence, which Mankind have of their common or publick Lord; and also sustain, or bear it up in the World. It is the


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44279:104"/>
way for God, who most justly claims and expects the worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of all his reasonable Creatures, not to be left without Witness, but even in a degenerate and rebellious World, to have some always visibly standing by him, and paying him his due honour and homage. It is also the way for him, to preserve alive a sense thereof among all his other Subjects and Children, whom he, as a common Lord and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is concerned continually to make acquainted therewith, and to try with the power and influences thereof.</p>
               <p>For by this means, he sets forth his worship and truths, as <hi>a Light, to shine out</hi> to all that are in darkness; and sets this <hi>light upon a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick,</hi> or collects the bearers thereof into a body or <hi>City;</hi> and places <hi>this City upon an Hill,</hi> as our Saviour <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5. 14, 15, 16.</note> says, to make it conspicuous, and that it may force it self upon the observation of all, who are at a distance. And if any are willing, to pay this Almighty Lord, his due honour, and homage; it will train them up dayly, in the knowledge, and observance thereof. If they are unwilling, and averse thereto; it will serve to make them willing by degrees. For such dayly represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, of God's publick worship and homage before their eyes, will be a dayly reproof of their ungodly Violations, or Neglects thereof; and make them uneasie therein, and by degrees awaken, and stir up those natural and innate feeds of Truth and Piety, which God has plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all mens Souls, though, under such Neglects or irreligious ways, they lye dormant, and seems as if they were buryed, or almost quite lost, in theirs. Or, if after all, they shall obstinately shut their eyes against this Light so shining out upon them, and persist in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and irreligion; it will clear the Justice of an Injured God, when he comes to punish them for the same, and leave them wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuse.</p>
               <p>Yea, this publick worship is necessary, at least as to a great part of Men, or as to the keeping them up in any considerable Numbers, to keep up Religion and Devotion, not only among others, but in their own breasts. For Devotion is to be upheld and improved in our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, by exercise: which, as they have Provisions for, and are call'd to; so all devout People are careful to comply withal, on the constant returns of these opportunities. But though we need to use this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise to keep it on, we need use none at all to wear it off our minds, which by meer neglect thereof, will sink into forgetfulness of what is good, and into sloth and indevotion, of themselves. Their progress therein, is like that of heavy Weights up hill, which need a constant hand to raise and carry them on, but, when that is once off, have enough in their own Weight to make them roul down again. And this, all may find by their own experience, mens pious affection, as any heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Observer will soon perceive, unavoidably decaying, and going back


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44279:105"/>
back for want thereof. Which makes devout minds, justly to dread the want of such opportunities for Ministerial Offices, as a starving of their Religious affections. And for this Reason, among others, St. <hi>Paul</hi> is earnest in pressing attendance on <hi>Religious Assemblies,</hi> and cautions them against <hi>for saking</hi> the same, because that would endanger the loss of Religion it self. <hi>Not forsaking the assembling of your selves together, as the manner of some is,</hi> saith he to the <hi>persecuted Hebrews,</hi> when he labours, to fix them <hi>in holding fast the Christian Profession without waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and to guard them against such things, as would most dispose them to <hi>draw back,</hi> and apostatize from it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 23, 25. 26. 39.</p>
               <p>And for these, and such like Reasons, publick worship is of so great account in God's sight, that he has <hi>framed much of our Holy Religion,</hi> with a particular eye to it; and <hi>instituted several great,</hi> and <hi>most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant things, for the sake of it.</hi> Such is the <hi>Church</hi> it self, which is instituted for joynt and publick worship. The Society thereby intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced among us, is to associate us in the common worship of that God, whom we all confess: and the Fellowship arising thence, is to make us all Fellow-worshippers. Such also is the <hi>Ministry,</hi> which God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his publick Service, or to minister unto him, either as his Mouth unto his People, or as their Mouth unto Himself, in publick Assemblies or Congregations. Such likewise are those <hi>set</hi> and <hi>solemn Times for worship,</hi> which he has instituted both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> and which are all design'd for publick worship in Joynt-Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Yea, even <hi>our Prayers,</hi> which are the <hi>Acts of worship,</hi> express communion and joynt-society, being put up according to his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>plural number;</hi> he having taught us to say, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> and <hi>give us this day,</hi> &amp;c. which speaks the communion and concurrence of more besides our selves. And the <hi>Holy Sacraments,</hi> those most eminent Acts and Instances of worship, are ordained for <hi>Asts of society</hi> and <hi>partnership,</hi> or of <hi>communion</hi> therein. <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>We are all baptized into one body.</hi> And <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>We, being many, are one bread and one body.</hi> And <note n="‖" place="margin">v. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>The bread which we break, is the communion of the body of Christ; and the cup of blessing which we bless, is the communion of the blood of Christ,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says. And because by their institution, they are not only to be Acts of worship, but of publick worship, or of joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concurrence or communion therein; therefore doth <note n="*" place="margin">Rubr. in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mun. of the Sick.</note> our Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no Sacrament even <hi>to the Sick, without three, or two at the least,</hi> to make a Congregation; and condemns the <hi>private</hi> and <hi>solitary Masses of the Church of Rome,</hi> which are eaten by the <hi>Priest alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such is the <hi>natural obligation,</hi> and such the <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>importance of publick worship,</hi> which is one of the greatest visible supports of Religion, without which 'tis to be feared it would sink, and be in danger to fail in the Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:44279:105"/>
Whereas the paying of this worship in Church-Unity and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on a Bishop, though it be a duty too, yet is a duty more of positive obligation. For to have Bishops, and to pay all our publick worship in communion with them, is no natural duty, which always was incumbent on all men; but came in with Christianity, by positive Institution, or particular Revelation. And besides, though important in it self, yet, in comparison, it is of less importance, not only the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> parts of the Ministration, but the <hi>positive</hi> too, as the <hi>Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nients,</hi> &amp;c. being, I conceive, of more Weight. And though the want of this Union under our own Bishops, by the opposite Passions and angry Tempers which Schism introduces, doe greatly eat out true devotion; yet doth it not make so wide a breach and waste therein, as the want of any Ministerial Offices at all would do.</p>
               <p>Now in any competition of Duties, the Rule is, that <hi>things of positive obligation, shall give way to things of natural obligation;</hi> and <hi>positives of less importance, to positives of more importance; in those cases, and times, where we can not do both.</hi> The natural there, takes place of the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and the greater, sets aside the less. Particularly, as to the <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Religion,</hi> and <hi>Church-unity and Association,</hi> if in any case we can not maintain both, but a competition happens to arise between them; the <hi>care of Church-unity,</hi> must give way to the <hi>care of Religion.</hi> We must look then to keep up as much Church-unity, as we may do in keeping up Religion, which being once lost, Church-unity and associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation signifies nothing. And not begin the other way, to content our selves with keeping up so much of Christian Religion, as we do in strict observance of the Rules of Church-society and Union. For Christs first and chief design, was to plant and preserve the Religion. And that Church-unity, which is either valuable, or desireable in the sight of God, is Church-unity with true Religion, not Church-unity without it: and we are tyed to keep up Church-union for Religion's, not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for Union's sake, as I shewed <note n="*" place="margin">Part 3. Chap. 4.</note> before. And therefore the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obligation to communicate in some Ministerial Offices, will be a fair excuse for doing this out of the way of Church-unity or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on our own Bishops, when both can not have place.</p>
               <p>And thus I think the Scripture determines in such cases, and that,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>These abatements, are what God himself has been willing to make on such necessity, in other like duties.</hi> He has not required, that men should stick so fast to those duties, or parts of duty, which are inferior, or subservient, or appendages unto others; as that for their sakes, they should drop other duties, which are principal or superiour to them: nor is he willing, that in care, of preserving their practice of lesser


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44279:106"/>
Vertues inviolable, they should at any time let the weightier fall. So that to think he will abate, and relax something of the <hi>duty of Church-union,</hi> when that is necessary to keep on the more <hi>important duty, of publick Ministration;</hi> and that he doth not the the People up to such strict care of communicating in the Unity of the Church, as must drop and let fall all communion in Ministerial Offices, when they are not to be had, but at the hands of those who minister in breach thereof: is only to think, that he is ready to make the same equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble allowance, on any competition in these, as he doth on like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions in other duties.</p>
               <p>And that Almighty God is willing to make these abatements on such necessity and competitions, I conceive may sufficiently appear by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Instances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> are all positive duties. But <hi>Circumcision</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> being of more importance, they were to take place of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and whensoever it so fell out, that they could not observe both, men might be excused in breaking the <hi>Sabbath Rest,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Jo. 7. 22, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>to labour in Circumcision,</hi> as they did whensoever the <hi>eighth Day</hi> of the Childs Age, which was appointed for his Circumcision, fell to be on the <hi>Sabbath Day;</hi> or in <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> with the labour whereof, <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 12. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the Priests in the Temple continually prophaned the Sabbath, and were blameless,</hi> as our Lord determines. And God himself declares, <note n="‖" place="margin">Hos. 6. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>I will have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy before Sacrifice:</hi> which imports, according to our <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 9. 13. &amp;c. 12. 7.</note> Lords allegations and applications of it, that Men should drop the duty of Sacrifice to attend the duty of Mercy, when, for the time, they must let one fall, and could not pay both. So, making the necessity of performing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural duties, an excuse for the omission of positive; and the necessity of performing more important duties, an excuse for the omission of less important, when there is a necessity of letting one fall.</p>
               <p>Thus also it was a positive duty, and rule among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the <hi>Priests should kill the Sacrifice,</hi> according to what is said in <note n="*" place="margin">2 Chro. 29. 24.</note> the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 4, 5. The People, who brought it, as it is there order'd, were <hi>to lay their hands upon the head of the Sacrifice.</hi> But <hi>it was left to the Priests to kill it,</hi> as <hi>Josephus</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Antiqu. l. 9. c. 13.</note> relates. Whence the Priests were able to give the number of the Paschal Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices at any Passover, as they did to <note n="*" place="margin">Joseph. de Bello Jud. l. 7. c. 17.</note>

                  <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when, by reason of the great and general defection, which had been in the days of his <hi>Father Ahaz, the Priests, who had sanctified themselves, were too few,</hi> as the Text says, <hi>to slay all the burnt-offerings;</hi> rather than any of the Sacrifices should drop, their <hi>Brethren the Levites</hi> slew them, and


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44279:106"/>
                  <hi>helped the Priests therein till the work was ended, and till the other Priests had</hi> performed their legal Cleansings, or <hi>Sanctified themselves,</hi> 2 Chron. 29. 34. And the same, on a like want of the regular and appropriate Ministers, to have recourse to for this Ministration, was done again, 2 Chron. 30. 17.</p>
               <p>Again, it was a positive Duty and Rule, that the legally unclean, as <hi>Lepers,</hi> or <hi>they who had touched Dead Bodies,</hi> or any persons, either Men or Women, under any accidents or things which their Law judged <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, should not eat of the Pass-over, or other Holy things,</hi> Lev. 15. 31. &amp;c. 22. 4, 5, 6. &amp; <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 6. But yet, rather than lose the <hi>Pass-over,</hi> at a time when there was the greatest Reason for them to partake therein, they were allowed to let fall this legal Rite, and the legally Unclean were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted under <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> When he came to the Throne, his first and chief care, was to set up a Reformation of Religion, which had suffered so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in <hi>Achaz's</hi> Reign. And in pursuit thereof, he calls, not only <hi>Judah,</hi> but also <hi>Israel, to the keeping of his</hi> first <hi>Pass-over, at the House of the Lord at Jerusalem,</hi> which he had <hi>cleansed</hi> and restored from the <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Idols,</hi> to the worship and <hi>service of the true God,</hi> 2 Chron. 30. 1. And when, upon <hi>his Letters,</hi> not only they of <hi>Judah,</hi> but several also of <hi>Israel</hi> were come; that he might not baulk the beginning of the Reformation, nor the People lose the end of their coming, especially they of <hi>Israel,</hi> viz. out of <hi>Ephraim, Manasse, Issachar and Zebulon,</hi> who had never been there before, <note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 26</note> 
                  <hi>since the dayes of Solomon;</hi> they were admitted to eat in their legal Uncleanness without legal Cleansings, rather than go without <hi>the Pass-over,</hi> tho this was <hi>to eat it otherwise than it was written,</hi> 2 Chron. 30. 18, 19. And in so doing, 'tis said <hi>God accepted them,</hi> v. 20.</p>
               <p>The like I may observe of the <hi>Christian Pass-over,</hi> or of our <hi>Holy Eucharist.</hi> This, by a Positive rule among us, or by our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 26 27. 29. Luke 22. 19, 20. 1 Cor. 11. 25.</note>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>In some Persecutions, indeed, raised against the Worshippers of the true God, there were none left to Minister to them.

those <hi>who had fallen, they would reserve,</hi> as <hi>Socrates</hi> observes, <hi>to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> So that what Communion the Catholicks thought it excusable to hold with them, in this Necessity, or want of Ministerial Offices from their own Clergy, was held with men, who plainly Officiated in a state of Schism.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It did the same <hi>in our own great Rebellion, when our Bishops were all driven cut, and Deposed with the King.</hi> For then, the Orthodox and Loyal-Adherents of the King and Bishops, took up with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Parish Churches, and thought, that for the sake of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worship and ministerial offices, they might do so, where they had no Ministers of their own to Communicate with. And yet, what Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies were, not only in a more barefaced and wicked Rebellion, but also in a more Flagrant Schism, than the establish'd and complying Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Assemblies of that time. So that in the Opinion of those our Ancestors, it was a good excuse, for having Divine offices in such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, when they could have better no where else.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Lastly,</hi> this necessity of having some Ministerial offices, <hi>is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought to Legit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mate Communion in those Churches, which have no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi> Thus it is in some <hi>Forreign Protestant Churches,</hi> who have no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, to Head and Unite them; (as our own Churches had not here at home, in the days of the <hi>Great Rebel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion.)</hi> And yet, the people there must Unite with their ministrations, because they must Unite with some. They must have some Divine service and Religion. And if they must have it, they must resort to some who Minister it. And if they can have no Ministration thereof in an Episcopal Communion, they must take up with it from such other as they can have.</p>
               <p>I speak of the case of the People in those Churches; and it is not the <hi>Clergies,</hi> but <hi>their</hi> Liberty, of taking up with Ministerial Offices from the hands of Schismaticks, in want of others, which I am here discoursing of. And in their case, the necessity is full for their excuse. For 'tis plain, they can not have those Ministrations in Episcopal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, unless their Clergy, whom they can resort to for the same, would receive Episcopal Ordination. And since, in the place where their Lot is faln, they can not have Episcopal Communion, they will be excused for wanting it. Though worshipping God, or communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Ministerial Offices, is a natural duty; yet the confining this to the communion of a Bishop, is a positive Limitation. And necessity, though it can discharge no natural duties; yet may sometimes excuse, and supersede positives. So that when they can not communicate in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Offices under Bishops, they will be excused, I hope, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating in the same without them.</p>
               <p>And as to the Clergy, though I will not here discuss, or determine their case, yet is this necessity, where it can be justly, and fully pleaded, thought by many to bid fair, for excusing &amp; warranting them, <hi>in Ministring</hi>


                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:44279:109"/>
                  <hi>without Episcopal Powers.</hi> For at one time, the Priest hood belonged to the <hi>First-born.</hi> At <hi>first</hi> it was lodged in the <hi>Patriarks.</hi> And thus we read of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>he would command</hi> and instruct <hi>his Children, and his House-hold after him,</hi> in the true Religion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 18. And of <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and other <hi>Patriarks offering Sacrifices.</hi> And from the <hi>Patriarks,</hi> it came to be vested in the <hi>First-born,</hi> till the <hi>Levites</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> were appropriated and <hi>given to God in exchange for them, Numb.</hi> 3. 41. And this limiting it afterwards to <hi>one Tribe,</hi> or <hi>Family,</hi> as the <hi>Line of Aaron</hi> among the <hi>Jews;</hi> or to men <hi>Episcopally called and Ordained,</hi> as it is among the <hi>Christians;</hi> were Limitations of positive institution. And therefore necessity, which supersedes, or excuses the want of posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, though it leave them still under the force of Naturals, is thought to bid fair towards taking off the exactness of these latter Restraints, and bearing men out in parting from them in those things where they can not avoid it, so long as they still keep close to them in others, where they can; if they have this necessity, honestly and fairly to plead for themselves.</p>
               <p>Now, if this necessity of Peoples communicating in Ministerial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will excuse their communicating with Ministers who have no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; I see not but it should do the same, in point of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with Ministers, who are broke off from their own Bishop. For surely it is a more flagrant breach of Union, to break off from Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy it self, than from any particular Bishop; and a deeper Schism, to cast off all Bishops, than to cast off one. And therefore that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of communicating in Ministerial Offices, which is allow'd to legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and excuse the one, will not be denyed to legitimate and excuse the other too.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Besides this, of <hi>Gods People having held and practised thus, under the greatest Schisms of former times;</hi> in further confirmation of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, I observe, <hi>Lastly,</hi> how it has done the same, <hi>to give Relief in some other compassionable cases, about communion, which have only like Plea for abatements, as this case has.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For great purposes, (and what will be alleadged greater, than preventing a total want of publick worship and Ministerial Offices?) the Church has abated <hi>in shunning the communion of Schismaticks,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially before they are cut off by judicial Censures; and <hi>of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, in abatement of this <hi>keeping off from their communion,</hi> it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd men <hi>to communicate with them at the beginning,</hi> ere <hi>Schism,</hi> yea, or <hi>Heresie it self is fully formed, and whilst it is capable of being prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> An <hi>Heretick,</hi>

               <p>Thus, on great reason, have some equitable abatements of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the foresaid Rules, for <hi>shunning of Communion with men fall'n into Heresy, or Schism, or other depriving crime,</hi> still been made in the Church, and some reasonable liberties indulged in those cases. It was thought reasonable to recede thus, and to take these Liberties, when put thereto to serve other peoples necessities; must it not needs be to the full as much so, when put thereto to serve our own? It was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to serve the spiritual wants of the offenders: Can it be less so, to serve those of innocent men? So that, as it suits, as I shew'd before, with the reason of things, and with the equitable allowances made by God himself on such Competitions: It suits no less, I conceive, with the Practice of the Church, and with the Concessions and Allowances thereof, to take up with ministerial offices from one in a Schism, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to live without any at all, or when they cannot be had at the Hands of other men.</p>
               <p>Albeit therefore, to avoid the the Guilt of Schism, men are to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, and stand off from the Communion of Anti-Bishops and their Adherents, and not to Participate in their ministrations: Yet is that strictly, I think, on supposal of Room or Opportunity to Participate more Regularly with others. But want of other ministrations, will be an excuse for the faultiness, of seeking them from them; and it will be allow'd, I conceive, to take up therewith from Schismaticks, rather than to live without any ministerial offices at all.</p>
               <p>And thus, under the paucity or small number of the Rightful Bishops and Clergy their adherents, and their insufficiency, as is alledged, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording general opportunities, especially in a Persecuting time, which allows no freedom of open and promiscuous Assemblies: will both a <hi>Due Conviction</hi> and <hi>Conscience of the criminalness of Schism,</hi> and the <hi>Exercise of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ullick Worship and Devotion,</hi> be kept up, and provided for in the Church of Christ. They will preserve a <hi>Conscionable sense of Schism,</hi> by owning the Unlawfulness of Communicating with the Ministrations of Schismaticks, where they can have others, perhaps on all occasions, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for the most part, at least in competent measure, though not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns so constant as they wish they could; yea, and though in these cases, they must be at some pains for these Ministrations, or have them with Peril, or Persecutions. I say, though with <hi>Pains</hi> or <hi>Persecutions.</hi> For, in such DIVISIONS, we must not think it an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing, which Assemblies we resort to for Communion: nor hold our selves Free, to go among those, who are met in the unity of the Church, in the Morning; but to a Schismatical Congregation, in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon.


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44279:110"/>
Nor must any fancy themselves at Liberty, to seek Religious Offices from men ministring in a Schism, when that is necessary to qualifie themselves for some secular office or advantage, or to serve a worldly Turn. Nor when it is necessary to save their pains, or to shun fleshly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, where they might have the same Religious Offices in the Unity of the Church, but with Persecutions. For in the abatements here pleaded for in the present case, from <hi>Necessity,</hi> I speak not of <hi>worldly Necessity,</hi> or of abateing where it is necessary for our worldly interests and convenience, or to prevent outward losses and sufferings. But of <hi>Necessity for Religion,</hi> and <hi>Gods Service;</hi> for our Duty, not for our Carnal ends: Or, of abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the strict observance of this command of <hi>keeping Unity,</hi> where it is necessary to the keeping and discharge of <hi>other of Gods Commandments happening to stand in competition therewith,</hi> which he sets more by. And they will keep up the practice of Devotion, and the publick Ministries and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion, by admitting the necessity of some Ministrations for an excuse; and so taking up with Ministerial Offices from them, when they can not otherwise, though with Persecutions, be supplyed therewith, but must live without any at all.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of Communicating in like Necessity, where there are some Prayers sinful in the Matter of them.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BUT in Communicating with Anti-bishops, and their Adherents, set up to head immoral Prayers and Practices, as is set forth in the fore-mentioned Cases, there is not only the <hi>Schismaticalness</hi> of <hi>the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,</hi> but the <hi>sinful Matter of the Prayers</hi> to be considered. There is a Fault in <hi>what they pay,</hi> which is a corrupt and sinful Worship; as well as in the <hi>Society where they pay it,</hi> which is not in the <hi>Unity of the Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Bond of Peace,</hi> but in <hi>Schismatical Congregations.</hi> And though the Necessity of having some Ministerial Offices, and the want of opportunity for any others, will excuse the <hi>first</hi> faultiness, <hi>viz. The Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticalness of the Assemblies:</hi> What shall such People do to get over the <hi>second, viz.</hi> the <hi>Unrighteous Petitions,</hi> or <hi>sinful Matter of the Prayers,</hi> which are offered up to God therein?</p>
               <p>As to this, to concur and go along in any immoral or unrighteous Petition, or Thanksgiving, is certainly an immoral and unrighteous thing; as <hi>praying,</hi> is most solemnly <hi>taking part</hi> with, and <hi>endeavouring</hi> for them. Nay, to offer up these, in Prayers and Religious Addresses, is a most impudently and horribly prophane thing; it abuses the Great and most Holy God, by making him a Present of the most hateful Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations;


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44279:111"/>
it blasphemes and asperses him, for an immoral and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous God, who can accept a Present of Unrighteousness, who can be pleased, or think himself honoured therewith, or be entreated to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the patron and Maintainer thereof. So that when such Prayers occur in Sacred Offices, or when they have the accessional allotment and furtherance, of set Days, of Fasting, or Thanksgiving; no Man, who would preserve any Reverence for God, or Respect for Religion, or Care of his own Soul, must concur therein: but, instead of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, all true Worshippers of God, and Lovers of Righteousness, as I conceive, most utterly detest and abhor them.</p>
               <p>But in mixt Prayers, where some are holy, and some are sinful, what may be done by those, who would pick and chuse, and joyn with them only in the good, but keep off from the evil?</p>
               <p>Now as to this, the <hi>sinful mixture</hi> may be of <hi>Idolatrous Worship or Prayers.</hi> And not to discuss, whether it may be excuseable in any Cases, to resort to Churches, where there are such Mixtures of idolatrous ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; I think however, these are not on the same Level with others, but that there is a greater bar to all Communion in Worship, by such Mixtures. For <hi>Idolatry,</hi> doth more peculiarly and heinously affect wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. In respect of it, God declares himself a <note n="*" place="margin">Ex. 20. 5. &amp;c. 34. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>jealous God:</hi> and so is less likely to accept of any worship in partnership with Creatures; or, in sacred Offices, to admit of, and go halves with Rivals. And with particular respect to this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> sets out the incompatibleness of <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 14, 15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>communicating,</hi> both with <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Belial;</hi> and the Scripture-precepts, of <note n="†" place="margin">v. 17. &amp; Rev. 18. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>be ye separate, and come out from among them,</hi> do more directly and forceably affect this, than other sins in Religious Assemblies.</p>
               <p>Or the <hi>good parts of the worship,</hi> which are intermixt with the evil, <hi>may not afford them all that is necessary in Christian Worship;</hi> or <hi>not in such a way, as it is necessary they should have it.</hi> And then, there is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar to Communion in such worship, not only from the Mixture of ill Prayers, from which the partakers in other parts would separate; but also from the defectiveness of those good parts thereof, which are to recommend it, because they do not supply the Worshippers with all that is necessary in Christian worship. Thus, instead of <hi>whole,</hi> they may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister <hi>half Sacraments,</hi> sacrilegiously withholding the <hi>Cup</hi> from the People, which Christ has appointed to be received by all the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, as well as the <hi>Bread.</hi> Or, what good Prayers and Oblations they do put up to God, may be all in an <hi>unknown Tongue:</hi> which is not to pray in that way that is necessary for Christians, who are to offer up a <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 4. 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>spiritual worship,</hi> which is to be done by <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor 14, 15, 16</note> 
                  <hi>praying with understanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or the evil parts, which are intermixed with the good, are indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably to be performed together with them, and he, who would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44279:111"/>
in one, must not be allowed to let the other alone. As there can be no <hi>receiving of the Sacrament,</hi> without <hi>worshipping</hi> it, in the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> It imposing a complyance with its Corruptions, as a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to those, who would partake in any sound parts of its Offices.</p>
               <p>And these are such hindrances of Communicateing with that Church in the <hi>Mass,</hi> which are not to be urged in Bar of Communion, under all immoral mixtures of worship and devotions.</p>
               <p>And much less is the allowance of some communion under such immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mixtures, to be extended for a justification of the same communion, in the <hi>Assemblies of Jews,</hi> yea, or even of <hi>Mahometans,</hi> on pretence of joyning, in like manner only with the Good, but standing off from the ill parts of their Offices. For that <hi>Church-Communion,</hi> which, as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in our <hi>Creed</hi> we all profess to believe, and seek, is <hi>the Communion of Saints,</hi> that is, in the language of those times, of <hi>Christians,</hi> not any Church communion of <hi>Professed Unbelievers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But suppose, that in a Christian Church, retaining all the <hi>Essentials of Faith,</hi> or <hi>Articles of the Creed,</hi> all that is necessary in Christian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, is to be had pure, and unspotted; and in a Tongue, which all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand; but some immoral petitions, or Prayers, are intermixt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, which people may be Tolerated to pass over, and to express dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from, whilst they shew Concurrence with all the good Prayers, which come along with them. Are they barr'd from such Communion, by such mixtures?</p>
               <p>As to this, it may depend much upon the degree thereof, according as the evil passages, are <hi>Tolerable</hi> or <hi>Intolerable,</hi> (I mean not to be done, as if any man were to expect a Toleration to do a wicked Action, but to be born,) on the point of <hi>this unlawfulness.</hi> In care of <hi>keeping Union,</hi> much would be bore withall for peace, and in hopes of seeing a cure thereof, whilst more modesty is shewn, in these unrighteous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral petitions. And, in want thereof other ways, for <hi>the benefit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateing in some Ministerial Offices</hi> and publick devotion, men would bear more. If such unlawful and immoral passages, were fewer in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and occurr'd more seldom in the service, to shock and gall good mindes; or, if they are any ways uncertain, and less Peremptory in sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and some way or other accomodable to an innocent and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sense: Good people, though they could not Concur in, would yet more patiently endure them. But they are less to be born, when more express and unavoidable in signification, and more grown in number. So that as any Assemblies multiply these petitions, they increase these difficulties and discouragements to those, who, for the sake of peace; yea, or (on the setting up of a Schism, after which they are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bound to maintain Ecclesiastical Peace and Union with them,) for the benefit of having publick Offices and Ministrations, would fain meet at their publick service.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:44279:112"/>
If once the Minglers of such immoralities in Prayers, shall, to this impediment of <hi>immoral mixtures,</hi> add another, <hi>viz.</hi> Of <hi>breaking the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Church,</hi> especially <hi>by setting up of Anti-Bishops,</hi> and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Elagrant Schism:</hi> There is an end of beaning with these mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>for the sake of peace,</hi> and <hi>for maintenance of Communion with them.</hi> For this peace and Union, is not to be kept with Schismaticks, as I have shewn; the Scriptural and Ecclesiastical Rules, being not to seek, but to shun Communion with such Persons. It is to keep United to those Bishops, who are the Orthodox and Rightful Heads, and to such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on them, and adhere to them; not to such Heterodox Dividers, as break off from them. So that this bearing with the irksomness of such mixtures, for the sake of Union, is a Reason of bearing only <hi>before the Formation of the Schism;</hi> but is never to be urged that way more, but has all its force turned, another way, when once that is done.</p>
               <p>Or, before such Formation of a Schism, the immorality of those petitions may be so express and unavoidable, the iniquity of them so staring and hainous, or the repetitions thereof so numerous, and the use thereof so flxed and setled; that good people neither would, nor ought to bear them, could they have any opportunity of doing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>Indeed, sin and wickedness, especially in any plane, gross, and great instances thereof, if once evidently made the matter of worship, and put up in Prayers, sets people at liberty in any Church, as I have <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 3. Part. 3.</note> shewn, to refuse them, and joyn in others, whose matter is pure and sinless.</p>
               <p>When once therefore corruption gets into the matter of Prayers, and sin makes a part of sacred offices, it gives a liberty for people to withdraw from those Prayers, though administred by their Lawful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors; and, if any Ministers Regularly empower'd will give them the opportunity thereof, to change them for a pure and sinless service. And still, the higher and more open the iniquity of such Prayers or Clauses, and the more numerous the Repetition of them is; the more are they, not only set free, but forced and necessitated to this. And the more answerably, are the Orthodox and Faithful Ministers necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, to afford them opportunities thereof.</p>
               <p>Lovers of Peace, out of an Ardent desire of Union, may forbear a while, so long as those Churches are more modest in their Corruptions, or whilst there may be hopes of cureing them, especially at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of closing the breaches. And this Allowance of forbearance, for a time, in Case of such <hi>Corruption of Worship;</hi> is no more than we see is made in Case of <hi>Heresy,</hi> which is a <hi>Corruption in Faith.</hi> This Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Faith, as well as Corruption of Worship, gives a discharge


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44279:112"/>
of Communion, as I have <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 4. Part. 3.</note> shewn. And yet Communion is not so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged thereby, but that it may be kept on for a time, as I observed it was with the <hi>Arians</hi> in the beginings of that <hi>Heresy:</hi> The Rule being, not to <note n="*" place="margin">Tit. 3. 10.</note>

                     </gap>retick</hi> from Communion whilst he may be thought sanable, or not till he has had a <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second Admonition.</hi> And thus it was judged and practiced, by those <hi>Orthodox at Antioch,</hi> who <hi>kept a meeting for some time</hi> in the <hi>Arian Assemblies</hi> under <hi>Leontius,</hi> after their error and impiety was introduced into their publick Offices and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, and was put up to God in <hi>Derogatory Doxologys.</hi> In which U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Assemblies, these Orthodox were Headed and lead on by <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> and <hi>Diodorus, that admirable Pair of best Men,</hi> as they are styled by <hi>Theodorit</hi> speaking of this business, and <hi>who first brought in the Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy at the end of the Psalms,</hi> which continues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ll to be used at the reading thereof, in our days. But who, whilst they shew'd Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the <hi>Arians</hi> in all the good parts of their Office, thought fit to shew their standing off from them in their Corrupt and Derogatory Doxologys, as oft as they came in the course of the publick service. For when, <note n="*" place="margin">Theod. Hist. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. l. 2. c. 24. Soz. l. 3. c. 20. &amp; Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceph. l. 9. c. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>at the end of the Hymns,</hi> the <hi>Arians Sung, Glory be to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Son,</hi> or, as others, <hi>Glory be to the Father, by the Son, in the Holy Ghost,</hi> aiming by this change of particle, to intimate dissimilitude and inferiority: The Orthodox <hi>Sung, Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,</hi> by that particle of <hi>Conjunction,</hi> making the three Persons all alike in Receipt of this Glory, or expressing their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality.</p>
               <p>But whatever compliances may be made thus for a time; yet, as the sinful mixtures grow more fixed, and the iniquity is more open and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced; when it greatly and evidently pollutes Devotions, and corrupts mens Principles and Practices, and is carryed on by all arts and endeavours to intrap and catch Souls: there is more apparent necessity to stand off from them. And then, they are bound, I conceive, and as I think, I have shewn <note n="*" place="margin">Part. 1.</note>, to afford Gods faithful people, more safe, and salutary, and Christian Administrations: and the People, without any hindrance from the Precepts of Peace and Union, are to break off from the other, and to joyn therein. So that such unlawful matter in Prayers, especially still as it grows more apparent and heinous, and more firmly fixed therein, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to carry people off, notwithstanding their desires of Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from any Assemblies, though they had not added Anti-Bishops to head their unlawful mixtures, or made an open Schism in the Church.</p>
               <p>As to this mixture of immoral Prayers then, with such a service as is wanting in nothing else, but has all that is necessary in worship, if these additions might be let alone: The desire of keeping Peace and Union in Assemblies or Churches, whatever it may do for a while, or in some cases, will not alwayes get over them. And if once the makers of immoral addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44279:113"/>
do moreover set up Anti-Bishops, and make a Schism for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thereof; Unity is no longer in Duty to be kept, but broke with them; so that the desire of Unity, will be no Reason to bear therewith, but to do quite contrary, after that time.</p>
               <p>But there is besides another, and a stronger ground of bearing, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Necessity of having some Ministerial Offices, and Publick Devotion,</hi> when they live under a want of better opportunities, &amp; must take up, either with these or none. And this, as it will excuse the Faultiness of <hi>Meeting with those who are in a Schism:</hi> So, I conceive, <note n="*" place="margin">See Dr <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s Practic. Cat. l. 2. Sect. 1. on the <hi>Beatitude of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
                  </note> will excuse men too, in bearing with these corrupt matters and immoral Additions, whilst they can be allowed suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to signifie, and express their Dissent from them.</p>
               <p>They come then, 'tis true, and, (as the forementioned <hi>Orthodox Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> did <hi>at Antioch,</hi> under the <hi>Derogatoriness of the Arian Doxologies)</hi> for the sake of many Good Prayers, submit to be present at others, whereby they will see Gods Worship prophaned, and hear his sacred Name dishonoured and Libelled, which is, and ought to be, a grievous Mortification to every Pious mind. But they submit to be present at all this, in the way of a <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Duty,</hi> viz. <hi>attending on some Ministerial Offices.</hi> And in want of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, of having those more Pure in any other Places: as was also the case of <hi>those Orthodox at Antioch,</hi> where <note n="*" place="margin">Theod. l. 2. c. 12. Soz. l. 3. c. 20. Niceph. l. 9. c. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Constantius</hi> had <hi>refused to allow them so much as one Church.</hi> And meeting it that way, though they may see and hear it, they are only aggrieved and wounded, but not polluted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. As <hi>Servants,</hi> or any others, are not polluted by hearing Gods Name Blasphemed, or seeing other wickednesses committed, which they are like to meet in the necessary duty and discharge of their attendance or stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: who are not guilty of the evil, that is uttered or acted, especially if they are allowed to shew dislike, and to be Reprovers of it. So that when others are Guilty, by concurring in these immoral Petitions; he contracts no guilt, by being present at them much against his will, and in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and due payment of some publick Devotion, which he has no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of paying any where else, so long as he apparently singles out the Good, and lets all the Bad alone.</p>
               <p>Nor is his <hi>mere presence</hi> at these additional immoral Prayers, an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretative Profession of his concurrence in them.</hi> 'Tis too rigorous, I think, to make coming to any Religious Assemblies, a profession of concurring in every particular, which, in any part of the ministration, is professed, or put up to God there. Men are liable to have various apprehensions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout some passages or other, that may happen to be in the publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whether in the Professions which are made to God, or in the Prayers which are put up to him. And also about some Undertakings, Events, or Transactions of this World, which may be brought, as occasion is, into the common Service and Devotion, though all are not of one mind or belief about them. And under this liableness, to such variety of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44279:113"/>
about these matters, we could never be able to <hi>keep up publick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> especially to keep it up so <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>constant,</hi> and <hi>to keep all persons in one Communion,</hi> as our Lord requires they should be kept, upon these terms. And they are more liable still, to have the same variety of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, about <hi>Private Composures in Pulpit-Prayers;</hi> which may be more Subject to the Tincture, either of some particular opinions, or expressions, which all cannot Assent to, or approve of. Considering which, it would be harder still to keep up such Communion, under the Allowance of these Pulpit-Prayers of Private Composure; which yet, besides what they have been formerly, or are at this time in other places, are now allow'd of by our own Church.</p>
               <p>In publick <hi>Fasts,</hi> indeed, or <hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> where the very Meeting or Assembling is made significant of any purposes; to be present at them, is a profession of what is signified by them. And it is insincere for those, who abhor that Design, which they are appointed to carry on, to afford their presence, or meet at them. But I think it is not so, with any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular passages and petitions, in the ordinary Devotion at other times; and that coming to Church Assemblies at such times, which are for Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at large, is no determinate and limited profession of concurrence in those passages, from which, though a man would profess to dissent, yet might he still resort to the Assemblies for so many other purposes. And of this difference betwixt these <hi>Two,</hi> as to <hi>their being a profession of concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> they who list, may see more in a <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 6. Sect. 1,</note> Book intituled, <hi>Of Christian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, it will give some presumption of concurrence in these Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if they visibly manifest no dislike; but, whatever they are in their Hearts, appear externally to joyn in them, as much as they do in others. And therefore, I conceive, it were not amiss, as they come in the course of the Service, by some external sign, to shew they disclaim, and stand off from them. As I noted the Orthodox did, whilst (in the beginnings, and, as was hoped, more sanable Age of the <hi>Arian Heresie,</hi> before they broke communion quite off) they <hi>met in the Arian Assemblies under Leontius</hi> at <hi>Antioch.</hi> But there is no room, or pretence for such presumption of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, (and they would be strange presumptions, that should be made in contradiction to express Declarations) if we signifie the contrary by some external sign. For none must presume, or we are not answerable for it if they do, that we joyn in such passages, if by some external sign we protest to all that we stand off from them; whilst, by like visible signs, we shew concurrence in all those good Prayers, which are put up together with them.</p>
               <p>I grant, the Communion of Prayers, should be an intire Communion; and no Petitions of publick Assemblies, should be the private desire of some, but the joynt desire of all in common. And where any thing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44279:114"/>
which all cannot joyn in, it makes a broken Communion. But there, the inserters thereof make this breach; and others, who are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Necessity to bear the same, only suffer it as their misfortune. And when they can have no other, which they would embrace, though with persecutions; yea, and it may be are illiterate, and unable by Reading, to carry on the Worship of God, and the work of instruction, in their own Families: It is better, I think, to take up with a broken Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion than with none. And though their wishes are to have one more intire, yet till they can have their wish, I conceive, their way will be to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in most Prayers, rather than in none at all.</p>
               <p>Whilst they are careful then, by some sufficient external sign, to shew their standing off from these additional immoral passages; the necessity of having some ministerial Offices and Devotions, will bear them out, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, when they can have no better, in resorting to such mixt Service, for concurrence in the body of other good Prayers. But all this, as I say, is whilst such visible signification and refusal of the sinful matters, will be allow'd òf. For if all, either in reality must, or in external shew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance must seem to concur therein: They ought not to be guilty, either of Iniquity, or Hypocrisie; and so, upon that account, are utterly barr'd and shut out from such Communion.</p>
               <p>And thus much, as it is greatly needed, so I have adventured to say on this Point, concerning that liberty and allowance, which, in compliance with the love of Peace, and the necessity of some Ministerial Offices, may, as I conceive, be made in <hi>abatement of the strict Rules against Communion with Schismaticks.</hi> I know all the use some are apt to make of such Concessions, is, instead of making them Relieve others, only to turn them against the Authors, and taking hold of them as Principles, to try if thereby they can overthrow the main Cause. I think this is very dis-ingenuous; and a wrong way of Reasoning too. For it is beginning at the wrong end in these matters. These Concessions, are not set up for main Principles, much less as points to be held against them; but as points of favour and ease, that may be thought fairly and equitably consistent with them. Which, should it happen otherwise, the Principles must stand firm, (unless they can be overthrown by Arguments intrinsick, and proper to themselves;) and all that can be said as to these Concessions of Ease, is, that there is an end of them. So, by that course, men do not so much oppose the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Principles, as themselves; and what they show is, that, in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence with Truth of Principles, no Concessions can be made; and that the Truth will not permit them to make such Approaches, or to come so near to them, as they fain would do. But these liberties in the present case, seem to me fairly Reconcileable, on the grounds here given, with the Reason and Reality of things; and with the intent of the foresaid Principles: And every man is left to judge for himself, whether they are or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:44279:114"/>
And thus, I think, it may appear, both how careful we ought to be, in shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Communion of Anti-Bishops, &amp; their Schismatical Adherents, where we have other opportunities: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>w, for the benefit of some Ministerial Offices, we may be at liberty to take up with them, when we can have the same from none else. Yea, for all they happen at any time to have made an addition of immoral mixtures, to a body of otherwise good, and sufficient Prayers, if we openly and sufficiently express our dislike and standing off from them, whilst we as openly concur, and joyn in others. And as it was before shewn, who make the Schism in any Divisions of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and who can cure it in the foresaid Cases: So, having found who are to answer for the Schism, this may suffice to shew what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion may be held with such, and how good Christians are to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it towards both parties.</p>
               <p>As to that exercise of spiritual ministrations then, which Faithful Pastors stand so many ways obliged to, notwithstanding any Deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of State, yea, or of Synods, as I have shewn: The Care of Preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Unity, or preventing Schism in the Church, ought to be no stop thereto in the foresaid Cases. Nay, if to Head their immoral Prayers, Doctrines, and Practices, the defectors shall set up Anti-Bishops, and so make a Schism in the Church: The Conscionable care of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unity, will bind them fast to such Faithful Ministers, who are their Rightful Pastors. And the Conscionable and truly Christian dread of Schism, will make them effectually keep off from the Communion of those defectors, who, by Erection of Anti-Bishops, have set up, Altar against Altar, and Schismatically broke off from them.</p>
               <p>And thus I have gone through those particulars, which I thought sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to be consider'd, and of most force to clear up this Argument. And from what has been offer'd in these papers, I think it will not be difficult for honest inquirers, to see what their duty is, under any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy differences or divisions of Churches, at such times. I pray God neither the desire of Thriving, nor the fear of Suffering, may make men afraid to see it, or to follow what they see they ought to do, when they are tryed with such Cases.</p>
               <p>It extreamly concerns all men, who would shew any serious care of their immortal Souls at such times, to discern the right way, and to take it in these matters. 'Tis not for any to think lightly of these points of difference: For 'tis hard to say what things would concern their Eternal Salvation more, or wherein to go wrong would be of more Fatal Consequence. If any things will lye hard upon us at the great day of accounts, sure the breach of Faith, and of the most So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oaths, of Civil Subjection and Obedience, and of Common Honesty and Justice, will sting and terrify us to the height, and be a burden unsupportable. Such wickednesses will sink Heathens; how much more


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44279:115"/>
Christtans, who Act them against so much plainer Revelations and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual advantages. They are any of them enough to condemn those, who at any time have been guilty of them, unless they truly repent and amend them. How much more must all of them, everlastingly confound those who always live in them, and dayly repeat the same; whose hearts, have resisted all Reproofs, and Convictions; whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, are thereby harden'd therein, and grown callous; and who, not content to provoke God thereby in their dayly practice, have horribly presumed as dayly to prophane him at such times, by a Blasphemous tender thereof in their dayly devotions.</p>
               <p>Nor is it safe, on pretence of any subtleties started about these points, by irreligious and ill employ'd wits on such occasions, to hope for finding an excuse, by pleading mistake or <hi>Ignorance,</hi> should those subtle Salvo's prove False. For whatever it may with some persons, whose sincere care, as well as desire, to see and follow the right, is best known to God himself: Yet in the general, I must reminde them, that 'tis ill trusting to Ignorance, in such plain matters of Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as men cannot ordinarily mistake or be ignorant of, till they have blinded themselves. It needs no skill, nor learning, to fee the wickedness of all these ways. And accordingly, when they are first tryed with them, the consciences of most persons, who can pretend to so briety and justice, and are not debauch'd with Corrupt principles, are startled at them, and in their first judgements, when they judge of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and from Natural Sentimentts and Convictions, they scruple and condemn them. But it needs much learning, or pains, to blind our own eyes, and overcome our Natural Convictions, &amp; see no wickedness in them. And if Men of Parts, should set their Parts and Learning as much to work, (which God avert) to baffle Mens common Convictions of any other Wickednesses and Immoralities; I do believe, they would give the Disobedient as much pretence for Mistake and Ignorance in those Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as, after all their pains, they are able to alledge in these.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Zeal against Popery,</hi> is given out often in these latter days of the World, to go furthest in blinding many. But though <hi>Popery,</hi> on account of the many dangerous Errors and unlawful Practices thereof, is a most dangerous Religion; yet must they be a strange sort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Persons, who can think nothing but Popery will endanger them. Whatever be the Religion, of false, and for sworn Men, of Rebels, Thieyes, and Murderers; their Religion shall do nothing to save them, but Perjury, and Rebellion, and Unrighteousness, will be sure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true Repentance, to condemn them. So that if they are afraid of Popery, because of its sinfulness, and of the dangers it brings upon their precious souls; they must not be less afraid of gross injustice and immoralities, which are not less sinful, and are more surely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive,


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44279:115"/>
than it is, having less <hi>Favor</hi> and <hi>Plea of Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Mistake,</hi> for well-meaning minds to offer for their excuse. And I beg all such, as are in earnest for the Salvation of their Souls, to consider, that it is as wretched a part, both of Folly and Wickedness, to throw away their Souls, in any immoral or otherwise unlawful ways, to keep out Popery; as it would be, to throw them away in turning to it.</p>
               <p>There is also the consideration of Schism in these Matters. And how light soever too many, God knows, may make of it, yet, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of God, it is full of Guilt; and in the lamentable experience of the World, it is fruitful in other Wickednesses, and abounds in Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. It rends Unity, which Christ, among his last Requests to his Father, was so earnestly concerned to have kept up in his Church. It breaks Peace, and, like a Canker, eats out the heart of Charity, which ought to be the very Badge of his Disciples. It turns Devotion, into Contentiousness; and Humility and the Love of our Brethren, into Pride and Self-pleasing, and a studiousness by all ways to maintain what we have once done ill, and bear up our own Reputation; into bitter Zeal, and angry Passions, and a deplorable train of other Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesses. And therefore if all the Guilt of Schism supervenes, to that of the foresaid immoralities in any Case, how broad is the Net spread there for destruction? How many there, are like to be drawn into the snare, and how loud will the Blood of those Souls cry, who are caught therein?</p>
               <p>Methinks, this must needs be enough, to shew Men the infiaite Weight and Consequence of these Debates, and to cure all indifference, and unconcernedness about them, on such occasions. If they are careless what becomes of their Souls, and care only or chiefly for worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests; all these things, indeed, will easily be slighted and over-look'd, when they oppose the Clamours of Flesh and Blood. But Men, who would pretend Religion, or secure their Eternal Happiness in the world to come, must needs see how deeply, and closely these Matters affect it, and how infinitely it concerns them, not to go wrong, or to be mistaken therein. And 'tis only to Men so disposed, that Discourses of this Nature are like to do any good. To such therefore this is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with a sincere and charitable intent, of ministring to give them right Notions and Apprehensions of these Matters, and of serving them in the way of their everlasting Concerns. I humbly request of them, for their own sakes, that they would faily resolve to set up God, and not this World, in these Matters. And if they will seek Truth sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and consider and examine what they read impertially; then let them judge of all, and apply what is here said, for the determination of their own minds, and for making such Judgment of Practices on such unhappy Differences, as they see Cause.</p>
