            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O sinne, the verie

            <p>I was wounded &amp;
I felte it not: I was
wounded to death,

I was bound, I was

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:27773:6"/>
For I was beside my

Christ, my fainting

            <p>Ah these my sinnes,
how do they distres?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27773:7"/>
how do they distract
me? they desire to be
seene, that they may
bee healed; but they
shunne to be shewn,

detested: they are not
healed without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and they are
not heard without

be cured, and if they
be opened they must

when all my actions,
words and thoughts,
euen those which I
most esteemed, either

            <p>Alasse wretch,
what shall I doe? if I
speake, my sinnes
stand vp against me:
&amp; if I hold my peace,
I find no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

howle out and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:27773:13"/>
lament beecause of
these heauy horrours
which thine offences
prepare daily to heap
vpon thee: thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as vnable to repel
the one, as either to
represse, or repente
the other.</p>
            <p>And yet now thou
doest see these euils,
see also if thou canst
shunne them; let no
paynes bee too great,
no petitions either to

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27773:14"/>
to make prouision a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste

trample vnder foote
the vanities of this

as <hi>Paul</hi> did the viper

cause thee to shake.
Runne, O runne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy onely refuge
Iesus Christ thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
become (as
it doth become thee)
an humble suppliant,
in the lowest degree
both of sorrow and

and gesture,
vnfained messengers
of thy distressed
mind; let thy words
bee seasoned with
sighes, and bathed in
tears, &amp; so addresse
thy suite vnto him.
Although it bee late,
it is not yet too late to
call for his mercie: &amp;
wherefore shouldest
thou be consumed in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:27773:15"/>
saying nothing? As
it is impossible hee

            <p>O Christ, O sonne

where is this loue?
where are these mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?

O Lord my life, It

            <p>Alas, how shall I

how shall my fearfull

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:27773:33"/>
how terriblie will he

Alas mine eies

            <p>O good God,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:27773:36"/>
what do I behold in

horrour; fierie
chaines, flaming

and lamenting,
woe and alas; with a

(in a maner) their

            <p>Here euerie part of
the condemned pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner

punishment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

ioies that are lost; the
apprehension, with
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:27773:37"/>
paynes that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
and (aboue all,)
the conscience is gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

which once

ceasing to rubbe

how base were the

what warninge was

how foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

            <p>Further, the sight

diuells, the hearing
with horrible and

feeling with sharpnes
of fire.</p>
            <p>A fire, which as

nothing that it doeth
burne: a fire, which
hath no light to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,

            <p>And besides these

paines, according to
the difference of his

sinnes, either in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,

shallbe so grieuous,

is impossible for any

And yet shall

            <p>O intollerable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
which no

no patience can
endure, no time shal
end: Is this (O Lord)
the wages of sinne? is
this the punishment
of wicked doers, of
whome I am one, in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:27773:41"/>
so deepe a degree?
and is it meruaile
then if my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science
quake? if my soule

and if my eyes bee

            <p>But where am I,
and whether am I
carried? whether do
you driue me, O my
sinnes? whether, O
God, doest thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
mee? If my sins
haue made mee that
I am thy offender,
haue they also made
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:27773:41"/>
me that I am not thy

hath bereaued
mee of my puritie,
hath hee also beerea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
thee of thy pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
If thy iustice
may rightly damne
me, cannot thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
possiblye saue
mee? and if I haue
deserued the one,
haue I thereby also
disclaymed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            <p>O mercifull Lord,
do not so looke vpon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:27773:42"/>
mee, that thou see
not thy selfe: regard

that thou bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

not so the sinnes
that I haue doone,
that thou forget the
substaunce which
thou hast made.</p>
            <p>What (O Lord)
is the sence of thys
saying? <hi>I will not the
death of a sinner, but</hi> I
<hi>desire that hee bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted

I <hi>will not the death of a

if thou drownest it

is this I <hi>desire that hee

            </p>
            <p>O gracious God,
whose word is a will,
and whose will is a
power, who doest
promise nothing but
that which thou dost
purpose, and who
dost purpose nothing
but that which thou

suffer me I pray thee,

towardes vs.</p>
            <p>Lord, if thou wilt
not the death of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
what necessitye
is there that I should
bee damned? If thou
desirest that a sinner
should be conuerted
and liue, what diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:27773:43"/>
is there that I
should not be saued?
can the power and
malice of the Deuill?
can the number, can
the enormitie of my
offences, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
that which
thou wouldest not,
or hinder that which
thou desirest?</p>
            <p>No, no, my God,
the deuils tremble at
thy mightie maiesty:
and if the sinnes of
the whole worlde
were ballaunced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:27773:44"/>
the least of thy

            <p>Haue mercy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>Notwithstandinge

When I sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

I was content, I was

I did not regard thee,

whilest I busied in

very greate and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

            <p>But as one that is

            <p>Alas how deepely
hath corruption tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my soule? what

his feate in my mind,

noe man not banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>O my God, what

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:27773:60"/>
how shall I eyther

of the flesh? <hi>the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
gaue it me, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente
deceined mee?</hi>
Tush, all these are
baites for babes; but
I was come to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
staiednesse, both
age, &amp; in experience;
I was warned, I was
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:27773:60"/>
weapened; I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
I was encouraged; I shoulde
haue vsed more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines
to suspect, more
wisdom to discerne,
more valure, both to
defend my selfe, and
defeat mine enemie.</p>
            <p>Noe sure, I will
neuer excuse him
whome his owne
conscience condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:
I had thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
word and will
to stop me; my owne
knowledge to bridle
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:27773:61"/>
mee; I would haue
disalowed those
thinges that I did, if
any other had done
them but my selfe.
When a mans me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie

his debt, when his
thoughts are willing
wytnesses agaynste
him, when his feare is
his goaler, when his

when his owne

credite, and

            <p>I, I, it is euen I
that haue broken co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
with thee; I
haue abused my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
rather why to do
amisse, then howe to
amend; I haue falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my faith; I haue
riotously runne after
the vaine conceits or

whose kindest cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies
are the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:27773:62"/>
of mischeife;
which like a be-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

to kill.</p>
            <p>I haue receiued
manye freshe
woundes, I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
all my oulde
soares, and what
thou (O Lorde) by

healed, I by my

open; in soe much
as sinne vsed agayne,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:27773:62"/>
hath made the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
once granted
to bee of none effect.
I may well say with

but either name or
number my sinnes
I cannot.</p>
            <p>O bottomlesse sea
of miserie and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
wherin I haue
plunged my selfe,
allwaies sinckinge, &amp;
yet by the infinitnesse
thereof neuer at the

            <p>Oh my soule, full
of wretchednesse, ful

of guiltines, accept
no obiect but of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe;
drawe greede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into thy minde all
conceites that maye
increase thy griefe:
bee ashamed, nay ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:27773:63"/>
to think of any
comforte. Loath thy
selfe, torment thy
selfe, and soe shall
thou doe some thing
well; for thou canst
neither loath nor tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a more cursed
creature.</p>
            <p>Alas, howe is my
soule abandoned?
how are all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
thereof layd wast?
comforte is no more
ease vnto me, then is
the handlinge of sore
woundes. I am deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:27773:64"/>
in my selfe, how
can I stand? I am
ouerthrowne in my
selfe, how shall I rise?
my desire is payned
because it cannot
hope, and if it hath
any sparke of hope, it
is rather in change
then riddance of
griefe.</p>
            <p>Forlorne wretch
that I am, it had bin
better for mee neuer
to haue bin conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to grace, then
thus peruersly to bee
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:27773:64"/>
diuerted from the
same; for then I
should haue gon on
in a sober securitie,
and my punishment
should haue bin soe
much the lesse, as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
is beneath
contempt: but nowe
I am not onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie,
but vnhappy

            <p>O foolish reason,
how sharpe art thou
to see thy mischiefe,
and yet how dimme,
how blinde art thou
to foresee it? O poore
remnant of pierie;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:27773:65"/>
onely soe much
goodnes left, as to
make me languish in
my owne euell.</p>
            <p>O sinne, the onlye
fall of my iudgment
and staine of my
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, now thou
hast sacked my soule,
now thou hast bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it downe vnder
thy tiranny, rest thy
selfe, forbeare a
while, treade not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my ruins, set not
fire to thine owne
spoiles. And yet not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:27773:66"/>
so; but do thy worst,
cruell and cursed
sinne, do euen the
verie worst that thou
canst: the more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
thou execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
vppon mee, the
more shall I both
loath and lament the

done thee; the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
shall I seeke to
drawe my desires
out of the mire of
thy subiection.</p>
            <p>There is yet left,
both time to repent,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:27773:66"/>
and occasion to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend;
yet doeth
Christ, not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
but inuite to his

see nor sorrowe
for my sinnes, did
not he both enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
my vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and soften my
sences. Hee hath
not enlightened my
vnderstandinge to
drowne it in darknes;
he hath not softned
my sences because
he could not breake
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:27773:67"/>
them; and why then
hath hee thus wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the one, and
weakened the other.</p>
            <p>It is euen soe: hee
that hath hetherto
in patience expected
mee, doeth now in

then (Lord) speake
vnto thy seruant;
thunder into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
eare of my harte;
breake my deafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
that I may heare
thy voice. Lorde,
thou lookest for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:27773:67"/>
mine amendmente
that I may haue thy
fauour; and I looke
for thy fauour that I
may amende.</p>
            <p>Woe is mee, how
longe haue I staied?
Alas how late doe I
come? how slowlye
doe I hasten? howe
doeth my resolution
stick betweene loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and necessitie?
woe is me wretch,
how cunningly doth
the deuell seeke to
delay mee? what arte
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:27773:68"/>
hath he vsed to keepe
the line from brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
wherat the fish
was caught? not
drawing him violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but letting him
play vpon the hooke
which hee soe gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely
had swallowed.</p>
            <p>O my God, the
sunne of my life hath
passed his Meridian,
and I am now in the
after noone of my
age; the night of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will come fast
vpon mee, when
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:27773:68"/>
death (as Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant)
will arrest, my
bodie vpon debt to
nature her selfe, my
soule vpon trespasse
committed against
God. The one hee
will binde hand and
foote, and committe
close prisoner to the
graue: the other he
will arraigne in the
high court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
where God
shall bee both partie
and iudge, to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
to all obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:27773:69"/>
as well of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
as of contempt.</p>
            <p>At this houre of
death, when the sinn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
soule beginneth
to bee loosed from
the fetters of flesh, O
good God, howe is
it troubled? what ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
are presented
vnto it? Then begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
it to throwe the
thoughtes freely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
euery corner of
the conscience; to
see the sinnes which
it hath done; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:27773:69"/>
the vengeance
that it hath deserued;
to consider, that the
time of repentance is
then at an end, and
that it is set vpon the
immoueable pointe
of passage to a most
stricte triall, vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
howe the best
actions that it hath
done shall bee exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>It is desirous to stay,
it is compelled to
goe: and as it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
happeneth, that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:27773:70"/>
whilest one thinketh
too much of dooing,
he leaueth to doe the
effect of his thinking;
soe whilest it lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the losse of all
the time that is past,
it looseth that little
which then remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
            <p>Looking backe,
it esteemeth the
whole race which
it hath runne, as a
short steppe; looking
forward, it behould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the infinite space
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:27773:70"/>
of eternytie wherin it
hath to continue; lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp the minde to
heauen, it discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
a most bright &amp;
beautifull glorie; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
castinge it
downe vpon the
earth, it seeth all
thinges enfoulded in
a mistie darknesse.
Heereupon, a new
swarme of thoughts
stingeth the minde;
It lamenteth, that it
was soe chained with
the enchauntmentes
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:27773:71"/>
of a momentanie es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
as scarce to
thinke vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
which neuer
shall haue end; that to
satisfie the flesh,
which is to be a nest
of wormes, it hath
neglected the spirite,
which was to haue
bin a companion of
Angells; that it hath
lost, for soe short a
shewe, the eternall
substance of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
that it hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed,
the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:27773:71"/>
of immortall
glorie for the trash of
floating vanitie.</p>
            <p>O, if it had but a smal
time more of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how seriously
would it conuerte?
what a sharpe and
seuere course would
it set into? but it is like
vnto a horse, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to runne, &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
spurred, but
soe short reined that
hee cannot stirre: or
like vnto those who
in their dreames are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:27773:72"/>
taken with some fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vision, which
sweate with payne,
and striue to crie for
helpe, but cannot
finde any strength to
crie.</p>
            <p>In the meane
time, the head shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
the back aketh,
the hart panteth, the

stringes crack; the

eyes wex dimme, the
nose sharpe, the
browes harde, the
cheekes colde and
wanne, the lippes
pale, the handes
numme, the iointes
stiffe; the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
is in a colde
sweat, the strength
fainting, the life va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and death
drawing on. Neither
will the children and
friendes (for whose
sake the sick shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thinke them
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:27773:73"/>
selues damned) for
beare in this instant
of extremitie; but
continually like flesh
flies they will offer
molestation.</p>
            <p>Whilst these sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners
of death doe
execute their office,
all the wicked acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wordes and
thoughts are broght
into presence; they
are heaped together,
and aggrauated to
the vttermost; they
giue the conscience
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:27773:73"/>
many a colde pull,
and lie vpon the hart
as heavie as leade.
Faine would the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
turne away his
eye, but hee shall bee
compelled to behold
them; they will all
crie vnto him; wee
are thy workes, wee
will goe with thee.</p>
            <p>Then shall the
conscience sharplye
accuse, the memory
giue bitter euidence,
reason shall sit as
iudge, feare shall
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:27773:74"/>
stand as executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and scarce is
there any seuere sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in all the bible
against sinne, which
the deuell will not
bring into minde,
vrging euery poynt
and amplifying it by
construction. Then
will resolution bee
turned to trembling,
pride into basenesse,
confidence into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire.
Then will bee
a greate difference
in iudgment from
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:27773:74"/>
that which men
beare commonly in
this worlde, in soe
much as the sinner
shall be forced to cry
and confesse; <hi>we sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
men thought their
life to be but madnesse,
whose end wee now es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme
most honourable:
but wee haue wearied
our selues in craggye
waies, wee are worne
out in pursuing vanity,
and the waies of the
Lorde wee haue not
knowne.</hi>

Neuer did tirant
exercise his rage
with greatet cruelty,
vpon anye that hee
most hated, then the
miserable sinner shall
then vpon him selfe;
in iustly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge,
in vainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging,
in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably
lamenting
the errours of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
whilest the
paines of parting
shall drawe the
powers of the minde
from true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:27773:75"/>
All vaine
pleasures are then at
an end, and as quite
forgotten as if they
had neuer bin at all.
Yea, euery wicked
delighte shall geue
sharp twitches to the
soule; especially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it considereth, that it
is to endure the smart
for manye thinges,
wherof it must leaue
the plesure to others.</p>
            <p>Somtimes the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
more able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:27773:76"/>
feare of death, wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to bee dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
from beeinge
guided by soe euell
a soule; not in full
hope that his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
shall thereby
either end or abate;
but according to the
nature of greife, the
present being most
painfull, hee desireth
to chang, and to put
in aduenture the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing.
But when
he doth perceiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
legions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:27773:76"/>
prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
him, and the

for his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then is hee in
a maze of amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
then like one
that houldeth a

bitten whilest hee

when hee lett goe.</p>
            <p>Well then, (se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and sencelesse

the deuell woulde
beare thee in hande,

course of nature;
and may bee euerye
houre, by many vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

of violence and of

is onely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

and God would haue

            <p>Awake therfore,
and watch ouer thy

that sitteth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whose name is
Death; prouide that
thou be not sodaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
surprised, and die
before thou beginne
to liue. Loose not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:27773:78"/>
the offer of occasion,
whilest it may not

offereth, yea sueth
to bee taken; and if

            <p>Christ yet distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth
the treasures
of hys mercye, the

bee suiters for the

nowe as apte to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue,
as hys power
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:27773:78"/>
will be able hereafter
to punish. The kings
of Israell were not so
famous for heir mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy

of <hi>Abinadab,</hi>
as the God is among

when thou didst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
he did expect;
when thou shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
he will e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brace.
The bowelles of his

            <p>Present thy selfe

            <p>O Christ, the

            <p>O infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

I beeseech thee, to
cast off the blinde
burthen of fleshlye
affections; subdue
my reason, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

            <p>Gracious God, I
haue noe goodnesse
in my selfe, but onely
to finde that I haue
no goodnesse like
a scholler, who is

of knowledge,
to knowe him selfe
vtterly ignorante:
but suffer (I beseech
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:27773:84"/>
thee) some beutifull
beame of thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
to shine into
my soule, disperse
the cloudes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
my conscience
is ouercast, melt
the mistie darknesse
which couereth my
vnderstanding. O
thou who saydest
<hi>let there be light,</hi> and
light was made;
speake the worde and
my soule shall bee

            <p>O surpassinge

not bee able to see
any thing but thee;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:27773:85"/>
possesse all my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

            <p>O Lord of life, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I am a sinner,
yet I am thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
beecause thou
hast made mee, yea
and made me againe;
both by redeeming,
and by often renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:27773:85"/>
mee: helpe mee
therefore whome
of thy goodnesse
thou hast fashioned,
let mee not perish
in my miserie whom
of thy mercie thou
hast redeemed, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
mee heerafter
whome hetherto
thou hast preserued;
despise not (O Lord)
the worke of thine

wherfore hast thou
created mee? bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou wouldest

damne mee? It had
bin better for mee
neuer to haue bin
made, then to bee
confounded in my

Listen (O Lord) to

and my

not, for thy sake, I
beeseech thee.</p>
            <p>And although

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:27773:86"/>
this thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that thou
mayest iustly refuse

wherein thou art
more wonderfull
then in all thy

O Lord my God,
at whose presence

bee not angrye with

is not his life
miserie, and a verye

O thou who grantest
truce of life, there
are but twoe pleas

            <p>Lorde, my whole

Deliuer mee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the

cutt away occsions

guide mee vnto

            <p>Giue mee grace,
O gracious God,
that although I haue

from henceforth I

rest in thy peace, rise

woordes, knowinge
how weake they are
for soe weightie an
office. without thy
presence it can neuer
attaine to any degree
of thy praise: let it
therefore haue thee
(O Lorde) that it
may in some measure
praise thee.</p>
            <p>For what worthy
praise can I giue vnto
thee, by whose
goodnes I was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by whole mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
I was redeemed,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:27773:102"/>
by whose power I
am preserued, and by
whose grace I looke
to bee glorified?
when I was not,
thou diddest make
mee; when I was
lost and forlorne,
thou camest downe,
and tookest mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
vpon thee to
redeeme mee: thou
a King, diddest hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thy selfe to exalt
mee; thou wert sould
to redeem mee; thou
wert wounded to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:27773:103"/>
heale mee; and thou
diddest dye to saue
mee.</p>
            <p>O sonne of God,
how hast thou abased
thy selfe? how were
thy affections infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?
how large were
the limits of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie?
Lorde, thou hast
loued mee more
then thy selfe, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
for my sake
thou wouldest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
not onely a
contemptible life,
but both a shamefull
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:27773:103"/>
and painfull death.</p>
            <p>And yet did not
thy loue in this sorte
leaue mee, but thou
hast continuallye soe
followed mee with
thy fauours, as
though thou haddest
regarded mee alone,
and neglected all thy
other creatures.</p>
            <p>When I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thou diddest
seeke mee, when I

diddest instruct mee,
when I offended
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:27773:104"/>
thou diddest correct
mee, when I sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thou diddest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte
mee, when I
stumbled thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
stay mee, when
I fell thou diddest
raise mee, when I
stoode thou diddest
strengthen mee; in
my affaires thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
direct mee, in
my troubles thou
diddest helpe mee,
in my dangers thou
diddest deliuer mee;
waking thou diddest
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:27773:104"/>
inlighten mee, slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
thou diddest
watch mee, sinninge
thou diddest suffer
mee, and prayinge
thou diddest heare
mee. Further, thou
hast annointed mee
with thy holy spirit,
and giuen mee a
minde to follow
thee; thou hast called
mee by thine owne
name, and thou hast
sealed mee with thy
bloude vnto eternall
life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:27773:105"/>
These and manye
other benefites haue
I receiued, some in
hand, and some in
hope; although
through my owne
sinnefull demeanor, I
haue almost both let
go my hold, and lost
my hope. But
what? if by my owne
fault I haue lost these
graces, shall I bee
vnthankefull to him,
by whose fauoure
once I had them.</p>
            <p>Lorde, I can
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:27773:105"/>
yealde noe reason
wherefore I had
them but that thou
wert mercifull; ney<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
can I say any thinge
nowe I haue soe
neere lost them, but
that thou art iust:
&amp; therefore I thanke
thee beecause thou
diddest giue mee
them, I am sorie bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I haue noe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
kept them, and
I pray thee that thou
wouldest againe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
restore them. For
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:27773:106"/>
I assure my selfe,
that thy goodnes is
as willinge to restore
as it was to giue; and
that my weakensse is
as able to recouer as
it was to receiue.</p>
            <p>Therefore, O
Lorde Iesus, by thy
precious teares, by
thy blessed bloude
which thou diddest
shedd for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
by the a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boundance
of thy
mercies I most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beeseech thee,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:27773:106"/>
saue thy seruant, saue
one of thy members,
though poore and
feeble; saue, I saye, a
part of thy selfe. Be
as greate in pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
those that are
submitted vnto thee,
as in punishing those
that are rebellious:
poure vpon my heart
the sweete streames
of thy mercies; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
my life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
my faith, settle
mee in a right and
vpright course, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:27773:107"/>
contynue mee in
the same euen vnto
the end.</p>
            <p>The worlde (O
Lorde) is wrapped
in darkenesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is made subiect,
both to the pollicies
and power of our
most dangerous and
deadly enemy: who
beeing the prince of
darkenes, is thereby
become alsoe the
prince of the worlde:
but by thy light his
malice is discouered,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:27773:107"/>
by thy wisdome his
deceites are auoided,
and by thy strength
his power is repelled.
Hee hath manye and
verye greate thinges
(I confesse) to laye
vnto my charge, but
for thy names sake
(O Lorde) rebuke
him, and deliuer me.
Drawe my desires
aboue the pitch of
his darkenesse, raise
my soule out of this
myrie lake of misery,
which affoordeth
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:27773:108"/>
nothing, but eyther
daungers or discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentmentes;
that this
filthy lumpe of flesh
onely may abide
on earth, but my
thoughtes may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
attend vpon
thee.</p>
            <p>O sweete Iesus,
the way of health,
the gate of life, the
pallace of pietie, of
ioy, of safetie; I doe
too much depresse
thy benefites whilest
I labour to expresse
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:27773:108"/>
them: for they haue
not onely filled,
but ouerflowed the
frame of the worlde.
But, O thou who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fealest
the silence of
the dumbe, vntie my
tongue, that I may
declare thy goodnes,
and giue my voice a
power to praise thee
for the same.</p>
            <p>By thee (O Lord)
the exile is reduced,
the captiue redemed,
the sinner is iustified,
the sicke are healed,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:27773:109"/>
the dead are raised,
and the damned are
saued. By thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
wee are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by thy power
wee are preserued,
by thy mercye wee
are saued. Thou
diddest create vs
without any neede,
thou doest gouerne
vs without any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
thou mayest
destroie vs without
any losse. Thou hast
giuen all thinges vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heauen for our
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:27773:109"/>
vse, either necessarye
or conuenient; and
yet diddest thou not
thinke that enough,
but thou hast allsoe
appointed thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
to attend vpon
vs, to stande aboute
vs, to watch ouer vs,
to bee messengers
for our seruice bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
thee and vs.</p>
            <p>And not onelye
mankinde hast thou
exceedinglye both
honoured and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singes,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:27773:110"/>
but the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
the starres, the
earth, the aire, the
seas, the floudes, the
day, the night, and
whatsoeuer else thou
hast ordained, either
for the necessitie or
delight of man, are
by thee renued, and
restored to the end
for which they were
created. For all
thinges were made
for the seruice of
man, and man for
the seruice of God:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:27773:110"/>
but once they serued
those who serued i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doles,
and then they
were without anie
dignitie, then in a
verie kinde of death,
being diuerted from
the right vse of their
creation. But now
they are exalted, now
reuiued, now they
reioice to serue
those, who serue and
worship thee, O
Lorde.</p>
            <p>But why doe I
confine thy benefites
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:27773:111"/>
within the compasse
of the whole worlde?
They haue prepared
downe into hell;
they haue alsoe sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
aboue the
heauens. Thou hast
subdued the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Sathan;
thou hast broken the
chaines of darkenesse
and death; thou hast
loosed the captiuitie
of hell. By thee alsoe
the angells expect a
restitution of the
breach which was
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:27773:111"/>
made amongst them,
by reuolt of those
which fell.</p>
            <p>O singular grace,
O admirable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
whereby man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
is saued; the
elementes are renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hell is van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished;
and heauen
is repaired. O beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
O bountifull
Iesu, thou hast bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
al creatures, &amp; all
creatures againe doe
blesse &amp; praise thee:
by thy holinesse they
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:27773:112"/>
are blessed, by thy
happinesse they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice,
by thy fullnesse
they flourish.</p>
            <p>O holy, O happie,
O high Iesu, how is
my dull sight dazel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with thy excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
brightnesse? My

to attaine vnto thee,
but whether, I pray
thee, doest thou flie
the pursuite of my

exceedest thou the
compasse of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite?
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:27773:112"/>
Tarry O Lord,
tarrie a while for my
feeble feete, which
straine to followe
thee: hide not thy
selfe from my dim
eies, which seeke to
see thee: haue pittie
vppon my weake
soule, which wearily
panteth after the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of thy saluation.
Reach forth thine

mee Lorde, lighten

put the finger of my

faith into thy

looke a little how

            <p>Oh wonder of
wisdome, O miracle
of mercie: God
made all thinges,
and God was made
man: God made all-thinges

and without man all-thinges

made all thinges of

would not restore

by whom all thinges

with out whome

Shall I speake with

            <p>The Sonne of

then doe his worst to
dismay mee; let my
foolish feare murmur
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:27773:116"/>
as much as it will;
let them both vrge
theyre abiect ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections,
and saye;
who art thou? howe
greate are thy sinnes?
and where (in
Gods name) are thy
demerites? I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
I knowe what
I am my felfe; and I
knowe who hee is
vnto whome I trust
Hee hath giuen mee
his gracious worde,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:27773:117"/>
who is both in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
true and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in performance;
hee will doe what he
can for my safetie,
and can doe whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
hee will. When
I call to my conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
both bent of his
loue, and treasure of
his mercie, then may
I plainly both see and
say, as the seruant of
the prophette did
when his eies were
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:27773:117"/>
opened: <hi>they are
more that stande for
vs, then they who are
against vs. 2. Reg.</hi> 6. 15.
The multitude of
my sinnes shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
choake his loue;
I can want noe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
soe longe as hee
doeth want noe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
If his loue bee
greate, my sinnes are
but small; and if
greate bee his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
greate likewise
shall bee my merites.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:27773:118"/>
He hath registred
mee on his backe; he
hath engrauen me in
his handes, hee hath
sealed me on his side;
the whippes, the
nailes, the speare
haue surely signed
his loue vnto mee:
they proclaime his
mercie to bee
claimed of all men;
they crie comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
vnto mee, that I
neede not feare.</p>
            <p>Hee hath displai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:27773:118"/>
his blessed bodie
abroade vpon the
crosse, his armes
spreade to imbrace
mee, his heade bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
downe to kisse
mee, his hearte laide
open to loue mee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Into those armes of
my Sauiour will I
runne, beetweene
these armes will I
rest, beetweene these
armes will I reioice. I
will sprinckle my
heart with the bloud
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:27773:119"/>
of this lambe, and
the destroyer shall
haue noe power to
hurte.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My sinnes greater
then can bee forgiuen?</hi>
Thou liest, <hi>Caine;</hi>
our sinnes can stande
in noe degree of
comparison with the
mercies of God; but
soe farre as God is
greater then man,
soe much doeth the
goodnesse of the one
exceede the euell of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:27773:119"/>
the other. As the
nature of God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and vnmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
soe cannot his
loue bee limitted, soe
is there noe measure
of his mercie; as the
nature, soe the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God is
knowne only to him
selfe.</p>
            <p>The sonne of God
hath taken our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
vpon him, hee
hath exalted it aboue
the heauens, he hath
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:27773:120"/>
seated it in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and glorie of
his father: In him I
haue a portion of
flesh aud bloud, in
him a parte of my
selfe euen now doth
reigne, in him a part
of my selfe is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
glorified: and as
I doe nothing doubt
of this his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with mee in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
soe will I not
distrust of my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation,
both heere
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:27773:120"/>
of his grace, and
heereafter of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
for although I
am sinnefull, yet is
not hee soe vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
that either hee
can forgette, or will
forsake his owne me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>Hee that dispai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
or distrusteth his
owne safetie, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
Christes mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hee denieth his
loue, hee denieth
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:27773:121"/>
his truth, hee deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his power; the
loue of his passion,
the truth of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and the power
of his ascention.
Therefore, the more
willinge hee was to
suffer, and the more
able hee is to saue,
the lesse cause haue I
to feare; for when all
thinges shall faile, he
will most constantly
keepe his faith.</p>
            <p>O wonderfull
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:27773:121"/>
misterie, O excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

bee loued: wee were
not worthye to bee

but must bee ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at such bowelles
of mercie? who but
will reioice at such
aboundance of loue?
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:27773:122"/>
which when I call
to my consideration,
the burthen of my
flesh doeth not so
presse me, the weight
of my mortalitie and

were wont.</p>
            <p>Gracious Lorde,
what thankes, what

to thee for this adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
where shall I

from thy meere
goodnesse, reacheth
beyond all boundes,
both of vtterance
and vnderstandinge:
thy praise, Oh Lord;

and then wee doe

when wee knowe

            <p>O Lorde Iesus, I

doe giue thee most

something my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

to settle my minde to

            <p>O amiable, O ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable

Iesu, let mee

for hee loueth
thee too little, that

            <p>O that my hearte

I bee not worthy soe

Therefore (O louing

            <p>It is verie much

            <p>O Lord our God,
O gracious, O all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
