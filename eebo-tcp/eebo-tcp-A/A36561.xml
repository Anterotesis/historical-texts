            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Author of theſe following papers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lately pay'd his debt to Nature, I thought it great pitty that they ſhould die, and be buryed with him, ſince I am inform'd, by ſome of Learning and judgment, they may be uſeful to the publick, and this is the only aim (and not any popular applauſe) that produceth this
<pb facs="tcp:51977:5"/>
publication; for though many worthy and ingenious perſons have written more largely already on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, yet none (I preſume) hath ſay'd ſo much, in ſo little a Treatiſe, and what he directs, is by his own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which I take to be the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structer. Yet it was not his ſtudy (who was by profeſſion a Divine) but his Recreation, an inoffenſive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light hee took in Planting; neither do I think this ſtudy ſo ill becoming that Function, when <hi>Solomon,</hi> that great King, and princely Divine, wrote of Trees, and Plants, from the Cedar in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> to the Hyſop that ſpringeth out of the wall; that is, from the higheſt and talleſt Tree,
<pb facs="tcp:51977:5"/>
to the ſmalleſt ſhrub, and loweſt herb. I may truly ſay, this our Author knew moſt Herbs and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in this Nation, yet I do not find he wrote any thing of them; but I would not have thee think that this Knowledge was his Maſter-peice, who had a Competency in all Arts and Sciences, ſufficient to compleat a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. He was my Brother, and I am affraid leſt that my affection ſhould lead me to partiality, and therefore ſhall ſay no more as to that particular; only ſomthing more as to the Book, which is but ſmall, yet may prove of great benefit to thee; and therefore if thou art a good Huſband, thou canſt not but think it well worth thy money,
<pb facs="tcp:51977:6"/>
when it teaches thee how to Plant and order Fruit-trees, the planting whereof, both for Sider and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fruit, I account one of the beſt parts of good Huſbandry, for I have frequently ſeen (in diverſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>England)</hi> what improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments perſons have made upon their Eſtates by ſo doing, beſide that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of Cider is ſay'd to agree beſt with our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bodyes, men Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to great Ages in the Cider-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, both Active and ſtrong, as may appear by a ſtorie, I ſhall here inſert, which I borrowed out of an Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Learned Author; <note n="*" place="margin">

            <head>A SHORT and SURE GUID IN <hi>The Practice of Raiſing and Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fruit-Trees.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe goodneſſe of materials, and the ſufficiency of the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, as in Building, ſo in Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the firſt thing conſiderable; The ſtock therefore being the cheif foundation of a good Fruit-tree, ſhall give the Beginning to this my enſuing diſcourſe. And whereas the beſt of ſtocks are produced from the ſeed; I will not pervert Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures method, but keeping in her Tract all the way treat of ſuch in this firſt following Chapter.</p>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51977:8"/>
               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of Raiſing ſtocks from the ſeed.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>EVery ſort of ſeed hath a delight peculiar to it ſelf, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in a place, that affords juice moſt agreeable to it's Nature. The beſt Ground (or mould) that I have ſeen for the ſowing of Apple and Pear-kernells is a Clay. If you have not the conveniency of ſuch for your purpoſe, then procure and bring into the Nurſery (or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) good ſtore of Clay, and make therewith a Bed of about one foot and an half in Thickneſſe, of what breadth and length you pleaſe. Upon this Bed muſt be laid ſome
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51977:8"/>
ſpit-dung <hi>(i. e.</hi> ſuch horſe-dung as is rotted in the heap, and may be digged with a ſpade) or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent mould, upon which likewiſe lay as much ſand, as will cover half a foot, or more, thick, when you have thus done, digge the ſand, dung (or mould) and half of the Clay, ſo that they mix well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let this be done in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer before you intend to ſow your kernells, ſo will this Compoſt be ſufficiently work't together againſt the time you ſow, which may be any time after <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and afore <hi>Mid-March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Digge it over often, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally digge it afreſh, and very fine, when you intend to put the ſeeds in the ground; rake it then even, and pick all the ſtones, and traſh
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51977:9"/>
out of it. Afterwards, by the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a line, digge (or drill) a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle trench of about two inches deep, and as much broad; into the which caſt ſome of the ſeed. When you have done this, remove the line, and place it about half a foot diſtant from the trench, make by it another trench in like manner, and ſow it with ſeeds, as you did the former. Do thus, until all your bed is ſown, or your ſeeds ſpent. Then cover all theſe little trenches by raking the earth upon them. Let this bed for kernells be on the North-ſide of a wall, or fence, or in ſome ſhady place: So will the young plants be freed from the parching heat in the Summer; and thereby be kept moiſt a longer time then they would in another place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51977:9"/>
This bed, being thus made of clay, yeildeth little harbor for the mole, mouſe, or worm; all which are very buſy in deſtroying ſeeds ſown in light ground; what the clay is ſuppoſed to kill by its cold and aſtringent clammineſſe, the ſand preſerveth by heat and friabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; filling up the chaps, which would otherwiſe be in the clay, if the bed ſhould happen to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to be watered in ſeaſon. You may not wonder that I make choiſe of clay to ſow kernells in; for it is the natural ſoile for them: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the moiſt and clay woods, which afford far better (and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtore of) wild ſtocks, then any other whatſoever.</p>
               <p>By this manner of ſowing in clay, I have known kernells to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51977:10"/>
ſhoot, ſome two foot, others a yard in a dry year; when thoſe, that were ſowne in looſe and richer mould, grew not above half a foot, or a foot at the moſt.</p>
               <p>Having mentioned ſomething about Mice, I thinke it not amiſſe to adde thereunto in this place (once for all) how to keep them from deſtroying the ſeeds, which (beſides the trappes) may be done by mixing a little ſoot with them in the ſowing, and to ſcatter a little lime and ſoot on the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the bed, after the ſeeds are ſown: by the bitterneſſe of the ſoot and the heat of the lime, the Mice (unleſſe very much pinch't with hunger) will be cautelous to venter thereon, as diſagreeing to the reliſh of their diſcerning pallats.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51977:10"/>
But to return where I left.</p>
               <p>Although this is the beſt kind of ground (or mould) to ſow the ſeeds in; yet will I not deny, what I have ſeen, <hi>viz.</hi> that they have thrived very much in others beſide.</p>
               <p>Plum-ſtones will grow very well this way: but Cherry ſtones will not. Wherefore you muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure (or make) a place of light mould, or black ſand, and ſow them therein in the like manner, as you did the Apple and Pear kernels; So will they thrive extraordinarily.</p>
               <p>Peach-ſtones thrive beſt, when ſet in a loomy ground (ſuch as ſerves to make bricks about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don)</hi> mixt with ſome ſpit-dung, &amp;c. I have known them inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the firſt year, they grew herein ſo bigge; the next unto this is that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51977:11"/>
wherein you ſow the black Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the cheif ſeeds to make ſtocks: but now to tell you, what ſtocks ſerve, for what kinds of fruit; for there muſt not be a mixture of grafts and ſtocks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Natures, as many (who treat of Miracles not truth) do deliver. Know therefore,</p>
               <p>That the kernels of Wildings, for all ſorts of Apples to be grafted on, are the beſt; if you can obtain them; if not, of any Crabbe (ſuch as are in the hulls, out of which verjuice was preſt) will ſerve the turn, if the Crabbs were not too ſmall.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion that Apple kernells make the fitteſt ſtocks for the ſweeteſt ſort of Apples, but
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51977:11"/>
of this I never ſaw the tryall, my opinion being wedded to the Crabb and Wilding; for as the ſame men affirme, the ſtock coming from the Apple is not ſo laſting.</p>
               <p>All Pear-kernells, but eſpecially thoſe, that came from ſome what ſoure Pears, (ſuch are theſe, that make the beſt Perry) for all kinds of Pears, Wardens, and Medlars, though theſe laſt are uſually graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on white-thorne; yet they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford larger fruit, when grafted on Pear-ſtocks, as I have ſeen happen by the experience of others.</p>
               <p>The Service-tree both wild and planted is an excellent ſtock for Medlars, the fruit thereof being better reliſh't and thicker ſet on, then thoſe of the Pear ſtock.</p>
               <p>The ſeparation of Crabb and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51977:12"/>
Pear-kernells is performed on this wiſe. After that the liquor hath been preſſed forth of the bruiſed fruit, take the hull-cakes and rubb them between your hands, that they may looſen themſelves from the kernells; then ſpread them on a blancket or winnow-ſheet laid in the Sun, where let them dry for a while: Then take a wide ſive and ridder them, ſo will the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells drop forth, like as corn uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doth. If ſome of the ſmaller hulls do come forth with the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells, they may be dryed a freſh, and ſhaken in a cloſer (or Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) ſive, whereby part will fall through, and part will gather into an heap, by the turning round of the ſive, but a clean ſeparation is tedious and unneceſſary, if the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51977:12"/>
are to be carried a great way, it is good to dry them again, leaſt they grow mouldy in the carriage.</p>
               <p>Theſe and all other kinds of ſeeds here mentioned muſt be mixt with fine mould or ſand in like ſort, as plums are mingled in fine flower by the bakers, to make cakes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and kept in tubs or pots, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too dry, leaſt they wither, nor yet too moiſt, leaſt they grow mouldy and rotten; let them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if they are kept within doors, be watered now and then, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter every watering be carried forth an hour or two for two or three days together to receive the benefit of the refreſhing Air; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards caſt into pots each kind by it ſelf as before. Some men do keep them ſo mixt always without
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51977:13"/>
doors where they ſtand to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of all Weathers.</p>
               <p>The ſtones of Plums, coming of a kind, whoſe bark is ſmooth and full of ſap, are the beſt to make ſtocks for all ſorts of Plums, and Aprecocks; more eſpecially, if they are of a white Pear-plum, which alſo will ſerve indifferently for the more common ſorts of Peaches. But</p>
               <p>The generall and beſt approved ſtocks for Peaches, <hi>Nectrines, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locotoons,</hi> and the reſt of that tribe, are the ſtons of Peaches themſelves, and among them, the <hi>Melocotoon,</hi> and ſuch whoſe fleſh eaſily ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates from the ſtone: which ſtones (notwithſtanding what I have ſaid of ſeeds in generall) ought to be ſet early, or elſe (which is better)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51977:13"/>
the ſhells broken in ſuch ſort that the kernells be not bruiſed but carefully taken forth and then ſet like others: for the ſhell is a great hinderance, to the ſpeedy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſhooting forth of the tender ſeedling, yea many a good kernel is rotted before it can break through ſuch a thick incloſure.</p>
               <p>Some choiſe exoticke Plums and Aprecoks prove good when grafted or inoculated on Peach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocks low on the face of the ground.</p>
               <p>Almonds make a great ſhew the firſt year, whereby many have been invited to inoculate them with the beſt kinds of Peaches, &amp;c. but the next year (or when they are once removed) they do for the moſt part come to nought, however
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51977:14"/>
if any of Cherrys ſtand, they are never ſo good as theſe of Peaches. Aprecock ſtones are little worth, for they grow ſlowly, and are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, to dry to inoculate on.</p>
               <p>Black Cherry ſtones preſt from their juice and waſht from their fleſh, make the only gallant ſtocks for all ſorts of Cherrys, if planted in a blackiſh ſand (as I have ſaid) in three or four year they ſhoot both in length and bigneſſe almoſt beyond beleif.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh Cherry called the Hony-cherry is the ſtock whereon the earlyeſt May's do grow, yet that fruit is not ſo good as that on the Black cherry, Enquirie and tryall may be made, how ſome Cherrys (eſpecially the Moriſco) will prove on the <hi>Rhamnus cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51977:14"/>
or the Harts Thorne. For the bark thereof ſhews that they will agree well together.</p>
               <p>The young plants muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept clean, and ſometimes the Earth between the ranks looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by howing, or (rather) gentle digging, leaſt they be overcome and choaked by the weeds.</p>
               <p>If the young ſeedlings grow too thick, or too cloſe to one another pluck up ſome of the weakeſt of them, and the reſt will ſhoot the ſtronger, but of this hereafter.</p>

               <p>BEfore that theſe ſeedlings be tranſplanted from the bed, wherein they were ſown, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that a plot of ground (to make a Nurſery) be choſen fit to cheriſh and entertain them; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall (or genuine) ſoile, of which I adviſe to be between (or a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of) clay and ſand, but therein the ſand to abound; if ſuch with conveniency may be to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe acquired; if not, any Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>[i. e.]</hi> neither too fat nor

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Situation thereof ſhould be guarded, and fenced from the blaſts of the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>North-We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> Winds: for thoſe are the greateſt deſtroyers of buds in Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation &amp; tender graftings; where you intend the Nurſery ſhall be large, this choiſe will not be of ſuch conſequence, for one Tree will guard another. The place being thus choſen and deſigned, ought the year (or two) preceding to have been well ſoil'd and till'd for corn, or digg'd as for a garden; and at the <hi>Michaelmas</hi> (or at ſuch time as the Crop is of) before the planting, Trenched <hi>[i. e.]</hi> digged two ſpit deep, the upper ſpit of Earth being turned in the place of the lower and the lower caſt in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51977:16"/>
room of the upper. The Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the whole, lying in <hi>Plano,</hi> as an <hi>Area</hi> in a Garden, muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before (or at) the time of ſetting be ſpread over ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with the beſt ſoil, (or dung,) ſuch is that, that cometh from the Brew-houſes; which ſoil in the Planting is to be lightly turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth, more eſpecially about the roots of the ſeedlings.</p>
               <p>By this manner of Trenching and ordering the Nurſery, Trees are caus'd to improve exceedingly: for the Earth, which before (like milk,) threw up and contained all it's fatneſſe (or cream) on the Superficies, now feedeth the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt root, that a young Tree is able to ſend forth: and although to ſome it may ſeem to have a diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cortion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51977:16"/>
(or a part) of bad mould in the midle <hi>[i. e.]</hi> where the roots will ſhoot out the ſecond year, yet may they underſtand, that, by the ſoaking (or ſinking) of the ſoil, that was laid afreſh on the new Superficies, and the riſing (or ebullition) of the fat mould of the quondam Superficies, now turned two ſpit into the Earth, there will be a perfect mixture through out the whole, before the firſt year be fully ended. Beſides this good mould, being thus under the roots, doth at once ſupply the ſtead of many dungings; which, though never ſo often repeated, will not be able to deſcend ſo deep.</p>
               <p>As to the objection of others, (and thoſe the greateſt number of men that deal in Fruit-Trees,) who
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51977:17"/>
ſay that by this enriching the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, thoſe Trees that are fetch't from off thence will not grow or thrive elſe where, ſave in ſuch like or better ground; cauſe, if into worſe tranſplanted, for the moſt part they dy: I muſt anſwer this, that no man (unleſſe very idle on ignorant, and ſo unfit for imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this purpoſe) would ever ſet a Fruit-Tree, but would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the place by ſoil, and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it before hand; whereby it comet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to paſſe, that the Tree (though brought off a rich Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery yet) is meliorated in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting, which laſteth for at leaſt two years; that ſpace of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough to keep alive and make grow the Tree; after which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſeldome happeneth, that any dy.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51977:17"/>
Yea, granting the ſuppoſition, that the Tree is removed from better to worſe, I can ſay, that it is a great furtherance to the quicker bearing of Fruit; hereby the ſap, that in the Nurſery ſpent it ſelf altogether in effecting the growing of the Tree, is arreſted in it's ſpeed, and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth, and prepareth it ſelf in the Tree for the bringing forthe of bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms (and conſequently Fruit) the next year aſter; this may be ſeen daily in the re-planting of Cherry Trees.</p>
               <p>Moreover theſe people do not conſider, that young Trees (like young cattle) do deſire in their firſt years a tender education; which if not granted, they are hindred (or hide bound) in their growth and improvement; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51977:18"/>
it hapneth, that an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dilatation of their bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and in the end a moſſineſſe affects them, though transfer'd to richer quarters; where if they do eſcape thoſe Maladves and thrive, their growth will be ſo faſt, that for it no Fruit can be produc'd, and (which is the worſt of all diſeaſes) a Canker in few years ſtops the career. Moſt Apple-Trees give this experiment and obſervation.</p>
               <p>But in theſe matters I do not take part with the too much infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Nurſeryes: ſuch being as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reproof, for their over-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as theſe other (cenſures) are for their opinion in under-doing; the firſt occaſion and cauſe whereof was Lazineſſe.</p>
               <p>Having cleared the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51977:18"/>
about the choiſe of ground for the Nurſery and the due order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof before planting, I muſt now return to diſcourſe of the work it ſelf; and before it, the ſeaſon (or time of the year) is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: This I find to be beſt, and ſafeſt from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>February;</hi> (when the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is open; for Froſt will kill the roots in the Winter; in like ſort as the heat doth in the Summer.)</p>
               <p>The earlyer removall, <hi>(viz.</hi> in and about <hi>Auguſt,)</hi> I diſlike; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the danger proceeding from the checking of the Tree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſap be throughly hardned into wood; by reaſon whereof the bark, being then too tender, withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth (or wrinckleth) and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a dead cover; when a live
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51977:19"/>
Tree is expected. Secondly, for that hereby it is hindred of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſpring; Laſtly, becauſe thoſe fibers at root, which uſually ſprout forth upon ſuch early ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, do periſh in the Winter; if the Froſt be penetrating.</p>
               <p>Yet when ſeedlings grow too thick, and your mind is to ſave them all, you may at any time throughout the whole Summer, by the help of a ſcoop like a paddle, after a watering, take up what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you pleaſe, with the Earth on their roots; and reſet them in a new appointed border, where with due watering and Shading they will ſcarce take notice of their remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, unleſſe it be by a faſter thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through their deliverance from the incumbrances of their fellowes,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51977:19"/>
and by being ſet at liberty in a freſher quarter.</p>
               <p>The beſt way to preſerve the cloſe and low growers of Peach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones is by the thus taking up of their overtoppers; or (as the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy guides) the leſſer may be taken up, and the greater ſtand.</p>
               <p>A late removall I aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct not; becauſe the Tree benummed (if I may ſo ſpeak) by it's taking up, is to ſeek for nouriſhment at the roots, when it ſhould be ſpringing out in branches. Yet in the earlyer, Cherry-ſtocks (by care) do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently grow, and Crabb-ſtocks in the latter. Now proceed I to the planting.</p>
               <p>Fiſt let all the greateſt ſort of ſeedlings be taken (or drawn) up by themſelves, ſlip (or prune) off
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51977:20"/>
all the ſide-branches (if there be any) from them, leaving only the middle (or upright) ſtemme ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which may be a little top't too, if it be taper, then cut away all the fibrous roots, (that the Earth may cloſe to the main,) and good part of that root, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly groweth directly down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: for thereby freſh roots will ſpring forth at the ſides; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that direct deſcending root ſhooteth moſt commonly deeper, then the good mould extendeth, which is one of the cauſes of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe in Trees, trimme alſo the ends (when there are any) of the ſide roots. Having done thus, and deſigned the plot in the Nurſery, where they ſhould be ſet, extend a Garden-line a croſſe the breadth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51977:20"/>
of the ſaid plot at one end thereof, by the guidance of which line digge a ſmall trench, not much deeper then the roots of the young plants, (newly prepared as afore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) which you muſt place therein, one plant half or three quarters of a foot diſtant from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo cauſing their heads to reſt directly erect on the line: then throw the mould [mixt with the dung, that was ſpread over the ſuperficies of the plot, as I have ſaid,] on the roots: and ſhake the plants, one after the other, ſomewhat after this looſe covering, that the Earth may be fitted on every of the roots, and that the plants be not buryed too deep in ground: after which you ought to tread the Earth, pretty hard for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51977:21"/>
the firmer and better cloſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the roots in generall, but in this fixing of them, there muſt be a regard had, they ſtand upright by the line, as at the firſt placing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the rank is fill'd up in this manner, remove the line from thence 2 foot (or a ſpace ſufficient for men to paſſe to and fro, to ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate grafts and prune them, and for them to ſpread) then ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the like form, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: do thus, till all the greater ſort of ſeedlings be ſpent. Then deal in like order with the ſecond ſort, or thoſe of the middle growth, but as for the leaſt, let them grow an year or two longer in the beds, where they were Sown, (for even the worms will turn out of the ground ſuch tender roots) then ſet
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51977:21"/>
them in like manner, as the other two were before. Some planters make holes by the line, with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or ſettingſtick made of the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a ſpade cut picked at the end, into which they put the ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and (by treading) cloſe the Earth about them. But this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſetting ſerves not for thoſe plants that have ſide-roots, becauſe the holes without ſome trouble, cannot be dilated to admit them: neither is it altogether ſo good for thoſe that can be ſo ſet; becauſe the Earth is clotted by the dibber, as it maketh the hole; where up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it cannot ſo exactly encompaſſe the roots, unleſſe with a ſpade, or trowell, it be thruſt cloſe to them, which is a trouble exceeding that of making a ſmall trench as is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51977:22"/>
before directed. Obſerve, that all ſeedlings one time or other muſt be removed, by reaſon of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect deſcending roots: as is above ſpecified.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Plum-ſtocks, you intend to inoculate Aprecocks, and to graft wal-plums on, as alſo Peach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, muſt be ſet a ſomewhat great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſtance in the rank; becauſe that their ſpreading ought to be low, unleſſe you are certain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them the next year after their inſition keep the ſpaces between the ranks clean from weeds, by once (or twice) howing them, in the Summer, if you have ſo much leaſure: however at the Winter fail not to digge them over a freſh, for the better mixture of the Earth and ſoil; and for the refreſhing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51977:22"/>
of the roots by the rain, which here by hath the freer admittance into the Earth. Some years, when you have perceived the former dung devoured, and the heart (or fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) of the Nurſery to faint, by the ſlow ſhooting of the ſpriggs and grafts, lay on freſh dung, and turn it in by the ſaid winter-digging.</p>
               <p>At Al-hallontide (or there about) cut of all the ſide-branches (or ſpriggs) from the Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocks &amp; Cherry-ſtocks every year; leaving the upright one, (or that that is intended for to graft or ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate on,) ſtanding againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther year, for a leader: this labour may be ſpared, when the ſtocks are reſerved for the wall, or to be dwarfe ſtandards, in which a low grafting, and inoculation, is to be uſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:51977:23"/>
The contrary kind of pruning <hi>[i. c.]</hi> by cutting of the erect aſcending branch) may be uſed to Crabbe-ſtocks and Pear-ſtocks, for to make their bodyes grow bigge and not toppe-heavy: or it is not of much moment, whether you uſe any, when that you have about two, or three, foot of the ſtocks clear bark't above the ground; for that will be high enough to graft them on.</p>

               <p>WHen the Crabb-and Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocks have thus ſtood, and grown in the Nurſery, two, three, or four years, according to their improvement in bigneſſe; then the grafting muſt be thought upon, and effected.</p>
               <p>But the Winter before <hi>[i. e.]</hi> (between <hi>Michaelmas</hi> and St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews-tide,)</hi> let their branches and heads be cut off, an handfull or more, above the ſmooth place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be grafted on. This cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the heads is for the better arreſting the ſap in the main body
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51977:24"/>
of the ſtock, which doth hereby become the more turgid in it's bark, by being thus hindred of it's vent; for the ſap (more eſpecially the more ſerous part thereof) is not wholy ſpent, till the great Froſts in Winter, as may be ſeen by the long continuance of the leaves on the top-branches, and their ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now, I ſay, it is hereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the greater effuſion of it into the graft (inſtead of it's own toppe and branches) the next ſpring.</p>
               <p>Cherry-ſtocks, that you have reſerved for ſtandards in Orchards, muſt not be thus dealt with, but the ſide-branches (as I have ſaid) only pruned of the ſtocks; becauſe they muſt be grafted at ſuch an height, as the Trees are to ſpread:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51977:24"/>
for Cherry grafts (for the moſt part) immediately expand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into branches on the head of the ſtock, neither will they grow any higher in an entire body.</p>
               <p>Thus much to the preparation of grafting, whoſe cheifeſt time is <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> the weather being warm, <hi>[i. e.]</hi> without Froſts or cold Winds, <hi>February</hi> for Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, and moſt ſorts of Plums, <hi>March</hi> for the latter kinds of Plums, and for all the ſpecies of Apples and Pears. Yet ſome have, in the variety of their practice, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to graft from, and in, <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> as alſo in <hi>Aprill,</hi> both which have happened to grow well: but theſe are but nicety's, the ſureſt grafting being in thoſe two months, I now have named.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:51977:25"/>
Now the manner and ſeveral ways of Grafting, (which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the difficulty to attain without ocular demonſtration) I will in this place endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>
               <p>Firſt there is the moſt vulgar called ſtock-grafting, or Cleft-grafting. To do this, cut off the head of the ſtock ſmooth, at the place where you intend to fix the the graft, then cut the graft like a wedg for two inches, (but) with ſhoulders on both ſides at a ſeam, or (which is as well by mine own triall) an eye; the inner part (that is to be placed within the wood of the ſtock) being made ſomewhat thinner then the outward, which with it's bark is to join to the bark of the ſtock; the graft thus prepared
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51977:25"/>
muſt be laid down in the basket or put in a diſh of water till you have cleft the ſtock, (a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the pith,) with a mallet and ſharp chiſell, or knife, without bruiſing the bark. Into this cleft, which if rough, or continued with ſtrings of bark one ſide to the other, muſt be ſhaved ſmooth with a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife, from the bottom (upward) to the top; and if too ſhort muſt be made long enough to receive the wedg-part of the graft: put a woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wedge, about the center (or middle) of the ſtock to keep it open for the graft, which muſt then be fitted thereunto exactly, bo that the ſhoulders on the top, and the ſides; the inſides, not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, (as by many miſtaken, whoſe work thereby came to nought,) of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51977:26"/>
the barks, both of the graft and ſtock; they touching one the other, almoſt as even, and cloſe as two peices of wainſcoat ſhot by a joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners plain. When you perceive, that they will do thus, let the graft alone in the cleft, and pull out the wedg, that held the cleft open, but if you find the graft will be pinched by the ſtock, leave a little peice of a wedg in the middle of the cleft, to keep it from preſſing too cloſe thereon: if the ſtock be big enough, another graft may be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the adverſe ſide of the ſtock in like manner as the former.</p>
               <p>This way of grafting (though univerſally known, and practiſed) is not good; becauſe the heart of the ſtock is wounded, and the rain (ormoiſture) oft falleth into the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51977:26"/>
cleft, and where likewiſe Earwiggs, and ſuch like Vermin find harbour; both which are cauſes, that the head of the ſtock often dyeth, or rotteth away, before the bark hath encompaſſed it.</p>
               <p>It is better therefore, (if by a cleft you would graft) that you cut the head of the ſtock aſlope <hi>[i. e.]</hi> (oblique deſcending) like a Colts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot (from the ſimilitude whereof, this manner of grafting hath it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination,) but plane a little, on the top, where the ſhoulder of the graft is to reſt. The remainder of the work is after the ſame order, and faſhion, as in the former.</p>
               <p>By this way the ſtock admitteth only one graft; you may therefore make two ſlits, or clefts, on each ſide of the pith one, for two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51977:27"/>
grafts, if the ſtock be large enough to contain them.</p>
               <p>This cutting of the head of the ſtock a-ſlope, doth in part (not wholly) divert, and avoide the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifs of the former. This ſtock grafting (or the former) muſt be uſed when ſtocks are thick ſet with knots; but in others it pleaſeth me neither, for I find theſe enſuing ways to be the more excellent, as bringing in their operation leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the whole, and as being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in a ſhorter time.</p>
               <p>Whip-grafting (otherwiſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Backing, Packing, or Splicing) is thus performed; After the ſtock is cut even, as in the firſt or ſecond grafting, you muſt cut your graft on one ſide only with a ſhoulder, very even and ſmooth, deſcending
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51977:27"/>
(like the ſide of a wedg) till the point (or end) thereof ſharpeneth it ſelf in the bark, that is on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſide of the graft, this ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt be made a little beneath an eye (or bud.) The other ſide muſt be left whole and intire, with another eye (or bud) on it, about the middle, from the ſhoulder, toward the bottom, or end, which muſt be diſtant two inches (more or leſſe) from the ſhoulder. The graft and head of the ſtock being thus prepared, lay the cut-ſide of the graft on that ſide of the ſtock, that hath the ſmootheſt bark, (the ſhoulder lying exactly on the top of the ſtock,) and mark with your penknife-edg the place, to which the bottom or end of the graft exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, then (having laid the graft by)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51977:28"/>
with the penknife cut a ſlice (of ſuch breadth as you gueſſe the flat ſide of the graft to be) out of the bark to the wood (and ſome part of the wood, when otherways it will not be broad enough) from a little below the place, you did mark at the bottom (or end) of the graft, to the top of the ſtock. This done; ſee whether the inward part of the bark of one ſide, and the end of the graft, fit to the inward part of the bark (or the narrow ſpace, or line, between the bark and wood) of the ſtock, in the room of that, which was ſliced off by the penknife. It is not ſo materiall, whether the other ſide join ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly: nay I rather adviſe, that that ſide of the graft fall ſomewhat within the wood of the ſtock; for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51977:28"/>
thereby it will ſit the cloſer and firmer to the former ſide. If the ſtock be big enough, and you have a mind thereunto, you may place another graft, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, on the adverſe ſide of the ſtock; but whether you graft one or two, you muſt with one hand hold them on a right, and with the other (if that none other perſon be there preſent to help you) bind them faſt on the ſtock, (ſtaying the bond with the hand, that holds the grafts,) with a ſoft flag, ruſh, peice of baſſes or inward rind of any Tree, or ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Obſerve in this place, both for this and all other kinds of grafting, where the grafts are to be thus bound on the ſtock, that you loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the bonds at ſuch time as the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51977:29"/>
grafts have grown a little, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they eſcape the dammages that enſue by pinching.</p>
               <p>Another way may be termed ſhot-grafting; for, if we can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſmall things by great, it is like the ſhooting of two peices of timber (as in a Ship-maſt) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The graft is prepared, and the whole operation performed, after the ſame manner as before in Whip-grafting, from which it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth but little, and that is, by cutting away the wood of the ſtock like the graft, if you would graft with a ſhoulder; if not, it is no more trouble then to cut a ſlice of two inches (more or leſſe) long from of the graft, and the like from of the ſtock, and to place the one upon the other in the ſame faſhion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51977:29"/>
as in the other. But yet the graft groweth the ſurer, if the bud on the back be (orly) beneath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bud on the oppoſite ſide of the ſtock; for by the bud, that is on the ſtock, lying higher then the bud on the graft, the ſap tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hold on the graft in it's paſſage thereunto.</p>
               <p>This way is moſt uſed, when the graft and ſtock are of equall bigneſſe; but it may ſerve very well alſo, though the bigneſſe of the ſtock do ſomewhat exceed that of the graft; ſo that they cloſe on one ſide exactly, as I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the former.</p>
               <p>There is a way much uſed by ſome of the beſt Nurſery-men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>London,</hi> and indeed very eaſy and certain, which is performed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51977:30"/>
on this wiſe. Firſt they cut of the head of the ſtock on the ſide, where the graft is to be put, deſcending or a little bending downward, and not altogether flat, when there is but one graft intended to be placed thereon; but when there are two grafts to be inſerted on the ſame ſtock, it muſt be cut flat, or (which is better) with a ridg (like a cheveron in Heraldry, or the tops of two rafters coupled) in the middle.</p>
               <p>Then they ſlice of a peice of the graft in the ſame faſhion, as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the ſecond ſhot-grafting way; the ſtock, if ſomewhat big, is dealt with as in Whip-grafting; but if little, as in ſhot-grafting, theſe things being thus accompliſhed, and the ſliced ſide of the graft found
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51977:30"/>
to agree to the ſliced place of the ſtock; then they ſlit the graft (gently, leaſt the bark ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urt) on that ſide that is to ly on the ſtock, from within half an inch (or leſſe) of the end, (or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,) to within (about) half an inch of the top, or where the ſlice began; the like they do unto the ſtock, ſo that on them both there is (as it were) a tongue: now they put the tip (or point) of the tongue of the graft into the ſlit of the ſtock, and the tongue of the ſtock into the ſlit of the graft, and guiding them even on one ſide they thruſt them gently (the one tongue within the other) till the bottom of the graft come to the place of the ſtock, whereon it is to ly. Laſt of all, they bind it, as in the two laſt preceding ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:51977:31"/>
This grafting I account the beſt, for it's certainty and eaſy accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing, as I have ſaid: very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, becauſe that by the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and placing the tongues, the one within the other, it commeth to paſſe, that the graft may be fed in three ſeveral places by the ſap; whereas in the other ways of graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it receiveth it's nouriſhment, but in one or two at the moſt. It is eaſy likewiſe, as having leſſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the placing and binding, the others of that kind; for the grafts ſtick almoſt as cloſe to the ſtock in this as in cleft-grafting.</p>
               <p>In Grafting between the wood and the bark, the head of the ſtock is cut off flat and ſmooth, as for cleft-grafting; and the graft pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the ſame faſhion, as in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51977:31"/>
Whip-grafting: which being effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and a ſtyle of iuory, box, or ſuch like hard and ſmooth wood cut like (though ſomewhat leſſe then) the end of the graft, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in a readineſſe; you muſt make a place for the graft with this ſtyle, by thruſting it (but not raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, between the wood and the bark (on the ſmootheſt ſide) of the ſtock, as deep almoſt as the cut part of the graft is long, then, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pulled out the ſtyle, put the point of the graft in the room there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with it's cut ſide cloſe to the wood of the ſtock; continue the thruſting it (gently though it be ſtiffe in going) down, till the ſhoulder of the graft reſt even on the head of the ſtock, and then the work is finiſhed, ſave that, leaſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51977:32"/>
the wind, or the very putting on the clay, ſhould ſhake it, you muſt bind it, as in others.</p>
               <p>This way of parting the bark and wood pleaſeth me not very well; becauſe herein the bark will riſe on both ſides the graft, farther then is requiſite; or if it be not ſo flexible, it will either not part clear from the wood, or elſe it will pinch and bruiſe the graft in it's paſſage. All which do (as I have known) fruſtrate the labour and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some, to avoid this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, cut the graft on both ſides, without any ſhoulders, like a ſharp wedg; and ſo thruſt it between the bark and wood: but hereby like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe too great a wound is given to it for to come to good; though I deny not, that it may happen to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51977:32"/>
grow, if the ſap can take hold on any place thereof in ſuch ſort as that the back part may in a ſhort ſpace be covered afreſh.</p>
               <p>Inſtead therefore of theſe I have ſubſtituted, and made triall of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, taken notice of by few, though the moſt neat, and leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and hurtful for the graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great ſtocks. The opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about it is ſomewhat agreeing to that of inoculation, from which becauſe there is ſome variation, I will here ſet down the whole in the ſame order I was accuſtomed to do it. Firſt I cut off the head of the ſtock (like the coltsfoot) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlope, and at the very top flat, for about half an inch, on the ſide, where I place the graft. Then I fit the graft like unto that for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51977:33"/>
Whip-grafting, ſave that in this I cut the pith, and middle part of the wood, from both ſides ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hollow ſcoop-like, that the outſides thereof might ſtick the compleater to the ſtock; from whoſe top I draw a ſlit, with the point of my penknife, through the bark, direct downward, of an inch or more in length. Then I raiſe the bark on both ſides the ſlit by the back of my penknife, to receive the point of the graft, which being put therein, I thruſt the cut part down between the wood and the bark, till the ſhoulder thereof reſt on the top of the ſtock, as it doth in others.</p>
               <p>Now although the bark of the ſtock was not opened, nor ſlit the length of that part of the graft that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51977:33"/>
was to be applyed to the wood; yet will the point of the graft, by this gentle thruſting down, cleave and dilate the bark wide enough to receive it moſt exactly.</p>
               <p>When the ſtock is of a larger ſize, I ſet another graft in like ſort one the ſame ſide, but diſtant from the other about an inch; and if the ſtock be very big, (ſuch are the arms and bodys of Trees) I place others, with oblique ſhoulders, to fit the ſloped part of the head, and one without any ſhoulder, at the lower end of the Clots-foot.</p>
               <p>By this ſlitting of the bark I eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew the inconveniency's of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graftings between the wood and the bark; for herein the bark opens no wider then to receive the graft, whom likewiſe it cannot by pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51977:34"/>
oppreſſe. Yet ſometimes it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out, that the bark of an old ſtock is ſo thick, that it will riſe, further then is needfull, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to turn ſhort enough, only for the admittance of the graft; wherefore I pare, and cut away ſome part thereof on both ſides the ſlit, whereby that miſcheif is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
               <p>All ſorts of grafting between the bark and the wood, for the moſt part are uſed in juicy-bark't ſtocks; or late, <hi>[i. e.]</hi> when the ſap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to ariſe, otherwiſe to make them part clear will prove a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter.</p>
               <p>Some Trees there are, whoſe cions will not be grafted, if taken clean from the Tree, whereon they grew at the firſt; with theſe you
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51977:34"/>
muſt deal in another method of grafting, called inarching. To effect this, you muſt, an year or two before hand, plant ſome ſtocks ſo nigh the Tree from whence you would graft, that the cion, which is to make the graft, may by that time extend over the head, of the ſtock, when it is cut and cleft, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five or ſix eyes, without any difficult ſtraining or pulling of it; from one of theſe (ſuppoſe the fourth) eyes, it muſt be cut with cheeks, or ſhoulders, from which, about two inches in length, muſt the bark and ſome part of the wood be ſmooth and evenly taken of on both ſides, like as in Cleft-graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſave that herein the graft is not cut off like a wedg, but ought to continue on the Tree, without hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51977:35"/>
the outſide bark in any place. Then, in the cleft of the ſtock, prepared (as hath been ſaid) to receive it, in like order and form, as in Cleft-grafting, muſt you place that part of the graft, where the bark was taken away next to the ſhoulders, as far as may; ſo that the lower part thereof, which joynes to the old Tree, and is the thickeſt, do not cauſe the cleft to open at top from the ſhoulders ſet thereon. When this is done, bind it upright ſo faſt, that the wind, when it ſhakes the Tree, from whence the graft is binded, may in no wiſe looſen it.</p>
               <p>Now, though this be the moſt uſuall way of Inarching, I know and do find, that the working whip, or (rather) ſhet-graft faſhion is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51977:35"/>
better, for the grafts are not ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to break, neither is there ſo great a wound given to the ſtock by this, as by cleaving.</p>
               <p>Another manner of Inarching, where the wood of the cion is not too brittle, is by cutting the head of the ſtock, like a wedg, for an inch and an half: and then to cleave, or ſlice, out of the cion, a tongue ſomewhat more then half way through; of the ſame length, as the wedged part of the ſtock is; for the end of the tongue muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the place, where the bark of the ſtock began to be ſliced for to make it wedg faſhion. Being thus cleft it muſt be placed riding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtride on the edged head of the ſtock, the tongue on the one ſide, and the part that holds on the old
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51977:36"/>
Tree, on the other ſide of the ſtock lying, as in Whip-grafting, or, in ſhort, the whole is like cleft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting revers't; for the graft, by being cleft, in this imitates the ſtock in that, and the graft of that ſhews the faſhion of the ſtock in this; the difference is, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſtock muſt not be cut with ſhoulders, nor the tongue flat, but deſcending, till it end ſharp in the bark, as the cut part of the graft in Whip-grafting. This manner of Inarching I approve of, as the beſt, when it may be effected; for that the graft can herein receive the ſap from both ſides the ſtock, if it be well guided in the binding thereon.</p>
               <p>In theſe inarchings the old Tree feeds the graft, till ſuch time, as it is united to the ſtock, and groweth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51977:36"/>
firmly there with; which will be before the Summer is ended: ſo that the winter following, it may with ſafety be cut off, from the old tree, cloſe unto the ſtock, on which it will have made a very great growth by double feeding.</p>
               <p>In an year or two ſtore of Apre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, without inoculation, may be produced, if that before hand Plum-ſtocks be ſet round about an Aprecock-Tree at ſuch a diſtance as that they may be grafted by theſe ways of Inarching.</p>
               <p>By the ſame alſo a cion, or a great bough (if the uttermoſt point of a branch thereof be cut like the lower part of a graft) may be made to grow, with the lower end upward, whereof I have known the experience, whereby that foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51977:37"/>
traditional opinion of having fruit without ſtones or kernels was confuted; for the fruit proved to be of the kind and manner with that of the Tree; from whence the cion, or bough was inarched.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the cheif ways of grafting, ſome whereof are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for a compleat grafter to know, other ſome meer curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſityes; but there are other variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which I purpoſely omit; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that from theſe, as from the cheif heads, an ingenious lover of this art, will of his own induſtry, diſcover and improve them, to his greater pleaſure, and content.</p>

               <p>FOr the better detaining the grafts in their right poſture, and for preſerving the ſap, at the graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place, in the tender growing, from the extremity of heat and cold, adventitious moiſture and drineſſe; like as an Emplaſter on a wound, in all Graftings there is to be uſed a loom or compoſt of clay and horſe-dung or ſuch like. The beſt, that I find, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is made on this manner: <hi>viz.</hi> Take of clay one half, new horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung, and cow-hair from the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, of each one fourth, which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51977:38"/>
makes the other half; mix all theſe very well together, by kneading, beating, &amp;c. with it cover over your ſtock in the grafted place, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an inch above the head, and a little beneath the point of the graft: the whole repreſenting an egge or a ball of an ovall forme.</p>
               <p>When the grafts have grown ſomewhat, then pull off the loom, and the bindings of ſuch as requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed binding, and put only a little of the like loom on the head of the ſtock, to keep it from the heat and wet, or, if your leaſure gives leave, daube them over afreſh, yet not with ſuch curioſity as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. As for the ſmaller ſort the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the loom is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſlary.</p>
               <p>Before the grafts do grow, the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51977:38"/>
ſtock will uſually ſend forth ſome ſhoots out of it's body; which muſt not be rubb'd of (as is commonly practiſed) till the graft grow; and then, if the graft be free in grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all muſt not be pull'd of at one time, but one, or two, left to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the aſcending of too much ſap into the graft: for by it the Tree will grow lop-heavy, and the graft toward that winter, or the next year, corroded with a canker. In this I ſeem to many paradoxical; becauſe that they, by thus doing, think to force up the ſap into the graft: but experience hath ſhewed me, that, when the buds are not ſuffered to ſtand till that time, the ſtock will either dy for want of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it's ſap, or, at the beſt, the root will endeavour to ſend forth ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51977:39"/>
whereby the grafted part is weakned, if not gone, and the pains moſt commonly comes not to the wiſhed effect. Beſides the buds, that are toward the top ſerve to draw up ſap the nigher to the graft, which the graft it ſelf through wounds and weakneſſe is not ſo able to perform. But if you find, that the graft in it's growing ſhoots but ſlowly, you may then pick off all the ſprings from the ſtock, and not before.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Michaelmas</hi> prune off all the irregular, and ſide branches from the grafts, leaving only that, you intend for a leader, or to make the body of the Tree; do thus to them every year, till thoſe, you reſerve for ſtandards, are ſhot up to the height of a man, or a foot lower;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51977:39"/>
after which time the upright bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may be taken away, and three, four, or five of the ſide ones, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to make the ſpreading arms of the Tree.</p>
               <p>The vulgar grafters do always pick off the ſide buds, till ſuch time as the Tree is high enough: but herein they erre; for by that means the Tree grows taper, and not able to ſtand by it ſelf, without a ſtake to hold it upright; whereas if the ſide buds be ſuffered to grow afreſh from year to year, the body of the graft will be big, and ſtrong enough, to maintain it ſelf againſt the winds; then may it by prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as afore ſaid) be raiſed to ſuch an height you pleaſe, to which ſpeedy riſe theſe men only aim at, not regarding thoſe now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51977:40"/>
inconveniencyes. The body of the graft, being thus kept low to grow big, doth likewiſe cover the head of the ſtock much ſooner, then when it is ſtrip't up to ſuch a taper dimenſion.</p>
               <p>Trees, that are for the wall, muſt be made to ſpread very low; therefore leave three, or four ſide branches, conſtantly cutting away the upright.</p>
               <p>Dwarf ſtandards at the height of an yard at the furtheſt muſt be made to ſpread as tis elſewhere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
               <p>As for the choiſe of grafts I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, that they be taken from the faireſt and beſt bearers, large, full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed, and ſmooth-bark't, of the laſt years ſhooting; when you graft, cut off the heads, and let not above
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51977:40"/>
four buds remain, on a graft, above the loom for Appels and Pears. In Cherrys and Plums two will be enough, becauſe, for the moſt part, they ſend forth new branches out of thoſe that grew at the firſt hand of the year, which Appels and Pears (unleſſe the tops be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) do ſeldom adventure to do.</p>
               <p>An old Tree which is a good bearer ſeldom affordeth cions for grafts; wherefore ſome cut off a bough from the Tree the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to cauſe the Tree to ſprout forth at that place.

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of Inoculation, &amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Precocks, Peaches, Nectrines, and ſuch kinds of choiſe fruit, are ſeldome procured by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary grafting, becauſe they bring forth bloſſoms before the young ſhoots; ſo that the graft, miſſing the uſuall method of it's kind, wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away, as not able to ſtay, ſo long for a conglutinating juice, when the ſeaſon is to be in flower, and if the ſtock ſhould endeavour to preſerve the new union by throwing up ſuch a ſap, yet will the graft refuſe it for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereby it turns to a killing gelly; but this ſeldome happens,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51977:41"/>
for theſe earlyer kinds are calling for nouriſhment before the ſpring is ſtrong enough to awake and rouſe it in the ſtock. There is therefore another way invented to increaſe them, and this is called Inoculation, or Budding.</p>
               <p>The time for it is principally from a fortnight before <hi>Midſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> to a fortnight after, when the buds and bark are newly hardned enough to part from the wood, and that without any difficulty. Yet if the Tree hath been forward in growing that year, the buds will be fit to inoculate with, even in <hi>May;</hi> and if backward, then to the laſt of <hi>July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aprecocks are the firſt to be inoculated, and Peaches the laſt, and between both all other kinds of fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:51977:42"/>
Thoſe ſprigs, that ſhot that year biggeſt and faireſt, afford buds for inoculation, only toward the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or (rather) the middle half way and more; ſo that the top muſt be cut of and thrown away: for the buds thereof are always too tender to part from the wood, as the loweſt are oftentimes too old and tough.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſprigs, or cuttings, muſt immediately be wrapped up in ſome wet linnen cloth, or (which is ſureſt) their lower ends ſtuck in clay and the whole body of them encloſed with watered moſſe and ſo put in a box; if that they are to be carryed any long way, or muſt continue any ſpace of time, before the inoculation; for otherwiſe in leſſe then ſix hours they will wither
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51977:42"/>
or prove very difficult in the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now you having obtained ſuch cuttings and brought them on this wiſe to your ſtocks, cut of all the leaves, reſerving only the ſtalk of them (or, if you perceive that will be too ſhort, a very little of the leaf alſo) to hold them by in the work. Go to your ſtock, and in the ſmootheſt. place thereof (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what low) cut a tranſverſe cut, with an even and ſharp edged pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife, three quarters of an inch (or more) in length: from the middle of this cut, or line, draw, with the very point of the penknife, another cut directly downward of an inch, or ſuch like length, within a little, as the eſcutcheon ſhall be. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cut ought to be deeper then the bark. Both of them joined thus
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51977:43"/>
together are repreſented by a great T.</p>
               <p>And that you may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in your work, open with the back of the penknife (toward the point) the direct deſcending cut a very little at the top thereof, where it joynes to the tranſverſe cut, only to ſe whither the bark will part eaſily from the wood; if it will, then let it reſt, till you have prepared the bud to put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which you muſt do on this wiſe: having deſigned which bud ſhall be made uſe of, cut with the penknife a tranſverſe cut, half an inch, or leſſe, above it, cut the like beneath, both quite round the ſhoot. Then draw the ſide-cuts (on each ſide the bud one) from the cut above the bud to the cut
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51977:43"/>
beneath: theſe cuts are not to be drawn parallel, to one another, as the tranſverſe; but oblique deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, meeting thereby in an ovall point at the lower tranſverſe line: ſo that the form of the bud, with that part of the bark, that is to be with it, is like an eſcutcheon, in the ſame manner as is expreſſed in the margent; the point in the middle ſheweth the ſtalke of the leafe, and the bud before it. Theſe cuts being thus made with the knife, peele away the bark of the ſhoot, between the tranſverſe cuts, that is on the ſide oppoſite to the eſcutcheon. [Thus far of the preparation may precede the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the T in the ſtock, but I place them together, as being leſſe trouble to the underſtanding of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51977:44"/>
deſcription, but to proceed.] When you have done this, cut a ſmall notch above (but ending in) the upper tranſverſe cut, to admit the quill or ſteele that is to take off the eſcutcheon. Then thruſt this quill or ſteele in that notch between the bark, or eſcutcheon, and the wood, very even and ſteedy, that ſo the eſcutcheon may be taken off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bruiſing. Obſerve after it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, whither it hath any hole withinſide at the root of the bud, if it hath, caſt it away, as unmeet for that purpoſe, and prepare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in like ſort, till that you have one without any hole at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the bud, which being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd muſt be laid on your lip, to be kept moiſt, or put in a diſh of water till you have nimbly opened
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51977:44"/>
the deſcending cut in the ſtock with the back of your penknife, without touching the gelly or moiſture on the wood, into which immediately put the eſcutcheon on this wiſe; take it from your lip and pour out the water by the ſtalk of the leafe, and hold it and the bud cloſe (though not pinching) between your forefinger &amp; thumb; in which poſture, thruſt the point thereof into the top of the deſcending cut between the bark (you newly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and the wood of the ſtock, ſo by degrees draw down the whole eſcutcheon, if it be ſomewhat ſtiffe (as it ſhould) in drawing down, lay the back of the penknife on the ſtalk, cloſe to the bud, but not on it leaſt you bruiſe it, place likewiſe the top of your thumb underneath
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51977:45"/>
the ſtalk, and preſſe it down by the back of the penknife with your other hand, till the upper end of the eſcutcheon come within a little of the tranſverſe cut where it muſt be cut off with the ſharp edge of the penknife, which will by that means fit it exactly to the bark that is above. But if the going down be very difficult, then may you open the bark by the back of the penknife a little, on the ſides and beneath the eſcutcheon, as he ſtands on the ſtock; then preſſe it down as before.</p>
               <p>When you have thus finiſhed, bind the whole with ſome ſoft flag, bull-ruſh, woolen yarn, or baſſe, pretty ſtraight, beginning at (and upon) the tranſverſe cut and ſo winding downward, till all the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutcheon
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51977:45"/>
be covered with the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but be ſure, not to touch the very bud, but to skip it, leſt it ſhould be bruiſed; however let the binding be placed cloſe above, and beneath the ſtalk of the leaf, under which the root of the bud lyes.</p>
               <p>Some open the bark of the ſtock, before they take of the eſcutcheon, but in my mind they do not ſo well therein; for if the root of the bud ſhould (as it often doth) happen to be broken in the taking off, the air and heat doth often dry the place, that is prepared for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another bud can be made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be put therein: but men may do herewith, as it beſt pleaſeth their fancyes.</p>
               <p>If that the ſtalk of the leaf will
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51977:46"/>
fall off, before the eſcutcheon can be brought to it's proper place, or where there is no ſtalk at all, but a bare bud, you may ſtick the point of the penknife ſomewhat beneath the ſide of the bud, and draw the eſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon down, as well as if it had a leaf-ſtalk thereon.</p>
               <p>The ſtyle, that taketh off the eſcutcheon, is a quill cut two third parts away, ſloping downward as for a pen, and at the end, inſtead of a nibb or point, with a flat round edg. After the ſame faſhion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny procure a ſteel one (well bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh't) to be made for them, which indeed is better then the other, but the beſt is an Ivory one, cut in the ſame form, which ſeldome hurteth the root or gelly.</p>
               <p>Many there are who take off
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51977:46"/>
the bud by thruſting the ſtyle from the point of the eſcutcheon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: but in this the edg of the ſtyle muſt be kept cloſe to the wood, whereon the bud groweth; otherwiſe it will glide between the root of the bud and the bud it ſelf, rendring it thereby unprofitable for inoculation.</p>
               <p>Others never uſe a ſtyle, but make the upper tranſverſe cut on the cion at a greater length, or diſtance from the bud, ſo that they may take hold thereof with their penknife and thumb, thereby pulling it leaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till it comes (or is peeled) off. What is bruiſed by the taking hold of it thus, is cut off at the tranſverſe line in the ſtock, before it be quite thruſt down in the ſame order, as in the other before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:51977:47"/>
This is the quickeſt and ſafeſt way; for the bud and inward bark are not touched hereby, as they are by the ſtyle in the other, which (unleſſe very ſmooth and round edged) often maketh the ſame rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to the indangering the whole inoculation.</p>
               <p>The next beſt unto this is the taking off the eſcutcheon, by a ſuddain and equall twiſt of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger and the thumb, as you hold it between them. There is a way to inoculate, whoſe faſhion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this; for in it the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe cut is made beneath the direct deſcending line, both which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are like a great T reverſt; ſo that the eſcutcheon muſt be cut re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſt likewiſe, and the whole ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration performed from the lower
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51977:47"/>
part upward. This, without doubt, is a very good way, and the bud likely to take; but I dare affirm nothing of certainty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, becauſe my ſelf have not as yet ſeen the tryal thereof in fruit-trees; having received the hint here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from an Orange bud, which (though otherwiſe very difficult in propagating) hath by this way ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken very well.</p>
               <p>A freind of mine did once uſe to inoculate, without taking away the wood from within the eſcutcheon, which many times (eſpecially in moiſt years) hath luckyly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded: but it is not ſo ſure as the other (whoſe trouble, I confeſſe, is the greater) becauſe that the ſap of the ſtock cannot ſo compleatly annex it ſelf to the new adopted bud.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51977:48"/>
There are other (but fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal) ways of cutting, and placing on the bud, ſuch are the faſhioning it Lozenge-wiſe, and like the leaves of a book opened, &amp;c. but I omit their deſcription, as uncertain in themſelves, and therefore unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to my diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>It is (and hath been) a great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition among divers Gardners that no bud will take, if any adventitious moiſture touch the root thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be inoculated; but this I know to be as frivolous a rule as hath been invented, for it is not only good, but very neceſſary in dry wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to dip the eſcutcheon in water before you put it on the ſtock, for thereby it will ſlide down the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the ſlit.</p>
               <p>All inoculations ſucceed beſt,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51977:48"/>
when they are done in a gloomy and cloudy day; now if there be none ſuch in the ſeaſon, but the weather prove wholy dry, and parching, it is beſt to work ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what early in the morning before the Sun make the day too hot, and in the afternoon, when the heat is abated.</p>
               <p>To prevent that the heat do not ſo much miſcheif, as otherwiſe it would, ty or hang ſome cabbage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaf, or ſuch like, over the buds after the inoculation; under this ſhadow will they be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure preſerved.</p>
               <p>When the weather hath been and is extraordinary dry, it is of good conſequence to water the ſtocks 2 or 3 nights before the ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and the like, after; for that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51977:49"/>
by the former the bark will riſe the better; and by the latter the new adopted bud will receive the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nouriſhment: yet in the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, there muſt be a caution for overdoing, leaſt inſted of afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liquor to a thirſty plant you make it drunk, which will appear in the ſpuing up of a gum at the place, to the buds deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Within ten or fourteen days, if the inoculation be done before, or about, <hi>Midſommer,</hi> the bark will happen to ſwell; wherefore the bond muſt be taken off, or looſned, leaſt the bud be deſtroyed by pinching.</p>
               <p>But the true time of looſning the bond will be beſt known by the goodneſſe and ſmoothneſſe of the bark of the ſtock; for ſome ſtocks
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51977:49"/>
(ſuch as are full of ſap) will in a ſhorter time ſwell out, and extend the bindings, when as others, that are dryer, and inoculated late, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a longer time, before that the bond will be ſtreightned.</p>
               <p>In dryer weather the bud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the longer time, in moiſter the ſhorter for unbinding.</p>
               <p>It happeneth ſometimes that in four, or five dayes you may know whither the bud have taken or no: for if then it look freſh and green, as when it came of the cion, it hath taken; yea, although the ſtalk of the leaf will at the touching fall off; that being cauſed by the bruiſe, it received either from the back of the penknife in the depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the eſcutcheon, or elſe from the ſtreightneſſe of their binding.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:51977:50"/>
Becauſe of the difficulty of one ſingle bud in running through all the hazards, it is neceſſary that three, or four, buds be placed on the ſame ſtock; where, if none have come to good, the inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially when you began the firſt early, may be renewed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times, untill you are aſſured that one on every ſtock will anſwer your deſire.</p>
               <p>Rebind the buds looſe, &amp;c. when the weather is very wet, for elſe the bark of the ſtock will open from the eſcutcheon.</p>
               <p>After the unbinding there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines nothing to be done till the next Autumne or Winter; at which time you muſt cut of the heads of theſe ſtocks two inches from the bud, and the next year
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51977:50"/>
cloſe to the ſhoot, that grew out of the bud, then it were good like wiſe to cover it with loom as in grafting. If you ſhould the firſt year cut off the ſtock cloſe to the bud, 'tis ten to one, but that the head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with the bud therein will' dy; Beſides the leaving of the head thus long, more eſpecially with a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bud on it, ſerves at the ſpring to convey and attract the ſap into the bud that is inoculated; but all other buds below ought to be rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of; and that above too, when the inoculated one hath ſhot two inches long.</p>
               <p>After an early inoculation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the buds held very well, that I might ſee varietyes, I adventured to cut off the heads of ſome plump bark't ſtocks; whereby it came to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51977:51"/>
paſſe, that the bud immediately ſprung forth a conſiderable le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gth, able enough to withſtand the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing winter, yet this is not of ſuch certainty as the not permitting of it's growth till the next ſpring.</p>
               <p>The inoculation of Roſes (which moſt account a difficult matter) comes beſt to effect this way; for it is ſeldome ſeen that their <hi>Midſommer</hi> buds do ſtay ſo long as the ſpring, from ſhooting forth; ſuch ſhrubs if obſerv'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue always growing, unleſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded by the Froſt, which is no ſooner over, but they (even in the mid'ſt of winter) thruſt out their heads again, to the often nipping of many of them, amongſt whom the adopted are likelyeſt to ſuffer, if the head was cut off juſt at that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51977:51"/>
winter ſeaſon; wherefore it is (as I have found) the beſt courſe to cut off their heads four or five days after the unbinding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they will immediately ſhoot luſtily enough to withſtand the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of the winter, like unto other Roſe-Trees, that are clipped after bearing. But this is ſomewhat beſide my purpoſe; I now return.</p>
               <p>As to the ſtocks, whereon each kind ſhould be inoculated, ſee in the firſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Trees thus inoculated, may, even in the bud, the next Autumn, be removed, as well as when they have grown an year or two; yea I find it beſt ſo to do: for there is leſſe danger ln tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting Trees (ſuch are theſe) whoſe heads are cut of, and they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51977:52"/>
thereby pruned, then thoſe, whoſe branches muſt be left at full length. Yet it may prove a loſſe to the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if the bud ſhould chance to miſcarry.</p>
               <p>If the winter and ſpring prove very froſty, it is of a very great concernment to wind wiſps of ſtraw round the buds, during all the ſeaſon of cold; for thereby the tender buds are preſerved, which otherwiſe by the peircing of the Froſts are oftentimes deſtroyed. If ſuch kind of weather continue long, you muſt ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreath the ſtraw, from off the buds, for an hour or two in the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt time of the day, to give them freſh air, and afterwards wind them up as before. Many men, being ignorant of this guarding the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51977:52"/>
buds, have loſt multitudes, which held very well and continued fair a long while after the inoculation; admiring in themſelves, why the Tree ſprung not out at the ſeaſon, when as they were all killed the preceeding winter.</p>
               <p>It will not be much from our purpoſe, as a cloſe to this and the other Chapters, to ſeek out and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, for the ſatisfaction of ſome, the cauſe why the greateſt part of Trees yeild better and fairer Fruit, through inſition, then, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to bear from ſeed. Now whereas I cannot ſo exactly fetch the reſolution hereof from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſitive Tree itſelf, whoſe method of ſeparation avoids even the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eye; I muſt by comparing Trees and animals find the full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51977:53"/>
thereof, yet ſo, as that I abſtract the ſame from the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of ſenſe and motion, and ſpeak of them only as to augmentation. Whereas therefore it cannot be made appear, that there is any great difference between a beaſt and a plant in their nutrition, the one therefore will demonſtrate and clear the other. Thus then; As the Chyle which is ſeparated from the digeſted meat, thrown into the guts, for a further purification or concoction, hath other veſſels to ſecern it from it's ſeveral excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, before that it is fit for the nouriſhing of the particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who in themſelves likewiſe have an attractive force to elect the meeteſt thereof for their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and being there which ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51977:53"/>
by another quality they do reject the ſuperfluity (though in it ſelf good, yet as) unprofitable for them; from whence it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there is ſuch a conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble growth in the animal, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as well to the bearing of Fruit, as to the extenſion of the branches and trunk in Trees: So is there in Trees, themſelves an allicient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, to draw by roots (like la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteal veines) a juice out of the whole Earth, or cheifly the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter parts thereof; which juice ſo extracted is by a natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on carried into the body of the ſtock, as into a common recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, out of which likewiſe the graft inticeth and altereth, what it finds beſt for the true purpoſe of it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the end appointed it by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51977:54"/>
refuſing the other, which yet ſerveth for the nouriſhment of the ſtock, as too groſſe, or excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious, ſo that the juice hath need of a ſecond and finer concoction, before it can be turned into the proper ſubſtance of the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Fruit.</p>
               <p>This is not wholy a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for it will further be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, if we conſider the growth of <hi>Maſſe, Polypody</hi> and <hi>Miſletoe</hi> on the Trees themſelves, which, though all the art of man be uſed, cannot be perſwaded to live on the meer ground: for that they have not thoſe Oſtridge-like ſubſtances to turn the groſſer and (as I may ſay) iron juice, at the firſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction out of the Earth, into more ſubtile ſpirits for nutriment, before
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51977:54"/>
that the Trees (like loving nurſes who, though fed with courſe meates themſelves, give the fineſt of their Chyle in their milk, to be ſuck't out of their paps by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants) hath (as it were) chewed and digeſted it for them. Whence it cometh to paſſe that the <hi>Miſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe</hi> beareth ſuch a Cryſtalline ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and together with the <hi>Moſſe</hi> and <hi>Polypody</hi> doth abound in ſuch medicinal qualityes, which in the Tree it ſelf were dogged by others more perdominant, till that by the excellent Chymiſtry in theſe plants, after a due fermentation in the Tree, they are delivered.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is urged, that Trees without grafting have and do bear Fruit; it may be anſwered, that they grow a longer ſeaſon, in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51977:55"/>
reſpect of the others, before they bear, and then too, produce not ſo large, nor ſo well compacted fruit: for that their finer bodyes, which are but ſingle, are to effect and undergo two offices at once, which they are not ſo able to do, as when they have a ſtock of a more rough (though not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether diſagreeing) nature, for to give the juice a preparation.</p>
               <p>This likewiſe is the reaſon why ſuch Trees are more buſied in bringing forth branches and are more ſubject to cankers then others; for having taken from the Earth at the firſt for the moſt part a growing nouriſhment, they have no other place, nor ſtop in it's paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, through which it might be percolated, and where it might
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51977:55"/>
depoſite it's corroſive humor, which doth not prove ſo in the ſower ſtock, where there are eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies enough to encounter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due it into a better temper.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of ſtocks raiſed without ſeed, and Trees without inſition.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw leaſt it ſhould ſeem ſtrange, or a neglect in me, not to ſpeak of a thing generally uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I will in few words deliver ſomething concerning ſtocks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured out of the woods, and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from the roots of Trees.</p>
               <p>Where ſeedlings can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, I adviſe that none do make
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51977:56"/>
much uſe of any others, ſuch as wild ones and ſuckers are, for uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally their roots grow in a diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned manner, whereby the inriching the mould round about them cannot ſo truly be effected, and the grafts in few years out ſtrip the ſtock in bigneſſe; which is a great hinderance to the bearing of good and large Fruit. The only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy hereof is the grafting them low on the ſuperficies of the earth.</p>
               <p>The beſt ſort of theſe are ſuch whoſe bark is ſmooth and green, the bodyes ſingle <hi>[i. e.]</hi> not two ſtems upon one root, and the knots thin ſet on them. Theſe marks ſhew, that they are either deſcended from ſeed, or at the leaſt plants of themſelves, and not dependent on an old maimed trunk; a care like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51977:56"/>
muſt be had, that the roots be drawn up without any great bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If there be many on one root, they make unhandſome Trees; if grey coloured, they prove hungry and hide bound; if full of knots, (beſides the other inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes,) they are very difficult to be grafted: and if notwithſtanding this they thrive, the young ſprigs through an irregular nouriſhing of the whole, are more ſubject to the canker then thoſe of others. The roots muſt be cut into ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity as that they anſwer one another like the radii of the ſame circumference. Then ſet the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſort of them in the place, where they are to remain conſtantly; and after two years they may be graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By this means they become
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51977:57"/>
good Trees, and grow the faſter and kinder, for that they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſed to the ground before their grafting, wherein likewiſe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the many miſcheifs that are incident to their rough Natures, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſecond removall. Yet thoſe that are ſmall (that is, within three inches compaſſe) may be ſet in the Nurſery, and entertained like ſeedlings, howbeit few of them will improve ſo well.</p>
               <p>What I have ſpoken in this is concerning the Crab, Pear, and Black-Cherry: Suckers that come from the roots of full and juicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd Plumtrees (ſuch as the Pear-plums who) make excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtocks, in no wiſe giving place to the ſeedlings; for the greateſt part of them aſcend from
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51977:57"/>
the roots of the old Tree by one ſingle erect root at the firſt, out of which the ſide-roots immediately do ſpring, ſo that the ſecond year after their irruption, they are like ſeedlings, not much regarding the aſſiſtant ſap of the old Tree, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the little improvement of the erect root beneath the ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roots, whereas above them it is of a larger compaſſe, receiving nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from them, and from it's firſt as from one of the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Crab and Pear ſuckers are of ſuch a careleſſe and unweaned Nature, that they will hardly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to ſend forth above two, or three new roots, as being aſſured that what food theſe will not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for, the old ſtump, like a lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mother, will afford, out of her
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51977:58"/>
own ſtore houſe, as not caring much in what low eſtate ſhe keeps her ſelf, ſo that her ofspring may flaunt it, whereby it comes to paſſe that they (though otherwiſe of hardy nature) are ſuch punyes in their growth at the firſt upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, when Plum-ſuckers (as neglecting the dependance on the old one after the firſt year) do, as I have ſaid, improve themſelves exceedingly; it is good therefore to procure ſtore of theſe for your Nurſery, for ſo you gain two, or three years of the other.</p>
               <p>Under this head of thus raiſing ſtocks the multiplying them and other plants by layers will fall; A buſineſſe not yet vulgarly known, though naturally practiſed by bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and thornes themſelves; yea of

               </q>
               <p>The cauſing Trees to increaſe by laying is effected after ſeveral wayes; the cheif are theſe. Firſt by bare bending down a branch from a Tree into the ground, (where it is to be kept ſteady by a forked
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51977:59"/>
ſtick drove over it and) then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end out of the ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right as if it were a young one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a root of it's own, in one year that part, that is in the ground, will take root, which when you have found it to do, cut it three quarters through (hard by the roots) on the ſide that joines it to the Tree, then let it remain another year untouch't in the ſame ground, as it did at the firſt, this year being expired, it may at the winter be clear cut off, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted. This is for very choiſe plants.</p>
               <p>The ſecond manner of laying is by cutting the branch half way or more through, and then ordering it as the former, yet a little more gently, leaſt it break in the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51977:59"/>
In this the branch will root faſter and ſtronger; for that at the cut there is an occaſion given to the ſap to turn into fibres, whileſt it ſtrives to cover the wounded part. The next winter you may open the mould, wherein if you find the roots to have ſhot forth ſufficiently you may then tranſplant it; if not let it remain till another year as did the former.</p>
               <p>Some uſe to take only part of the bark, three quarters round, from of the branch, and ſo to lay it; but it comes all to one end, if there be any difference, the cutting is the better.</p>
               <p>Others wreath or twiſt the bough in the part that is to be lay'd in the ground, which cleaveth it in Sundry places, out of which the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51977:60"/>
fibres for roots will iſſue.</p>
               <p>The time of laying is uſually in winter, or ſpring, but it may be done at any time of the year, and the plant take rooting very well.</p>
               <p>If the branch be high, ſo that it cannot be bended to the Earth, it then muſt be laid in a basket, box, or earthen pot fill'd with good mould in ſuch wiſe, as ſhall be deſcribed when I come to ſpeak of the vine ſlips, and of the Kentiſh codling, Nurſe-garden, Sweeting, &amp;c. who will grow without roots like ozier-ſticks.</p>
               <p>A branch ſometimes will grow if two or three inches of bark be cut off round about it, as it growes on the Tree, and then clayed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently about the place, where the bark was taken away. This is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51977:60"/>
done in <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and at the winter toward ſpring, the branch is cut off and ſet in the ground, where it often happeneth to thrive like another Tree. But a better way to make a bough grow on the Tree is by ſlicing off ſmall peices of the bark and hacking it a little in the place where the roots ſhould iſſue forth, and then placing an old boot over the bough, ſo that the middle of it be the conteiner of the place that is ſliced, it being thus placed muſt be bound cloſe at the bottom, and filled with good Earth, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in dry weather the Earth ſhould be watered, whereby the bough will ſend out roots into the boot. This is to be performed in ſpring. If you find at latter end of <hi>Summer</hi> that it hath taken root,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51977:61"/>
you may cut off, and ſet it as the former. But it often happens that inſtead of roots there is only certain extuberancyes, or knots a riſen in ſeveral places about the ſlicings, which are but ſo many preparatives for roots againſt the enſuing year; wherefore it muſt ſtand till the next ſeaſon, at preſent only cut away the bark, that was reſerved at the firſt for the better conveiance of ſap into the upper part of the bough.</p>
               <p>Now that the cion groweth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the bark is wholy taken away, is not (as ſome ſuppoſe) by a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of new ſap through the clay or mould; for if it were ſo, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part would not endeavour to take root downward, that being a contrariety of motion in the ſame
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51977:61"/>
organ, which cannot be granted: yea I ſcarce beleive that any juice paſſeth that way for the nouriſhing of the ſprig; becauſe that all ſuch cions do not grow but by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the roots of the Tree, who refine the courſe juice of the earth, before theſe receive the leaſt atom thereof, and although the lower part ſendeth none but good, yet the clay and mould reduceth it into it's former courſneſs, immediately at it's paſſage into the upper part of the cion. Neither is the root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſed (as others affirm) by the arreſt and ſtoppage of the ſap in it's deſcent at Autumn, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it not finding a place where to retire, doth at the cut transforme it ſelf into fibres; if this were ſo, and that there is any ſuch thing as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51977:62"/>
the deſcent of the ſap at the fall of the leaf, then would all Trees grow more at the root in the winter then in the Summer, the contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſufficiently known. The true reaſon therefore and manner of this growing (by the leave of ſo many who content themſelves with the former) I conceive to be by the aſcent of ſap through the heart and pores of the wood, which, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the upper part of the cion, doth in an extending motion find out the wound, which it, (with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juice then called in a large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to aſſiſtance) doth ſtrive to cure by reuniting the upper to the nether part: but the wound proving too great, and that juice (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the affluence of new and it's own weight) not able to return the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51977:62"/>
way it came, nor finding any other place to divert it ſelf, doth at the ſame wound burſt forth into fibres, which afterward being ſtrong (like the veſſels of an Embryo when it becomes an animal ſubſiſting of it ſelf) act a contrary part, and ſuck fit nouriſhment for the plant, when as at the firſt they received it from the ſame. And this likewiſe muſt be the manner how all rootleſſe ſticks thruſt into the ground do grow.</p>
               <p>That there is a motion of ſap through the internal parts and pores of the wood appears plainly to the eye, in late pruning of vines, wherein theſe pores mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſhew themſelves, to give the only nouriſhment, whoſe paſſage between the wood and bark is here
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51977:63"/>
really ſtop't through the thinneſſe and binding drineſſe of the bark, whereby it will ſooner exhale then aſcend.</p>
               <p>If any branch (or limb) be cut off from other Trees alſo in the ſpring, there will be an exſudation (or weeping, which is the <hi>Lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae</hi> in <hi>Phyſick)</hi> throughout the whole wood of the remaining part of the branch even if the bark it ſelf ſhould be taken away. Now that there is likewiſe upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a motion (though preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) of ſap thus through the pores even downward too, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to my ſelf in an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience upon a Walnut-Tree, one of the roots whereof I cut off a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Tree, in the month of <hi>March,</hi> which within
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51977:63"/>
half an hours ſpace began to deſtil fromward the body of the Tree, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter then any ſpirit of wine can do in an Alembick, the bark during that ſpace was hardened by the air. This water therefore muſt needs come by deſcent from the ſeveral parts of the Tree, and not by any other way; neither could ſo great a quantity ly in the part of the root that remained on the Tree, for in three dayes ſpace the deſtillation was ſo great, that if the liquor had been weighed, it would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded that of the root in a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold proportion. In very young trees, who are of a nimbler growth, the ſubſtance encircling the pith is of a greeniſh colour, very tender &amp; ſpongy, through which (I ſuppoſe) a larger quantity of ſap doth paſſe, then doth in any other part beſide.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51977:64"/>
The cheifeſt uſe of the bark is to preſerve the ſap from the injury of the weather, (in the like manner as the skin doth the internal parts from external injuryes,) and in no wiſe adminiſtring moiſture to the body being it ſelf generated by a reſtagnation thereof, it's office in theſe tricks the clay and mould do ſupply.</p>
               <p>As for the ſap that was drawn in the ſpring &amp; <hi>Summer,</hi> part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is converted into leaves, new branches, and Fruit; part likewiſe after by an exſudation through the wood turneth firſt into a jelly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the bark and wood, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by ehe help of the heat in and about <hi>Summer</hi> ſolſtice, into wood it ſelf; and the remainder is imployed in dilating the old tree; ſo much of it only retaineth it's own old Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51977:64"/>
as ſerveth to keep the whole moiſt until the next ſpring.</p>
               <p>This manner of growth is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in that action of Woodmen, who, to know of what age any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood is, do cut off a ſtick <hi>(viz.</hi> of Hazel or Sallow) ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlope, and by telling the ſcaly orbes (which ſome men call colts I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they mean coats) do know the age of the wood; which orbes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo diſtinguiſhed, were there not every year a new one made by the hardened ſap. Theſe orbes in young ſticks may be ſeparated, but in old wood they ſcarce appear.</p>
               <p>There is one thing yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which (perhaps) may cauſe a diſſent from this my opinion, and that is an argument raiſed from grafting, the ſubſtance whereof is this; If there ariſeth little or no ſap
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51977:65"/>
between the bark and the wood, how cometh it to paſſe, that to make the graft grow, there ought ſuch a regard to be had to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the inwardeſt part of the bark of the graft ſo exactly to the inwardeſt part of the bark of the ſtock, and not to the wood of the ſame, which (according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding poſition) hath the largeſt quantity of ſap: To this an anſwer may be found in the foregoing words likewiſe; where 'tis ſaid, that part of the ſap, after an exſudation through the wood, turneth firſt into a jelly between the bark and the wood: which being granted, I can ſay, that the ſap, arriving at the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the wood there to generate a new orbe, doth in the reſtagnation ſeize upon and conjoine it ſelf to that moiſt part of the graft, that is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51977:65"/>
of affinity unto it; according to the maxime, which ſaith, That moiſt things are eaſily contained in others bounds, but very difficultly in their own, ſo that by this the graft is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed like other parts of the Tree. Now upon the cutting off the head of the ſtock, the woody part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of groweth dry on the ſuperficies of the wound; for that the ſap retireth another way, becauſe that, having no incloſure, it would pump the tree into a languiſhing condition, if not to death it ſelf; which if it do eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, yet would that weeping choak the graft, wherefore it leaveth the naked face of the wood devoid of moiſture: howbeit not reſting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of the preſerving the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the whole, it doth rally it's force on the borders or circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the wound, and aſſuming
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51977:66"/>
for it's armour a new filme, doth under the protection thereof by a rouling March at length cover the wounded place, rendring it the ſame defenſive cloathing, of which it had before been diveſted; whereby it happeneth, that the graft not being adopted, before the filme is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, is thruſt off the wood of the ſtock, and excluded as a ſtranger, to whom the ſtock hath no relation.</p>
               <p>But to proceed again according to the deſign of the Chapter. If a branch cannot be allured to grow by laying or otherwiſe, nor the tree afford ſuckers; then may a root be cut off from the tree, and left lying in the ground; as when it was on the tree: If it dy not, it will the next ſpring ſend forth ſeveral young ſhoots; by reaſon that the ſap which the root draweth, hath no way elſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51977:66"/>
to vent it ſelf, then by ſetting up new trees inſtead of the old one, from whence it was of late ſeclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Obſerve that ſuch ſuckers muſt the next autumn be cut half or three quarters through, cloſe to the old root; and cover well above with good mould, wherein they will that next <hi>ſummer</hi> ſhoot out roots ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent enough to maintain them in a removal the ſecond winter. If you ſhould the firſt year endeavour to tranſplant them, you would find but one ſingle root, and that joining to the old one, as its proper and ſole nurſe, for want of which, or ſome others in the room thereof, it may chance to wither; wherefore it is better to uſe them in ſuch ſort as I have declared.</p>
               <p>Some have adventured to cut down the whole tree ſomewhat
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51977:67"/>
within the ground, whereby every root contributeth to the making up of an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra-like company of young ones ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtump of the old; now if the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſort be plucked up, and the greater let ſtand, theſe will thrive extraordinarily.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happeneth, that before any root is cut off, or the tree felled, there doth a gallant number of upſtart cions ſpring from the roots of the tree, whereby the tree it ſelf pineth away through the diſability of the ſap, which cannot feed both young and old; wherefore in ſuch a caſe, where there is a deſire of multiplying that kind, there need no doubt to be made of cutting down the tree; For</p>
