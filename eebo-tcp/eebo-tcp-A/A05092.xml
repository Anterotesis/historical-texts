            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eneca</hi> the Philosopher (to whome without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, the learned among the Latines gaue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence for morall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie) saith in fewe words, but full of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that Fortune is neuer at rest; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that she vseth not to giue ioy without sadnesse, sweete without sowre, rest without labour, honour without enuie, and generally no felicitie vvithout his contrary: the vvhich novv I perceiue to be verified in my selfe. For vvhereas shee hath giuen me occasion of ioy
<pb facs="tcp:9848:3"/>
in offering mee an oportunity to shew my dutifull reuerence to your royall Maiestie, and also to our famous Citie, by your happy approach thither: thereby she hath made me sad and melancholious, in that she hath so much hastened your said coming, that I had not the leisure to prepare and file these hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred morall Emblemes, accompanied with an hundred staues of verses, expositors of the same: the which in their first inuention (such as they are) I dedicate to your most excellent Maiestie. But that your Maiestie may not blame me, in that (following the errour of the Gentiles and Ethnickes) I attribute to Fortune that which (as a Christian writing to a Christian Princesse) I ought to attribute to Gods prouidence: I say therefore, that your said happy comming depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded not any whit vpon fortune, but (euen as do all other humane actions) onely vpon Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who (as it is necessary to beleeue) doth all things for the best: and that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently your sayd coming hath not bene to me hastie, but for the best. Wherefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
<pb facs="tcp:9848:3"/>
the precedent with my selfe, I do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume humbly to present vnto your Maiestie my said Emblemes, although they haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but to halfe the number that I intended; beseeching your Maiestie to receiue them (such as they are) according to your accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med benignitie, and that with so good a will as they are by me your poore seruant offered and presented. Moreouer (Madame) it is not onely in our time that Emblemes are in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and singular regard, but it hath bene of ancient times and almost from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world: for the Egyptians (which thinke themselues to be the first people of the world) before the vse of letters, wrote by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures &amp; images, as well of men, beasts, fowles, and fishes, as of serpents, thereby expressing their intentions, as is written by most ancient authors, <hi>Chaeremon, Orus, Apollo,</hi> and the like, which haue laboured diligently and curiously to expound the saide hieroglyphicall figures: whereof likewise <hi>Lucan</hi> maketh mention in his <hi>Pharsalie,</hi> and <hi>Polyphile</hi> the author of the
<pb facs="tcp:9848:4"/>
Moderns, in the description of his dreame, <hi>Clius Rhodiginus</hi> in his commentaries of the ancient readings. <hi>Alciat</hi> hath likewise in our time set out certaine Emblemes, and adorned them with Latine verses. And I (imitating these abouesaid) esteem the time wel bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which I employed in the deuising &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of these saide Emblemes: and I shall think my selfe most happy, if the reading her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may yeeld you any honest recreation: pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God (most noble Princesse) that he will send you long life and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting happinesse.</p>
