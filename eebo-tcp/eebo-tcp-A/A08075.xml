         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (according as the cuſtome is,

               <p>Let it be, as be it may. Our high &amp;

the Vnited Netherlands, haue power

               <p>In this tytle of a Placcart, publiſhed
by authority of ſuch as haue not any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

               <p>1. The firſt is, the prohibition or

               <p>2. The ſecond is, that no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

            <sp>
               <speaker>The Hollander.</speaker>
               <p>So it is, and ſo enacted and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in the aſſembly of the aforenamed
<hi>High-mighty Lords the States generall,</hi> in
the <hi>Earles-Hage</hi> the ſix and twentith
day of February, in the yeare of ſixteen
hundreth &amp; two and twenty, and there
printed by <hi>Hillebrand Iabobſon,</hi> ſworne
printer vnto the High-mighty Lords
the States generall.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>Heerby I am brought to vnderſtand
that this Placcart of the High-minded
Lords the States is printed in the <hi>Earles-Hage,</hi>
Ergo, There is an Earle to
whome this <hi>Hage</hi> appertayneth, &amp; this
Earle notwithſtanding that he is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
iſſued and deſcended, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the true heyre vnto thoſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Earles, that haue gouerned there;
yet is he of new States which are no
Earles, wholy thurſt out, who haue
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21169:9"/>
now made thereof a <hi>States-Hage,</hi> but
muſt neuertheleſſe ſuffer it to continue
the name of an <hi>Earles-Hage</hi> in memory
of the true claime, which the Earle &amp;
owner thereof hath vnto it.</p>
               <p>Heere then is this Placcart printed
by <hi>Hillebrand Iacobſon,</hi> ſworne Printer
vnto the High-minded Lords the states:
wherby may be noted, that this ſworne
Printer vnto thoſe States, is not to leaue
out any lye that they ſhall pleaſe to giue
him in any Placcart of theirs to print,
for feare of being found periured.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Hollander.</speaker>
               <p>The Lords the States do giue him no
lyes to print.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>Doe they puniſh him when lyes are
found printed in their Placcarts?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Hollander.</speaker>
               <p>He is not puniſhed, becauſe no ſuch
lyes are found.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>They that know not a lye from a

truth or will not know it, fynd it not;
but they that can diſcerne vntruthes
from truthes, can find them out, albeit
they ſtand in eſtabliſhed Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of highly named Netherland States.
And ſurely, this muſt needes proue a
more lucky Placcart then many forgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
haue proued, if no lyes were to be
found in it, and eſpecially where there
is mention made of Ieſuytes, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall

            <sp>

               <p>Indeed the Ieſuytes in this Plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart
are called <hi>a pernicious &amp; murtherous
ſect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; that they of this ſect &amp; other priests,

their fals doctrine &amp; Idolatry, to an auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from their lawfull Superiours, to the

to instruct them in all kyndes of treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
them, thereby to preferre the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:21169:10"/>
                  <hi>and abſolute Domination of the King of

               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>Haue I not gheſſed right? I ſee now
that this Placcart will not for lacke of
lyes make any fore-going Placcart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed:
for heere they fall ſo faſt one
vpon another, that I had need of ſome
breathing tyme to note them.</p>
               <p>The Ieſuytes are heere named a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
and murtherous ſect, which
is a ſhamefull lye.</p>
               <p>That the Ieſuytes &amp; other Prieſts,
and ſpirituall named Perſons, of the
Romiſh religion, doe ſeeke to bring
the inhabitants through their falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

lye.</p>

to an auerſion from their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſuperiours, is a needleſſe lye, for the

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21169:10"/>
themſelues, haue already done the ſame.</p>
               <p>That they ſeeke to bring them to the
murthering of Princes and Potentates,
is a Diueliſh lye.</p>
               <p>That they inſtruct them to all kind
of treaſon agaynſt Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,
is a horrible lye.</p>
               <p>That they ſeeke, in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
to preferre the Tyranny of Spayn,
is a villanous lye.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>The Hollander.</speaker>
               <p>It is not inough to ſay that theſe

               <p>How els? Haue you but the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that I may haue tyme to doe it.</p>
               <p>Seeing then, that the Ieſuytes are
heere put in the firſt place, and called
by the Epithere of a pernicious &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous
ſect, and that they, and other
ſpirituall perſons, do ſeeke to procure
the murthering of Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates:
this alſo being a common ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21169:11"/>
and Calumny which dayly rydeth
on the ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine tonges of your <hi>Holland</hi>
Caluinian Miniſters. It is then need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to examine and call into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
what murthers of Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,
haue hapned in Chriſtendome
in this age of ours, and ſince the tyme
that the order of the Ieſuits by <hi>Saint Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius
de Loyola</hi> was founded.</p>
               <p>The number of Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,
that haue come to ſuch violent
and vnfortunate endes, I fynd to haue
byn eight.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe was the moſt Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
and Illuſtrious Lord, <hi>Melchior
Zobel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Herbipolis,</hi> and Duke of
<hi>Franconia</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> This Prince was
cruelly murthered, as he was going
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bridge, ouer the riuer of <hi>Mayne,</hi>
from the Citty of <hi>Herbipolis</hi> or <hi>Wirtz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge,</hi>
to the Caſtle where he held his
Court or Reſidence, which Caſtle is
neere vnto the ſayd Citty. His murther
was cauſed by a Gentleman of the ſame
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21169:11"/>
Countrey of <hi>Franconia,</hi> called <hi>Grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagh.</hi>
What kynd of Ieſuit this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was, reſteth in conſideration, for
Catholike he was not, but a profeſſor
of the new pretended reformation, and
ſo were alſo the actours which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in committing of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The ſecond in this vnfortunate
nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber was <hi>Henry,</hi> King of Scotland by
his mariage with <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Father to his Maieſty King <hi>Iames,</hi>
now King of England &amp; Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp;c.
This Prince was a Catholike, and was
murthered by a conſpiracy of Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
and by Caluiniſts which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
were imployed he is thought to
haue byn ſtrangled. Theſe then muſt
needes haue bin Caluiniſticall Ieſuites,
aſwell thoſe I meane that were of the
conſpiracy, as the executors of the fact,
for there was not one Catholike among
them.</p>
               <p>The third was <hi>Iames</hi> Earle of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:21169:12"/>
in Scotland, baſtard Brother vnto
<hi>Mary</hi> Queene of Scotland before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
He was a rebell and a perſecutour
of the Queene his Soueraygne, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
by the Fathers ſide: He forced her
to fly into England, and Tyrannically
vſurped the Gouernment of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
vntill the time that a Gentleman
named <hi>Hamilton</hi> ſlew him with a gun,
in the towne of <hi>Lithquo,</hi> when being
on horsbacke he was acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyed with
many Gentleman that came with him
to make his entry into that towne.
<hi>Hamilton</hi> notwithſtanding eſcaped and
fled into France. The Earle was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
Caluiniſt, and ſo was <hi>Hamilton</hi>
alſo that ſlew him. It may be that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
in France became a Catholike.
If the <hi>Holland</hi> Caluiniſts wil make a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuyte
of him, then muſt he haue byn a
Caluiniſticall Ieſuite when he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the fact; for Catholike-Ieſuite he
neuer was.</p>
               <p>The fourth in this number was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21169:12"/>
                  <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of Guyſe. This valiant
Prince ſeruing the King of France a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
his rebells, was by one <hi>Iohn Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trot,</hi>
who came behind him, ſhot throgh
the body with a piſtoll, as he was on
horſebacke in his iourney: &amp; it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the noting that this <hi>Poltrot</hi> being
well horſt, and hauing diſcharged his
piſtoll vpon the Duke, put ſpurres to
his horſe and made a way with all ſpeed
poſſible; and hauing ridden the whole
night, and not otherwiſe weening but
that he was many myles from the place
where he committed the murther, was
in the morning apprehended neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place where the deed was done.
If this <hi>Poltrot</hi> muſt now be made a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuyte,
he muſt then be a Geneuian Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuyte:
for Geneua was his ſchoole, and
<hi>Beza</hi> the Caluinian Rabbin, his ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayſter
that inſtructed him, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Prince.</p>
               <p>The fifth in this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber was <hi>William</hi>
of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> Prince of Orange, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21169:13"/>
in open rebellion agaynſt his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Soueraygne Lord, King <hi>Philip</hi>
ſecond of Spayne, the which by all
the lawes of the world is <hi>Crimen laeſae
maiestatis,</hi> was at <hi>Delfe</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> ſlayne
with a piſtoll by one <hi>Baltazar Gerard,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias
<hi>Seragh</hi> a Burgundian. Of what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
this Prince was, there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
but <hi>Baltazar,</hi> that ſlew him was
a Catholike: that he was a Ieſuyte was
neuer knowne, but if Caluiniſtes haue
gotten the skill to make him a Ieſuyte
eight and thirty yeares after his death,
who in his life was neuer any, it may be
regiſtred for a Caluiniſticall miracle.</p>
               <p>The ſixt in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber was <hi>Mary</hi> Queene
of Scotland, Mother vnto his Maieſty
that now is King of Scotland and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
&amp;c. This Princeſſe being an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and ſoueraygne Queene, &amp; being
enforced by her rebellious ſubiects, fled
into England, vpon hope and promiſe
to be by Queene Elizabeth ſuccoured.
She was with the Queene of England
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21169:13"/>
in good peace and amity, and was by
her through her letters inuyted for her
more defence and ſafety to come into
England; but ſo ſoone as ſhe was there
arriued, ſhe was layed handes on, and
detayned as a priſoner, directly againſt
all right and reaſon, and ſo detayned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the ſpace of twenty yeares. In all
which tyme, Queene Elizabeth did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo much as once vouchſafe to ſee
her, or heare her ſpeake. In the end
when ſhe accepted of the meanes that
was offered her for the eſcaping out of
her vniuſt impriſonment, ſhe was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
with an axe, by the hands of the
comon Hang-man; which moſt foule
and great murther was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the
euerlaſting diſhonour &amp; ſhame of falſe
Iuſtice, becauſe it was done vnder the
cloke and colour of true Iuſtice: for ſhe
being an abſolute &amp; Soueraigne Princes
of herſelfe, was no ſubiect vnto Queene
Elizabeth, or vnto her lawes, and yet
notwithſtanding ſhe was condemned
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21169:14"/>
as a criminall ſubiect. A moſt Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
example, of very murther, and
iniuſtice, vnto all enſuyng poſterity.
And moſt contrary to the doctrine of
Caluiniſts that will haue Princes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to no authority or power vpon
earth, but only vnto God, vnleſſe they
can heere make a God of Bul the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>This act doth the more remain to the
greater ſhame of the actors, becauſe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the committing therof, great bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyers
were made in the ſtreets, and the
belles rung, in manner of a triumph,
for ioy of obtaining ſome great victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>This Queene was a Catholike. The
Hangman that murthered her was a
Caluinian Proteſtant, whoſe handes
had byn imbrued in the bloud of diuers
Ieſuytes &amp; Prieſtes, in the raigne of the
forſayd Queene Elizabeth. If Holland
Caluiniſtes will now make a Ieſuyte of
of him, he muſt then be a Gewſe-refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21169:14"/>
Ieſuite, &amp; that can be no great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation
vnto them, ſeeing that May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Paul Bafous</hi> a hangman in <hi>Liuonia</hi>
or <hi>Liftland,</hi> left his office of hangman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and turned preacher of the Word,
according to the Holland reformation.</p>
               <p>Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the death of this holy Queen, the
Calumnies of Caluiniſts raiſed againſt
Ieſuytes, are contradicted in the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <l>OVR Caluinists of Ieſuites complayne,</l>
                  <l>That they of Kings and Princes killers be,</l>
                  <l>But if heerin they did not falſely fayne,</l>
                  <l>They muſt ſome ſuch, the world let know and ſee:</l>
                  <l>But ſince ſo much as one they do not show,</l>
                  <l>To what end then ſerues this Calumniation?</l>
                  <l>To ſeeme to hate for ſooth Prince-killing ſo,</l>
                  <l>As hauing thereof no imagination.</l>
                  <l>And that meane whyle they heerof others taxe,</l>

               </q>
               <p>The ſeauenth in this number is <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the third King of France, who after
he had cauſed <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Guyſe &amp;
his brother the Cardinall to be muthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
was murthered himſelfe by one
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21169:15"/>
                  <hi>Iacques Clement</hi> a lacobin or Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
Friar. This King was a Catholyke
&amp; ſo was alſo the Fryar that killed him.
If our Holland-Gewſes wil now make
a Ieſuyte of him that dyed in the habite
of a Dominican Fryar (for he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
killed by thoſe that then were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the King) they can do more then
the French Hugenots, who would as
fayne haue had him a Ieſuite as the
Holland-Gewſes would, but they muſt
notwithſtanding be contented to let
him be a Dominican Fryar, as he liued
and dyed.</p>
               <p>Heere can I not omit alſo to note,
that if ſo be, that for this fact of <hi>Iaques
Clement,</hi> the Caluiniſts ſhould giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Fryars of S. <hi>Dominikes</hi> order the
name of a Pernicious and Murtherous
Sect, or that they ſought to bring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
to the murthering of Princes, and
Potentates, they had in all truth done
the Religious men of this Order much
wrong: for there can be no reaſon that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21169:15"/>
a whole order ſhould beare the blame, &amp;
reproach of the fault, that one of the
ſame order hath committed, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the others were innocent. How
much leſſe reaſon can then be found,
that the Ieſuites (of whoſe order no one
was euer knowne that euer killed
Prince or other perſon) ſhould of ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
Gewſes be calumniated with
the name of a murtherous ſect, and to
be ſtirrers vp of the inhabitants of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
to the murthering of Princes and
Potentates: which were a greater pitty,
for the inhabitants of Holland to doe,
conſidering that Princes &amp; Potentates
are not among them in ſo great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
vnleſſe the meaning of the Plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart
ſhould be, that the Ieſuites and
Prieſtes, did intend to imploy the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of Holland to goe &amp; murther
Princes and Potentates in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys</p>
               <p>The eight and laſt of this vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
number and ranke, was <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21169:16"/>
fourth King of France, who was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by one <hi>Francis Rauaillac:</hi> and if ſo
be the Holland Gewſes will make of
him a Ieſuite alſo, yet the adminiſters
of Iuſtice in France, which are as far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
as thoſe of Holland, and haue
throughly enformed themſelues of this
mans condition and ſtate of life, and
done their vttermoſt endeauours to
come to the full knowledge of all that
might concerne the matter of the Kings
death, could neuer find that he ſo was.
And yet the ſharp-ſighted ſtates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
that can looke further into mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones
then other men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
who are the murtherers of Princes
and Potentates, in other Countreyes,
then the officers of Iuſtice themſelues,
in whoſe handes they happen to fall,
that commit ſuch criminall facts.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>The Hollander.</speaker>
               <p>But can there no Princes els be found
that haue byn killed or murthered ſince
the Ieſuites haue had ther beginning,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21169:16"/>
then only theſe you haue named?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>I know not of any more, but of this
number of eight. Marry heere by the
way is to be noted, that fiue of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
haue byn murthered by Caluiniſts,
and three by Catholikes: King <hi>Henry</hi>
3. King <hi>Henry</hi> 4. both Kings of France,
&amp; <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> Prince of Orange,
by Catholikes: <hi>Melchior Zobell</hi> Biſhop
of Wirtzburge and Duke of Franconia,
<hi>Henry</hi> King of Scotland, <hi>Iames</hi> Earle of
<hi>Murray, Francis</hi> Duke of Guyſe, and
<hi>Mary</hi> Queene of Scotland by Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.
And if thinges had ſucceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to intentions, Caluiniſts had,
had the honour to haue had ſix of theſe
eight to haue byn murthered by them:
for <hi>William</hi> Prince of Orange, before
named, was in very great poſſibility to
haue byn murthered by a Proteſtant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
and I wot not how many Zeland
States with him, to haue borne him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in the ayre, when he and they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21169:17"/>
ſhould haue byn blowne vp togeather
with gunpowder, wherof I may take
occaſion to ſpeake more anone. In the
meane time behold whether in this odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
buſyneſſe of Prince killing, Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts
haue not the precedence by oddes,
Notwithſtanding they cry out ſo lowd,
and ſo falſely vpon Ieſuites, giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the name of a pernicious and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſect, when themſelues in this foule
fact, fall fouleſt of all that therein are
to be touched, &amp; the Ieſuites not found
to be touched at all.</p>
               <p>Let all the world now iudge, to
whome it is, that the odious Epithete of
Prince-killing is beſt befitting, either
to Ieſuites or Calumiſts. Who might
not laugh at this mad accuſation, and
thinke that reformed Holland-Gewſes
are turned fooles, not knowing what
they ſay? They ſeeme through the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of their malice to be become
blind, and giue occaſion themſelues of
the manifeſtation of their owne ſhame
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21169:17"/>
which before lay vndiſcouered. What
ſtrange kindes of Ieſuites haue heere
byn found, among the murtherers of
Princes and Potentates? The Holland
Gewſe-reformed brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may heere ſee
what comes of lying. That their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
continew their lying in their pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits
I can in ſome ſort tollerate; the
poore fellowes haue charge of wife &amp;
children, their preaching is their trade
to liue by, and to mayntaine their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.
But the worſhipfull Lordes the
States to lye, and to publiſh lyes in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Placcarts, that indeed is ſomwhat
to groſſe: you may pleaſe to excuſe me
for beeing ſo free with your Lords and
States, Becauſe
<q>
                     <l>He that ſpeaketh what he ſhould not,</l>
                     <l>Muſt heare for his anſwer what he wold not.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Me thinkes they that practiſe lying,
ſhould in reaſon become more cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning,
then to make lyes that are ſo groſſe and
palpable, and doe indeed bring credit
and reputation to Ieſuites, and ſhame
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21169:18"/>
vnto themſelues that ſpred them: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
it is found that when any one
is accuſed and afterward found inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
the accuſer is curſed and hated, &amp;
the falſe accuſed pittyed, beloued, and
belieued.</p>
               <p>Theſe Caluinian Calumniatours
will ſeeme by calling Ieſuites &amp; Prieſts
the murtherers of Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,
as if they (poore innocent ſoules)
were becom great Care-takers for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
&amp; Potentates ſafeties. This ſurely is
a very ſuddainly-growne-vp affection:
they were not wont to be ſo, for me
thinks it is not ſo long ago that Princes
can haue forgotten, that at ſuch tyme
as their ſubiects rebelled againſt them,
the good Holla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d-Gewſes were alwayes
readier to aſſiſt their rebelles agaynſt
them, then them againſt their rebelles. I
muſt needes acknowledge ſome reaſon
why it ſo ſhould be, &amp; that is, that <hi>ſimile
gaudet ſimili,</hi> &amp; if at this day any Princes
find this to be true, themſelues know
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21169:18"/>
it beſt: But further to manifeſt their
good affection to Princes, we are to
note that it hath not only byn ſhewed
in the fiue aforenamed, who they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therouſly
haue bereft of their liues, but
alſo in ſome vnto whome euen after
their deathes they haue ſhewed indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and villany, as vnto <hi>William</hi> the
Conqueror King of England who was
buryed at <hi>Cane</hi> in <hi>Normandie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where the
French-Hugenotes in their Rebellion
in the yeare 1562. vnder conduct of
<hi>Chaſtilian,</hi> when they tooke this towne,
and ſpoyled the Churches, they brake
open the tombe of this great Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querer,
and threw his bones about the ſtreets.</p>
               <p>At Orleans, where they alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
their Church-robbery and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege,
they brake open the tombe of
King <hi>Lewys</hi> the eleuenth, and burnt
his bones.</p>
               <p>The bones of <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of Ango<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſme
Father to King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of
France, who for his vertue &amp; deuotion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21169:19"/>
deuotion was reputed as a Saint, they
ſuffered not to reſt in his ſepulcher, but
threw them out. This hate may haue
proceeded of two cauſes, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was a Prince, the other (&amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
the greateſt) becauſe of his Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for to the bones of Saints or holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
haue Caluiniſts ſhewed ſo great hatred,
that at <hi>Towres</hi> they tooke the bones of
the holy Biſhop Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> and the
bones of the holy Saint <hi>Francis</hi> of Paula,
and ioyning vnto theſe bones the body
of a dead Aſſe, they burnt all three
togeather, to the end Catholiks ſhould
not ſaue any part of the bones or aſhes
for reliques, and yet to make more ſure
worke, they did caſt all the aſhes into
the riuer of <hi>Loire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They would alſo haue broken down
&amp; wholy deſtroyed the Abbey of S <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
in France, withall the tombes of the
Kings of France that there are buried,
but that the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> who then
was their chiefe, was faine to preuent
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21169:19"/>
it, by appointing a Guard about the
Abbey, which he did in regard that he
was deſcended from ſome of the Kings
that there lye buryed.</p>
               <p>The Caluiniſts of Scotland haue
deſtroyed the Tombes of the Kings of
that Countrey, aſwell in the Abbey of
<hi>Dunfermeling,</hi> as in the Abbey of the
<hi>Holy Croſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Bruxelles, when the Caluinian
Gewſes had their domination there,
they opened the vault in the Church
of S. <hi>Godula,</hi> where ſome of the Dukes
of <hi>Brabant</hi> were buryed; and brake
open the leaden cheſts, and threw out
their bones.</p>
               <p>Theſe are acts of Caluinian refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
louers of Princes, that not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
againſt them, and murther them,
but when they are dead endure not that
their bodyes may quietly remaine in
their ſepulchers. Are not theſe good te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
of the great affection, that
theſe reformed brethren beare vnto
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21169:20"/>
Princes and Potentates? Surely Kings,
Princes, and Potentates, may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
of the great change in theſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
who ſo ſuddainly are become ſo
great Care-takers for their ſafties. But
becauſe there is no appearance that
Princes and Potentates will ſend their
Ambaſſadors into <hi>Holland,</hi> to thanke
them for their care; it ſeemes they can
ſmell, it is but a diſſembled care, and
that they doe not heerin giue credit,
vnto thoſe reformed, or deformed Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>The Hollander.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee not for all this, that Ieſuytes
are welcome to all Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>They are welcome to all thoſe that
beſt know them, but it is no wonder
that ſuch as are miſinformed by lying-teachers,
and haue no good affection
to Catholike religion, haue an auerſion
from Ieſuites, for they neither know
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21169:20"/>
them, nor yet come to heare any right
report of them, from the mouthes of
thoſe that truly know their piety, and
vertuous conuerſation. But to the end
you may know whether the greateſt
Princes of Chriſtendome do know and
reſpect them or no, I will heere for the
better knowledge of the ignorant, and
in oppoſition to thoſe that out of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
malice doe calumniate them,
make it briefly to appeare, in what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
and reputation they ſtand with
thoſe aforeſaid Princes: that thereby
their Caluinian Maligners, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
may ſee what they haue profitted
by their ſo loud barking againſt them,
in Placcarts, in pulpits, in pamphlets, &amp;
all kind of detraction.</p>
               <p>Yet with proteſtation before God,
that I do this, and haue reſolued to doe
it, wholy of my ſelfe, without being
thereunto deſyred, moued, or counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by any Ieſuite in the world, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Ieſuite my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:21169:21"/>
Let vs then begin with his Holines,
<hi>Gregory</hi> the Fifteenth, now Pope, at this
preſent, who choſe for his Confeſſor
Cardinall <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> of the Society of
IESVS.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> now rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gning,
hath to his Confeſſor a Ieſuite.</p>
               <p>The moſt Chriſtian King of France
hath to his Confeſſour a Ieſuyte.</p>
               <p>The victorious King of Polonia, hath
to his Confeſſor a Ieſuite.</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Princes Electors,
with the Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> and almoſt
all the Catholike Princes and Prelates
of Germany, haue to their confeſſours
Ieſuites. And ſo haue in like manner
the greateſt Prelates and Princes of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>And albeit his Catholike Maieſty
of Spayne hath no Ieſuite to his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſour,
but a Friar of the Dominicans ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to an ancient cuſtome, of ſome
former Kings of Spayne; yet is he very
much affected to the Ieſuites, of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21169:21"/>
which one was confeſſor to his mother;
and his Brother and Siſter haue vnto
their Confeſſour a Ieſuite called Father
<hi>Ieronimo de Florentia,</hi> whome King
<hi>Philip</hi> the third, of glorious memory,
Father vnto the preſent King <hi>Philip</hi> the
fourth, cauſed to come vnto him for his
conſolation in his greateſt ſicknes, and
to remaine with him till he gaue vp the
Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>So haue alſo many of the greateſt
Prelates and Princes of his Court, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
to their Confeſſours. In like ſort
haue the principalleſt Prelates &amp; Princes
in the Court of the Emperour, in the
Court of the King of France, and in the
court of the King of Polonia &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Are the Ieſuites murtherers of
Princes and Potentates, and haue the
greateſt Princes and Potentates of all
Chriſtendome, no more feare of them,
then to admit them daily in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?
To make choice of them as of
thoſe eſpeciall perſons vnto whom they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21169:22"/>
reueale the ſecrets of their ſoules &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences?
This is no ſigne that they beliue
Caluiniſts, &amp; hold Ieſuites for Prince-killers,
but a manifeſt token, that they
hold Caluiniſts for falſe accuſers, and
Ieſuites for true ſeruantes of Chriſt,
whoſe great learning &amp; vnderſtanding,
accompanyed with true religious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
with a well tempered diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and all kinde of vertue, theſe
Princes owne experience hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
taught them to diſcerne. I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
deſire Caluiniſts to ceaſe from ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating
Ieſuites: they doe heereby
make themſelues the more knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Catholike Princes &amp; Potentates for
malicious Calumniatours. Caluiniſts
cannot teach Catholike Princes to
know Ieſuites, becauſe they are ſure
they know them better then Caluiniſts
can know them, and Caluiniſts better
then otherwiſe they ſhould, by their
calumniating them.</p>
               <p>Heere ſtandeth it alſo to be noted,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21169:22"/>
that ſome Princes who haue diſpoſed
themſelues to abandon the world, and
to ſerue God in religious ſtate of life,
haue become Ieſuites. As the Duke of
<hi>Gandia</hi> in <hi>Spayne, Aloiſius Gonzaga,</hi>
ſonne &amp; heyre vnto <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Marquis
of <hi>Castillion,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bouino</hi> in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly.
And now of late <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nayne</hi>
Prince, and Biſhop of <hi>Verdune,</hi>
Prince of the Empire, and Coſin
to his Maieſty of England, with ſundry
other great and noble perſons. Now is
it in all reaſon to be conſidered that if
ſuch noble Men and Princes, who for
no other reſpect then the meere loue &amp;
ſeruice of God, entred into this Society,
ſhould not therin haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the deuout
&amp; godly life of theſe Fathers, with ſuch
exerciſe of learning &amp; vertue, not to be
in all reſpects conforme to the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which they had conceaued therof,
before they came among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there can
be no doubt, but they wold haue depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, albeit they had made proofe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21169:23"/>
of their conuerſation for ſome yeares
togeather, for that this Order doth not
oblige profeſſion to be made at the end
of one yeares probation, but alloweth
an vnlimited tyme of more yeares.</p>
               <p>Conſidering with my ſelfe what
great perſons in this our age (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all ſlaunders that calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aduerſaries haue rayſed againſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,
Prieſts, &amp; Friars &amp;c.) haue aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
the world, religiouſly to ſerue
God in pouerty, chaſtity, &amp; obedience,
in ſundry Orders, and that a Duke hath
byn ſeene to become a Capuchin in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
and the Brother of a Duke to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the ſame auſtere order in <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xelles,</hi>
I was mooued to thinke that it
may belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before we may ſee a Gewſe
or Caluinian Duke, or Prince become a
Miniſter, albeit that condition of life
obligeth not to the making and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of any ſuch vowes, or to any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
at all, but to liue with eaſe, in
the Ghoſpell of free liberty. There is a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21169:23"/>
prouerbe in the Netherland language,
that <hi>Herman</hi> did in tyme get on his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet,
after he had byn ſeauen yeares
drawing on of one ſleeue; but I ſuppoſe
<hi>Hermans</hi> dublet might wholy be gotten
on, and quite worne out, before a man
might ſee, ſuch perſons moued by the
great piety they might obſerue in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
to enter with them into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of the Word.</p>
               <p>But to returne vnto my precedent
purpoſe, me thinkes it were not heere
impertinent to ſee, and conſider what
cauſe there may be found of the great
hatred which Caluiniſts beare vnto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuytes
(and not Caluiniſts alone but all
other Sectaryes,) for albeit they beare il
will and hatred vnto all Catholikes, &amp;
eſpecially vnto all Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
yet is it manifeſt vnto al the world
that the Ieſuites of all others haue the
precedence in the malice of Caluiniſts.
And ſeeing ſomething there may ſeeme
to be, that is ſingular in theſe religious
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21169:24"/>
men, more then in others I haue the
more endeauored to diſcerne what this
may be, and three thinges I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
               <p>1. This firſt is, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any Order in the Catholik Church,
that in ſo ſhort a ſpace hath diſperſed it
ſelfe ſo farre ouer the world, to make
the name of Ieſus Chriſt knowne vnto
heathen and Pagan people.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond is, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any Order that in ſo ſhort a tyme,
hath written ſo many learned bookes,
aſwel in diuinity, as in al other laudable
ſciences.</p>
               <p>3. The third is that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any Order, that in ſo ſhort a tyme
hath had ſo great a number of Martyrs,
aſ well by the perſecution of Pagans, as
Apoſtata Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>As for their exerciſes of deuotion,
labour in preaching, hearing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
inſtructing and bringing vp
of youth in learning, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21169:24"/>
of their parents, making of
attonements where there is diſſention
and diſcord, readines at all houres of the
day and night, to viſit the ſicke, and
to conſolate their ſoules, is not now
needfull heere to be ſpoken at large: but
when I well conſider their manifold
deedes of Deuotion and Charity, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the wordes of Chriſt vnto the
Iewes, when for his good deedes they
would haue ſtoned him to death, <hi>I haue
wrought many good workes among you: for
which of thoſe will you stone me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Enuy is the deadly enemy of vertue
and of wel-proſpering. The Ieſuites
thankes be to God, do go well forward
in al their works of piety; and for theſe,
Sectaryes will ſtone them: and beeing
themſelues the actual murtherers of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuytes,
it is no maruell that they ſeeke
to robbe &amp; tak away the good name &amp;
fame of thoſe, whoſe lyues they let not
to take away: nor is it any wonder, that
they to coulour their owne tyrannous
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21169:25"/>
murthering of Ieſuites, giue out that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuytes
are murtherers of Princes &amp; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates:
As if themſelues did put Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
to death, therby to ſaue the lyues
of Princes &amp; potentates which Ieſuites
would els bereaue them off. But what
loue Caluiniſts, and principally Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-Gewſe-Caluiniſtes
do beare vnto
Princes, themſelues doe now adayes,
the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger the more, make better known
vnto the greateſt Princes of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
then they can make knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, that Ieſuites are murtherers of
them, and of Potentates.</p>

               <speaker>The Hollander.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt confeſſe, that you haue heere
manifeſted vnto me much more then
before I euer knew, or heard of. But
yet, notwithſtanding that it cannot be
perceaued, that the Ieſuites haue had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the deaths of any of the eight
Princes heere by you mentioned, it
ſhould ſeeme they haue had knowledge
of intentions of murthering Princes, as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21169:25"/>
of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of England, King
<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of France, before he
was murthered by <hi>Rauaillac,</hi> his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
that is now King of <hi>Great Britayne,</hi>
by the gunpowder Treaſon, &amp; his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>For the firſt, concerning Queene
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> of England, if we well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
her abandoning of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Religion, which at her corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhe ſwore to mayntayne, and that
beeing a woman, ſhe tooke vpon her
ſupreame authority in Eccleſiaſticall
cauſes (which your Caluinian deuines
in Holland do affirme to be Idolatry ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in man or woman) ordayning alſo
by her Statutes, that thoſe who ſhould
deny to confeſſe her Eccleſiaſticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
vpon their oathes, ſhould ſuffer
death as traytors: That ſhe depoſed and
put from their places, the Catholike Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Prelates, caſting ſome in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
&amp; forcing others to fly the realme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:21169:26"/>
That ſhe ordayned a forfayture of
twenty poundes a moneth, for not
comming to her Caluinian-proteſtant
Church-ſeruice, with other leſſer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faytures
for Catholikes of leſſe meanes,
who in regard of their conſciences ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
themſelues from the ſayd ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice;
by meanes whereof the priſons e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
where became ſo repleniſhed with
Catholikes, that new priſons muſt be
made for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe the old could not
conteyne the number.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the putting to death of
ſo many Catholike Prieſtes, as alſo the
putting to death, and ruyning of ſome
Gentlemen, and others that had harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them.</p>
               <p>The queſtion now is whether
Gewſes or Caluiniſts being to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſo treated by any Prince that had
ſworne to maintayne their Caluinian
religion, they would with patience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
it? Who can belieue this? Seeing
they haue not letted to rebell agaynſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21169:26"/>
their Princes and Soueraignes that haue
intruded no innouation, or change in
religion vpon them, as agaynſt the
Kings of Spaine, &amp; France, and againſt
<hi>Mary</hi> Queene of Scotland: who I ſay
can belieue this, when it is apparent
that the very ground-worke and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Caluinian religion is layed &amp;
ſetled vpon rebellion, as to all the world
it is manifeſt.</p>
               <p>This Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was ſo
ſeuere and cruell, that ſhe letted not to
burne alyue ſome of our countrey-men,
beeing Netherlanders, &amp; not her borne
Subiects, for their Anabaptiſme; and
cauſed ſome Puritans which are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concurring in religion with the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſts
of Holland, to be hanged, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to fly the realme, and lyue in exile,
becauſe they had ſought both by wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and preaching, to bring the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of England to the iuſt forme and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of that of Geneua, &amp; Holland.
Puniſhing then, the Anabaptiſtes as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21169:27"/>
and the Puritans as ſeditious,
ſhe hath not letted to vſe a greater cloke
and colour for her perſecuting of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
and this was, to cauſe to be
giuen out at diuers times, that they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
to kill her.</p>
               <p>She imployed among other for one
of her ſpyes, ſometyme in France, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme
in Italy one <hi>William Parry,</hi> This
<hi>Parry</hi> coming vpon a tyme out of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſuppoſing to get more credit and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
came vnto her and told her,
that at his being in Italy where he bare
himſelfe as a Catholike (hauing leaue
ſo to do) he there demaunded of a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuyte,
if it ſhould be a deed well done to
kill the Queene, and that the Ieſuyte
anſwered yea, &amp; that thereupon he had
promiſed the Ieſuyte to do it. <hi>Parry</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then demaunded, if he had not in
his trauayles abroad, byn acquaynted
with one Father <hi>William Criton</hi> a Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
Ieſuyte (who at that tyme was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
in the Tower of <hi>London</hi>) he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21169:27"/>
yea. Being then demaunded if
he had asked the ſame queſtion of the
ſayd Father <hi>Criton,</hi> he anſwered he had,
but that Father <hi>Criton</hi> had diſſwaded
him from it: he thought belike that if he
had anſwered yea, he ſhould haue byn
brought face to face with Father <hi>Criton,</hi>
who might haue conuinced &amp; ſhamed
him, and therefore he thought it eaſier
for him to bely a Ieſuyte that was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
then one that was preſent. Father
<hi>Criton</hi> within a whyle after was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret
out of the Tower, and the rather for
that he was a Scotſman &amp; no borne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
howbeit he was banniſhed out of
the Countrey. <hi>Parry,</hi> becauſe of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
in matter of ſpiery, ſolicited to
haue a place and office that now was
fallen vaca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: the place was giuen to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<hi>Parry</hi> grew malecontent, and
caſt out wordes of murmuration. The
Earle of <hi>Leyceſter</hi> loued him not, he was
known and diſcouered among the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
for a ſpy, &amp; that he had broght
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21169:28"/>
diuers principall Catholikes in trouble:
&amp; being thus diſcouered he was grown
out of date, and vnable to do ſeruices of
the ſame kind, as he had formerly done;
<hi>Parry</hi> was apprehended, and charged
he had an intention to kill the Queene:
in fine he was hanged, and this was at
laſt the reward he got for the good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
he had done. The reaſon why he
was hanged, ſeemeth to haue byn, that
if they had let him liue, &amp; not giuen
him liuing according to his deſyre, he
might haue diſcouered many ſecrets: he
wrote a letter vnto the Queene out of
the Tower, wherin among other things
he ſayd vnto her: <hi>Pitty poore Parry, and
relieue him, for life without liuing is not fit
for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no cuſtome that a criminall
offender, and in ſo haynous a matter as
the murthering of a Prince, ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wryte to be ſet at liberty, but to be
prouided of meanes to liue by. He knew
well that they knew, that the counſell
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21169:28"/>
which he ſaid was giuen him by a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite
in Italy, was but an inuention
of his owne head for the more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
perſecuting of ſuch, as might be
found to haue receaued Ieſuytes into
their howſes (of the confiſcation of
whoſe goods <hi>Parry</hi> might haue had his
ſhare) but it ſo fell out, that <hi>Parry</hi> play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wily-beguyle himſelfe. For when
he came to the gallovves, and ſavv
how the matter went, he grew ſo
ill contented, that he plainly ſayd, that
the Queene after his death would ſay,
that ſhe had loſt the beſt keeper of her
parke.</p>
               <p>Some yeares after the death of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
one <hi>Edward Squyre</hi> was alſo han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
who as it was giuen out, did meane
to poyſon the Queene &amp; Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
(who afterward by the ſayd Queene
was put to death.) This <hi>Equire</hi> came out
of Spayne, and ſayd that a Ieſuyte there
had cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelled him to poiſon the Queen,
and the Earle. The poyſon he ſayd was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21169:29"/>
deliuered him in a bladder in <hi>Spayne,</hi> &amp;
there with he ſhould annoint the ſaddle
wheron the Earle ſhould ryde, and the
chayre wherin the Queene ſhould ſit.
This muſt haue byn a very wonderfull
poyſon, that a chayre &amp; a ſaddle being
but annoynted therewith, it would kill
thoſe who ſhould ſit in the one, &amp; ride
on the other.</p>
               <p>Who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not thinke this to be a moſt
palpable lye? how muſt he then ſpeed
that muſt bring this forcefull poyſon in
a bladder (if any bladder could contein
it) and anoynt it on the chayre and on
the ſaddle? But the lying fooliſh knaue
that came with this tale in his mouth,
vpon hope of reward, becauſe he would
not performe the buſines, but diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it, was notwithſtanding rewarded
at Tiburne with a halter, which was
held neceſſary, becauſe it might be
thought the Queene had much reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
ſuſtaine the quarrell of the Hollanders;
ſeeing Spayne ſo much hated her, that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21169:29"/>
murtherers were ſent from thence for
her deſtruction: for <hi>Squyre</hi> was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
by the force and torment of the
racke, to intend &amp; meane the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that himſelfe came to reueale, and
ſo was hanged, notwithſtanding he
was a good Proteſtant.</p>
               <p>As concerning the conſtant and
glorious Martyr Father <hi>Edmund Campi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
who with others (to wit thirteene
in number) was condemned for hauing
in Rome, and Rhemes conſpired the
Queens death, as a couple of moſt falſe
witneſſes affirmed, is as ſhamefull and
vniuſt a matter, as euer any did paſſe
by way and courſe of Iuſtice: for after
theſe falſe witneſſes, had taken their
oathes, that theſe thirteene perſons had
at Rome, and Rhemes on ſuch and ſuch
days, of ſuch &amp; ſuch moneths, of ſuch a
yeare, conſpired the Queens death, one
Mayſter <hi>Thomas Lancaſter</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and one Mayſter <hi>William Nicol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
being there preſent, and both cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit-worthy
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21169:30"/>
perſons, did offer to proue
by diuers witneſſes, that ſome of
theſe thirteen perſons had not byn out
of <hi>England</hi> that yeare, wherin the falſe
witneſſes had ſworne they conſpired
the Queens death in Rome, &amp; Rhemes:
&amp; that they had not bin out of England
in ſome yeares, both before that yeare
and after it: and the priſoners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
proteſted at the Barre, on their
ſoules, that in all the dayes of their lyues
they had neuer byn all togeather at one
tyme in one place, but only there that
very day. And albeit the proteſtation
and offer of proofe made by the two
perſons before named, had byn ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in all law and iuſtice throughout
the world to haue diſcouered theſe falſe
witneſſes, and to haue cauſed them to
haue had their deſerued puniſhment, yet
proceeded the Iudges forward in iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and condemned Father <hi>Edmund
Campian,</hi> &amp; almoſt all the reſt to death,
as being culpable of that conſpiration,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21169:30"/>
whereof by theſe falſe witneſſes they
were accuſed. But at this we need not
wonder if we conſider what the Iuſtice
was of this Queene, who letted not to
make a law, directly contrary to the law
of God and all the world, that one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
only ſhould be ſufficient, for the
condemnation of a man to the loſſe of
life and goods, if it were in a caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
herſelfe: which without all
doubt may cauſe wonderful iniuſtice in
a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey where ſuch perſidious people
are inough to be found, as for reward
will not make ſcruple to take any oath,
agaynſt whoſoeuer it be, let the cauſe be
what it will: and the more in the cauſe
of the Prince, whereby hope of fauour
and greater reward, is giuen. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the hiſtory of this glorious mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
and of thoſe others alſo that were
with him condemned, is publiſhed to
the world in Print in the Latin tongue,
I ſhall not need in this matter further
to enlarge my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:21169:31"/>
That King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
was hurt by one <hi>Iohn Chaſtell</hi> at Paris
who meant to haue killed him ſome
years before he was killed by <hi>Rauaillac,</hi>
is knowne to all the world. This <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell,</hi>
had ſomtyme byn a ſcholler in the
ſchooles of the Ieſuytes, <hi>Ergo</hi> ſay the
Hugenotes, the Ieſuytes inſtructed
him to murther the King. Surely a
very fayre concluſion: Many youthes
go to other ſchooles, wherof ſome come
afterward to comit criminall offences,
as treaſons, murthers, thefts, and the
like; is it not a good argument &amp; great
reaſon, that for this their School-mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
muſt be puniſhed or defamed?</p>
               <p>The fact of <hi>Chaſtell</hi> came to be
iudged &amp; looked into by certayne Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litykes,
and great enemyes of Ieſuites,
and in a fury the Ieſuytes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
out of <hi>Paris,</hi> a Piramide was
erected in memory of this fact, and in
accuſation of the Ieſuites, the Ieſuites
patiented this Calumny, vntill tymes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21169:31"/>
daughter might be admitted to haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
which in the end ſo came to
paſſe, that this King (thankes be vnto
God) vnto whoſe view the Ieſuites had
byn by their Hugenotes and Politike
backe-friends ſo vgly painted out, and
deſcribed, receaued at their handes ſo
great ſatisfaction of their innocency,
that he not only cauſed the Fathers of
this Society to be receaued agayne into
<hi>Paris,</hi> and cauſed the ſcandalous <hi>Pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide</hi>
to be raced downe to the ground;
but by many benefits done by him vnto
theſe Fathers, beſides the erecting for
them the fayreſt Church and Colledge
they haue in all France, he ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
their very great affectioned &amp; true
Friend: yea he made choyſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to be
the preceptors and ſcoole-maiſters vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the world that he held them not for euil
inſtructors of youth, as they had byn

greater teſtimony of theſe Fathers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyting,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21169:32"/>
from this great calumny?</p>
               <p>Let vs now come vnto his Maieſty
the preſent King of great Britaine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the acculation of Father <hi>Henry
Garnet</hi> in the matter of the gun-powder
treaſon. This treaſon was without all
doubt, a moſt wicked intention of ſome
Catholikes, that with patience would
not endure the perſecution which ſo
many of their Catholike-brethren had
ſo long, &amp; ſo patiently endured, and as
the good Chriſtians in the perſecutions
of the Roman Emperous alſo did. But
who wotteth, whether this might not
be a deuice, firſt practiſed in the ſubtill
brayne of the Secretary, <hi>Sir Robert Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
who by ſome ſubtill deuice might
get it put into the heades of ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
aſwell as the Secretary Sir

one <hi>Polie</hi> a favgned Catholik, to
draw thoſe Gentlemen into the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
of deliuering out of durance <hi>Mary</hi>
Queene of Scotland his maieſties mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21169:32"/>
that now raygneth: by which
meanes of thoſe Gentleman came all to
loſe their hues, and that good Queene
alſo. But let that be, as be it might. One
of thoſe Catholikes that was priuy to
the ſayd powder treaſon, confeſſed on
the torture, that he had in confeſſion
giuen Father <hi>Garnet</hi> knowledge of the
matter. He ſayd not that Father <hi>Garnet</hi>
was one of the conſpirators, or that he
animated him, or any of them vnto it,
but to the contrary, that he had earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſwaded him from it. They were put
to death: Father <hi>Garnet</hi> was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
he was accuſed to haue byn priuy
to the treaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that he had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
it. Father <hi>Garnet</hi> anſwered that
he might not in any ſort vtter ought
that was reuealed vnto him in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
for ſecrecy of all that which is vttered
in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion muſt euer be an inuiolable
precept in the Catholike Church: for
the prieſt that ſhould do the contrary is
to be degraded, and to be ſhut vp,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21169:33"/>
and put to pennance all the dayes of
his life.</p>
               <p>But Father Garnet declared that he
was ſo earneſt in forbidding him to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this foule fact, that he denyed to
giue him abſolution, vnleſſe he would
deſiſt from this intention: what could
the Father haue done more, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
had byn againſt the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?</p>
               <p>Thus then was this innocent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
put to death, not for that he was
a conſpiratour or actour in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but becauſe he would not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the ſtrong ſeale and obligation of
the holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion, which

               <p>It hapned at ſuch tyme as the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinian-Gewſes

ſuffer death, &amp; that he had put the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the ſaid ſentence in the hands
of any ſuch perſon or perſons as would
vndertake it: He thereupon counſelled
and perſwaded a young fellow that was
his ſeruant, called <hi>Iohn de Iauregny</hi> borne
in Biſcay, to performe this act. But
when this <hi>Iauregny</hi> was ready to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, the aforeſayd <hi>Enastro</hi> his may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
got himſelfe out of the way. <hi>Iau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regny</hi>
with a piſtoll ſhot the Prince of
Orange through the checkes, whereof
he dyed not, but <hi>Iauregny</hi> was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
killed by ſome of the Prince his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants:
heerupon enquiry being made,
it was vnderſtood that <hi>Iauregny</hi> did vſe
to go to confeſſion to one Father <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21169:34"/>
Timmerman,</hi> a religious man of the
order of <hi>S. Dominicke.</hi> This Religious
man was apprehended and asked what
<hi>Iohn de Iauregny</hi> had vttered vnto him
in Confeſſion. The Religious Father
well knowing the ſtrict commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Catholike Church, that
nothing that is vttered in confeſſion
muſt be reuealed, made anſwere that
he knew not; becauſe that he indeed
did know nothing, concerning this
mans confeſſion that he might vtter.
His examiners then cauſed him to be
hanged by his thumbes, with weightes
faſtned to his toes, to force him by this
torture to reueale vnto them what had
by <hi>Iauregny</hi> byn reuealed vnto him in
confeſſion; but the Reuerend and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Father, would in no ſort violate
therein the law and commaundment of
the vniuerſall Church of God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
whyle he hung in this great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he called vpon God, ſaying out
of the 140. Pſalme, <hi>Keep o Lord my mouth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21169:34"/>
and my lipps, that I ſinne not with my
tongue.</hi> Heerupon they ſentenced him
to death, and to the deuiding of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
into foure quarters: which death &amp;
martyrdome he conſtantly endured.</p>
               <p>Of the before-mentioned Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-treaſon,
was alſo accuſed Father
<hi>William Baldwine,</hi> of the SOCIETY
of IESVS. This Father as he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
in Germany was by <hi>Frederike</hi> the
fourth, then Palſgraue of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
neere vnto <hi>Franckendale,</hi> &amp;
by him ſent priſoner vnto the Amba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſador
of his Maieſty of England, then
reſident at <hi>Duyſeldorp</hi> in the Countrey
of Cleue. And worthy it is to be noted,
that on the very ſame day that this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was deliuered into the handes of
the Engliſh Ambaſſadour at <hi>Duyſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorp,</hi>
the ſayd <hi>Palſgraue</hi> dyed at <hi>Heydel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge,</hi>
&amp; ſo came to taſt of death him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
ſooner then the Father, which he
intended to ſend to the ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>The Father was carryed into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21169:35"/>
where after he had remayned
priſoner many yeares in the Tower of
London, and not the leaſt point in the
world could be proued againſt him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the aforeſayd Treaſon, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that in ſome printed
bookes it was publiſhed that he was
culpable) he was at laſt deliuered out of
priſon, and diſmiſſed the Realme.</p>
               <p>Concerning one <hi>Peter Pan,</hi> ſayd
to be ſent by the Ieſuytes of <hi>Ipres</hi> in
Flanders to kill Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
the matter hath byn throughly
examined, and the Calumny rayſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
thoſe Fathers ſufficiently refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to be falſe. <hi>Peter Pan</hi> was knowne to
be a fellow that was frantike, but the

him out of the handes of the Holland-hangman:
for the Iuſtice of Holland
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21169:35"/>
found it wiſdome, to put this poore
foole to death.</p>
               <p>I truſt I haue heere cleerly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
how the Ieſuites haue by their
Caluinian enemyes byn moſt falſly
calumniated: and albeit that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
do in ſuch caſes recomend their
cauſe to God, diſpoſing themſelues to
beare with patience all iniuryes, for the
loue of CHRIST IESVS, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they well know how falſe they
are: yet my ſelfe euen of zeale vnto
truth and equity, could not omit to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thus much, vpon the occaſion now
giuen.</p>
               <p>The cuſtome of giuing out, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
and Prieſts do intend to murther
Princes, was firſt take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp in England &amp;
put in practiſe by ſome of Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi>
Caluinian Counſellers, who to
haue the better colour to perſecute Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
whome they feared might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
to faſt, as alſo to make them the
leſſe compaſſionate of the people, did
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21169:36"/>
ſeeke to make them odious by ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giuing out that they went about to
kill the Queen. But that the ſayd Queen
and her Counſellers themſelues did not
belieue this, reaſon maketh manifeſt:
for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it found that a Prince or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
fearing that for ſome certaine noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
cauſe he is in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to be killed by

continue the ſame cauſe, yea and daily
more &amp; more increaſe it, as this Queen
did her perſecution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how can this agree
with reaſon of State? for through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
and increaſe of perſecution,
thoſe that are perſecuted doe comonly
alſo increaſe: and it might fall out that
among the number of the perſecuted,
for all do not alwayes endure with like
patience, ſome might be found, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
driuen to deſperate termes might
attempt ſome ſuch thing (for as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
ſayth, the fly hath her ſplene)
but the patient ſuffering for religion is
eſpecially taught, and recomended by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21169:36"/>
Catholike teachers, and the contrary
by others of contrary Religions, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
Caluiniſts, of whoſe hoat and
reuengefull ſpirits the world hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
had teſtimony inough.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>William Criton</hi> the Scottiſh
Ieſuyte before named, being before
ſome of Queene Elizabeths Counſell, a
little before his departure out of the
Countrey, ſayd vpon occaſion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this matter: My Lords, you vſe
heere a manner of giuing out among
your ſubiects, that Ieſuites and Prieſtes
do go about to kill your Queene; but in
very truth, if we intended any ſuch
thing, ſhe could not liue: for you muſt
vnderſtand, that there are a multitude
of people of the Catholike religion, that
haue wholy abandoned the world, and
haue choſen to liue in all ſtrictnes and
auſterity, ſequeſtring themſelues from
all worldly pleaſures, deſiring and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauouring
nothing more then to leaue
this world, and to liue with God in his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21169:37"/>
Kingdome of heauen. Among theſe
men that ſo little reſpect the world di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
may be found, who beeing perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that it were ſo meritorious a deed
before God, that he who ſhould deliuer
the world from an enemy and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the Catholike religion, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
looſe his life, ſhould ſtraightwayes
enter into the eternall ioyes of heauen;
without all doubt this matter would
not be left vnattempted. The counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
hearing this had little to ſay to the
contrary.</p>

               <p>To ſay the truth, I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
I haue heere heard much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <sp>
               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>I haue firſt recounted, what Princes
and Potentates haue byn murthered, or
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21169:37"/>
made away in our dayes; and after that,
I haue ſpoken of intentions or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
to make away Princes: It reſteth
that I now ſpeake of the intentions of
Gewſes, or Caluinian reformed Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
about the murthering or making
away of Princes; thoſe innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wolues
I meane, that haue had their handes
in the bloud of fiue of the eight
Princes before named, to the end we
may alſo ſee how pure and vnſpotted
they are in their good meanings &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
to haue put that buſines in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
practiſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt then it is a thing cleere &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
that the Hugnenots of France
had a reſolued purpoſe to haue murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the moſt Chriſtian King <hi>Francis</hi> the
ſecond, with his mother, and ſundry of
the nobility, in the Citty of <hi>Amboiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is alſo moſt certayne that a Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Gewſe or Caluiniſt, meant to haue
blown vp <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> Prince of
Orange, with ſome of the Holland and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21169:38"/>
Zeland States, with gun-powder, in
the Towne-houſe of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> if it had
not byn diſcouered by him that aſſiſted
him to conuey the powder into the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
or vault of the ſayd Towne-houſe.
And had this ſucceeded according to
the purpoſe of the authour thereof, <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tazar
Gerard,</hi> that afterward killed the
ſayd Prince of Orange, had ſaued his
life, and his labour, and the Gewſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Brethren had, had the honour
of murthering ſix of the eight Princes
before named.</p>
               <p>When I conſider this Prince, and
theſe intentions of his death, me thinkes
it muſt needes be a great ſigne, that he
was not in the fauour of God, ſince as
well Caluiniſts, as Catholikes, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to kill him.</p>
               <p>Heerto may alſo be added the Earle
of <hi>Gowry</hi> in Scotland, a Caluiniſt alſo.
The hiſtory is publike in print, how he
meant to haue killed the King, wherof

               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:21169:39"/>

               <p>To the murthering of Princes and
Potentates, and to the furthering of the
tyranny &amp; domination of the King of
Spayne.</p>
               <p>Let vs now vpon examining of
theſe points, ſee what may be ſayd, with
truth and reaſon.</p>
               <p>Concerning the falſe doctrine wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Caluiniſts do accuſe Ieſuites and
other Catholike Prieſtes: That is, that
among other points, which they hold
contrary to their hereſyes, that God is
not ſo vniuſt and tyrannicall, that he
doth (as Caluiniſts affirme) take you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
infants euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the breſts of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and vndeſeruedly caſt them into
the euerlaſting fire of hell.</p>
               <p>The true doctrine then according
as Caluiniſts do teach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, that God ſo
doth; and the doctrine of Ieſuites and
Prieſts which Caluiniſtscal falſe, is that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21169:40"/>
God is ſo good, ſo iuſt, and ſo mercifull
that he doth not ſo.</p>
               <p>Concerning their Idolatry, this eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
is, as Caluiniſts affirme, that
they belieue and teach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the body of
Chriſt is really preſent in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of the Altar, that they adore it, and pray
vnto it, and that in their Churches they
haue Images. Now muſt I demaund of
you, from whence it proceedeth that
Catholiks belieue the reall Preſence of
Chriſt in this Sacrament?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Hollander.</speaker>
               <p>I know it is true that Chriſt at his
laſt ſupper taking bread, and bleſſing
it, ſayd vnto his Apoſtles, take and eate:
<hi>This is body:</hi> but for all that, he did not
ſo meane it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>But withal you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that the cauſe
of this beliefe commeth from the very
mouth of Chriſt himſelfe: if it come
from the mouth of Chriſt, then taketh
it not originall from the mouth of any
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21169:40"/>
Pope. Chriſt muſt haue lyed when he
ſayd it was his body, if it were not his
body; or Caluiniſtes muſt now lye, in
ſaying it is not his body, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Chriſt ſayd it is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Hollander.</speaker>
               <p>Neither of both do lye, Chriſt meant
that it was the figure, or ſigne of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>Where is it written, that Chriſt
meant it ſo?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Hollander.</speaker>
               <p>Our Preachers doe ſo interprete it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>I perceaue your Preachers will not
only take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to reforme the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Church, but they will alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
Gods word it ſelfe, and make it
vtter that which therein is not to be
found.</p>
               <p>But ſhew me where it is written that
aboue 1500<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yeares after Chriſt had ſaid
it was his body, and that all Chriſtians
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21169:41"/>
throughout the world did thereupon ſo
beliue it to be; he would then ſend new
teachers into the world, to reforme this
ancient Fayth, with teaching Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to belieue, that it was not his body,
and that he did not ſo meane as he ſpak,
when he inſtituted this Sacrament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Hollander.</speaker>
               <p>The oldeſt Chriſtian fayth was, that
it was not the body of Chriſt, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our teachers do call themſelues the
reformers of religion, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
and bring religion to the firſt &amp;
moſt ancient manner: for if this were
not ſo, they could not appropriate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themſelues the name of reformers of
religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>They giue themſelues the name of
Reformers, but with their appropriating
this name vnto themſelues, they oblige
themſelues in the ſight and iudgement
of all men, of vnderſtanding, of the
whole world, &amp; in al honour &amp; reaſon,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21169:41"/>
if they wilbe accompted worthy to be
belieued, cleerly to demonſtrate two
thinges.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that they are expreſly
ſent from God to reforme religion: for
if ſo be that a reformation was needful,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was it alſo needfull that God ſhould
thereunto ſend and imploy fit perſons,
that muſt be men of great holynes, and
haue power from himſelfe, to make it
appeare to the world, that they were ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
from him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that they muſt be
able to ſtop the mouthes of all others,
that at the ſame tyme ſhould alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the world, pretending refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of religion as well as they, albeit
in diuers different manners, ſetting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
at defiance, and chalenging to combat
with them, with the weapon of the
Word, as long as they dare.</p>
               <p>If men of vnderſtanding ſeeme to
imbrace your Caluinian reformation
without ſeeking ſuch requiſite ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:21169:42"/>
therein as heere is noted, they can
be no other then Politikes, whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
is their owne particuler temporall
end, or matter of ſtate, and not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of religion.</p>
               <p>But whereas you ſay that the moſt
ancient Chriſtian beliefe was, that the
reall preſence of Chriſt was not in the
Sacrament; whereas the wordes which
Chriſt ſpake and wherhence this Faith
is deriued, is the moſt ancient cauſe of
this beliefe:</p>
               <p>There is then to be conſidered, if
the Apoſtles themſelues when Chriſt
ſayd, Take and eate this is my Body, did
ſo belieue it to be or not: but certayne
it is that they all belieued it, vnleſſe it
were the falſe traytor <hi>iudas:</hi> for if they
had doubted thereof, the had without
all doubt demaunded or proponed ſome
queſtion vnto him about it, aſwell as
when he ſayd, that it was as eaſy for a
camell to paſſe through the eye of a
needle, as it was for a rich man to enter
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21169:42"/>
into the Kingdome of heauen for them,
they ſtraight wayes demaunded of him,
who could then be ſaued? Whereupon
he anſwered them, that with God all
thinges are poſſible. Is it poſſible with
God that a camel, or the cable of a ſhip,
can go through the eye of a needle?
Then can the body of Chriſt be in the
Sacrament. But the Apoſtles among
ſundry other great miracles which they
had ſeene our Sauiour doe, whereof we
fynd ſome written (though many of
them were left vn written) did alſo ſee
him worke ſome great miracles in his
owne body, when he ſo altered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
courſe therof, that he did ſundry
thinges therewith aboue the courſe and
poſſibility of nature: and therefore it is
no wonder that the Apoſtles, were all
ſilent, and without reply belieued the
wordes of Chriſt, which they knew
to meaſure by his power.</p>
               <p>There is alſo to be conſidered, that if
ſo be the firſt Chriſtians, to wit thoſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21169:43"/>
of the primitiue Church, haue belieued
as Caluiniſts now do, that the body of
Chriſt is not really in this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or
that this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is but a figure, ſigne,
or token of the body of Chriſt, how &amp;
when began the beliefe in the world,
that the body of Chriſt was really
there? Through whoſe ordayning was
it ſo to be taken &amp; belieued? By whome
was it taught? By whom was it writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
At what time was it that Communion-tables
were taken out of Churches, and
Altars erected there in their places?</p>

the Catholike Chriſtians of the
Roman Church, there are great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Greeke Church:
There are many Chriſtians of the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſine
or Ethiopian Church: There are
Chriſtians of <hi>Malabar</hi> in the eaſt Indies
which were at firſt conuerted by Saint
<hi>Thomas</hi> the Apoſtle, with ſundry other
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21169:44"/>
ſorts of ancient Chriſtians aſwell in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia
as in Africa: for the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
haue byn in thoſe Countreys, &amp;
firſt preached among their anceſtors,
and brought them to the fayth. Theſe
do differ in ſome points and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
one from another, &amp; alſo from the
Church of Rome, but all theſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
can ſhew out of their Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
Annales and Church hiſtories,
that they haue had Maſſe euen from the
very tyme of the Apoſtles, and haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
belieued that the body of Chriſt
was really in the Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar:
and albeit that theſe are ſequeſtred
from the Church of Rome, and all of
them who vnto that Church haue not
reconciled themſelues, are by the ſame
holden for Schiſmatikes; yet will they
all beare witneſſe for the Church of
Rome againſt all our European new &amp;

               <p>I haue in Holland both read &amp; heard

did I neuer read, nor heare before: but

            <sp>
               <speaker>The Brabander.</speaker>
               <p>The Apoſtles well knew that they
had no need to write that, which they
inſtituted and taught to be daily in vſe
among Chriſtians, ſeeing it could not
then be forgotten, and therefore needed
not for the preuenting of obliuion, to
be putit dovvne in vvryting.</p>

Of the greateſt number of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
we haue no wrytings at all, and
thoſe that wrote, haue left many things
vnwritten, aſwell concerning Chriſt
himſelfe, as concerning their owne
ſelues, not hauing written, when or by
whome themſelues were baptized, nor
whether they were baptized or no, and
yet were they without all doubt bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
They knew that Chriſt had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to ſend the Holy Ghoſt vnto his
holy Catholike Church, to teach the
ſayd church all truth, and to remayne
therewith to the end of the world, what
neceſſity was there then for them to put
downe all thinges in wryting, whereas
their expreſſe charge was to go ouer all
the world, and preach, and baptize, and
this may well be the cauſe that but fiue
of the twelue Apoſtles of chriſt haue
written, and thoſe but briefly neyther;
and the other ſeauen not at all, or not
whereof we haue any notice. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

               <p>Your Gewſes-reformed, will alſo
make Catholikes Idolaters, for hauing
of Images in their Churches. They
may make <hi>Moyſes</hi> an Idolater alſo,
who notwithſtanding he forbad the
making of Idols, erected Images in his
temple, for he well knew the difference
betweene the one and the other.</p>
               <p>The Heatheniſh Idolls, agaynſt
which the ſacred Scripture inueygheth,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21169:46"/>
ſo much, the Heathen did offer ſacrifice
vnto, which is the higheſt and greateſt
honour that is done vnto God himſelfe.
The belyers of Catholikes may put on
their ſpectacles to ſee what ſacrifice, or
Godly honour is done by them vnto I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
albeit they be Images of Chriſt,
of his bleſſed Mother, and of his Saints,
not of the Gods of the Heathen, which
were all Diuells.</p>
               <p>No Catholikes offer ſacrifice to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Images: no Catholikes pray to any I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
for ſo to doe were not only a
moſt grieuous offence vnto God, but a
great folly &amp; madnes in humayne crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
A dog will neuer run at a carued
or painted hare. Doe Sectaries weene
that Catholikes haue leſſe ſenſe then
brute beaſts? can they not vnderſtand
as well as vnreaſonable beaſts that they
are things without life? Catholike Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
haue them in vſe, for memory of
God and of his Saints, and in reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them, the reuerence is meant and

referred vnto thoſe they repreſent: as
when at hearing the name of IESVS,
we doe not reuerence the ſound, but
our thoughts are ſtraightwayes by that
ſound tranſported to Chriſt himſelfe, as
by the ſight of his Image they alſo are.
But your Caluinian pulpit-fellowes, to

               <p>Concerning the point that Ieſuites
and Prieſtes, do go about to bring the
good inhabitants of theſe vnited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
to an auerſion from their lawfull
ſuperiours, is in troth, as good a ieſt to
be laught at, as it were, that a thiefe
hauing cut a purſe, ſhould cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the people to looke well vnto
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21169:47"/>
their purles, for being cut by the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſes.
The Gewſes themſelues of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
haue long ſince brought the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of thoſe partes to haue an auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from their lawfull Superiours; and
now they ſay, that Ieſuytes and Prieſts
do go about to do it, as though it were
not by themſelues done already, and as
though the preſent rebellious Vſurpers
of ſuperiority there, were true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Superiours. But what goodly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
will heere be lawfull ſuperiours?
Doth this lawfull Superiority belong
vnto them, becauſe they haue by fraud
and violence made themſelues the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Cittyes and Prouinces, &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the lawfull ſuperiours away? Why
was not then <hi>Iohn Buckleſon,</hi> the Tayler
of <hi>Leydon,</hi> a lawfull King of <hi>Munſter</hi>
in <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> when in like ſort he had
chaſed the lawfull Superiours thence?
And why haue your Holland-States by
ſtrong and forcible oppoſition hindred
the <hi>Arminians</hi> from making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21169:47"/>
mayſters of ſome Cittyes, that ſo they
might become the lawful Superiours in
them, as well as they in others?</p>
               <p>But how greatly are the poore Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers
all the world ouer pittyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the King of Spayne doth ſo much
trouble them, to put them out of their
lawfull ſuperiority? They haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that Catholike religion obligeth
to the reſtitution of ill gotten &amp; detay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
goods, and therefore they are in
feare, as if they alſo knew that they are
the vniuſt detayners of that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
vnto another. But conſidering
that Caluiniſts or Gewſes, that haue
the power and authority in their hands
to make reſtitution, are not ſuch as goe
to Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion to Ieſuites or Prieſtes, they
may therefore haue the leſſe feare.</p>
               <p>As touching the murthering of
Princes and Potentates, there hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſufficiently byn ſpoken: but it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by the wordes of the placcart that
the Ieſuytes and Prieſtes doe ſeeke to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21169:48"/>
bring the good inhabitants of Holland
to become the murtherers of Princes &amp;
Potentates; as if Ieſuytes and Prieſtes
went into Holland, to ſeeke to make
prouiſion of murtherers among the
good inhabitants there, to the end they
might employ them where need ſhould
be, in the murthering of Princes and
Potentates, in other Countreyes; as
though none els for ſuch purpoſe could
be found more fitting, then among the
good inhabitants of Holland.</p>
               <p>That they there ſhould alſo further
the Tyranny &amp; domination of Spayne,
are two lyes. No ſubiects of the King of
Spayne are by him tyrannized, neyther
haue the Ieſuites or Prieſts in Holland
medled, or haue had charge to meddle
in matters of State or Gouernment, as
thinges beeing out of their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>The Hollanders cry out, and take
on very much about the Tyranny of
Spayne: but if it were ſo, that the
King of Spayne had no ſubiects out of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21169:48"/>
Spayne but only Hollanders, the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers
might perhaps be better belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
but he hath other ſubiects alſo in
Europe, and out of Spayne, and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
nations.</p>
               <p>He hath Portugeſes, Neapolitans,
Sicilians, Milaneſes, Burgundians,
Germans, Walons, and Netherlanders,
that are not vnder Holland gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And which of all theſe Nations
is it, that liueth not now in a more free
and better ſtate, then in former tymes
vnder the comaund of their particuler
Kings, Princes and Lordes? And where
among all theſe differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nations is there
any one found, that is ſo Tyrannized
ouer at this day, as are the ſubiects of
Holland, with ſo great and ſo intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
exactions and taxations.</p>
               <p>And whereas they haue alwayes
made profeſſion, to leaue people to the
liberty &amp; freedom of their conſciences,
they do notwithſtanding forbid ſome
of their good inhabitants vpon great
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21169:49"/>
paynes, the exerciſe of their religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as their conſciences do require,
which they deny not vnto Anabaptiſts,
nor Iewes.</p>
               <p>They cry out, and take on about
the Tiranny of Spayne, to make the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
afrayd of a faygned Tiranny,
that in the meane tyme they may the
better goe forward, as vnſeene, with
their owne true and great Tiranny in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>No children may be ſent to ſchoole
in any places vnder the comaund of the
King of Spayne, or in Colledges of
Ieſuytes &amp;c. Belike there is no good
