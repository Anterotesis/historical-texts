         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the errande would neither offen de God nor man: Neither can I ſee why there ſhould not be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall contribution giuen through the realme, for the mayntenaunce of men of warre, when theyr ſeruice concerneth ſuch publique profit: The Prince is not able to recompence all, and the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour muſt fight in defence of all, why ſhould hee not be maintained by the helpe of all.</p>
                  <p>But here ſome wil think I ſpeake for my ſelfe, &amp; I confeſſe it, ſouldiours muſt learne of other men to ſpeake for them ſelues, for there is no body elſe that will: VVhat trade or handicrafte haue you ſo ſimple, but if it begin a little to decay, but by and by it pleades pouerty, runninge to the Prince or Parliament for releefe, eyther by repelling ſome ſtatute, by making ſome priuiledge, or by attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome conſideration: And if vppon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion betweene Nations trafique be ſtopte, howe clamerous is the Marchaunt in the eares of hys Prynce, till hee hath his paſſage againe freely ſet open:</p>
                  <p>The Lawyer will permitte no Edicte to come forth that makes againſt his owne profit, though otherwiſe it be beneficial for the whole common wealth: The Deuine findes fault that their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall promotiones ſhould ſo many wayes bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued them, and (I thinke) complaineth of it not without ſome cauſe: If euery profeſſion hauely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to ſay for them ſelues, giue ſouldiours leaue to ſpeake, when by the vnkindnes of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen
<pb facs="tcp:16438:7"/>
they are brought to the worſt, and yet as profitable members to their common wealth, as they that thinkes them ſelues beſt: Is it not the Souldiour by haſarding his life abroade, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth the Artificer to ſit quietly by his worke at home. And what would it auaile the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt to ſpeake for forraine gaine, if the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our were not to defende him from domeſticall ſpoyle. The Lawyer makes no plea but for priuat profitte, and burldes goodly houſes, and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth whole countries about him.</p>
                  <p>The ſouldiour ſerues his countrye for a ſmall ſtypende, and would be contended with alowance but to buie meate, drinke, and cloath: And that very religion which the deuine but coates downe in his quiet ſtudie without any perill, that very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the ſouldiour maintaineth with the loſſe of limme and life. How much more might heere be alleadged in the behalfe of ſouldiours and their ſeruice, yet theſe be they that the politique wyſe man (him I meane) (that is better practiſed in <hi>Machauils</hi> policies, then ſtudied in the new Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament) would haue to be kept vnder.

                  </p>
                  <p>But is not that countrie to much vngratefull which hath no manner of remorſe to thoſe men whoſe blood hath ſcarletted the grownd ſo much to their glory, and no leſſe to their preſeruation: If ſouldiours muſt be had (as of neceſſity they muſt) how would you haue them liue, wyll you ſette downe no courſe: Giue me leaue then to ſay my minde I ſpeake but in ſporte, but that it might come to paſſe <hi>I</hi> would wiſh in good earneſt.

                  <p>Now our people of England being as general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie giuen to inordinate lawing, if the like impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:16438:8"/>
might be rayſed for euery action they ſhould commence, for euery writte they ſhould fetche foorth, and for euery ſentence in lawe that ſhould be pronounced with them both, or againſt them, no doubt it would maintaine a great many of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diours to grade them, whereby they might the more ſafely follow theyr lawe, and when they had ſpent all amongſt Lawyers (as a number of them already hath doone) they might haue ſome cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to craue gratification from the Prince or Country for theyr good ſeruice, as if you will beare with me, I will ſhewe you the like preſident. About tenne yeeres agoe, (vpon occaſion) beinge in <hi>Hollande</hi> at a towne called <hi>Gorcum,</hi> a good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low comming to the States, craued of them ſome recompence, for his indeuours, which (as he ſayd) had beene wonderfully beneficial to their ſtate and gouernement.</p>
                  <p>The States willing him to make repition of his ſeruice, and he ſhould finde them ready to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of good deſert, this good fellow then ſo well incouraged beginnes his tale.</p>
                  <p>It is not vnknowen (quod he) that within theſe ſeauen yeeres, <hi>I</hi> was worth 4000. Guilders, ſithe which time vntill this preſent (ſo longe as I had one ſtiuer left) I am ſure there is no man that euer ſawe me goe ſober to bed: Now gentlemen, if you will wiſely conſider of this, how beneficiall my drinking hath beene to your common purſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyſe, and not onely what my ſelfe haue ſpent of
<pb facs="tcp:16438:9"/>
mine owne, but alſo by my drawing in of many other good drinkers in my company, I doubt not but as you muſt confeſſe I haue beene a good member to my commen wealth, ſo you will not fayle to gratifie me, according to my deſert.</p>
                  <p>Now, if the like exciſe were ſette of the Lawe, why might not a fellowe that had beggerd him ſelfe by lawing, craue like conſideration, and by as good deſert: I ſpeake not againſt the triall for title of landes, which I knowe muſt be decided by the verdit of a Queſt, or the diſcretion of a Iudge, but I ſpeake againſt theſe vnkindly Actions of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, commonly commenced for the ſpeakinge of a word, for a neighbours gooſe that ſhall but looke ouer a hedge, and for other ſuch like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, wherein they will not ſticke to ſpende more poundes, then for the releefe of a ſouldiour, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their countrye they are willinge to giue pence. But as it is neceſſary ſuch clyentes ſhould be a little wronge by the purſes, ſo ſuch counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſhould not goe ſcotfree, that are the annima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to ſuch cauſes. I remember longe ſithens, (when I was a little bookiſhe,) I reade a Hiſtory in our Engliſh Chronicles, and although I canne not ſet you downe the place, yet as I can I will tell you the matter.</p>
                  <p>A Prince of this realme (vpon what occaſion I knowe not) fined all the Lawiers of this lande, for their extortion bryberie and deceite, but to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, that was found to be vncorrupted
<pb facs="tcp:16438:9"/>
there was giuen 300 pounds. If it pleaſed her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty to followe this example, and to fine euery Lawyer but at tenne pound, that hath cozoned his countrimen at the leaſt of renſcoore, to them that ſhal be found free from corruption, ſhe might double her beneuolence and make the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound 600. in Gods name, and yet ſaue an honeſt portion for the maintenaunce of her wars: It was ſometime though that one Lawyer, and one Goſſehauke were enough in a whole ſhyre, and as <hi>Plato</hi> concludeth, it is a token of a corrupted eſtate, where there are many Lawyers, and manie Phiſitions, becauſe the multitude of Lawyers are maintained by the contention of people, and ſuch ſtore of Phiſitions, by their exceſſe in dyet, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes and gluttonie. But pardon me here I praie you, the tellinge of a merry tale that comes but nowe ſodainelye in my minde, and thus at fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>There was ſometime a Lawyer dwelling farre in the North that had ſerued a writ of a poore <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>berland</hi> man, for his appearaunce at <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> in the beginning of the next Terme, this poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for want of a horſe comming to London on foot, and by the way as he paſſed, where he ſawe a ſigne he was ſure to finde meate, drinke, and lodging for his money, but comming to London, and by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hitting into Holburne, ſeeing a ſigne at euery mans doore, began to make doubte, and callinge to a Boye that paſſed by, aſked him where hee

                  <p>Now the foule ill tae them, be all thure lawyers, marry had I kende that, I had rather haue eate no breade theſe two daies, then haue come amonge ſayke a company; thus as he was haſtily goinge forth of the doores, the gentlemen ſporting at his folly, followed him laughing, which when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, calling to the porter he ſayd, ay ſay, my gude fellowe ſlot to the doore, by the bread a gad and all thure may once breake out, there is neere a poore man in England that ſhall liue in whayet

                  <p>VVee doo finde in the holy ſcriptures and that in ſeuerall places, both in the bookes of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> in the booke of <hi>Ioſua</hi> and others, where they haue vſed not litle regard aſwell in the choſing of their Captaines, leaders and conductors, as alſo in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing lawes and diſciplines of warre, which ſometimes were appointed by the almighty God him ſelfe: <hi>Phillip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> did mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile why the <hi>Athenians</hi> did euerye yeere chooſe newe Generalles and Captaines of the wars, when he him ſelfe had found but one good, namely <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menyo: Alexander</hi> admitted none to the roome of a Captaine vnder the age of 60.</p>
                  <p>But in England, wee neuer number his yeeres, we neither conſider his knowledg, we little regard his worthines, we leſſe eſteeme his experience, wee ſcarce examine his honeſtye: Our Captaines are appointed, more for fauour then for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, more for feendſhippe then for experience,
<pb facs="tcp:16438:12"/>
more for opinion then for deſert: God graunt wee neuer come to make triall of the ſeruice of ſuche Captaines as I haue ſeene ſome, if wee ſhould, there were great feare of vnhappy ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>And this is to bee lamented amongſt vs, that wee can bee ſo prouident in matters of no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, and ſuch cauſes where in our owne ſafeties dooth eſpecially conſiſt, wee eyther neglect them altogether, or elſe performe them with little care and leſſe foreſight. If the matter were well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned we ſhould finde that the ſafety both of Prince ſtate, country, ſubiects, and altogether conſiſted in the worthines of the Captaine: and to this moſt fitly agreed the ſaying of that noble ſouldiour Sir <hi>VVylliam Drury,</hi> who many times woulde vſe theſe wordes.</p>
                  <p>The want of a horſſe ſhooe nayle, may bee the loſſe of the ſhooe, the loſſe of the ſhooe, the ſpoile of the horſſe, the ſpoyle of the horſſe, the loſſe of the man: the loſſe of a man, the ouerthrowe of an army: the ouerthrowe of an army, the loſſe of a Princes crowne: If ſmall thinges thus by degrees, may conclude ſuche great preiudice in the wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vppe, (as it can not bee denayde) what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe is to be looked for, where captaines and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are ſo vtterly ignoraunt, that many of them knowes not when it is time to charge, nere when it were good to retire: and as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaith, the boldenes of the ignoraunt ingendreth manye euilles, and <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> affyrmeth, the lacke of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryence
<pb facs="tcp:16438:12"/>
breedeth the lacke of corage: And as hiſtories make mencion, more feeldes haue beene loſte for wante of gouernement, then for want of ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>To giue a braue charge, is a thing proper to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ordinarie ſouldiour, but to make a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in time, &amp; in order, therin conſiſteth the ſkill of the Captaine: The vnexpert Captaine, and the vnlearned phiſition, doo buy their experience at to deere a rate, for it is ſtill purchaſed, with the price of mens liues: The place of a Captaine is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and ought not to bee giuen but to men of experience, of valiaunce, and of vertue, and yet I haue heard tell, where they haue beene made mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandyſe of, and bought and ſolde for money, but I dare not ſay that I haue knowen it my ſelfe, for paraduenture <hi>I</hi> ſhould offend.</p>
                  <p>But I hope ſouldiours ſhall not bee ſtill illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, they ſhall be eſteemed accordinge to deſert.

<pb facs="tcp:16438:13"/>
Theſe be their workes meritorious which ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they boaſt of, and by this ladder they thinke to clime vp to heauen gates, where ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> ſtandes watching ready to let them in. O how many vngodly practiſes, haue they intended againſt our moſt gratious princeſſe, how are they continually buſied in conſpiring againſt her: but that almighty God who firſt planted her to their ſubuerſion, hath not fayled ſtill to protect her (no doubt) to their confuſion.

                  <p>And although that accidentes are many times ſufficient to ſerue their turne, either to confirme, eyther to confound religion according to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, I wonder they cannot aſwell condemne a Papiſt in his ill ſucceſſe that is ſent ouer with ſo many hallowed bulles, as they will doo a proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tante, for the leaſt miſfortune that may befal him, but if this light were ſufficient for men to iudge

                  <p>A Generall thus fortefied in his owne conſcience, with the iuſtice of his quarrell, is nowe to ſatiſfie his whole company with the example of his vertue, and as the eye (aboue the reſt of our ſences) is leaſt miſtaken,

and the minde apter to receiue impreſion by what the eye ſéeth, then by that the eare heareth, ſo there is not a more ſpèedy meane, to make inferiours to embrace vertues, then when they ſhall ſée the gouernour or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, giue firſt example in his owne perſon. A Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall therefore muſt eſpecially both looue and feare God, he muſt not be without learned Preachers and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of gods word, which muſt inſtructe and teach the Armie, practiſing them aſwell in the feare of God, as in duety and obedence to theyr Commaunders, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Officers.</p>
                  <p>In his owne perſon he muſt be magnanimious, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, gratious, eaſie to be ſpoken with, conſtant in his counſayles, quicke in his executions, and ſecréete in his determinationes, that his intentes may be kept cloſe.

Their hearſe battailes, their broad ſquares, their baaſe ſquares theyr baſtard ſquares are very good, but beſt to be vſed vppon aduauntage of ground, and although my leaſure wyll not now permit me, to ſet them downe proportionable to euery number, yet I hope in the meane time you will accept of ſome fewe that ſhall hereafter followe. The Croſſe battaile (the figure wherof is this inſuing) is a moſt excellent fight, but to order it in due proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to euery number is a little difficult and aſketh lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time then I can now ſtand about, and will there fore leaue it tyll ſome other oportunitie.</p>

THere bée other fourmes of battailes framed of many battalions, impaide with ſléeues and fillets of Pikes, which as they are very excellent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemie, ſo they are moſt daungerous for that they are quickly diſordered, where Souldiours be not moſt exquiſitely trained. But the fight now one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conſiſting in Shot and Pikes, there is no fourme of imbatteling to be preferred before the iuſt ſquare, or if your numbers be ſufficient to order them into 2. 3. or 4. ſquadrons according to theſe figures.</p>

                  <p>I haue hetherto made no mention of our olde Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh weapons, namely the Bowe, the browne Byll, or Halberd, ſometimes had in great reputation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, the bow is alreadie ſet aſide, yet there bee ſome that thinkes it to be a weapon of wonderful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and to maintaine their opinions, wil aleadge ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reaſons, manie of them ſcarce woorth the ſpeaking of, but this might ſuffice, that men of iudgment and dailie experience, findes them to be to ſo little purpoſe, that we ſée they neuer call for them, yet this I wyll ſay, (and it cannot be denyed) that where bowes may be brought to ſerue againſt horſe, they might be very well, and ſtand in ſome ſtead, but ſo many ready ſhotte that were placed in their roomes, woulde doo a great deale better, and more daungerous to the enemie. In like manner our browne Bill, Halberd, or other ſhorte weapon, are moſt naturall for our Engliſhmen for where they may be brought to dealing of dry blowes, I think there is no other Nation that were able to ſtand againſt them, but the childe that is but this day borne from his mothers wombe, ſhall neuer liue to ſée two battailes incounter pell mell, the one with the other, as héere before they haue doone, and to what ende then ſhould ſo many ſhort weapons ſerue, that are euer pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that part of the battaile which ſhould bee moſte ſtrong, where they can neuer be brought to doo ſeruice. But ſuch as will néedes haue ſuch ſtore of ſhort wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, were better to place them in ſome winge, readie to be drawne foorth vpon anie execution, for which purpoſe they might be very requiſite: and yet if anie inuaſion ſhould be made in our own Country, I wold

And that the iuſt ſquare is eſpecially to be preferred, may eaſely appeare by theſe conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it is not very curious in placyng, ſecond it is eaſie for Souldiers to march, eſpecially if they haue to paſſe any ſtraights through the which they may bee drawne by 5. or 3. in a ranck (if the place will affoorde no greater ſcope) and be ſuddainly brought againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their firſt proportions without any manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: but eſpecially the iuſt ſquare is moſt defencible and ſtrong, both againſt horſemen and footemen, wher there is no aduauntage to be taken of ground, either of hedge or dytch, ryuer, hyll, or other like.</p>
