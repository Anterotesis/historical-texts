            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Short Diſcourſe on the preceeding Comedy.</head>
            <p>THE wiſdome of the world in all ages, and their precepts of life, lies wrapt up in their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology, even as ours at this preſent is contained in the Holy Scriptures; except that God in his mercy to us hath delivered us thoſe truths of which they had but the the Tipes and Figures: But yet of ſuch efficacy we find their Fables to be, that even in the darkeſt Times we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſay, that the ſoul of man had light enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the bounds and rules we ought to live within, and the end we live for: ſo that we may truly ſay, ſince God made man, he never left him without ſuch a ſufficient Conduct as might well ſerve his turn, till in his great grace and bounty he ſhall think fit to ſend him a better; nor was it leſs then divine wiſdome in him at the firſt to ſend the weakeſt lights to prepare the ſoul of man for thoſe great ones ſince delivered unto them, and to let <hi>Gentiliſme</hi> as it were uſher in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that Mankind might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the weight, form, and matter thereof, and want nothing but the ſtamp of his <hi>Meſſias</hi> upon him for his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting perfection. Now amongſt the ancient Fables, I find none that better unfolds the nature and ſtate of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind then this, which <hi>Ariſtophanus</hi> takes for the ſubject of his Comedy; not perhaps any that comes nearer to our own ſacred Scriptures <hi>Plutus,</hi> the Tipe of <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Plenty,</hi> is ſaid by <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be deprived of his Eyes, for aſpiring to enthrone himſelf in his power and wiſdome, that which at the firſt we read threw down the Angels, and next to them him, and in him that poſterity that was created almoſt as happy as thoſe Angels; ſo that <hi>Plutus</hi> with his <hi>eyes open</hi> may allude to us <hi>Adam</hi> in his <hi>Innocency,</hi> his <hi>blindneſs</hi> our <hi>falt</hi>; and his being brought to <hi>Eſculapius</hi> his Temple to receive his ſight again, may not unfitly emble to us our ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>Saviour</hi> to bring us into that State again we fell from: But yet further then in this conſideration, which I hope will offend no body; we will not uſe compariſons, but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55925:20"/>
proceed to our intentions, which are to conſider the <hi>World</hi> as it ſtood with <hi>Plutus</hi> his <hi>eyes open,</hi> and as it now ſtands with his <hi>eyes out.</hi> The law of Nature is, that which in all ages Philoſophy hath aimed to find out; for though the world ſtands now upon another bottom, and we live ſo wholly by our own agreements, that it is impoſſible to bring it into the practiſe of life any more, yet were it of wonderful importance to every ſingle man, his buſineſs in this world being onely to know himſelf, and his own being, to know what he was before he made any bargains with other numbers of men, to take what principles they thought fit to impoſe upon him; but certainly to find this law of our natures, which like an old Record hath lain ſo long in the duſt, till the letters are worn out, and the language for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, is a thing of great difficulty, eſpecially conſidering that our ſenſes and the faculties of the mind that flow from them, are given us for the uſe of Life, and not to examine what that Life is; they can look forth and diſtinguiſh of objects abroad, but cannot look back, and reflect upon themſelves: My Eyes teach me to ſee, but ſhew me not what Seeing is; and I Hear with my Ears, but cannot hear what Hearing is, nor indeed is there any thing in this world can teach us by it ſelf what it is; for if it were not ſo, I cannot find what bounds could be put to Humane knowledge, the which both by the failings in our ſelves, the Muthology of the Ancients, and even our own ſacred Stories, we ſtill find for aſpiring beyond its tearms hath been caſt into chaines: The beſt way therefore for man to make diſcovery of his own ſimple eſtate and condition, as it ſtood before he brought himſelf into ſlavery, will be firſt to rank himſelf again with the reſt of his fellow creatures, in their manner of enjoying the benefits of this life, and as they do, to reckon that divine providence out of that ſame earth, whence their generation came, hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe without their care provided nutrition to lead our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural lives on to thoſe tearms and limits nature hath ſet them; and hence we ſee the Goſpel, that was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant made with Mankind, for the reſtoring him again to his ſimplicity of life, for illuſtration of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a natural ſtate and condition, brings the Lilly of the field, that neither toiles or ſpins, to exceed <hi>Solomon</hi> in all in his glory; and further argues that the Fowls of the Air neither ſow nor reap, nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father provideth for them; and do not you much exceed them? that is, are not you much
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55925:20"/>
more capable of living contentedly in common, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of Nature, upon the fruits and benefits of the earth, then they; for the truth is, though thoſe words did generally relate to the caſting of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind upon the providence of God, and not to rely upon his own care, yet I doubt not but all his precepts of that kind had alſo a reſpect to that day when Chriſt ſhall come and finiſh the work of a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> when (as the Text ſaith) he ſhall have put down all rule, and power, and authority; that is, what ever we now call Propriety and Right, except the common natural right of other creatures; for to the ſame peace that Mankind at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed we can onely be reſtored by being put into the ſame ſtate and habit of life. Now we find in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that the dominion given to man over the world, did not extend further then the making of food of that which hath ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life; <hi>I have given you every herb bearing ſeed which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the earth, and every Tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding ſeed, to you it ſhall be for meat</hi>: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this deed of gift of the fruits of the earth more particularly to man then his fellow creatures for in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſe, <hi>to every Beaſt of all the Earth, and to every Fowl of the Air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat</hi>: Neither was this firſt natural eſtate of man unknown to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where the Holy Scriptures never came, for the foundation of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> Philoſophy we find is the ſame, and hath had the fortune to continue in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> parts to this day, when it could not do ſo with thoſe that had it immediately from heaven; likewiſe <hi>Haeſiod,</hi> with a kind of divine ſpirit tells us, that Humane ſuſtenance, if there were any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane temperance, might lie in ſo narrow a compaſſe that he ſhould not need to put his Oxen and Mules into the yoke of ſlavery, if it were not a curſe that <hi>Jupiter</hi> had laid upon him for <hi>Prometheus</hi> bold theft of fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the knowledge of good and evill, that is, the ſtating of it himſelf as he thought fit; for we find not that God put any confinement to the thoughts and ſoul of man, to the matter of ſeeking good and evill in the natural ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation into himſelf, or any of the creatures, that were his companions, but on the contrary gave encouragement to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; for we ſee he had leave to call the creatures before him, and give names to them proper to their natures and habits, and by that means to propogate the art of <hi>Etimology</hi> in the world, that being the firſt principle upon which all

Humane ſcience is built; but ſo ſoon as he came to eſtabliſh his Morals, it was that unhappy Philoſophy that cauſed both all his own ſorrow, and that of other creatures, for our pride and ſelf opinion firſt taught us to practiſe Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and blood-ſhedding over other creatures, the next thing that followed was perſecution and ſlavery of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; neither did man then onely learn to deſtroy man, but by his example other creatures learned the ſame cruelty over one another; for in the image of the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, we find it received, that man did not fall alone, but the whole world fell with him; <hi>Cain</hi> gave an example of murder to the next Bird or Beaſt that was ſtronger then his Brother; and I remember it to be an obſervation of the ever renowned Doctor <hi>Hernii,</hi> that thoſe creatures that are moſt in ſociety with us, learn our luſt and habits of life of us, even to ſuch a degree that we ſee Dogs and Swine vary from the appointed times of generation ſet by other creatures, and are at any time (as Man is) capable of it; now when man, or a few men, by Strength or Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence had ſubdued many, the next thing that followed, was that unhappy thing we call Propriety, to ſuch a part of the world as they could maintain; and here it was the ſoul of man, that was born to know onely the oppoſites of pain and pleaſure, as they were confin'd to his bodily E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, grew to fix them moſt unhappily upon all things without him, untill his life became capable to afford him nothing that was ſimple, nor is he able to enjoy any thing for fear of its oppoſite, that like a terrible ſhadow (much longer then the ſubſtance) walks ſtill along with his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; for ſo ſoon as the names of <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Poverty</hi> were defin'd in the world, all manner of Appetites, like a Sea, when a Sluce is plucked up, came in upon Mankind: True it is, one would think that the intentions of Propriety were to keep away the notions of Poverty, till upon ſecond thoughts we find it impoſſible that men (having ſuch une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſouls) ſhould ever be ſatisfied that they have equal parts in any diviſion, and ſo conſequently deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach till ſome where there falls out to be ſcarcity; whereas in the life of man, in common right, there is no ſubjects; for ſuch paſſions, or if it were ſo, that precincts were able to preſerve us from one another, yet Ambition we ſee teaches us where we cannot enlarge the quantity of our Territories, to ſeek ſtill ſome way to improve the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof, that by that means when we cannot excell our neighbours in the extent of power, we may make them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55925:21"/>
ſtoop to us for ingenuity, the moſt dangerous and certain rule of making ſlaves of one another; and this is not a little evident in the invention of Tillage, a thing which as the ſtate of the world now ſtands, is queſtionleſs the greateſt of its policies, though if we look back to the firſt eſtate of Mankind, nothing perhaps is a greater miſchief to it, for we find not bread to be ſuch an eſſential ſuſtenance to the body of man, but that by experience it can ſubſiſt without it; and moreover, we find not by <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> that in <hi>Egypt,</hi> from whence they ſuppoſe Mankind at firſt to have come, but that it was of late in Cuſtome; nor which is more, do we at this day find that any of the moſt <hi>Southern</hi> Climates have a ſoyl that will bear any of thoſe grains which we count our life in theſe <hi>Septentrion</hi> climates, ſubſiſts upon; and therefore rather for the ſatisfying of the mind, then other neceſſity, thoſe that make voyages thither make ſome thing as like it as they can of any thing that comes next. So that I often with my ſelf conſider it as the greateſt of our infelicities, when for this thing, and for many more that are of no greater importance then it is, man hath brought toyl and labour and conſequently ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very upon his poſterity, and all for the want or fore-ſight what neceſſities the ſcarſity of the contents of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties would caſt us upon; men when they grew too many for the ſpot of earth they were upon having no other way but by forcing it with ſeed to feed themſelves; and by the eternal providence of revolution, to turn that food again into nutriment to keep the wombe of the earth ſtill open and prolifick to them, ſo that one in a homely phraſe made a good expreſſion of Humane life, when he ſaid, Our buſineſs was onely eating to ſhite, and ſhiting to eat. Now though we ought to receive thoſe curſes, that it pleaſeth God to lay upon us for our rebellions, with patience and ſubmiſſion, yet ſure it is a great miſtake to call them Bleſſings, and by that means exalt our ſelves from thoſe very means that are given us for our humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for ſo is it with us when we admire our ſelves for our Arts and Inventions, which at the beſt are but ſupports to our infirmities, diſpiſing innocent life whereever we hear of it with the title of Barbariſm; inſomuch that I have often thought with my ſelf, that had we now a viſion of the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> feared in it again with all his felicity, we ſhould, for the poor wretch his good, deſire to teach him ſome of our good manners and good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55925:22"/>
But to cure our ſelves of this pride of ſpirit, I know no better an example then the Hiſtory of the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites Jer. chap.</hi> 35. who were Sons, or as ſome interpret, Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Jonadab</hi> and his Philoſophy; theſe people, as is there expreſſed, lived in Tents, and by their particular laws were both forbidden the uſe of Wine and Tillage; and denyed ſo much as to come into ſociety with the <hi>Jews,</hi> when the Prophet preſſed them to it, and yet ſo great a reward God Almighty thought fit to give to their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Fathers, and the temperance of their lives, that he promiſeth them in the end of the Chapter, <hi>Jonadab ſhall not want a man to ſtand before me for ever.</hi> Neither is this all the evill conſequence that hath followed for the altering and dejecting the mind and ſoul of man from its firſt eſtate, for if we take Tillage in its larger ſenſe, for what ever is an unnatural and forced uſe of the earth, we may then involve almoſt all the nutriment to which now the body of man is habituated, and not onely its nutriment, but its luxuries. And having changed the fruits of the earth, I cannot doubt but we have therein alſo changed our own bodies, and conſequently making a new digeſtion, we have now no longer our firſt natural thoughts and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: I think it therefore no wonder, that in ſtead of a natural way of arguing and concluding, men ſhould take the rule of their lives from Phanatique thoughts: I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not at all how I have got the notion of a Spirit, a thing that is nothing that hath place, and no dimentions, that is obvious to my ſenſe, and yet is inſenſible; I wonder not that my Faith is my greateſt certainty, and that the price upon which my Soul depends, is as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>the evidence of things unſeen</hi>; though all this be againſt ſenſe; for all this I will allow the habits of my new education may have now made to be my nature and conſtitution; nor do I for this pay a leſs reverence and reſpect to the truths of what I now am bound to believe, that I come thus to think of them; for the truth it ſelf of theſe things did but begin with the change of Humane nature in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; for the truth of our immortality after death could not commence before we knew we ſhould die, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not unaptly (in my opinion) have ſome of the beſt Philoſophers thought it demonſtration enough for ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural things, that we are able to think of them, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence enough that the ſoul is immortal, that the Soul it ſelf thinks ſo, its ſelf; and the knowledge of it ſelf were created together. I know it will be urged here, Is every
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55925:22"/>
thing ſo, becauſe I think it ſo? my conception then can give reality to any thing, that hath no being. I anſwer to that with another queſtion, Do I believe what I think? I believe, if I do, I doubt not of the truth of it, for I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not to be able to remove mountaines, when I have faith enough to beleive I can; but the difference in matter of Faith, as I ſuppoſe, lies, in that it is one thing to believe a thing, and another onely to beleive that we believe it, and a third onely to ſay we believe it for private cauſe or intereſt beſt known to our ſelves; and for the nature of Humane Faith, we have no one more pregnant example then of the Father in the Goſpel, who ſaw a miracle done by our Saviour upon his own Son, and moreover received a promiſe that all other things that concerned his good ſhould as eaſily be effected as that, if his faith were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and yet he confeſſed in tears that he had belief and unbelief upon him at one time; <hi>Lord I believe, help my unbelief.</hi> And the truth is, the ſtate of Faith, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the moſt Holy, ſince the fall of man, hath been much after this manner, and ſo untill the finiſher of our Faith ſhall come, it is likely to continue: for we ſee St. <hi>John,</hi> even in the midſt of his ſufferings for Chriſt in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſent yet two of his Diſciples with this meſſage, <hi>Art thou he that ſhould come, or do we look for another?</hi> ſo that it is hard to ſay whether men themſelves know what they believe. But now to return from this little digreſſion, with an explanation of my ſelf in theſe arguments that went before, and ſought to prove, that from natural cauſes or changes of food and education, man may have fallen from his firſt eſtate and happineſs; I would not from hence be thought to diſappoint God of his eternal degree, by which he hath ordained through ſeveral eſtates and trials to bring us to himſelf; but on the contrary, I do conceive thoſe ordinary means to have been the inſtruments of that decree; nor do I doubt, but when his will and pleaſure is, he may again by ordinary means, reſtoring us to our firſt habits of life, and the Earth to her firſt Airs and nutrition, bring the ſame Mankind back to innocenſe, and make the ſame garden of <hi>Eden</hi> again Paradiſe; and an Apple from the ſame tree, cure the deſeaſe that the firſt Apple brought into the world. The moſt learned Phyſicians of theſe late times, are many of them of opinion that the venereal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe that came not many hundred years ſince by contagion into the blood, and hath ſince been propagated with our poſterity, not being a thing inherent to the fabrick and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55925:23"/>
conſtitution of man, ſhall in time wear out, and the humour being ſpent, vaniſh at length quite away, with as much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as it came at the firſt; and ſince the time that I have lived in the world, which is but a ſhort meaſure of a ſlow revolution, I have obſerved a ſenſible decay of it, both in regard that I have heard many ſay, It is not ſo ſuddenly gotten as it was, and alſo in that when it is taken, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of it is now grown ſo weak, that every remedy that before uſed to fail, is now a certain cure. Now I know no reaſon nor contradiction to Holy Writ, that if a diſeaſe, that is, a piece of diſſolution, ſhall have this natural courſe and termination, why ſin and mortality it ſelf ſhould not have the like: nor can I, when I ſee the wonderful and various effects of nutrition in our bodies, but believe the ſame nutrition as powerful in our ſouls; when I put a piece of bread in my mouth, how many ſeveral commiſſions hath divine providence given unto it? there is not a part in my little world, but it hath a meſſage to deliver to it, it not onely takes care to ſupport my vitals and limbs, but even my excreſences, my hair and nailes; and ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the ſame morſel (like the Prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> againſt its will) is ſent to deſtroy the City: Now, if ſuch be the force of digeſtion upon the body, how ſhall I think it leſs upon the mind of man? and though the world have been ſubject to believe the ſtars to be the miniſters of the divine ſpirit, in governing of the world, yet I confeſs I cannot look over my head but under my feet for thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations; whatever comes not imediately from the throne of God to me, I expect to receive from his foot-ſtool the earth: And hence methinks, by the way, we may find that it hath not been altogether without ground or reaſon, that ſome have thought that after the temporal kingdom which our Saviour ſhall hereafter have in this world, mans im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality ſhall again begin in the ſame world where it firſt failed; St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>we ſhall all be changed,</hi> and changed <hi>in a moment</hi>; or rather indeed, as it is more conformable to the original, <hi>we ſhall be all reconcil'd</hi>; and theſe words do not onely go down to our graves with comfort, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to thoſe who at that day ſhall be found upon the earth, for theſe corruptible bodies of ours are certainly as eaſily reconciled to the divine will whilſt they are in this world, as raiſed again to glory hereafter. And here I think it's time to return again to that which gave the occaſion of this diſcourſe, where Man in his own firſt nature and his fall from it, is repreſented in <hi>Eſculapius</hi> his reſtoring <hi>Plutus</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:55925:23"/>
to his eyes, where we with great ingenuity find expreſſed by <hi>Ariſtophanus</hi> the ſuddain reconciliation of the world, inſomuch that the juſt man changes thoſe rags he hath ſo long worn with the <hi>Sycophant,</hi> for that rich attire his flattery and lies had got him; and likewiſe, that after that day there was no poſſibility of any longer counterfeiting the paſſions of the Soul, to give ſorrow and pain to our lives, and bring deceit and a falſe ſelf-opinion upon others: For we ſee the <hi>Old Woman</hi> in the ſame minute was put out of countenance, that ſhe ſhould at her years expect a lover; and likewiſe concerning Arts, both Speculative and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick, that Want was the Inventer of them, nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the mind of man from any principles of truth, but to make himſelf acceptable to thoſe to whom he is now become ſlave to ſo high a degree, that like dogs we are fain to take our bread from the hands of others, and that perhaps ſuch only as they cannot eat themſelves, either through their abundance or curioſity; and, this men are fain to deſerve, either as they can find out ſomething for their Maſters to govern and grow powerful by, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to entertain and paſs idle hours, when their tyranny and ambition cannot; men have not only Hands of ſeveral Profeſſions, but even their Souls are alſo of ſeveral Trades; ſome are Compilers of that they call Law, ſome Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Medicines, or rather poyſon; and, which is worſt of all, ſome are Divinity-makers, and turn oft the ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture into all faſhions, the which certainly, though it be one of the beſt Callings in the world, is yet one of the worſt Trades; and accordingly we find in this Comedy, when <hi>Plutus</hi> had his eyes again, how ſoon it was ſtarved: and the ſport of all is, that all this which the Great ones firſt invented to govern by, is now by long ſucceſſion wrought into ſuch a ſubtilty, that it is grown to govern them that thought to govern by it; and ſometimes too, not only by neceſſity, but through real opinion of the thing it ſelf: ſo natural is it for men, firſt to make lies, and afterwards come to believe them themſelves; the which <hi>Mountain</hi> excellently compares to Boys, that dreſs up one of their companions, and black his face, to repreſent the Devil, to make themſelves ſport; and when they have done, run away for fear of him, and forget that it was the Idol of their own hands: Now notwithſtanding that it appears that men are ſo wholly caſt down from their firſt natural eſtate, that our beſt friends (our Senſes) are no longer to be truſted, a worſe condition than which for a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55925:24"/>
living creature is, ſure, not to be imagined: It is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſee for all that, how that part of the world whoſe natures are under the bondage of education, do deſpiſe the reſt who ſtand free, with the title of Barbarous; ſome out of an intention of charity, and others with ſcorn and vanity praying for them as a loſt people, wiſhing to have them brought home to their own condition; not unlike to a friend of mine who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I went to ſee in the Fleet once, with intention either to deviſe a remedy with him, to bring him out, or at leaſt to comfort him againſt the misfortunes that had brought him thither; but, contrary to both thoſe intentions, he began with me, and the many conveniences and ſafeties of that life, and by what arts and difficulties I was to get thither for my everlaſting preferment; And certainly, not unlike to this confidence is that of thoſe who would have us change the principles of Nature for thoſe of Education, to change our bodies when they are hardened againſt wind and weather by the natural armour of our own skins, and reduce them to ſuch a tenderneſs, that the robbing of other creatures of all their cloaths is at length ſcarce ſufficient to defend us from the cold; to bring our ſenſual pleaſures and appetites to ſuch a niceneſs of food and diet, till it be harder to ſupply their luxury for that ſhort time of life we now enjoy, then it was in the firſt age to ſuſtain that nature which for its continuance got the name at leaſt of Immortality. Neither indeed, ſince the coming in of Propriety, the firſt thing that brought want, and conſequently traffick, and then war into the world, do I find that the courages of men have been more tryed to ſupply neceſſities than they are in the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they have made for their luxuries: What ſhall I think of him that firſt ſet upon an Oyſter, and put the living fiſh into his belly, ſcarce killing it ſo much as with his teeth? or, that will eat Frogs, and truſt to his judgment in knowing them from their neareſt kindred Toads, or Muſhroomes whileſt they are called Toad-ſtools; and for ſuch inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theſe is it for the moſt part that men account themſelves more civilized then others; and what is this but to ſet up our depraved natures to judge and condemn that truth and ſimplicity we were firſt created in? And in like manner, if that part of men who excel in Arts and Manufacture, ſhall from thence extol themſelves, and (which is now a common thing) ſeek conqueſt over thoſe who live happy without ſuch inventions, becauſe they feel no ſuch wants, the very argument they ſeek to prove their
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55925:24"/>
excellence by, diſcovers their miſery, by ſo much as it is a happier ſtate of mind not to want, than to have minds ſtill working how to ſupply our wants; and therefore here with wonderful ingenuity <hi>Ariſtophanus,</hi> when <hi>Plutus</hi> is reſtored to his eyes, finds no office for <hi>Mercury,</hi> that before was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to ſo many actions of Humane life: It was proverbial in <hi>Greece</hi> of old, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Humane Arts brought in Humane Sorrrow.</hi> And laſt of all, the ſtrongeſt argument that men fetch to make conqueſts over other nations, is from the neceſſity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their ſpeculative Philoſophy delivered by their teachers, bringing their Authority from men for the moſt part both againſt nature and experiment, until Humane ratiocination became nothing but agreement; not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Art of a Fencing-School, where the Maſter teaches both the offenſive and defenſive part, ſo that the Scholars are able to make a good ſhew of learning amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their weapons, and their guards and motions being agreed upon; but if a Country fellow happen to come in with a Flail, the vanitie of that Art is ſoon diſcovered, and he drives the whole School before him; and ſuch (in my opinion) is the end of the Schools of the Profeſſors of Learning, when men examine their confidence, as it were ſtep by ſtep, by the grounds of nature, and true experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not by their own tearms and principles, except it be in ſuch matters as are delivered by a higher Authority than Reaſon, the which admits of no diſcourſe, but what is both to the prejudice of the things themſelves, and the deſtruction of Humane reaſon, by letting it take a habit in doubtful principles and falſe concluſions: the which once got, like an ill diſeaſe that follows us through all Aires and Climates, ſo doth it go along with us in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of all the moſt important queſtions of our lives to our abſolute deſtruction: How ungodly a thing then is it for one nation or one man to preſs ſuch queſtions upon another as have no anſwer, and to impoſe what we our ſelves have received by faith upon the reaſons of ſuch as yet by the divine aſſiſtance are not brought further then the degree of natural men? And of this, what cruel exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples have thoſe that are followers of the two eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets for truth and falſhood, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Mahumet,</hi> brought into the world; ſo unchriſtian-like have been the means of late for the bringing in of Chriſt, that it is more then to be feared that thoſe that have brought ſalvation to others, by it have brought perdition to themſelves; ſo that, in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55925:25"/>
conqueſt over the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> it is a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Heathens that are ſaved, or the Chriſtians that are damned, are moſt in number; for what can man deſerve worſe from God Almighty than in ſeeking for ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to bring in his Prophet, by means both contrary to the Doctrine of that Prophet, and the example of the Prophet himſelf: Ought we to raiſe war in the behalf of him who to ſave his own life might have had legions of Angels to have fought for him, if he would have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Father for them? the which, that he might not deſtroy the temporal peace of a nation, he refuſed to do. How ſlow therefore ought men to be, till they have certain revelation that they are the inſtruments choſen for that purpoſe, in preſſing the converſion of others to the doctrine of their own Prophet! how fully convinced ſoever they themſelves are that there is no felicity in the life to come, but what is built and founded upon that Faith; ſince, though it be fit for every true believer to have that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in himſelf, yet is it ill done of them to make deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate concluſions of ſuch whom God himſelf ſees it not yet time perhaps to require more than an univerſal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from. For, ſuch we ſee his mercy hath been to the ages paſt, that we find in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11. where there is a large account of all the degrees and meaſures of Faith in the world, both before the Flood and a long time after, there was a kind of faith rewarded then in ſuch who had not received the promiſes; and theſe were Saints of no leſs magnitude then <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi>: the chief ſubſtance of whoſe Faith, as it is expreſſed in that Chapter, was, that <hi>the world was framed by the word of God, and that things which are ſeen were not made of things which do appear:</hi> Now with this Faith the Ancients, whom we commonly call Philoſophers, (and I hope were Divines, and are now Saints,) did almoſt in the very words all of them concur; <hi>Antiphanus,</hi> a Diſciple of <hi>Socrates, <gap reason="foreign">
