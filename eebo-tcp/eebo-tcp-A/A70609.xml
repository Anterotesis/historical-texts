         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Was preſent at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> when the Univerſity there
was lately <hi>Viſited</hi> by the <hi>Presbyterian Party,</hi> and was
Witneſs to all that paſt at the <hi>Tryals</hi> of the <hi>Principal</hi>
and other <hi>Maſters;</hi> and the Accounts of it having
ſince fallen into my hands, and I knowing them to
contain nothing but Matter of Fact and down right
Truth, thought fit now to Publiſh them; not to <hi>Continue,</hi>
or <hi>Excite Faction</hi> or <hi>Revenge,</hi> but to Vindicate Innocent
Men, from the <hi>Calumnies</hi> and <hi>Slanders</hi> that have been of
late Charged upon them. If the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly
<hi>propagated abroad,</hi> the Idle and Impertinent Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<hi>they invented at home,</hi> theſe <hi>Papers</hi> had never ſeen the
<hi>Light:</hi> It is indeed with great Reluctancy, that I give the
Tranſactions of that late <hi>Viſitation</hi> any room in my Memory;
but ſince the Clamours of a <hi>Factious Party</hi> conſtrain Men
to defend themſelves: It is but juſt to return <hi>ſuch Anſwers</hi> as
may undeceive well meaning People, and expoſe the <hi>Injuſtice</hi>
of that <hi>Inquiſition:</hi> It being ſo eaſie a thing to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<hi>That the Maſters of that Univerſities greateſt Crimes,
were their Places and Preferments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe in the following Papers, mention is often made
of a New Teſt, that the Parliament appointed for all
Univerſity Men; it may not be improper once for all
here in the beginning, to tell what that Teſt was;
for this then let it be remembered: That the</hi> 17 Act
Parl. 1. Seſſ. 2. July 4. 1690. <hi>Earl</hi> Melvil <hi>Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
appoints;</hi> That no Maſter or Profeſſor in any Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or School, ſhall be allowed to continue in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of his Function, but ſuch as do Acknowledge and Profeſs,


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47542:3"/>
and ſhall Subſcribe the Confeſſion of Faith<note n="*" place="margin">Weſtminſter <hi>Confeſſion.</hi>
               </note>, Ratified and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by this preſent Parliament; and alſo, ſhall Swear the
Oath of Allegiance to their Majeſties; and withal, ſhall be
found to be of Pious, Loyal, and Peaceable Converſation, and
of good and ſufficient Literature, and Abilities, for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Employments; and ſubmitting to the Government of
the Church now ſetled by Law—and are well Affected to
their Majeſties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, by <hi>Act 38. Seſſ. 2. Parliament. 1. Gulielm. &amp; Mari.
July 22. 1690. Melvil</hi> Commiſſioner, all perſons who are
bound to Swear the Oath of Allegiance, are alſo obliged to
Subſcribe this <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> as they call it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I A. B.</hi> Do in the Sincerity of my Heart, Acknowledge and
Declare, that their Majeſties King <hi>William</hi> and Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> are the only Lawful, Undoubted Soveraings, King
and Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well de <hi>jure,</hi> as <hi>de facto,</hi> and in
the Exerciſe of the Government: And therefore I do ſincerely
and faithfully, promiſe and ingage, that I will with Heart
and Hand, Life and Goods, Maintain and Defend Their
Majeſties Title and Government, againſt the Late King <hi>James,</hi>
his Adherents, and all other Enemies; who, either by open
or ſecret Attempts, ſhall Diſturb or Diſquiet Their Majeſties
in the Exerciſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the <hi>Inſtructions</hi> which the Parliament by their
Acts gave to the Viſitors; and a conſiderable number of them
being <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters, were not wanting in their Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to ſcrew up every thing to the greateſt height, againſt
the Epiſcopal Maſters, and to make them feel the ſevere ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects

Profeſſed,</hi> and <hi>Subſcribed,</hi> without any Limitation,
Reſtriction, or Reſervation whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The Viſitors might have been well aſſured, That no
Maſter or Profeſſor of any Conſcience, who had been <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copally
Ordained,</hi> or acquainted with the Primitive Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church, could any ways comply with Conditions ſo
Rigid and Severe.</p>
            <p>It had been ſoon enough then, for the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to
have fled to their old <hi>Experimented</hi> way of <hi>Libelling,</hi> when
the Maſters had ſtood their ground againſt that <hi>New Teſt,</hi>
which Originally had no end, but to make <hi>vacant places.</hi>
But the <hi>Preachers</hi> of that <hi>Party</hi> (Members of the Viſitation)
judged it more convenient, Boldly and Indefatigably to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate
the Profeſſors, leſt if they had been turned out for
mere and juſt Scruples of Conſcience, the People ſhould have
murmmured and complained; The Body of Mankind often
believe <hi>the firſt and loudeſt Reports,</hi> few of the People being
capable, willing, or at leiſure to Examine <hi>the Truth</hi> of things,
and ſince now the <hi>Faction</hi> had got the uppermoſt, and had
Power in their hand, they enquire into all things that might
make the <hi>Profeſſours</hi> odious to the City or Nation, and
thought fit to let them feel the effects of their Raſhneſs, if


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47542:4"/>
in all their Life time, they had been once ſpoke againſt <hi>the
Impoſture or Enthuſiaſme</hi> of that Sect.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preachers (who earneſtly wiſhed to be
Employed in the <hi>Toyl</hi> and <hi>Drudgery</hi> of this Affair) made it
their Buſineſs to ſearch into all the Actions of the <hi>Profeſſors</hi>
Lives, eſpecially <hi>ſuch</hi> as were capable to be <hi>Transformed</hi> into
a <hi>Libel;</hi> and having the Aſſiſtance and <hi>Zeal</hi> of ſome of the
<hi>New Magiſtrates of</hi> Edinburgh, to ſecond their Endeavours,
it was eaſie to foreſee what Quarter <hi>they</hi> might expect, <hi>who
differed from them:</hi> And this was no difficult Province for
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> to mannage, conſidering the Nature of their
Diſcipline, and their preſent Conſtitution; The moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
things have two handles, and <hi>ſome Men</hi> induſtriouſly
ſeize the worſt: But becauſe they pretended to be moſt Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Reformers,</hi> they would therefore do their work <hi>thorowly,</hi>
and ſtrip their Oppoſers as bare of their Reputation and
Good Name, as of their Livelyhoods and Preferments; and
having now got the Church's Juriſdiction and Revenues into
their hands, it was not ſafe for them to want <hi>the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and Psſſeſſion <hi>of the Seminaries of Learning:</hi> And
therefore the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> that Preached before the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
never forgot to Exhort ſuch as were in Power <hi>ſpeedily to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Univerſities;</hi> which is no leſs in their Language,
than <hi>to plant them with Presbyterians;</hi> To accompliſh this,
it was neceſſary to Repreſent the Maſters of Univerſities
under the Epiſcopal Conſtitution, as <hi>very Ill Men, Enemies to
the Godly, Socinians, Papiſts;</hi> now the People could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
when <hi>they</hi> ſpoke <hi>Contradictions,</hi> for tho' <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and
<hi>Popery,</hi> be two oppoſite Points of the Compaſs, yet ſome of
their <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> ſcrupled not, among the <hi>Goſſoping Siſters,</hi>

            <p>When the Government of the <hi>City of Edinburgh,</hi> was
lodged in the hands of the firſt and beſt order of Citizens and
Gentlemen; the Maſters of the Colledge had all the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
that they themſelves could wiſh; They lived in
all Tranquility and Freedome during the Adminiſtration of
Sir <hi>Magnus Prince</hi> and his Predeceſſour, Sir <hi>Thomas Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedy:</hi>
They made it (both of them) their Buſineſs to
preſerve the Order, Fabrick and Revenues of <hi>that Houſe;</hi>
they omitted no occaſion of Supporting the Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47542:5"/>
of <hi>its Maſters;</hi> as well as of diſcouraging what ought
to be reproved, and timouſly amended; whenever there was
the leaſt ground for it. The Maſters of the College in that
Period, had nothing to do but carefully to look after the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Proficiency of their Students; for the Countenance
of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and their generous Inclinations to Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<hi>Learning,</hi> did ſo ſecure and guard the <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> againſt
the little efforts of cenſorious and <hi>talkative Fanaticks,</hi> that
they could not contrive how to be more happy in their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
For theſe Gentlemen knew what an Ornament their
Univerſity was to the City and whole Kingdom, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Freedom, Contentment, and Retirement are to the
attainment of Learning: and therefore they were ſo far
from vexing and diſturbing them, that they heaped upon
them all marks of Honour and Regard.</p>
            <p>Others (ſhuffling <hi>themſelves</hi> into the <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> under the
Covert of <hi>ſuch Commotions</hi> as neceſſarily attend all great <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions)</hi>
had not the ſame view of things, They thought
their Buſineſs was to Reform, tho' <hi>they knew not what;</hi> and <hi>this
Reformation</hi> was regulated by ſuch <hi>Oracles</hi> as managed their
Councils, and the <hi>Reſponſes</hi> were always given by <hi>Intereſt:</hi>
Hence they ſeemed to mind nothing ſo much as <hi>the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of that Seminary:</hi> Sometimes they thought that they
might manage the <hi>Diſcipline of the Houſe,</hi> without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>the Maſters;</hi> ſometimes they thought they might <hi>by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>

ſometimes they would contrive <hi>odd and phantaſtick</hi>
Schemes of Diſcipline, and it is not eaſie to imagine into
what <hi>freakiſh Humours, ſilly Conceits,</hi> and <hi>little Tricks</hi> this
Fancy metamorphoſed it ſelf in the ſpace of two Years. But
thoſe Attempts ſerved only to make Citizens of the beſt Senſe
and Quality, ſome of them to <hi>Laugh,</hi> and others <hi>to Lament,</hi>
that the Profeſſors of the <hi>Liberal Sciences</hi> ſhould be ſo treated
by ſuch <hi>illiterate Buſie-bodies.</hi> For generally the Citizens of
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> are not only Affable, Kind and Courteous to the
Maſters of that College, and to Learned Men in general;
but alſo very forward to promote the <hi>Intereſt of that Houſe;</hi>
The original Erection whereof is owing to <hi>their Charity;</hi>

but few of them but retain a tender eſteem of its great Worth
and Advantage, and the Eſcapes and Prepoſterous Dealing of
ſome of them; in this Critical Juncture, is not at all to
be laid to the Charge of the Body of the People, who have
always valued the Maſters of the College as they did the
Education of their Children, than which nothing is of greater
conſequence to themſelves, or <hi>the Societies</hi> in which they live:
The <hi>Presbyterian Miniſters,</hi> finding the Endeavours of their
Magiſtrates too ſlow to ſerve their ends; and that they were
frequently <hi>baffled</hi> in thoſe little Skirmiſhes with the Maſters,
importuned the Leading Men of the Party, to procure ſuch
<hi>an Act of Parliament as might beſt ſerve their Deſigns againſt
the Univerſities,</hi>

they had but <hi>ſubmitted to Epiſcopacy,</hi> were not allowed to
hold their Places, but in a moſt <hi>precarious</hi> manner.</p>
            <p>The Maſters of Univerſities complain <hi>juſtly</hi> of <hi>two things.</hi>
Firſt, That they were obliged <hi>to take Oaths that the reſt of
the Clergy of the Nation were not bound to take.</hi> Whereas any
Legal Teſt ſhould reach all or none. Secondly, That this Teſt
ſhould contain <hi>not only their Allegiance to the Civil Authority,
but alſo their hearty Submiſſion to the Presbyterïan Government
and the new Model of it in</hi> Scotland<note n="*" place="margin">Which differs vaſtly, not only from all Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians abroad, but from all their own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>. Thus the Presbyterians
were very ſure, that if they did not thruſt them out by <hi>the
Firſt,</hi> they could not fail to ſend them Packing by <hi>the Second,</hi>
eſpecially ſince the laſt Clauſe of the <hi>New Teſt</hi> obliged them
to ſubmit to Presbytery, which is no leſe than to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up to all the Deciſions of the Conſiſtory.</p>
            <p>It was not to be expected but that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> would
quickly poſſeſs themſelves of <hi>the Univerſities,</hi> ſince the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Government was lodged in the hands of a few of
them, by an <hi>Heteroclite</hi> kind of Prelacy never before known

<hi>Presbyterian Covetouſneſs</hi> and Sacriledge, and their <hi>Honour</hi> and
<hi>Good Name,</hi> to their <hi>Vanity, Pride</hi> and <hi>Revenge;</hi> It was not
enough to have them <hi>removed,</hi> unleſs it was with <hi>Oſtentation</hi>

            <p>It was not unpleaſant to ſome Spectators to behold at what
pains the <hi>Presbyterian Preachers</hi> were to patch up <hi>Libels</hi> againſt
the Maſters, going from Houſe to Houſe, from one Company

entertaining Perſons of Quality with the <hi>Opinions</hi> and
<hi>Erroneous Conceits</hi> they alledged them then to have had.
And <hi>beſides that,</hi> they had the true Art of <hi>Transforming</hi> the

of Honour and Integrity amongſt them, (ſoon perceiving
their <hi>Aſſeſſors</hi> upon this <hi>Committee, were not to be guided by

never again appeared; ſuch were the Earl of <hi>Louthian,</hi> Lord
Secretary <hi>Dulrimple,</hi> L. <hi>Raith,</hi> Sir <hi>John Dempſter,</hi> &amp;c.
When once they retired, the Maſters were left to <hi>wreſtle</hi>
with all the <hi>Chicane,</hi> and <hi>affected Miſtakes and Prejudices</hi> of
then <hi>Sworn</hi> Enemies; and becauſe ſome of them did inſiſt upon

in their own words, and their moſt plauſible and ſucceſsful To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks
fairly Examined: And ſince the Maſters were not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſufficient time to make their Defences, but forced to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47542:8"/>
their Anſwers to many particulars which were jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
together againſt them, and which they never heard of
until they were ſiſted before theſe <hi>Tribunals:</hi> I will therefore
take care to pick up all the Exceptions that came to my
hand; and now, ſince the Anſwers muſt be made Publick,
where I judge them defective or obſcure to Strangers, I
will Enlarge and Explain them, and that ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe they thought theſe Libels of ſuch weight
as to keep them upon Record in their Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters.</p>
            <p>Indced, if the Reputation of Innocent Men had been Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted,
only by ſpreading Reports and ſcattering idle Stories
among the People, no Man needed to have been at the pains
to anſwer ſuch whiſpers as flie only the in dark: <hi>Innocence,</hi> and
the good Nature of the Citizens of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> would have
ſufficiently defended the Maſters againſt ſecret Reproaches
and Calumny, but now that they are allowed a place in the
<hi>Publick Records,</hi> it is but a piece of <hi>Innocent Self-Defence,</hi> to
expoſe the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of thoſe Arguments they laid ſuch ſtreſs
upon, when the <hi>Presbyterian Preachers,</hi> who alone were moſt
Active in ſuch <hi>Libels,</hi> practiſed ſuch an <hi>Arbitrary Inquiſition</hi>
upon the <hi>Theatre</hi> of the Nation, what is to be expected
from them in the <hi>remote Corners</hi> of the Country? where
their Meetings are not <hi>overawed</hi> with the Preſence of
Perſons of Quality, where there is no <hi>check</hi> upon them, nor
any <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of their <hi>Extravagance,</hi> but the <hi>Lay Elders,</hi>
thoſe Grave <hi>Noddies</hi> of their own Erection, a new ſet of
<hi>Presbyters</hi> of their ſpecial invention, without <hi>Miſſion or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government in our Nation, had been
<hi>Tempered</hi> by a Modeſt Dependance upon the State, there had
been leſs place for ſuch <hi>unreaſonable Oppreſſions</hi> and <hi>irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diable
Confuſions</hi> as are now <hi>too viſible:</hi> Nor is it poſſible to
preſerve the <hi>Peace of the Nation;</hi> if there lie no <hi>Appeal</hi> from
the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Conſiſtory:</hi> This was the moſt <hi>inſufferable
piece of Popery</hi> that <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> Groaned under before
the Reformation, and therefore they ſhook off this <hi>Yoke</hi> too
<hi>Grievous to Them,</hi> and to <hi>Their Anceſtours:</hi> This <hi>Independent
Diſcipline</hi> as it is managed by our <hi>Innovatours,</hi> is founded
upon ſuch <hi>Ambition,</hi> and <hi>Arrogance,</hi> as is inconſiſtent with
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>Innocent Freedome</hi> of Humane Life, and


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47542:8"/>
the <hi>Prerogative Royal</hi> of Kings, and inſtead of promoting
<hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> among Chriſtians, increaſes only mutual
<hi>Cenſurings, Factions, Hatred,</hi> and <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and what elſe
is moſt oppoſite to the Spiritual Tendency, Charity, and
Purity of our Holy Religion.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>they themſelves</hi> look back upon all the ſteps and
<hi>Pageantry</hi> of <hi>that Viſitation,</hi> they cannot but acknowledge
they have miſſed ſome conſiderable part of <hi>their</hi> Deſign; for
the <hi>Maſters</hi> they were moſt violent againſt, are as much Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
and Esteemed by their former Friends in the City of
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> and elſewhere, as ever: They did not think to
keep <hi>their places</hi> in defiance of the preſent Law, nor do
they complain ſo much of the <hi>Illegality</hi> of the <hi>Sentence</hi> againſt
them, being there is now ſuch a Law, as <hi>they could not
comply with,</hi> but they have Reaſon to complain, that there
was ſuch a Law made on purpoſe to turn out ſome particular
Perſons, as the <hi>Contrivers threatned</hi> Twelve Months before
that Tryal, They hoped (If they were not Treated like
Chriſtians and Scholars) they might be allowed the Civilities
due to Humanity, and the common forms of Juſtice; now
being this Account carries with it the undeniable Evidence of
particular Matters of Fact; The Reader may by it diſcern
ſomewhat of the <hi>Spirit of Presbytery,</hi> and of that <hi>Partiality
and Hypocriſie,</hi> that animates their moſt Solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
            <p>It is not intended by this Preface to Inſinuate, that <hi>all
the Nobility and Gentry, who were Named to Viſit the
Univerſities, by Act of Parliament, were equally inclined to
Faction and Injuſtice:</hi> It is certain, that many of them were
averſe from ſuch Severities, and particularly my Lord <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>michael</hi>
Preſident of the Committee for <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> Treated the
Principal Dr. <hi>Fall,</hi> and Subordinate Maſters there, with all
the Civilities due to their Merit and Character; for tho' the
<hi>Cameronians</hi> in that place had prepared <hi>Libels</hi> againſt the
Regents, yet my Lord <hi>Carmichael</hi> rejected them with Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
And tho' <hi>the Maſters</hi> of the Univerſity of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi>
have been Examined with all <hi>Rigour</hi> and <hi>Severity</hi> (all
the Vintners and their Servants, and other Rabble at St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>
being Summoned to appear before the Committee,
and made to Declare upon Oath, all things that ever they
heard or knew of the Maſters of that Univerſity) yet no


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47542:9"/>
Maſters were treated <hi>as Malefactors,</hi> but the Profeſſors of the
Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> It's true, nothing but Civility and
Diſcretion could be expected from a Gentleman of my Lord
<hi>Carmichael</hi>'s <hi>Honour, Integrity and good Breeding.</hi> And that
any Perſons of Quality were ſo <hi>ridiculouſly Zealous</hi> as to Glory
in <hi>their Severities againſt Men of Learning and Piety,</hi> is, I
hope, to be aſcribed rather to the <hi>Prejudices</hi> of their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than to any <hi>Perverſeneſs</hi> in their Nature.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spirit of Presbytery</hi> hath in it ſo much <hi>meanneſs</hi> and
<hi>inſolence,</hi> when it is attended with <hi>Force</hi> and the <hi>Secular Arm,</hi>
that it cannot ſo much as <hi>counterfeit Civility;</hi> wherefore it's
hoped that the Nation will ſpeedily ſhake off <hi>this Yoke,
which neither they nor their Forefathers could ever bear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Gentry are Men of good Senſe and Education; and
tho' in the Weſtern Shires ſome of them are byaſſed towards
this <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Pedantick Tyranny,</hi> yet it is not poſſible to
<hi>keep even them</hi> ſo much in the <hi>dark,</hi> as not to ſee the <hi>Novelty</hi>
and <hi>Vanity</hi> of <hi>Presbyterian Pretencies:</hi> And therefore ſince
<hi>Presbytery</hi> began to appear in its true Colours, they have loſt
the greateſt part <hi>even</hi> of <hi>ſuch of them,</hi> as they had formerly
deluded.</p>
            <p>The Presbyterians from abroad have always ſpoke and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of the Epiſcopal Conſtitution <hi>with reſpect and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
becauſe they found that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and their Adherents
(eſpecially in <hi>England) have been always the Glory and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
as well as firſt Promoters of the Reformation.</hi> But the
<hi>through-pac'd weſtern Presbyterians,</hi> have loſt all Thoughts of
any other concern but of <hi>their own Model;</hi> and tho' it never
prevailed in its <hi>full force</hi> and <hi>tendency</hi> in any other Church
upon Earth, yet they muſt <hi>meaſure</hi> all Mankind by that <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard.</hi>
There is ſcarce a <hi>little ruling Elder</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">A Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture word, but the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it in the Presbyterian Language is not to be met with in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, a late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the World.</note> in the Weſt of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> but <hi>expounds</hi> the <hi>darkeſt Prophecies</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
and the <hi>Revelation, with relation to the Covenant and
the Reformation wrought by it.</hi> This is the <hi>great Secret</hi> of
their Religion, the <hi>original ſpring</hi> that ſets all their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
in motion. They are <hi>a Covenanted People,</hi> i.e. linked
and confederated together to advance and propagate their
Faction and Diſcipline, which they upon all occaſions, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly
call the <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is true, the
<hi>Roman Domination is intolerable,</hi> but then to make the People
<hi>bow</hi> under the weight of it, <hi>They pretend</hi> to <hi>Infallibility:</hi> The


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47542:9"/>
Presbyterians ſhould follow them <hi>in this Pretence,</hi> as they do
in the <hi>Severity of their Procedures,</hi> that at leaſt they might
be <hi>Conſequential;</hi> for they are as impatient of Contradiction
as <hi>the Jeſuits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Witneſs Mr. <hi>Black. Vide</hi> Spotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</note> from whom they have borrowed moſt of their
beloved <hi>Tenets,</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> by which they endeavour to
ſupport them; Eſpecially their opinion <hi>concerning Kings,</hi> and
the <hi>Independance of Clergymen upon the Secular Powers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe without extraordinary Appearances of Sanctity
and Devotion, the People cannot be <hi>wheedled</hi> into a belief
of their Godlineſs and Honeſty; they <hi>confine</hi> the Name <hi>of
the Godly</hi> only to <hi>themſelves,</hi> as Papiſts do the Name of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
to <hi>them:</hi>
               <note place="margin">J. F.</note> And I have heard ſome of <hi>them</hi> ſay, That
<hi>it was not poſſible the Power of Godlineſs ſhould prevail, but
under Presbytery:</hi> If it be ſo, the World is much miſtaken;
I wiſh with all my heart we had better Evidences of <hi>Their
Piety,</hi> than of late we have diſcerned: I am ſure, and no leſs
ſorry, <hi>That ſome who advance and ſupport their Fuction at
preſent in</hi> Scotland, <hi>are remarkably profligate ſenſual and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Debauchees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had we no other Evidences of <hi>their unchriſtian and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
temper,</hi> but their late <hi>Injuſtice towards the Epiſcopal
Clergy,</hi> we might be ſufficiently convinced of their ill Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Their <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> was never acted with <hi>leſs Diſguiſe,</hi>
they are ſo <hi>bare-faced</hi> in their illegal Proceedings, they leave
off to Counterfeit: They abuſe <hi>the Power</hi> which is put in
their hands, to that degree, that <hi>their Partiality</hi> is become
the Talk of many of their own Adherents. Tho' <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Inclinations of the People,</hi> be no good Argument (nay,
that which Chriſtianity is deſigned to ſubdue) yet really they
have as little Foundation <hi>in the Affection of the People,</hi> as they
have in <hi>Scripture and Reaſon;</hi> And this will appear upon the
leaſt ſearch even into thoſe places of the Nation where they
boaſted that <hi>there was none to contradict them</hi> (I don't mean the
Weſt) but ſome of the moſt eminent and populous Counties and
Pariſhes even be South <hi>Forth,</hi> what do they think of the Shires
of the <hi>Mers</hi> and <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> of the Pariſhes of <hi>Peebles, Dalkeith,
Muſſelburgh</hi> and <hi>Aberlady,</hi> &amp;c. and which is yet more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to their Wiſdom, <hi>They are all convenient Livings, and
not far from</hi> Edinburgh. As for <hi>the Northern Country,</hi> we
know what Eſteem they are like to have there, by their
late Reception at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> when they want to <hi>offer the


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47542:10"/>
Goſpel</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Their own Phraſe, for no leſs diſtinction muſt be made between them and thoſe that differ from them, than that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</note> there, for ſince they muſt be attended <hi>with Troops,</hi> it is no
good Argument, of their having any great Foundation in the
Affection of the People; but indeed, <hi>the weapons of their
warfare</hi> are only known to <hi>be mighty,</hi> becauſe <hi>they are felt
to be Carnal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two Arguments I find lately inſiſted upon by ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
of that <hi>Party,</hi> to prove that the general <hi>Inclination</hi> of
that Kingdom is for <hi>Presbytery.</hi> They are to be ſeen in <hi>P. 32.</hi>
of a late Pamphlet, Entituled, <hi>A further Vindication,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That the Biſhops durſt never venture upon the
Calling of a <hi>National Synod,</hi> even in that Period that Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
ſtood by <hi>Law,</hi> leſt ſome of the <hi>Clergy</hi> might aſſault the
very Order of Biſhops, tho' moſt of them had received Orders
from their own hands.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That, if the Author of this Pamphlet is
is perſwaded, That the moſt part of the Epiſcopal Clergy are
for <hi>Presbytery,</hi> why then does he not influence the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
to receive them into the <hi>Government,</hi> eſpecially ſince
he acknowledges that the Miniſters cannot lawfully part with
their ſhare of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Power to any other. The Factions
in the State, rather than the Inclinations of the Clergy, was
the Reaſon why the Biſhops did not call a National Synod.
And if the Author thinks that the Scotiſh Clergy are for Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
how inexcuſable is it in the Presbyterians to <hi>Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi>
them ſo violently when they have nothing to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, but that they complyed with <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> ſince
the firſt Covenanters were as liable to this <hi>Accuſations</hi> as any
of the preſent Clergy.</p>
            <p>His next Argument is, That there was a Neceſſity to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
an <hi>Army</hi> to Suppreſs the Inſurrections of the <hi>Weſtern</hi>
Shires when the Government was <hi>Epiſcopal.</hi> This is rather a
threatning, than an Argument, and we know very well, that
ſince ever that Sect thruſt up its Head above the Ground, they
were troubleſome to <hi>Authority,</hi> and will continue ſo as long
as there is any matter for <hi>FACTION</hi> and <hi>REVENGE</hi> to
work upon, for they Preach to their People that they may
advance their <hi>own way,</hi> whether the Prince will or will not.
But I leave it to the Author to judge what the Conſequences
ſhould be, if the Epiſcopal Clergy (who are now ſo cruelly
trampled upon by their <hi>Inſolence</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice)</hi> ſhould Preach
to the People of their <hi>Communion</hi> the ſame very Doctrines


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47542:10"/>
that are Propagated by the <hi>Covenantors,</hi> if they Preached up
<hi>Aſſaſſinations</hi> and <hi>Rebellions</hi> as their Enemies do, I ſuppoſe a
more conſiderable <hi>Army</hi> would be neceſſary; for it is certain, that
the People that adhere to the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Clergy can fight much
better than the Weſtern <hi>Covenanters,</hi> and 2000 Men can keep
theſe Shires very quiet at any time. But in ſtead of thoſe
lame Topicks which he <hi>fancies Demonſtrations,</hi> I think
a better expedient were to put it to the Poll of the whole
Nation, which I know the Presbyterians will never be for.</p>
            <p>The Author is much miſtaken if he thinks that the Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Scots Clergy are Presbyterians, though they are
content, to joyn with Presbyterians in Church Judicatories in
all thoſe Duties that are uncontroverted. His Book is rather
an Advice to the Presbyterians, than an Apology for them:
For as long as the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> is ſuch, as that it may be
<hi>wreſted,</hi> it's certain they will uſe it not for <hi>Edification</hi> but
<hi>Deſtruction,</hi> and the queſtion in our preſent Circumſtances is
not what belongs to the Civil, and what to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi>
Power, but what the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have formerly done, what
they do now, what's likely they will do hereafter upon their
own <hi>Principles,</hi> and whether or not they can ever be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to profeſs their Repentance for what they have done.
The Author indeed deſerves thanks that he offers them a more
moderate <hi>Scheme,</hi> and that he acknowledges their former
<hi>Extravagancies,</hi> but in all the Book I ſee no proper Remedy
for our preſent <hi>Confuſions,</hi> and the truth is, there are many
of his thoughts very juſt; yet the true Remedy is not to offer
Advice, but to pull out the <hi>Teeth</hi> of our <hi>Oppreſſors,</hi> and then
(and not till then) every Man may ſit under his own Fig-tree.
However I intend this Author no <hi>Unkindneſs,</hi> who (I think)
underſtands the World very well, and much better than he
does ſome places of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, and the Acts of the
Apoſtles: Which I have no mind to examine fully in this
Preface. Only let him be advis'd not to alledge for Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
that place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> The <hi>Spirits of
the Prophets are ſubject unto the Prophets.</hi> For tho' this Text
ſhould be chang'd unto all <hi>ſhapes</hi> and <hi>figures,</hi> it can yield no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to his <hi>purpoſe;</hi> for it lignifies no more, than that the
Prophets inſpired by God were leſt in the Exerciſe and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of their Reaſon, when they uttered their Propheſies,


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47542:11"/>
and this diſtinguiſhed them from the Exſtaticks and Enthuſiaſts
who were poſſeſed by <hi>Devils,</hi> and delivered their <hi>Oracular
Reſponſes</hi> in Fury and Tranſport.</p>
            <p>For the other miſtake of the <hi>Apoſtolick Character,</hi> Pag. 4.
It is no more than what is ordinarily ſaid in all Preſbyterian
<hi>Syſtems,</hi> but when he Examines it a little more accurately, he
will find by this eſpecial Character which he <hi>appropriates</hi> to the
Apoſtles (and by which he <hi>diſtinguiſhes</hi> the Apoſtles from
other Miniſters) that the <hi>Seventy</hi> Disciples are as much <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi>
as the Twelve. I hope the Author of that Pamphlet will
Pardon this <hi>Digreſſion.</hi> His Book may be examined more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
in another Treatiſe. When ever he perſwades the
Brethren of his way to act like <hi>reaſonable</hi> Men, they will
meet with leſs oppoſition, and he himſelf will deſerve the juſt
Commendations of <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Modeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have hitherto gloried in <hi>their Extemporary Prayers;</hi>
I love not at any rate to play with things Sacred, I know
that Men in Private and in their Cloſets ought not be tied to
Words or Forms that are preſcribed; for if we can fix our
Attention on <hi>God himſelf,</hi> and the things agreeable to his Will,
and ſuitable to our Neceſſities, we need not words, if we have
but ſtrong and fervent Deſires <hi>for all things are naked and
open to the Eyes of him with whom we have to do;</hi> but when
we go into the Houſe of God, it's long ſince <hi>Solomon</hi> advis'd
<hi>to go with reverence, for he is in Heaven and we are upon
Earth; our words ſhould not only be few, but very well weighed,</hi>
and apt to beget in the Hearers, <hi>an awful ſence of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi>
and of the inconceivable diſtance between him and the
Workmanſhip of his hands: Therefore the Wiſdom of the
Chriſtian Church, thought fit in all Ages to put words in the
Mouths of her Children when they approach the moſt High
God in his Houſe of Prayer: for it is very odd that we dare
come <hi>into his</hi> Houſe with <hi>leſs Preparation,</hi> than we do when
we <hi>addreſs to</hi> any of our <hi>conſiderable Neighbours:</hi> yet with
the ſaddeſt regret it muſt be acknowledged, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
of late have to the <hi>Diſgrace of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and
of the Solemnity of its Worſhip, changed <hi>the Devotion of the
Chriſtian Church,</hi> into <hi>incoherent Rapſodies and Fopperies.</hi>
I am confident (not to mention <hi>the Blaſphemies</hi> for Twenty
two Years, and the New <hi>of</hi> Montroſs <hi>his Armies;</hi> with


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47542:11"/>
which they were wont to run their Glaſſes) if <hi>their Prayers</hi>
but ſince the late Revolution, within the City of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
and the Places next Adjacent to it, were but Printed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to Publick View, all the Proteſtant Churches would
abhor their way; as the ready means to introduce and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> among the People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pulpit Blaſphemies</hi> that have lately been <hi>belched</hi> out
<hi>againſt Heaven</hi> in this Nation, cannot be related without
<hi>Horrour and Indignation:</hi> Nor was God ever ſo much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by the <hi>Vanities</hi> of the Pagan Idolatry, as by the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Inſpiration of our new Reformers,</hi> every little trifling
occurrence that's ſuggeſted to their Fancy, or caſually tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in their Memory, is immediately cramb'd into their
Prayers.</p>
            <p>But I have digreſſed too far, now then to return to my
particular Theme. <hi>The Viſitors</hi> put themſelves indeed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
toll in examining the Maſters of the Colledge of
<hi>Edinburgh:</hi> And yet the <hi>Particulars</hi> they inſiſted upon were
ſuch, as they themſelves knew, neither to be <hi>material,</hi> nor
<hi>poſſible to be proved.</hi> They could not but think that the moſt
remarkable ſteps they made in this Affair would readily come
to light, and yet they were not ſo wiſe as to <hi>temper</hi> their
Proceedings <hi>with the leaſt Diſcretion;</hi> ſo difficult a thing it
is to hide what has got the Aſcendant over all their Paſſions.
A Calmer Method and Temperament would have ſerved the
Deſign of their Government to better purpoſes, If their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
may be called <hi>a Government,</hi> that't every where at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with <hi>ſo many Complaints, ſo much Confuſion and Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi>
But I am not to teach <hi>them</hi> how to ſtrengthen and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
<hi>their Party;</hi> for none can deny <hi>them the two</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Supporters of Faction and Schiſm, <hi>Impudence</hi> and <hi>Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</hi>
They may think this Language ſomething courſe and
ſevere, but it is hard to change the Propriety of words. If
we muſt ſpeak of <hi>them</hi> and of <hi>their actings,</hi> the keeneſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
come ſhort of their Oppreſſions and Falſhoods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They had the Confidence at</hi> London <hi>to deny</hi> that ſome of
the People of <hi>Aberdene</hi> had their Ears nail'd to the Pillory
lately at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> becauſe they teſtified their reſpect to their own
Epiſcopal Miniſters, and would not ſuffer the Inquiſitors to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
them of the Bleſſing of their Doctrine and Preſence.</p>
            <p>

Upon the 27th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Committee met, and ſpent
ſome time in Reading the Libels, before the Maſters were
called to appear: A little after, they were pleaſed to call in
the Principal Dr. <hi>Monro;</hi> upon his Appearance, Sir <hi>John
Hall</hi> deſired him <hi>to Anſwer to the ſeveral Articles contained in
his Indictment</hi> which he commanded their Clerk then to read
<hi>openly,</hi> in the face of the Court and Spectators.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accordingly, The Clerk read the Firſt and Second Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
to which the Dr. anſwered</hi> ut infra, <hi>but finding that the
Paper contained a great many Articles, He pleaded,</hi> That he
was not obliged to Anſwer an unſubcribed Libel; <hi>that,</hi> He ſhould
know his Accuſer, <hi>And that</hi> this Method of Tryal was New,
Unjuſt, and Illegal: That Men ſhould be obliged to Anſwer ſo
many Queſtions <hi>ex tempore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A certain Member of the Committee told the Dr. that it
was no <hi>Libel,</hi> but an <hi>Information.</hi> The Principal anſwered,
That a <hi>Slanderous Information,</hi> containing ſo many Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
to the ruine of a Man's <hi>Reputation</hi> and <hi>good Name,</hi> was
to him the ſelf-ſame thing with a Libel: at leaſt that he was
not Lawyer enough ſo nicely to diſtinguiſh them; but that
he was ſure the one had the ſame Effects with the other; and
ſince the thing was the ſame, he was not concerned by what
Name it was called.</p>
            <p>The Committee-Man told him, <hi>It was to have no Effect till
it was proved;</hi> (a Favour which they do not always grant)
The Principal replied, That there was a <hi>double Effect,</hi> That
of <hi>Deprivation,</hi> and <hi>the loſs of his Good Name;</hi> and tho' the
<hi>firſt</hi> was not Attained without <hi>Proof;</hi> yet the <hi>laſt</hi> was ſure to
follow upon ſuch a <hi>malicious Charge,</hi> ſince the People were
but too apt to believe what was publickly informed, tho' it
were <hi>not</hi> proved; and ſo that which He called an <hi>Information,</hi>
would have the <hi>Effect</hi> of a <hi>Libel,</hi> even in the worſt ſenſe that
it could be taken.</p>
            <p>The Principal, wearied with <hi>Jangling about a word,</hi> and
<hi>Conſcious of his own Innocency,</hi> was willing to hear the worſt
they could ſay, and ſo the Clerk proceeded to other Articles:
And after having read one Paper, another far more Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and ridiculous was put into his hand to heighten the
<hi>Libel;</hi> The Articles whereof follow.</p>

entered to the ſecond Claſs, moſt of the Parents of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that were to enter to the ſaid Claſs, enclined to put
them back to the firſt Claſs, for fear of there being tainted
with Popery; But Dr. <hi>Monro</hi> made on Act in the Colledge,
<hi>That none ſhould go back,</hi> particularly <hi>Bailzie Gram</hi>'s Son,
who had entered to the firſt Claſs, was made to enter to the
Second: Likewiſe, Dr. <hi>Monro</hi> went and told the Earl of
<hi>Perth</hi> his Diligence and Care of Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> whom the
ſaid Earl thanked kindly, for his love to any that went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the Colledge, a Form of Worſhip never allowed of in this
Nation ſince the Reformation; And tho' it were tolerated,
yet no Toleration allows any of different Form of Worſhip from
the State, to enjoy legal Benefices in the Church or Charge
in Univerſities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV.</hi> The Act for <hi>Viſitation of Colledges requires,</hi> that none
carry charge in them, but ſuch as be well affected to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
both of Church and State: But ſo it is, that it is
known by all, that know Dr. <hi>Monro,</hi> that <hi>he is highly
diſaffected</hi> to both, as appears by a <hi>miſſive Letter</hi> written
by him to the <hi>late Archbiſhop of St.</hi> Andrews, Dated the
5th Day of <hi>January 1689.</hi> And which may alſo appear <hi>by
his leaving the Charge of the Miniſtry to ſhun Praying for
King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary: and his rejoycing the Day

And how much he <hi>Diſlikes the preſent Government of the

breaking up of Mr. <hi>James Ingliſh</hi> his Chamber Door in the

Colledge, and turning him out of the ſame, notwithſtanding
he had been in peaceable Poſſeſſion thereof for many Years,
and paid Rent for it: and all this betwixt terms, and the
ſaid Mr. <hi>James Ingliſh</hi> was willing to part with the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

Mr. <hi>James Ingliſh</hi> Preached in a Meeting-Houſe in his own
Pariſh, being called to it by them; And when the ſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
was challenged for this; He ſaid, he would ſuffer none
of ſuch Principles to be within the Colledge. And when
Mr. <hi>Gourlay</hi> was Licenſed to Preach by the Presbyterians,
the Students of Mr. <hi>Kennedys</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cunninghame's
Claſſes</hi> beat up his Chamber Door, and Windows with
Stones; and pulling off his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hat, Cloak and Periwig; and
reproaching him with Phanatick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They forced him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

under no Obligation to take notice of them: Yet I make
bold to intreat your Lordſhips Favour and Patience for ſome
Minutes, to hear a more particular anſwer to that Paper,

                  <p>And therefore if your Lordſhips think it worth the while,
Mr. <hi>Reid, the preſent Serjeant of the Town Company</hi> (who

                  <p>But your Lordſhips will conſider I hope <hi>the impertinency
of this Accuſation,</hi> ſince it is not poſſible to be ordained a

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47542:17"/>
And our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Superiors,</hi> who ordained <hi>Prieſts and

always ſince the Reſtitution took care (I hope) to diſtinguiſh

                  </p>
                  <p>Next let it be conſidered, whether I endeavoured to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance

ſince I entered into the Miniſtry, what good evidences
for my being inclined to Popery? Had I not a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to take off the Mask ſome Years before the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution?
Was it any of the Sermons I Preached againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
in the High Church of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and in the Abby of
<hi>Holyrood-houſe,</hi> when <hi>our zealous Reformers were very quiet:</hi>
To all which ſome Hundreds of the beſt Quality of the
Nation, were Witneſſes. And the Libeller knows this
Article is ſet in the front, <hi>to make up the Muſter,</hi> and for
no other end, ſince he dares no more appear to make good
this, than the other triffling particulars. Was it my <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Oath of the Teſt once and again,</hi> or <hi>my recommending
to the Scholars</hi> (the firſt Year I came here) <hi>ſuch Books as I
judged moſt proper to Diſcover and confute the Superſtitions

<hi>Libeller</hi> (who hath no regard to Truth or Probability) to
have caſt into this Paper more odious Crimes? <hi>But I was

yet the <hi>Libeller</hi> hath the Honeſty to accuſe me, <hi>that Mr.</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47542:17"/>
truly a fault in Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> that he was <hi>Suſpect</hi> of <hi>Popery?</hi>
The Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſcow</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Kennedy,</hi>
then Proteſt, will vindicate me in this particular: For it is
very well known how much I oppoſed Mr. <hi>Burnet's</hi> entry
here; a Gentleman of known Parts and Integrety, one of
the Profeſſors of Philoſophy in the old Colledge of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>
was the Man I wiſhed to fill up the vacance that
happened by the Death of Mr. <hi>Lidderdale;</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ja. Martin.</note> but Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi>
being once thruſt in upon us, (more by the Duke of <hi>Gordon</hi>
than the Earl of <hi>Perth)</hi> what could I do with him? My
care of this Houſe obliged me to make him as uſeful as
I could: He lay under the Suſpicion of being Popiſh, but
I knew this to be a Calumny; and if I had not endeavoured
to get him ſome Scholars, we ſhould have wanted one entire
Claſs in the Colledge: This is the true Reaſon why I ſpoke
to <hi>Bailzie Grahame</hi> to ſend his Son to Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and
procured an Act of the Faculty (for I could make none as
the Libeller impertinently ſuggeſts) that ſuch as were Mr.
<hi>Lidderdale</hi>'s Scholars the preceeding Year ſhould be taught
for that Year, in no other Claſs but Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to his charge. This was no Arbitrary ſtretch of mine,
but a juſt defence of the Current and uſual Cuſtomes of
the Houſe; for Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> having the ſecond Claſs, could
expect none elſe but the Students that were taught in
Mr. <hi>Lidderdale</hi>'s Claſs the preceeding year;<note place="margin">We ſhall hear more of this in the Report of the Committee, where its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies will be more particularly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</note> but it is added,
<hi>I did all this, becauſe I favoured Popery, and the Chancellour
thanked me for it.</hi> But this is a down right Lye, for I never
Entertain'd the Chancellour with Diſcourſes of Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi>
beſides, for any thing I know, the Chancellour had no
value for him.</p>

Reformers, <hi>Wiſheart,</hi> and ſeveral others, to juſtifie the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Liturgy;</hi> but alſo the Solemn Conceſſion of the whole
Nation, who thought their Confeſſion then Ratified, had in
it nothing contradictory to or inconſiſtent with the Book of
<hi>Common Prayer,</hi> Rites, and Ceremonies of the Church of
<hi>England:</hi> And ſuch as plead for their Separation from the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> from the Practices of the firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
here, go upon an unpardonable Miſtake in our Hiſtory.
But the plain Matter of Fact, is this, when I left off Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the <hi>High Church:</hi> I adviſed with ſome of my Brethren,
and the Reſult was, that we ſhould Read the Book of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer,</hi> and Preach within our Familes, <hi>per vices,</hi> ſince
moſt of them were acquainted, ſomewhat, with the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> Neither did we think, when
<hi>Quakers</hi> and all <hi>Sects</hi> were Tolerated, that we ſhould be
blamed for Reading thoſe Prayers within our private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
which we prefer to all other Forms now uſed in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church: Neither had we any deſign to Proſelite the
People to any thing they had no mind to, elſe I might have
Read the Liturgy in one of the Publick Schools within the
Colledge. And it muſt not be ſaid we were afraid to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon the Publick Exerciſe of it becauſe of the Rabble,
for during the Seſſion of the Colledge, it is very well known
in the City, that the Mobile durſt not preſume to give us
the leaſt Diſturbance: However, the Matter ſucceeded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what we propoſed or looked for; we Preached to the
People upon the Sundays, they came by hundreds more than
we had room for, and very many became acquainted with
the Liturgy of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and perceived by


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47542:18"/>
their own Experience,<note place="margin">This Anſwer to the 3d Article of the Doctor's Libel, did exaſperate the Presbyterians to the higheſt degree, and they to whom it was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to view and examine his Anſwers, thought they diſcovered ſtrange conſequences in this. But ſome of the Nobility who were preſent when this was toſs'd, would not ſuffer ſuch Fooleries as were then objected to be inſerted in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, partly that the Presbyterians might not be expoſed; partly, that they might not be Witneſſes to ſuch palpable Impertinencies; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that none might ſay the Miniſters, to whom the Government was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, were ſuch Fools as to flie in the face of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in this juncture.</note> there was neither

                  <p>But your Lordſhips will not think I
make all this Apology, as if I were diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the intrinſick Excellency of <hi>Common

But the <hi>Libeller</hi> ſhould remember, that
the Letter is of a much older Date than
the preſent Government either in Church or
State, and that at that time, things looked
rather like a total <hi>Interregnum,</hi> than any ſetled
Government; and if that Letter (Written

in the time of the Tumuks) retain any
veſtiges of Fervour and Impatience, your
Lordſhips will impute that, partly to the
troubled State of things, and partly to the
hard and unchriſtian Oppreſſion of the
Clergy of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Shires: And let not

For I think there may be a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi>

As to that Sentence, informing my Lord
St. <hi>Andrews</hi> of a certain Clergy Man who
had groaned under Epiſcopacy, I had it by
Miſ-information, I wrote it haſtily, and
now I Retract it, and am glad I have the

                     <p>This is pleaſant enough: for he could Name no outward
ſign or expreſſion of it; he thinks I Rejoiced, and therefore
ſets it down as a ground of Accuſation; ſo, my Lords, it
was impoſſible for me to ſhun this, unleſs I had been Dead
ſome time before the Victory; for this <hi>Libeller</hi> names his
Conjectures, dark Conſequences, and remote Probabilities,
for ſufficient Evidence; for any thing he knew, this Joy
appeared no where but on the inward Theatre of my Mind;
but to make the Story paſs, why did he not name the uſual
and Extravagant Frolicks that attend ſuch Mirth? Where
was it? And with what Company? Was he Invited to this
Merry Meeting himſelf? But this is no part of his Buſineſs,
to circumſtantiate things as common Sence and Juſtice would

of Mother <hi>Juliana,</hi> that was ſaid to ſmell Souls, and
at a good diſtance to diſcern whether they were in the State
of Grace, or under the Power of Sin. I have Anſwered

<hi>That I Proſecute all the Presbyterian Party to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47542:20"/>
about three years ago (the Colledge then being very throng)
ſeveral Gentlemen importuned me to procure Chambers for
their Children within the Colledge; at which time Mr. <hi>Ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
had no uſe for a Chamber within the Colledge, being
for the moſt part abſent: I ſent the <hi>Janitor</hi> to him, and
ordered him to tell Mr. <hi>Ingliſh</hi> that we were very throng, and
I would take it for a great Complement, if he would part
with that Chamber; yet I ordered the <hi>Janitor</hi> to treat the
ſaid Mr. <hi>Ingliſh</hi> with all Civility and Diſcretion, and not to
ſtraiten him. The <hi>Janitor</hi> went as he was ordered: Mr. <hi>Ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
returned anſwer, That now indeed he had no uſe for a
Chamber in the Colledge, but ſince he underſtood there was
a deſign another ſhould have it, he would not part with it,
and he would keep it in ſpite of my Teeth: Some days after,
as I was going through the upper Court, I met with ſome
marks of Incivility from him. The next News I hear of
Mr. <hi>Ingliſh</hi> is, that he had raiſed Letters of<note n="*" place="margin">Which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Scots ſignifie ſuch writs as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige any Man to ſecure the Peace under the pain of Impriſonment.</note> Law-barrows
againſt me, and offered himſelf to Swear before the Lords of
Seſſion, <hi>he dreaded me Bodily Harm.</hi> But the then <hi>Lord
Preſident</hi> Lockart rejected the Letters, with Indignation,
without my Interpoſal or Knowledge. For I knew nothing
of this Malicious diligence againſt me, until ſome of my
Friends ſent me the Letters of Law-barrows rejected in <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia;</hi>
I gave this account of the whole Affair to Sir <hi>Thomas
Kennedy,</hi> then <hi>Lord Provoſt</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> he immediately
ſent his Officers to diſcharge Mr. <hi>Ingliſh</hi> from the Colledge,
who when they came, they did not break open his Door, nor
was his Furniture caſt out; but after all this Provocation, I
gave him all the days he ſought, for ordering his things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently,
and peaceably to retire. So much of Mr. <hi>Ingliſh</hi>
his Perſecution for being a Presbyterian: And I beg <hi>Your
Lordſhips Pardon,</hi> that I have kept you ſo long upon this
particular. But the Libeller adds, I was challenged for this,
and returned anſwer, I would ſuffer none of Mr. <hi>Ingliſh</hi> his
Principles to continue within the Houſe. That I was chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
for this, is an untruth, and conſequently I made no

                     <p>The Libeller is certainly very Critical and Exact in this

It is not enough for the Libeller to Repreſent me as
an Ill Man, but he muſt have me thought an Idiot. But
the Matter of Fact, as to this Trifle, is, that Mr. <hi>Gourlay,</hi>
ſome years before I came to the Colledge, attempted to teach

Common-wealth</hi> to Govern: And yet I think they are as Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
and Regular as ſo many Youths in any part of the

and I was ſo forward to puniſh the Youths, that before I
heard them plead in their own defence, I fin'd ſome of them in a

treated by <hi>Gourlay,</hi> they preſently Caball'd themſelves into a

then it was that <hi>Gourlay</hi> found it Convenient to retire. But as

I could not eaſily gueſs who ſhould firſt invent this prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Calumny, a Lye ſo notorious, that it could not come out
of the Mouth of an ordinary Sinner. The Story of this
Scholar, and the true Original of the Slander is this. In the


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47542:22"/>
beginning of <hi>Nov. 1688.</hi> I found that <hi>Robert Brown</hi> the
Plunderer (who was then Mr. <hi>Kennedy</hi>'s Servant) had
been for a good while practiſing upon ſome of the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
to enter into Tumults, break all Order and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and to burn publickly ſome mock Effigies of
the Pope: This certainly would have ruined the Peace and
Order of our Society, many bad Conſequences did frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attend it: Not only were the Students debauched from
their Books, but their Lives expoſed every moment to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
by the Tumults: Beſides, that our Colledge had felt
the bad effects of it ſome years before. Upon the account of
this, and ſome other notorious Villanies, I procured <hi>Robert
Brown</hi> to be impriſoned, however, at the ſame time I gave
him a piece of Money to ſerve him that night, upon the
marrow I pleaded he might be ſet at Liberty, upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of amendment, which was done accordingly; but the
Villain grew worſe and worſe, till at laſt he became Captain
of the Rabble; and in requital of my forbearance towards
him, he writes and fixes a Placade upon the Colledge Gate
threatning to kill the Regents, ordering me to R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

keeping) Notwithſtanding of all this, I forbore to extrude
him upon plauſible Conſiderations, at the intreaty of ſome,
and ſtill he went on in his wicked Courſe, and all the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries
committed upon poor People were laid at our doors,
as if our Scholars were to be blamed for his Extravagancies:
At laſt he committed an Out-rage, which might have han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
a hundred. There was a Woman in my Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent's
Houſe, whom this <hi>Brown</hi> careſſed and frequented, and
ſhe had a quarrel with another Maid-ſervant who was Popiſh;
immediately <hi>Brown</hi> is imployed by his Godly Miſtreſs to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the Popiſh Maid from the Houſe. He willingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the Service, gathered his Troop, and entered the
Houſe (my Lady being in Child-Bed, and my Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
himſelf at <hi>London) Brown</hi> thus invading the Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident's
Houſe, my Lady was almoſt frighted to Death; and
we that were Maſters of the Colledge thought our ſelves ſo
diſgraced, that the Houſe of our Great and Learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
ſhould be thus rifled in his abſence, by one of our
Scholars, when his Lady was lying in: And when we thought


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47542:23"/>
that my Lord Preſident could not but be highly offended,
to hear that we had thus requited him for many favours he
had done to this <hi>Univerſity,</hi> I confeſs, I could no longer
forbear, I went to the Claſs where <hi>Brown</hi> was, and called
him to the upper Gallery, and gave him all his moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
names, and threatned him, if he did not immediately
beg my Lady <hi>Lockart's</hi> pardon, I would break his Bones,
all thoſe big words I ſaid to him, and the day thereafter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
him with the uſual swore: Upon which he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

Pardon for this tedious and unpleaſant ſtory; for none

Head, than to gather together ſuch Articles as he thought

                  <p>The next was, <hi>That I did not puniſh the Scholars for Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

                     </gap> the occaſion whereof was this By King <hi>James</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
for Indulgence we could not impoſe the former
Oaths upon our Students, when they commenced Maſters of
Art, and therefore, leſt they ſhould go oft without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
the former Oath was comprized into this ſhort
Promiſe <hi>Pollicemur in Deum fidem inviolabilem, in religions
Chriſtiana Reformata perſeverantiam erga ſereniſſimum Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Regem Obedientiam,</hi> &amp;c. But it fell out ſo that the word
<hi>[Reformata]</hi> was left out in ſome place, by which they would
conclude either that the Promiſe was indefinite, or that there
was a Blank left to be filled up upon occaſion with a word,
in favours of ſome other Religion different from the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
If the firſt be intended, it is no new thing to find the
Students here Sworn to Oaths as indefinite, as this is; for the
<hi>Puritas</hi> and <hi>Veritas Evangelii,</hi> in the Oath impoſed by Dr.
<hi>Golvil,</hi> is coincident with the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> mentioned
in the Form now challenged; for I never underſtood by
the Proteſtant Religion any thing but Chriſtianity unmixt.
But if this be ſaid to be too general, look the Records, <hi>Ann.
1662,</hi> and ye ſhall find that there is not the leaſt mention
of Religion in the Oath Impoſed. If the ſecond be ſaid that
there was a Blank left on deſign, it is humbly deſired to
know what the deſign could be; the <hi>Bibliothecarius</hi> is ready
to depone that he never intended a Blank, nor was he ever
ordered a Blank; and the reſt of the Maſters may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate,
whether ever they knew of any ſuch deſign. So that
this Phraſe, <hi>Religio Chriſtiana,</hi> without the word <hi>[Reformata]</hi>
once varied, is purely the Reſult of Chance, and no Deſign.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt;</hi> It cannot be denied, but that the Doctor did once
and again, deliberately, plainly, and openly, refuſe to


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47542:26"/>
comply with the <hi>New Teſt,</hi> appointed by the late Act of
Parliament for Maſters of Univerſities; but then it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for Strangers to know what this <hi>Teſt</hi> is, and then they
will ſee, upon what Deſign it was invented, and why it was
Impoſed upon Maſters of Univerſities, and not upon the
whole Clergy of the Nation. <hi>Firſt,</hi> All Maſters of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,
were required to Sign the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Confeſſion of
Faith in every Article, and to hold every Article <hi>de fide,</hi>
without any Limitation, Explication, Reſtriction, or Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
When the Doctor gave in his Anſwers to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,</hi>
he was that Afternoon asked, if he would comply
with the Act of Parliament; he told them, he had conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Act of Parliament, and he could not comply with
it: <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it is needleſs to inſiſt on particulars, though
I ſhould agree to it in ſome Inſtances, I cannot comply with it
in its full Extent;</hi> and, in our Language, this is <hi>molum ex
quolibet defectu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bonum ex integra cauſa;</hi> thus he anſwered
once, ſo he had Reaſon to expect, they would never give him
any trouble about this Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Committee</hi> upon the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> would
needs ask him again, whether he would Sign the <hi>Weſtminiſter</hi>
Confeſſion of Faith; The Doctor thought this queſtion was
asked to ſatisfie their private Curioſity, not at all with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Report they were to make to the General Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
ſince he poſitively told them before, that he would
not comply with the <hi>New Teſt;</hi> therefore he yielded ſo far
to their importunity, as to tell them he had no great ſcruples
againſt the Confeſſion of Faith, and that if the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
Confeſſion of Faith, was impoſed, as <hi>Vinculum Unitatis Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticae,</hi>
and nothing elſe required, he might be induced to
comply with it very chearfully; he was then removed, and
in the Interval of his abſence before he was called again, one
of the Miniſters deſired, that no more Queſtions ſhould be
asked, for in Caſe, ſaid he, <hi>(He ſhould comply with the other
particulars of the Teſt, where are we then)</hi> I had this from a
Perſon of Honour who was preſent, a Member of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
But as long as the <hi>Teſt</hi> ſtood as now it ſtands,
Mr. <hi>Kennedy,</hi> if he be the Man, needed not be ſo much
afraid of the Doctor's Compliance: This Confeſſion, as to
the Confeſſion of Faith, is by their Sentence, made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
his publick refuſal to Sign it before the Commiſſion;


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47542:26"/>
as if every Article of that Book ſhould be received as Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Truth; was it not enough, that he was content to
Sign the Confeſſion of Faith, with that <hi>Freedome</hi> and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
the Proteſtant Churches uſed to impoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
upon their Members: But the Earl of <hi>Crawford,
Praeſes</hi> of the General Commiſſion, asked the Doctor when
he was ſiſted before them, whether he would Sign the <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter</hi>
Confeſſion of Faith, without Reſtriction, Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Explication, or any <hi>Reſerve</hi> whatſoever; To this, the
Doctor Anſwered plainly and reſolutely, he would not; nor
are Confeſſions thus impoſed in any Proteſtant Church upon
Earth; they look upon them as Secondary Rules, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
to be Examined by the Word of God: And the
moſt Accurate Humane Compoſures, may afterwards be found
in ſome one Inſtance or other, to have ſwerved from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
and Original Rule of Faith; but the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
may appear in this, that they Read the Scriptures with
deſign to defend their <hi>own</hi> Dictates; whereas, others Read
all Dictates with an Eye to the Holy Scriptures: The Doctor
was content to Defend and Aſſert upon all occaſions, all theſe
Articles in that Book that were Uniformly Received in all
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches; Nay more, he was content never open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and contentiouſly to Diſpute againſt any of the Doctrines
contained in that Book, ſo as to advance Faction or Parties;
But to Sign the Confeſſion of Faith in all Articles, and to
hold every one of them to be <hi>de fide,</hi> he thought not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with the <hi>Freedome</hi> of Univerſities and Schools:<note place="margin">Heads of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Vnited Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Head 8, <hi>of a Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith.</hi>
                     </note> They
might have Learned to be a little more Modeſt, from the
Practice of the United Diſſenters in and about <hi>London,</hi> who
allow any Man to be an Orthodox Chriſtian, and fit to be
Received into their own Refined Communion, if he hold the
Doctrinal part of the 39 Articles of the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
But the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> tho' they have no Standard of Unity,
yet they are mightily Rigorous in their Impoſitions; and it
is a little odd, that they ſhould have mentioned this, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Confeſſion of Faith, in their <hi>Report,</hi> ſince the Doctor
once and again, told them before the <hi>Committee,</hi> that the
Condition that Qualified Men by Law for their places in
Univerſities, was a complex thing, which he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with; ſuch a Rigorous Impoſition was never intended by
the Parliament: They thought it neceſſary for Maſters of


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47542:27"/>
Univerſities to Sign it, as <hi>vinculum pacis Eccleſiaſticae;</hi> but
the Miniſters were to Comment upon the Act, and extend it
as was moſt ſubſervient to their Deſign: The <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
are againſt Infallibility in the <hi>Theory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vide Acts of the General Aſſemb. 1646.</note> but will not allow their
own Dictates to be Diſputed; yet when this Confeſſion firſt
appeared, they <hi>themſelves</hi> did not Receive it without Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Explications; But if there be ſo much Miſchief in
Impoſitions; (as ſometimes they would make us believe) It is
in thoſe of this kind, where our Underſtandings are Captivate
to believe the leſſer Niceties and Deciſions of Dogmatick Men,
to be <hi>de fide;</hi> which (with leave of the <hi>Presbyterians)</hi> I
reckon a far greater and more Spiritual Bondage, than Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my Knees when I Receive the Holy Euchariſt: If
Men were ſo Wiſe, after our endleſs and Fooliſh Diſputes,
as not needleſly to multiply the Articles of our Faith; how
quickly might the Chriſtian Church be United on its Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
<hi>Center,</hi> of Unity and Simplicity; The <hi>Papiſts</hi> will not
part with one Barbarous word, nor the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> with the
leaſt <hi>Iota</hi> of their Orthodox Stuff; though they plead the
Tenderneſs of their Conſciences very loudly, when they are
only bid do things in their Nature indifferent, to preſeve Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Peace and Uniformity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The next Branch of this</hi> Teſt, <hi>was,</hi> The Oath of Allegiance to
King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One great piece of Policy, which the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
againſt the Epiſcopal Party, is, never to require Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Civil Authority, without the mixture of ſome
<hi>Presbyterian Teſt;</hi> when this Severity is complained of, they
Clamourouſly Alledge, that the Epiſcopal Party are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and openly in the
<hi>Coffee-Houſes</hi> at <hi>London</hi> vent, that there was none of the
Clergy of <hi>Scotland,</hi> met with any ill uſage, but merely
upon the account of their Diſloyalty to King <hi>William</hi> and
Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> upon the whole Matter, I have no more at
preſent to ſay; but that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are never ſo much
out of Humour, as when they know their <hi>Oppoſites</hi> heartily
complie with the Civil Government: Then they find it a
little more difficult to turn them out, tho' this trouble amounts
to no more than the forming of a Libel of Scandals, and


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47542:27"/>
judging them that are Libelled, by the ſame Men that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
them.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Hypotheſis (when its <hi>Conſequences</hi> are
duely conſidered) allows no true Allegiance to any King upon
Earth; if after all, there lies no Appeal from the Eccleſiaſtical
Court to him, to whom I Swear Allegiance; for two Co-ordinate
Supreme Powers in one State, is a Contradiction; and therefore,
whenever I am required to Swear Allegiance to the King;
The firſt thing I humbly crave, is, to be delivered from that <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi>
which will ſuperſede that Allegiance upon occaſion; for it
is not enough to tell me, that the Power of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> is
Spiritual, and the other is Secular; for I feel their Spiritual Power
meddles with all my Temporals; that tho' I hear the Voice of
<hi>Jacob,</hi> I am oppreſſed by the hands of <hi>Eſau:</hi> And tho' it is
an eaſie thing for them to tell me, they only meddle <hi>in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
ad Spiritualia;</hi> yet, that is but a word, and but a Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
one too; for by the ſame Logick, they may cut my
Throat, as well as turn me out of my Houſe and Living,
and both may be ſaid to be <hi>in Ordine ad Spiritualia:</hi> But
every Man knows, how inconſiſtent the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are with the Royal Prerogative of Kings: And it is very
hard to leave the Epiſcopal Clergy to their Mercy, who, by
their Hopes of Heaven, are Sworn to deſtroy them in the
Solemn League and Covenant, which is ſtill the Standard;
and tho' they think it not time all of them again to Renew
it; yet they magnifie it on all occaſions, and Act exactly
conform to it.</p>
                  <p>The next Branch of the <hi>New Teſt,</hi> is, the Certificate or
Aſſurance, which you may Read in the Act of Parliament:
If Allegiance, Naturally imply an Affectionate and Sincere
Reſolution to ſerve the King, againſt all others upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions;
then ſome will ſay, this additional tye of Fidelity,
is ſuperfluous; I am ſure that many in <hi>England</hi> who will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſerve the Government with all Chearfulneſs,
and Zeal, could not be made to Subſcribe any ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
as this is: But let it be Remembred, that when this
Act paſſed in Parliament, very few either of the Nobility or
Gentry were preſent.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Article of the <hi>Teſt</hi> Requires, that they ſhould
ſubmit to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Kirk Government; for if they had
complyed with the former three, this was a ſufficient reſerve


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47542:28"/>
for the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Intereſt; every thing the Maſters did or
ſaid, good or bad, might be turned into a <hi>Libel,</hi> and they
were Judges of what every <hi>Libel</hi> deſerved: Their Diſcipline
is a bottomleſs Abyſs; the Maſters behoved to be Tenants at
will, if once they ſubmitted to their Government: It was an
eaſie thing for the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to From <hi>Libels:</hi> Nay, rather
it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> for them not to form them; for ſo many of
them deſiring to be thruſt into theſe places, it was folly to
expect any peaceable Poſſeſſion. And if there were no other
reaſon to refuſe the <hi>Teſt</hi> now appointed; but that it required
Submiſſion to <hi>Presbytery,</hi> I think any knowing and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Man might be excuſed for his non-compliance.</p>
                  <p>Now you have ſeen the <hi>Teſt</hi> in all its Branches, and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
will be ſurprized, to hear that there are no Oaths at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
required in <hi>Scotland</hi> of any Clergy Man, but only of the
Maſters of Univerſities. The reaſon is this, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
intended ſpeedily to plant themſelves in theſe places, and for
the reſt of the Clergy they doubt not quickly to diſpoſſeſs
<hi>them</hi> of their Livings, by the Power of their Government,
upon ſuch pretences as they can eaſily deviſe and ſuggeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them. Such of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> as entered into the
Univerſities took the Oaths; but it was thought ſit to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
no Oaths upon the whole Body of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that
the <hi>Kirk</hi> might preſerve its independency upon the State; ſo
this Law was not made for the <hi>Saints,</hi> but for Wicked Men
and Malignants. They know they may diſpatch the reſt of
the Clergy by methods, ſuch as are frequently complained
of: For who can ſtand before the force of <hi>Presbytery?</hi>

                  <p>There are here a great many things jumbled together, and
therefore they muſt be explained more particularly. But it
was not poſſible for the Miniſters that drew up this <hi>Report,</hi>
to have contained more Non-ſence and Malice in ſo few
words. And ſome Perſons of Quality, who were Members
of this Viſitation, doe confeſs that the Doctor did nothing in
Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s affair, but what they would have done, if they
had been in his Circumſtances: But the matter of Fact is
this: There fell a <hi>Regents</hi> place vacant in the Colledge of
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by the Death of Mr. <hi>Lidderdale:</hi> Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi>
had his eye upon this place a good while before Mr. <hi>Lid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale</hi>
died, and ſo prevented the diligence of all Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
He was recommended very ſtrongly to the Provoſt, and
other Magiſtrates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> who are Patrons. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
upon the death of Mr. <hi>Lidderdale,</hi> fixed his eye on
Mr. <hi>James Martin,</hi> Profeſſour of Philoſophy in the Old Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> his particular Friend and Acquaintance,
who had taught Philoſophy ſeveral years in that Famous U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity,
with great Succeſs and Applauſe; and did recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him with all the Zeal imaginable to the Magiſtrates,
that he might be choſen in the room of Mr. <hi>Lidderdale,</hi> now
deceaſed! Several Divines and Phyſicians, Men of unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Learning and Reputation, in the City, know that the
Doctor uſed all means to keep Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> out of the Colledge:
But Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> (being recommended by the Duke of <hi>Gordon,</hi>
and his Friends at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> being pre-ingaged to lay hold
upon this advantage as ſoon as there was occaſion,) prevailed
in this Competition, notwithſtanding the Doctor, and ſeveral
other Friends, did with all Vigour interpoſe in Favours of
Mr. <hi>James Martyn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Burnet</hi> had emitted ſome <hi>Theſes,</hi> in which
were ſome poſitions favourable to the <hi>Abſolute</hi> Power of
Kings, and particularly the King of <hi>Scots:</hi> It ſeems this was
magnified by the Perſon of Quality that recommended him
to the Town of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> ſeveral People did upon this
ſuſpect him either to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or not far from <hi>Popery,</hi> if
any ſtrong temptation did aſſault him; and this was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47542:29"/>
                     <hi>propagated</hi> by ſome againſt him; ſo that many
were determined to keep back their Children, either from his
Claſs, or from the Colledge for good and all. The Doctor
found that the Colledge was at a diſadvantage by ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
as were founded on ſlight <hi>Surmiſes,</hi> and therefore he
was at the pains to undeceive ſome Citizens and others, that
Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> was no <hi>Papiſt;</hi> and this he had good reaſon to
do, becauſe Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> as ſoon as he entered Regent in the
Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> offered chearfully to ſign the <hi>Teſt,</hi>
and Renounce all <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Phanaticiſm.</hi> And therefore the
Doctor (having nothing in his view, but the publick advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Houſe, and that there might be an even ballance
betwixt the four Profeſſours of <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> and that none of
them might make a Monopoly, either of the Scholars that
came to be taught, or of the Profits got by them) took all
poſſible care to make Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> as uſeful as he could, tho'
he was thruſt into that Colledge againſt all the endeavours
the Doctor could uſe to keep him out of it. If he had done
otherways, and ſuffered ſuch reports to flie abroad, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
would have concluded all the Maſters in the Houſe were
<hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected, and ſo withdrawn their Children from the
Seminary. The fear that many would abſent themſelves
from the Colledge on this occaſion, touched the Doctor to
the quick, and made him ſtruggle with all poſſible Induſtry
to keep up the Reputation of that Houſe, eſpecially ſince the
Government of it was committed to him, and that it had
flouriſhed for many years before he entered under the Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his Learned Predeceſſours. And leſt ſome other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours
might take advantage of the misfortune Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi>
lay under, he procured that an Act of the Faculty ſhould
paſs, that the Scholars who had been in the preceeding year
taught their <hi>Greek</hi> in Mr. <hi>Lidderdale</hi>'s Claſs ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to no other Claſs, for that year, but Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s, who
was orderly brought into his place. This was the current
uninterrupted Practice of the Houſe, and of all other <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi>
Colledges in the Nation: Here was no Arbitrary ſtretch,
nor no Statute of the Houſe violated, and no Member of
the Faculty was forced to Vote otherwiſe than they pleaſed.
This account of the Act that paſſed in the Faculty, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> is in it ſelf Reaſonable, Juſt, and True;
how then can the Inquiſitors pretend there was another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47542:29"/>
than what is alledged by the Doctor? They'll tell you
there was another Deſign; <hi>the Doctor favoured Papiſts,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Burnet</hi> was a <hi>Papiſt, and that was the Reaſon why the Doctor
wiſhed many Scholars to be taught by Mr.</hi> Burnet. It is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
for ſuch as never deſigned well in their life, and never
with regard to the publick advantage, to ſuſpect the moſt
Laudable and Innocent Actions to proceed from the worſt
Principles and Deſigns; Did Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> truly teach any <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery?</hi>
Or did the Doctor recommend to him to teach <hi>Popery?</hi>
Did any of his Scholars ever hear him teach any thing that
looked like <hi>Popery?</hi> No, that cannot be alledged; but it
was fit for the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to ſay ſo, and tho' they could
bring no proof for what they ſay, yet they impudently inſiſt
on it. If they had not loſt all ſence of common Modeſty,
they might have learned more Diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>But let us examine more narrowly the Reaſonings of this
part of their <hi>Report.</hi> They tell us, in the firſt place, that
the Doctor made an Act of the <hi>Faculty:</hi> This is an Impertinence;
for tho' he preſided in the <hi>Faculty</hi> when it met, he could
by himſelf make no Act. The Reaſons, perhaps, he alledged
for the Act, might determine his Brethren to Vote, as <hi>he</hi> did
in that juncture.</p>
                  <p>They tell us next, that the Doctor confeſſes that Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
lay under the ſuſpicion of being <hi>Popiſh.</hi> It is true, that
in the ſecond Article of the <hi>Libel</hi> formed againſt the Doctor,
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſay, that Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> lay under the ſuſpicion
of being <hi>Popiſh.</hi> Thoſe words of their own <hi>Libel,</hi> the Doctor
repeats in his Anſwer to the <hi>ſecond Article;</hi> and this Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their <hi>own</hi> words, they make to be the Doctors <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi>
This muſt needs proceed from, either unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Malice, or Stupidity. For in what ſence can it be ſaid, that
the Doctor confeſſed that Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> was ſuſpected of <hi>Popery?</hi>
Was it any fault of his, that Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> was ſuſpected, or can
Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> himſelf be blamed that he was ſuſpected? The leaſt
miſtake may occaſion one to be ſuſpected, and yet he may be
very innocent; notwithſtanding of all the Suſpicions that
may be to the contrary: This is a malicious and fooliſh
way of Reaſoning; for the moſt publick Spirited, and moſt
innocent Men may be Suſpected and <hi>Libelled</hi> too by Malice
and Envy, and yet continue in their Integrity. Let me expoſe
this way of Reaſoning a little more familiarly. A very Eminen,

Member of the pretended <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> is ſuſpected to
have Inriched himſelf with a part of the Money given by the
<hi>Sectarian Army</hi> to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> when the King was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
up at <hi>New-Caſtle:</hi> Is the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
becauſe they did not oblige this Man to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from this Suſpicion, before he ſat in the <hi>Aſſembly;</hi> or was
that Member himſelf to be blamed, becauſe he was ſuſpected
of it, unleſs there can be ſome evident proof brought, that he
did actually receive a conſiderable Sum of Money from the
<hi>Sectarian Army,</hi> upon the former conſideration: I believe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that Member, nor the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> will allow of
this way of Reaſoning, when it is applied to their own Caſe.
I'll make it more clear yet, by one or two Inſtances. Another
great <hi>Reformer</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi> is ſuſpected of being acceſſary to the
Murder of Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi>

                     <hi>Lord Arch-Biſhop</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and it
may be this Suſpicion is founded upon better Reaſons than the
other, of Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s being a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> do they therefore think
it reaſonable to treat him as if he were a Murtherer: There
is no doubt they will be more merciful, if they remember his
Service to their Cauſe. There is one <hi>Urqhart</hi> who is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to have ſpoken Contemptuouſly of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Presbyterian Miniſter.</note>
and our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> for having Compoſed it, and of
doing this in the moſt blaſpemous Expreſſions; do they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
think he ſhould be ſton'd to Death, upon the account of
this Suſpition? For my part I do not think Suſpition a juſt
Reaſon againſt any Man. Our Saviour himſelf was ſaid to
be a Wine-bibber, a Friend to <hi>Publicanes</hi> and <hi>Sinners;</hi> and
all the Innocence of Heaven, and Luſtre of his Divinity,
could not keep him from being Cenſured by the <hi>Phariſees;</hi>
ſo I hope we need no more inſiſt upon this: When the
Doctor is turned out, and when they conſider ſeriouſly, they
may perhaps acknowledge they ought to have Reaſoned
better.</p>
                  <p>But we are told, the Favour done to Mr. <hi>Burnet, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of making a Gap in the Colledge;</hi> ſo it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated,
that, what-ever the Doctor pretended, the true
deſign was to advance <hi>Popery;</hi> at this rate it was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do, or ſay any thing, no, nor to look to any quarter
of the Colledge, but what might be ſuſpected of having
ſome <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> in it. But was the Doctor obſerved to keep
Company with Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> more familiarly than he did


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47542:30"/>
with other Maſters; no, this is not, nor cannot be alledged,
for to tell the plain Truth, he never Treated any Man in
his Life ſo roughly, as he did Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> ſometimes, for
which he blamed himſelf afterwards; then in the Name of
Common Senſe and Modeſty, tell me, where lay the <hi>Popiſh
Plot:</hi> If the Doctor had not obviated the Lying Reports
that went abroad, of Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> one of the
four Claſſes had been wanting in the Colledge; and if this
had truly fallen out by his Lazineſs; had it not been a great
diſadvantage both to the Town and Colledge, and to the
Doctor's own Reputation? Would it not been ſaid, that the
Colledge Flouriſhed formerly, but now, ſince it had a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
that underſtood not the Intereſt of it, it decayed in
its Number, Order, and Splendor? This would have been
the juſt Conſequence, if Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> had not been Vindicated
from the Suſpition of being a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> And they that now
manage the Argument againſt the Doctor, would have been
the firſt and loudeſt Accuſers of his Conduct; but it ſeems,
that they thought it no prejudice to the Colledge to want
one intire Claſs: It's true, the Doctor might have ſuffered
Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to ſink or ſwim, without his Aſſiſtance; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he would have done ſo, if there had been nothing in it,
but Maſter <hi>Burnet</hi>'s private Intereſt; but when the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Colledge was in hazard, any Man of Common
Senſe would excuſe the Doctor, to interpoſe in that Affair
with all Vigour and Application; It may be, they have no
Notion of the Principal's Office; but, that he muſt be ſome
Grave un-active Thing, that muſt be thought Wiſe, becauſe
he cannot ſpeak, and a Prudent Governour, becauſe he
dares not meddle with their Diſorders: But we are told,</p>
                  <p>That the Act runs thus; <hi>That the Doctor procured the Act,
in favour of Mr.</hi> Burnet, <hi>for ſeveral Reaſons known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi>
The Doctor does not deny, but that when the Act of
the <hi>Faculty</hi> was made, ſome ſuch Expreſſion might have
drop'd from him, that ſuch an Act was neceſſary for ſeveral
Reaſons, not fit to be inſiſted on particularly in that Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
And when the Reader conſiders the Reaſons that are
already given, he will find there was juſt Cauſe for that you
to make ſuch an Act; tho' no Reaſon (at all can be given
for compelling the Maſters to give ſuch a particular


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47542:31"/>
account of their Adminiſtrations in ſo trifling an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence.</p>
                  <p>But they inſiſt on another Argument, to prove that the
Doctors Concern in this, had in it ſome one <hi>Popiſh</hi> Deſign or
other; becauſe the Doctor does not alledge, that he uſed
means to cauſe Maſter <hi>Burnet</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">This word in the Phanatick Language ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of one from Calumny and Slander.</note> purge himſelf of the ſaid ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
of being <hi>Popiſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is Modeſty with a Witneſs; how could the Doctor
Alledge in his own Defence, what he enjoined Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to
do in Order to his Vindication: unleſs the Inquiſitors had
given the Doctor a particular occaſion to tell, whether he
did oblige Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to Vindicate himſelf or not; did ever
any of them that were Members of that Committee ask that
particular queſtion, whether he ordered Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to take
all juſt and Reaſonable Methods, to Vindicate himſelf from
the Suſpicion of being <hi>Popiſh?</hi> Or did ever the Doctor refuſe
to give a plain Anſwer to all the Queſtions, that were asked?
But the Inquiſitors would have the Doctor (ſuch is their Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
and Candor) Anſwer all poſſible Queſtions, as well as
thoſe that were propoſed; why did not they ask the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in particular? If they had, the Doctor would have An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that Sir <hi>Thomas Kennedy</hi> then Lord Provoſt of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi>
and he himſelf too, did enjoin Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> with the very firſt
occaſion, in the <hi>Gray-Frier Church,</hi> from Dr. <hi>Robertſon,</hi> that
the People might ſee, that the rumours of his being <hi>Popiſh,</hi>
were groundleſs and fictitious; and accordingly Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi>
did ſo, and ingaged all his Friends through the City, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
him every where, from the Calumnious Suſpitions
vented againſt him. Now if the Inquiſitors had asked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Queſtions, they would have met with particular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers;
but they muſt blame the Doctor for not Anſwering
the Queſtions they might have ſtarted, as well as thoſe that
were asked; and if they are not as yet ſatisfied by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of things, they may ſatisfie themſelves by ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of Witneſſes in <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> But there needs no ſuch
Appeals be made to the Citizens of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> ſince the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Sir <hi>Thomas Kennedy</hi> alone (a Perſon of ſo much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Integrity) is inſtead of a Thouſand Evidences. And
I think we have enough of this Impertinence.</p>

                  <p>This is the Argument by which they ſeem to triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Doctor, and which they managed with all Art and
Induſtry. Nothing pleaſed the Goſſiping Siſters ſo much as
this Story, for they hugged and embraced each other at the
hearing of it: Some ſaid the Doctor did take away the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
out of the Colledge: <hi>No, Siſter,</hi> ſaid another, <hi>he
ſent them away down to the Abbey of</hi> Hollyrood-Houſe, <hi>and
there they were burned by the Papiſts.</hi> And this being the
laſt and moſt odious Story, prevailed; and if any body offer
to contradict it, they were ready to fly in his Face, as an
Enemy to the Good old Cauſe: But before I come to tell
of the matter of Fact in particular, let us view the <hi>Report</hi> in
Truth and Ingenuity. Therefore let me ask one Queſtion,
Did ever the Earl of <hi>Perth,</hi> Lord High Chancellour, come
to the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in Perſon, to viſit the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
all the time that the Doctor had the Government of
that Houſe? This muſt be anſwered negatively, becauſe the
Chancellour never came to the Colledge; for the Viſitation
ſat in the upper Rooms of the Parliament Houſe, not in the
Colledge. And it is not eaſie to gueſs how they could be ſo
impertinent, as to name the Lord Chancellour on this occaſion.</p>
                  <p>You have ſeen the Doctor's anſwer to this Article of the
<hi>Label</hi> before; but then he thought that he needed not make it
more publick nor more particular; but ſince they muſt have
all come to light, the matter of Fact is this: When the
<hi>Committee</hi> came to that <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Libel</hi> againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
that he had removed the Pictures of the <hi>Reformers</hi> out
of the <hi>Bibliotheck,</hi> and asked him what he had to ſay to it:
He told them that there was a Gentleman concerned, whoſe
Name and Perſon he honoured, and he behoved to name him,
if he was obliged to give a particular anſwer to that part
of the <hi>Libel;</hi> and tho there was nothing done, but what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47542:32"/>
Applauſe and Commendation; yet it was not very
good Manners to toſs the name of any worthy Perſon before
Courts and Judicatures needleſly; Therefore he deſired that
one of their Number might be Commiſſioned to hear his
Anſwer in private; and if that Perſon was ſatisfied with the
Anſwer, they might truſt him ſo far, as to make no further
inquiry into this matter; but if he was not ſatisfied, then the
Doctor was ready to make the Anſwer as publick and as
plain as they required. The <hi>Committee</hi> yielded to this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and asked the Doctor whom he would communicate his
Anſwer to, he ſaid he would give it gladly to Sir <hi>John Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumple,</hi>
then Lord Advocate; and he named him, becauſe he
knew him to be a Perſon of Senſe and good Manners. Sir
<hi>John</hi> asked the Doctor whether he would not communicate
the Anſwer to Sir <hi>John Hall,</hi> then <hi>Preſes</hi> of the <hi>Committee.</hi>
The Doctor anſwered that he was content to do ſo; he thought
in diſcretion he could not refuſe him, ſince he was once named:
Then Sir <hi>John Hall</hi> withdrew from the Table, and went to
a Window in the upper Hall of the Colledge, to hear what
account the Doctor would make of it in private. Then the
Doctor told Sir <hi>John</hi> thus, That he could not give a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Anſwer to the <hi>Libel,</hi> without making mention of Sir
<hi>Thomas Kennedy</hi>'s name; this he thought would have been
great rudeneſs, where there were ſo many Spectators; but the
true and plain account of the matter was this. That Sir
<hi>Thomas Kennedy,</hi> then <hi>Lord Provoſt</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that the Viſitation, which was appointed by King <hi>James,</hi>
in the Year ſhould ſit in the Colledge Library, and
he feared that ſome of them who were in the Retinue of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Quality might take occaſion, from the ſight of the
Pictures of the firſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> to begin ſome one Diſcourſe,
neither ſo pleaſing to the Proteſtants, nor yet ſo fit to be heard
in that Houſe. And therefore that no ſuch occaſion might be
given to them, and that all ſuch Debates might be waved at
that time, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ordered and adviſed the Pictures of the
<hi>Reformers,</hi> which hung in the Library, might be removed,
for ſome few days, out of their uſual place, and ſo ſoon as
this occaſion was over, they might be hung up again where
they were. Sir <hi>John</hi> receives this Anſwer from the <hi>Doctor,</hi>
and returns again to the Table, and gave ſome general An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
with which all of them ſeemed to be ſatisfied at that


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47542:32"/>
time, for ought I know, Now let me examine their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
and Sincerity in this particular, either Sir <hi>John</hi> was
ſatisfied with the Anſwer that he got in private, or not; if
he was ſatisfied himſelf (the thing being revealed to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Secreſie and Confidence) how came he to make it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
for the <hi>Committee</hi> having allowed the <hi>Doctor</hi> one of
their Number to hear his Anſwer in private, did plainly yield,
that if the Anſwer ſatisfied that particular Truſtee, they were
no more to inſiſt upon it; if he was not ſatisfied why did he
not plainly declare his diſſatisfaction when he returned to the
Table; then the <hi>Doctor</hi> would have given the full and plain
Anſwer himſelf, without any Diſguiſe or Reſerve: Sir <hi>John
Hall</hi> being <hi>Provoſt</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> ſhould have defended the
Authority of his Predeceſſour; and he knows very well that
he himſelf did frequently and impertinently interpoſe his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
about the Colledge, in things that had no ſuch
tendency, either as to its Preſervation, or Honour,
as what Sir <hi>Thomas Kennedy,</hi> in that Interval, did intend.
But it ſeems the <hi>Committee</hi> thought fit to examine Sir <hi>John
Hall</hi> upon Oath, what it was that the Doctor told him in
private: This was not fair, for they might oblige the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
himſelf to tell all that he had to ſay upon this Head:
For if they obliged him to make a publick Anſwer, it was
as good he ſhould do it by himſelf, as by another. But the
moſt pleaſant part of the Story is this, That Sir <hi>John</hi> depoſes
upon Oath, that the Doctor told him in private, that it was
by Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his Advice. But did the Doctor intend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
his Order, when he alledged his Advice in his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
or does the Learned <hi>Committee</hi> think, that the ſerious
and prudent Advice of a Perſon inveſted with Authority, hath
not the uſual force of an Act of <hi>Juriſdiction.</hi> But they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Doctor, becauſe he did it by Advice; but did not
the Doctor, before the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> it ſelf, alledge Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>
his Order, as well as his Advice? And might not his juſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
be heard at the Higher Court, as well as the Lower?
And if he was not ſo full and accurate in his Defences to Sir
<hi>John</hi> in private, why might he not be allowed to give one
more full in publick? When the E. of <hi>Crawford</hi> examined
him about this particular, whether he confeſſed that he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Pictures of the <hi>Reformers</hi> by Sir <hi>Thomas Kennedy</hi>'s
Advice? The Doctor anſwered, <hi>That what he did in that


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47542:33"/>
Affair, was by his Advice and Order too.</hi> The Earl gravely
ſhook his Head, and told, that Sir <hi>John Hall</hi> was upon
Oath, and that Sir <hi>John</hi> did not make mention of any Order.
Truly one would have thought this was nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for if what the Doctor ſaid was true in it ſelf, it was
as fit to be alledged in his Defences before the <hi>Commiſſion,</hi>
as before the <hi>Committee,</hi> or Sir <hi>John.</hi> Therefore the Doctor
pleaded that Sir <hi>Thomas Kennedy</hi> might be examined upon
this particular; but that was denied, for it was no part of
their buſineſs to find the Doctor in the right. Sir <hi>John Hall</hi>
declared, <note place="margin">Tho' the Doctor did this by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no order for it, it being in his power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and ſet up Pictures, or any other Furniture as he pleaſed.</note> that the Doctor ſaid, he had removed the Pictures
by Sir <hi>Thomas Kennedy</hi>'s Advice, ſo it was fit for them to
conclude, he had no Order for what he did. Now if ſuch
Non-ſence paſs in the Eye of the Nation, what muſt the
Miniſters expect in ſome corners of the Country, where
Ruling Elders, <hi>Shoomakers</hi> and <hi>Weavers,</hi> are their ordinary
Judges.</p>
                  <p>But why all this mighty noiſe about this trifle? Is it a
Sin to remove Pictures for two days, from one corner of a
Room to another: They'll tell you, I believe, it was no Sin
in it ſelf; but it was done with a bad Deſign. But Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Kennedy,</hi> and the Doctor, will ſay it was done with a
good deſign, where then are the Evidences that there was a
bad deſign in it? It's true, there is no Evidence; but ſince
it is capable of a miſconſtruction, it is as impoſſible for them to
take it by the right handle; as to bring any ſolid proof, there
was any bad deſign in it, from the firſt to laſt. But ſince
I have ſaid, that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ordered what was done in this
Affair, let me ſubjoyn his own Declaration upon the whole
matter.</p>

                  <head>Review.</head>
                  <p>I muſt give the Hiſtory of this particular in the plaineſt
manner: For I think the Records of all Nations, and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
will not parallel this Accuſation (all things being duly
conſidered) The ſeveral <hi>Committees</hi> had Order from the
<hi>General Commiſſion,</hi> to look carefully into the Dictates that
were taught the Scholars in all Schooles and Univerſities:
Purſuant to this Order, The <hi>Committee,</hi> appointed to viſit the
Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> ordered Dr. <hi>Monro,</hi> upon the <hi>25th.</hi>
of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> within two or three days after, to give up to the
Clerk of the <hi>Committee</hi> a Copy of his Dictates. The Doctor
told them what the <hi>Themes</hi> were, upon which he had his
publick <hi>Praelections,</hi> viz. <hi>De Deitate Chriſti, De ejuſdem Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificio,
De adventu Meſſiae, De natura, ortu &amp; progreſſu Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionis
Chriſtianae,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo they needed not be Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
after them, for they were not likely to find in them
thoſe Opinions, that they were moſt zealous againſt. But
withal he added, that he himſelf wrote a very ill hand, that
the Papers that lay by him were in many places blotted and
interlined. But he promiſed where ever he could find a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
among the Students, he would deliver it up to their view.
For the Copy they wrote was more juſt than any he had in his


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47542:34"/>
keeping; for in the very time of the <hi>Publick Praelection,</hi> he
did Add, Change, and Alter as he ſaw convenient. This
did not ſatisfie, but one of their number pleaded, that he
ſhould give up his Dictates immediately, and that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
he made, was a Shift and downright contempt of the
<hi>Committee:</hi> I think it was <hi>Hume</hi> of <hi>Polwart</hi> that reaſoned
thus, with ſome degrees of warmth againſt the Doctor:
The Doctor was content to undeceive them as far as was
poſſible, and therefore he deſired they might name ſome of
their own number to examine his Dictates, and that he would
wait upon them, and read the Dictates to them himſelf, ſince
he preſumed none elſe could read them ſo well. It ſeems they
found this overture reaſonable; for after that offer made by
the Doctor, he heard not one word more of the Dictates,
they never inquired after them. However, the Doctor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
a legible Copy of his Dictates, <hi>De Sacrificio Chriſti,</hi>
from one of the Students, and gave it to the Clerks, that
they might give it to whom they pleaſed. It fell out, that
when they were ſpeaking very hotly about the Doctor's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates,
that he told them himſelf, that for one year he had
changed his publick Dictates into <hi>Chatechetio Conferences.</hi>
The reaſon was this, That he perceived that it was not
poſſible to order any publick Leſſon, equal to the Capacity
and Advantage of all the Students; for ſome of them being
but ſo very young, that they were but Learning their <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
and <hi>Greek;</hi> Others of them being advanced ſo near the
Degree of <hi>Maſters of Art,</hi> moſt part of the Youth, within
the Colledge, could not be thought capable to underſtand
<hi>Theological</hi> Controverſies, which were the ordinary <hi>Theams</hi>
of ſuch <hi>Publick Praelections.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Doctor</hi> adviſed
with ſome of the Maſters, what way the publick Lecture,
upon the <hi>Wedneſdays,</hi> might be made Univerſally uſeful to all
the Students within the Colledge. And the reſult was, that
he told the Students he would not put them that Year to the
toil of writing any, but ordered them to convene frequently
on the <hi>Wedneſdays,</hi> and he would explain to them the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick
Creed,</hi> one Article after another, <hi>viva voce,</hi> this he
did for that year: The Students were better ſatisfied, much
more edified, and leſs wearied, than when they were obliged
to Write; for now they came to the School freely of their
own accord, without conſtraint; whereas formerly they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47542:35"/>
writ what was Dictated, nor were all the Maſters able
to drive them to the publick Hall, when they had ſtrained
their Authority to the greateſt height. And perhaps ſome
of them who were moſt concerned then to magnifie every
ſhaddow of an Objection againſt the <hi>Doctor,</hi> have found by
their proper experience, that the publick <hi>Dictates</hi> are no
more regarded than their <hi>Character:</hi> This then was the
<hi>Doctor</hi>'s fault that he changed a publick Leſſon, that ſerved
no end, but that of Form and uſeleſs Solemnity, into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
uſeful, and ſerious Exerciſe. By his imployment, he
was obliged to teach the Youth the firſt Principles of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion;</hi> what more proper method could he deviſe,
than go through the Articles of the <hi>Apoſtolick Creed,</hi> and
explain them, partly from Scripture, partly from the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Natural Reaſon, partly from the Univerſal Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church, and partly from ſuch Conceſſions of <hi>Pagan</hi>
Authors, as might either illuſtrate or confirm what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
among the Chriſtians: This was the method he took:
But was the <hi>Doctor</hi> obliged, by any Statute in the Houſe,
never to vary the former Cuſtom of <hi>Praelections?</hi> No, that
is neither pretended nor alledged; wherein then was he to
be blamed, that he taught his own Scholars in the manner
he judged moſt proper for their Edification? perhaps, when
<hi>Elias</hi> comes he'll tell us where the fault lay, and not till then
ſhall we ever know. Let me ask one queſtion, and ſo I'll
leave this Argument: Did all the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Predeceſſours ſo
Superſtitiouſly obſerve this way of Dictating, without change
or alteration of the Method? No, for the truly Learned and
Pious Dr. <hi>Lighton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dumblain,</hi> when he was Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
of the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> did never oblige them to
write one word from his Mouth: But inſtead of thoſe Dictates,
recommended to them, <hi>viva voce,</hi> the moſt excellent truths
of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> in the moſt unimitable ſtrains of
Piety and Eloquence. And Mr. <hi>Adamſon</hi> his Predeceſſour
did Catechiſe, as you may ſee by the Printed Copy of his
Catechiſm; nor is there any reſtraint upon the Principal of
the Colledge, either from Statute or Cuſtom, why he may
not change his Method, as oft as he ſees convenient: Yet
to make a mighty muſter of Arguments againſt the <hi>Doctor,</hi>
his <hi>Catechetick Conference,</hi> muſt be made a part of his Crime:
I think one Mr. <hi>Law</hi> had the honour of making this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
but I am not very ſure of it.</p>

                  <p>And that it appears by the publick Regiſters of the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrand
Laureation,</hi> that whereas, in the Year 1663, till the
Year 1687, the Magiſtrands were always ſworn to continue in
the Verity and Purity of the Goſpel, or in the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
reformed, according to the Purity of the Goſpel; yet in
the Year 1687 and 1688, when Dr. <hi>Monro</hi> was Principal,
he takes the <hi>Magiſtrands</hi> obliged only to perſevere in the Blank
Chriſtian Religion, and this Blank is found three ſeveral
times in the Book, <hi>viz.</hi> At two publick <hi>Laureations,</hi> and a
private one, and the Doctor having laid the blame on the
<hi>Bibliothecarius</hi> his negligence, and craving the <hi>Bibliothecarius</hi>
might be examined thereupon. He being accordingly Sworn
and examined Depones, that what he wrote in the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrand</hi>
Book, was either by direction of the Primar, or of one
of the Regents, and in preſence of the Faculty, or of a <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
of them, and that what he did write in the ſaid Book,
was always read over in preſence of the Maſters and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
And particularly the Alteration of the Promiſe made at
the Graduation, in the Year 1687. As alſo the Committee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that at the two laſt <hi>Laureations,</hi> in the Year, 1689,
and 1690, neither Oath nor Promiſe was required at the
Graduation:</p>
                  <p>It is therefore the Opinion of the <hi>Committee,</hi> that Dr. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Monro,</hi> Principal of the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> be
deprived of his Office, as Primar there; and that the
ſaid Office be declared vacant.</p>
                  <p>There is a Letter written by the ſaid Doctor, and directed to
the late Arch-Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> dated the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>January,
1689,</hi> owned and acknowledged by the Doctor to be his hand
Writ, the conſideration whereof is Referred to the Commiſſion.</p>

                  <p>Here it at laſt ſome dangerous Plot diſcovered: To make
the Account of it as ſhort and eaſie as is poſſible, let me
firſt explain ſome words that are peculiar to our Country. By
the <hi>Magiſtrands</hi> is underſtood that particular Number and
Society of Students, that are ready to Commence <hi>Maſters of
Art;</hi> by the <hi>Laureation</hi> is underſtood the Publick Solemnity


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47542:36"/>
of conferring this Degree; The particular Anſwer to this
objection, is given before; but I will unfold the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by propoſing ſome Queries relating to it: The firſt,
is, did the <hi>Doctor</hi> Adminiſter the Current Oath, that was
ordinarily Sworn by Maſters of Art, all the time he was in the
Colledge, until there was a Proclamation, <hi>Feb. 1687.</hi> by
King <hi>James, forbidding all Diſcriminative Oaths?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes he did. But how can that be made evident? yes it
may be made evident by the following <hi>Tranſcripts</hi> of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Regiſters, that all who Commenced Maſters of Arts
ſince the <hi>Doctor</hi> entred, were made to Swear the Current
Oath of the Houſe, until the Proclamation of Indulgence
did forbid all ſuch Diſcriminative Oaths; and therefore the
<note n="*" place="margin">Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters.</note> Reader will be at the pains to read as follows, <hi>Anno 1686.
De diſciplina Magiſtri</hi> Herberti Kennedy <hi>ſollinne formulae
ſponſionis &amp; Juramenti Accademici</hi> Edinburgeni <hi>praeſcripti
nos quorum ſubſequuntur nomina cordicitus ſubſignamus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So you ſee, that all that Received the Degree that year,
did Sign the Oath, <hi>3 Junii 1686. eidem</hi> S. S. <hi>Juramento
praeſcripto ſubſcripſerunt</hi> Gulielmus Baird, &amp; Joannes
Monro.</p>
                  <p>Another was Graduate, <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>July 1686.</hi> Another,
<hi>July 20, 1686.</hi> Another, <hi>July 26, 1686.</hi> Another, upon the
<hi>24 Auguſt, 1686.</hi> Another, upon the <hi>31 Auguſt 86.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
upon the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>Sept. 86.</hi> Another, upon the <hi>22d</hi>
of <hi>October, 86.</hi> Another, upon the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>December, 86.</hi>
And all of them did Swear, and Sign the ſame Oath that
was formerly Sworn.</p>
                  <p>Then it is Alledged in the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Defence, that the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Oath of the Houſe was Adminiſtred, until all ſuch
Oaths were Prohibited by the Proclamation, <hi>Feb. 1687?</hi> Yes
that is Alledged, and no change obſerved, until the <hi>4th</hi> of
<hi>April 87.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But did other Maſters of other Univerſities, particularly in
the Univerſities of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> forbear the
Impoſing of all ſuch Diſcriminative Oaths after the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Feb. 87.</hi> as well as the <hi>Doctor?</hi> Yes, that they did:
Were they ever Challenged for this, by any <hi>Committee</hi> ſent to
Examine their Behaviour? No, not at all, not one of them
was Challenged for it: What is it then that the <hi>Doctor</hi> is
Blamed for? He is Blamed for this, that in ſtead of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47542:36"/>
Oath which he would (but durſt not) Impoſe, he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a General Promiſe of perſevering in the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
But is not the word, <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> never to be
met with in that Publick Promiſe, required of the Students,
inſtead of the former Oath? Yes, I told you before, that the
firſt Alteration that is obſervable, is, upon the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>April 87.</hi>
and then the Promiſe was, to perſevere in the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi>
But this being thought too General and Indefinite;
in the Month of <hi>June</hi> thereafter in the ſame Year, as may
be ſeen in the Publick Regiſters; the words run, <hi>pollicemur
in puriore Religione Chriſtiana perſeverantium:</hi> Did the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
at any time thereafter, in Private or in Publick, with or
without the knowledge of the Maſters, Order the <hi>Bibliothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius</hi>
to leave out the word <hi>Puriore?</hi> No, that he never did;
Have we no other Evidence for that, than the <hi>Doctors</hi> bare
Aſſertion? Yes, as you may ſee by the <hi>Bibliothecarius</hi> his
Declaration, ſubjoined to this Dialogue, upon the word of a
Chriſtian, that he was never Enjoined, either by the <hi>Doctor</hi>
or any of the Regents, to leave out the word <hi>(puriore)</hi> or
<hi>(Reformata)</hi> But did not the <hi>Bibliothecarius</hi> leave a Blank, as
the Inquiſitors alledge? The <hi>Bibliothecarius</hi> will anſwer that
Queſtion in the Declaration himſelf: But are there no other
Inſtances preceeding the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s time, even when there was
no Publick Proclamations, forbidding Diſcriminative Oaths;
in which, the Maſters of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> took the Liberty to
change the Publick <hi>Formula</hi> of the Oath? Yes, ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
may be given of ſuch Changes, if any Man will be
at the pains to peruſe the Regiſters; I'le name but one, it is
in the Year 1662, and the Students, when they Commenced
Maſters of Art, had an Oath Adminiſtred to them; in
which, there is not the leaſt mention of any thing Relating
to Religion; and therefore the Inquiſitors date the Cuſtome
of Swearing this Oath, from the year 1663; for they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
ſaw, if they had gone further back, they would have
met with a <hi>Formula,</hi> in the year 1662, much more Looſe,
General and Indefinite, than that for which the <hi>Doctor</hi> is
challenged; and leſt he might have any ſuch Precedent from
the Publick Regiſters in his own Defence; they that drew up
the Report, fraudulently paſſed it over in ſilence; ſo they
concluded, it ſeems, that no Religion was better, than the
Chriſtian; For ſome of them that ſat Judges in that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,</hi>


                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:47542:37"/>
did Commence Maſter of Art that very Year, 1662,
in the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> when the General Oath Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
only obliged them to continue, <hi>Fautores Academiae
Edinburgenae;</hi> and ſome Members of the <hi>Committee,</hi> ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
not to ſay, that the <hi>Formula</hi> in the Year 1662, was
better than the Promiſe required by the <hi>Doctor</hi> after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation:
But what was it that the <hi>Doctor</hi> blamed the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliothecarius</hi>
for? He might perhaps blame him, that he
did leave out the word <hi>Puriore,</hi> at ſometimes, after it was
Inſert into the <hi>Formula,</hi> ſince he himſelf Declares, he was
never enjoined to do ſo; but the plain Truth in cold Blood
is, that this was no Trick nor Deſign in the <hi>Bibliothecarius,</hi>
but a moſt Innocent inadvertence: When this Affair was
toſs'd before the <hi>Committee,</hi> they Diſcourſed of it, with that
Warmth and Confuſion, that it was not poſſible to know,
what they would have been at; Therefore the <hi>Doctor</hi> deſired,
that the <hi>Bibliothecarius</hi> might be Interrogate upon Oath,
whether he knew of any <hi>Popiſh</hi> or <hi>Heretical</hi> Deſign, intended
or contrived by the Maſters, when they required this Publick
Promiſe of the Students; inſtead of this, they enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he wrote this <hi>Formula</hi> by any order from the Maſters,
as if the Crime lay in the <hi>Formula</hi> it ſelf, and not in any
bad Deſign about it: This was another Impertinence, for
the <hi>Bibliothecarius</hi> was never Accuſed to have invented the
<hi>Formula</hi> of himſelf, for that had been a piece of Forgery
with a Witneſs; of which Mr. <hi>Henderſon</hi> the <hi>Bibliothecarius</hi>
is not capable, being a Youth of ſuch Modeſty and Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
it may be, he might be blamed for leaving out a word,
or for Writing careleſly.</p>
                  <p>From the Anſwers I have given to theſe ſeveral Queries;
The Reader may ſee, what was the occaſion of this Change
in the Publick <hi>Formula,</hi> after the Proclamation; and it is ſo
much the more wonderful, that they blame the <hi>Doctor</hi>
for obeying that Proclamation, that firſt warmed the
<hi>Phanaticks</hi> into their preſent Strength and Confidence: But
before I ſet down the <hi>Bibliothecarius</hi> his Declaration; let
me Inform the Reader, that when the <hi>Doctor</hi> was ſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Commiſſion, ſeveral Queſtions were asked at him,
and five or ſix times he was Removed, and the Report of
the <hi>Committee</hi> was but once Read in his Hearing; It was
not poſſible, for an Hour together to give an Anſwer, to all


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47542:37"/>
the particulars they had heaped together in their Report;
The <hi>Doctor</hi> endeavoured to give a true Account of the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula</hi>
which was challenged; He deſired, that Mr. <hi>Gregory,</hi>
Profeſſour of the Mathematicks, and Mr. <hi>Cunninghame</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour
of Philoſophy, who knew the Regiſters much better
than he did, might be Examined, but this was denied: If
Mr. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cuuninghame,</hi> had been Examined,
they would quickly have explained any thing that was dark
or intricate about it; But the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> would not
hear any Defence or Explication of that <hi>Formula;</hi> he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that it obliged them only to be Chriſtians, and that
the Papiſts were Chriſtians; The <hi>Doctor</hi> anſwered that by
the Proteſtant Religion, he never underſtood any thing, but
unmixed Chriſtianity, and that the Papiſts, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> were no
Chriſtians, <hi>i. e.</hi> Popery is no Chriſtianity, for tho' they were
Baptized, and ſo Members of the Catholick Church, yet
their Popery is no part of their Chriſtianity, elſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
are obliged immediately to turn Papiſts, unleſs they
renounce their Chriſtianity. And therefore tho' we allow
the Papiſts to be Chriſtians, and ſome of them excellent Men
too; yet the Errours which are mixt with their Chriſtian
Belief, and which obliged the Proteſtants to Separate from
them, is no part of the Chriſtian Religion; and if the
Students did continue firm in the Chriſtian Religion, I hope
it had no tendency to make them Papiſts: But there is a
Sect of Men amongſt us, who value the niceſt Punctilio's of
the <hi>Covenant,</hi> more than they do the fundamentals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.
It is time now to leave this, and to inſert Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert

one Expreſſion, That without ſpecial Grace Renewing the

ANSWER
TO THE
ARTICLES
Given in
Againſt Doctor STRACHAN, Profeſſor
of Divinity, in the Colledge of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</head>
               <p>TO theſe Articles or <hi>Libel</hi> I am not in Law ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to give any particular Anſwer, unleſs it
were owned and ſubſcribed by my Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
and Witneſs adduced for the probation of the
Particulars <hi>Lybelled;</hi> for ſince the Accuſer is ſo
Conſcious to himſelf of his groſs Prevarications
and notorious Falſhoods alledged in his <hi>Libel,</hi> that
he dare not ſubſcribe the ſame; yet ſince I know
my intire Innocence, as to many of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<hi>Libelled</hi> againſt me; (for ſome of them I do not
acknowledge to be Faults) I ſhall not decline to give
a particular Anſwer to each of them, being glad
that the <hi>Lybeller</hi> has not had the Confidence to
charge me with any Immorality in my Life and


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47542:40"/>
Converſation, reſerving therefore all other Defences
competent in Law.</p>
               <p>I. To the firſt I Anſwer, That in a Sermon
before the moſt Reverend Father in God, my Lord
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
in his <hi>Dioceſian Synod,</hi> I did from <hi>Phil. 4.</hi> and 5.
recommend to my Auditors, and to all Chriſtians
of whatſoever Perſwaſion, that Chriſtian Duty of
<hi>Moderation,</hi> (of which I wiſh we had more at
preſent) the want whereof is the occaſion of the
lamentable <hi>Schiſms</hi> and <hi>Diviſions</hi> that are in the
<hi>Chriſtian Church:</hi> But as for Reconciliation with
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is now Conſtitute, I was
ſo far from preſſing it (though to wiſh a true Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
among all Chriſtians were no Crime) that I did
highly blame the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> for going ſo far to the
extream, in Points controverted betwixt us and
them, ſo as to obſtruct a deſirable Reconciliation,
as it is to be regretted ſome Proteſtants, on the other
hand, run too far to the other extream, to put a
bar thereto: So that we owe it to the want of
<hi>Moderation</hi> amongſt the fiery <hi>Zealots</hi> of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Perſwaſions, that the ſame is rendered ſo
impracticable. But as to that expreſſion, <hi>What
needs this din</hi> (or rather noiſe) betwixt <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
and <hi>Papiſt,</hi> I never had ſuch an expreſſion. As for that
of the two Brethren named <hi>Reynolds,</hi> I did adduce
that as an Inſtance of the <hi>Imbecility</hi> and <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Mutability</hi> and <hi>Changeableneſs</hi> of our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and humane Underſtandings (while we dwell
in theſe Houſes of Clay, and the duſt of Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
not blown out of our Eyes) upon the account
whereof, we ought to have Charity one towards
another, and Compaſſion one of another; and that
they might have been both Good and Learned


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47542:40"/>
Men, and might have been both ſaved, I know
nothing to the contrary; yea, and in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Charity I am bound to think ſo, if they
lived and died in the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> owning the
Fundamentals of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> whatever
Preterfundamental Errors any of them might have
been intangled in. As for my alledged Saying,
that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> but I hold
<hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> it is ſo impudent a Calumny, and
ſuch a notorious Lye, that as I am confident the
Accuſer, whoever he be, dare not ſay he heard it,
ſo neither can be adduce any famous Witneſs,
that can depone the ſame; the contrary is ſo well
known, that my Judicious Auditors can bear me
Witneſs that I Preached both againſt the <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi>
of <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and <hi>Conſubſtantiation</hi> of the
<hi>Lutherans,</hi> and ſaid it had been good, and had
tended much to the Peace of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> that
the different Parties had never taken upon
them, peremptorily to determine the manner
of our Bleſſed Lord's Preſence in the <hi>Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi>
but that they had contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with that modeſt expreſſion of the old
Schoolman, <hi>Durandus, Vterbum audimus motum
ſentimus modum neſcimus praeſentiam credimus;</hi>
with which alſo accords that known Diſtich, <hi>Corpore
de Chriſti lis eſt de ſanguine lis eſt. Deque modo lis
eſt non habitura modum.</hi> I might adduce ſeveral
Teſtimonies of Learned Divines of the Reformed
Church, to this purpoſe, but I ſhall content my ſelf,
at preſent, with that one of Judicious <hi>Calvin, In
Tractatu de coena Domini. Blaſphemia eſt negare in
coena Domini offerri veram Chriſti communicationem,

               </p>
               <p>2. As to the Second, that I am generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
an Arminian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I know not how I may
be reputed, but I deſire the <hi>Lybeller</hi> may conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
when, or to whom I ſaid I was ſo; did I ever
ſubſcribe their Confeſſion? it's known they were
Presbyterians, and I am none. And I ſuppoſe that
may now be reputed to be my greateſt Crime;
for if I were, it's probable theſe things would not
be laid to my charge. It has been always my
Principle and practice not to eſpouſe the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
tenets of any party, but as the ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
ſaid, <hi>Amicus Plato, amicus Socrates, ſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis
amica veritas.</hi> So ſay I, <hi>Amicus Calvinus, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus
Arminius, amicus Lutherus, ſed magis amica
veritas,</hi> being always ready to embrace Truth by
whomſoever it be maintained. That I Preached
and maintained <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Pelagian</hi> Tenets in
the <hi>Trone</hi>-Church, in which I was oppoſed by
my umqhaill Collegue Mr. <hi>Trotter.</hi> The <hi>Lybeller</hi>
ought to prove it by famous Witneſſes, and not
ſimply to alledge, <hi>Si accuſare ſatis ſit quis erit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noceus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For I peremptorily deny, that ever I uſed ſuch
expreſſions as my Accuſer alledges. My then Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue
being now at his reſt, I deſire not in the
leaſt to reflect on his memory; what his deſigns
were, in being the firſt Aggreſſor in reflecting in


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47542:41"/>
his Pulpit were beſt know to himſelf. Though
he were <hi>in vivis,</hi> his allegation could be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation;
wherein he wronged me, I forgive him, and
I hope God hath forgiven him.</p>
               <p>3. My third Accuſation is, That I have inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
the Worſhip of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which it is
anſwered, That I have indeed made uſe of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Service in my Family, as judging it to be
the way of Worſhip moſt conſonant and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Word of God, and the practice of the
whole Catholick Church, even in its pureſt times,
it being a moſt devout and ſerious way of offering
up our Prayers and Praiſes to Almighty God, and
tending moſt to Edification. And againſt this, I
know no ſtanding Law, more than againſt the
<hi>French</hi> Service, which is ſo publickly made uſe of
in this place, and not in the leaſt quarrelled:
And that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Service was not more in uſe
in this Church, it's too well known to whom we
owe that unhappineſs, and what Unchriſtian and
Barbarous courſes were taken to prevent its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Eſtabliſhment here, when that Royal Martyr
of Bleſſed and Glorious Memory was endeavouring
it for the good of this Church and Kingdom,
which by the unjuſtifiable practices of the Oppoſers
was then made an Aceldama, or Field of Blood.</p>
               <p>4. In the Fourth Article the Accuſer challenges
me for negligence of my duty in teaching of Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to the young Students, and alledges it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
in that for the firſt two years, my Prelections
went no further than my harrangue. I anſwer,
that were it ſo as he alledges (which whether ſo
or not I cannot call to mind now) I could not be
challenged of any negligence upon that account.


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47542:42"/>
The ſubject of my harrangue being ſo copious
that it might have furniſh'd matter of dictats for
ſeveral years. For it was <hi>de Theologia in genere de
ejus dignitate, Authore, objecto, fine,</hi> &amp;c. Which
Subject I inlarged upon, in dictating further than I
had in that harrangue: Whereas ſome eminent
Profeſſors have ſpent ſeveral years dictating upon one
point of controverſie; but whenſoever it was finiſhed,
I ſimply deny that either it or any thing elſe I dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
contain'd any unſound Doctrine as the <hi>Lybeller</hi> was
pleaſed to alledge. As for <hi>Paſſive-Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Reſiſtance,</hi>
I yet own them to be ſound points of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<hi>duly ſtated and qualified;</hi> beſides, that could be
no evidence of negligence in regard the frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of other exerciſes, <hi>viz. Homilies, Exe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſies,</hi>
and <hi>Diſputes</hi> among ſuch a number of Students
were ſuch as at ſome times I could ſcarce have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
me above ſix or ſeven Diets in dictating
the whole half year. So that conſidering the few
Dyets of dictating and how ill they were attended
by the Students who were deſirous rather to read
what was already Publiſhed, than to be put to the
toil of writing, I kept thoſe Papers in looſe Sheets,
not having deſigned them for publick view, but it
was always my judgment that if there were leſs
writing, and more reading and meditating on what's
already publiſhed, it might tend more to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Learning, and the better Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Improvement of Youth in the Study
of Divinity; and therefore I choſe to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to them ſuch Books as I judged moſt
proper for them; by which method, and the Lords
Bleſſing upon their pains and endeavours, many
have given great Proofs of their proficiency in
the ſaid Studies, and others great grounds of
hope of their being ſerviceable to God in the holy


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47542:42"/>
Miniſtry, when he thinks fit in his Wiſdom to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them therein.</p>
               <p>5. As to ſome Baptiſms and Marriages in the
Fifth Article, I knew no reſtraint upon me, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in my Station, hindering me to grant the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of the Reſpective Parents, when duly invited
by them to the performance of ſuch Duties. But
ſince the promulgation of the late Act, I have
forborn any thing of that nature. As for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Mr. <hi>Alexander Chaplain,</hi> his Liberality
to the Poor of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and others, is very well
known. If he had given me a Guiney for the uſe of
the Poor of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> I ſhould not have defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them thereof. The Gentleman himſelf can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
as to that matter, for I was never ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
as to ask any thing for my pains.</p>
               <p>6. As for the Expreſſions mentioned in
the Sixth Article, they ought to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
on, and proved; which not being done,
I can give no anſwer thereto. I never left the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
nor do I deſign to deſert my preſent Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here; but if I be thruſt from the one, as I
have been from the other, upon the account of
my Conſcience, that cannot comply with the
Conditions required, I muſt patiently ſubmit, and
caſt my ſelf, and my numerous Family, on
God's good Providence; being reſolved never to
put my worldly Intereſt in Ballance with the Peace
of my Conſcience, which I have endeavoured hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
to keep <hi>void of offence towards God and Man.</hi>
And to follow that Apoſtolical Rule, which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
recommended to others under my Charge,
<hi>to obey God rather than Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:47542:43"/>
6. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I am charged, that I ordinarily neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the Worſhip of God in my Family, which is
ſo notorious a Falſhood, that I challenge the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller,</hi>
or any he can adduce to make it good,
and appeal to all that have been in my Family,
as Witneſſes of the contrary. But it ſeems the
<hi>Libeller</hi> has forgot the Third Article of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
or thinks, to uſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Service,
is not to Worſhip God: To whom, for all theſe
Calumnies, I refer him.</p>

has often Preached <hi>Preſentiam Credo modum ignoro:</hi> And
that it had been good that that had not been in diſpute, but
kept in the Ancients words: And albeit he denied his
being <hi>Arminian;</hi> yet he not only refuſed to Subſcribe our

the Doctor Replied very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently;
that if any Perſon would
own and Subſcribe the <hi>Libel</hi> given

he ſhould then Anſwer it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.
My Lord <hi>Crawford
Praeſes,</hi> ſaid there was no <hi>Libel,</hi>
the Act of Parliament made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of none, it was but an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
and any body might
Inform; The Doctor Replied, it
was materially a <hi>Libel</hi> what ever


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47542:46"/>
word they pleaſed to Expreſs it by; And that in
Equity and Common <hi>Juſtice,</hi> he ought to know
his Accuſer. The <hi>Praeſes</hi> replied, there was no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer,
neither did the Act of Parliament appoint any,
and therefore, he (the <hi>Proeſes)</hi> required the <hi>Doctor</hi> to
give a Poſitive Anſwer, whether he owned theſe
written Anſwers, or not, (a Copy of them being
offered to him to view them) the Doctor Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that he did <hi>own</hi> them and <hi>adhere</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>After which, the Lord <hi>Crawford</hi> asked the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
if he would <hi>qualifie</hi> himſelf according to the
Act of Parliament for his place in the Colledge,
by ſwearing the Oath of Allegiance to King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſubſcribing the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of aſſurance, the Confeſſion of Faith at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
and heartily ſubmitting to the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Government. The Doctor anſwered he could
not with a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> comply with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Teſt ſo propos'd, and that therefore he adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to his former anſwers before the Committee,
whereupon he was ordered to remove, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a little while he was called again before them:
The former Report of the Committee was again
read over to him, and the Commiſſions Sentence
of deprivation following thereupon; after the
reading of both, the Doctor ſaid no more, but that
he thanked God he received their Sentence with
great peace of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Tranquility</hi> of Mind,
which he could not have promiſed to himſelf, if he
had done any thing againſt his convictions to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
that blow.</p>
               <p>Many of the Gentlemen and others who were
permitted to be preſent at the reading of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and Sentence, not having heard the Doctor's
Anſwers read, nor known what paſt in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
might conclude upon the bare hearing of


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47542:46"/>
that <hi>Report</hi> drawn up by the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
that they had found him Guilty of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
ſeveral <hi>Heterodox</hi> Opinions in the Colledge,
and that for ſuch Doctrines he was <hi>deprived.</hi> Yea,
ſome of the Members of the Commiſſion it ſelf,
before whom the Doctor's written Anſwers were
never read (as he is credibly informed) did entertain
the ſame thoughts upon the hearing of ſuch words
as <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with the Church of <hi>Rome, Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,
Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore it
was thought convenient to undeceive well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men, and expoſe the malice of his <hi>Accuſers</hi> in
this particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> The Committee did <hi>conſider</hi> his Anſwers to
the Articles of his <hi>Libel,</hi> but they do not plainly
declare what it was in thoſe Anſwers that they
did <hi>conſider;</hi> we know very well they did conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Anſwers, and it was not poſſible for them to
find in them either <hi>Vntruth</hi> or <hi>Impertinence;</hi> it's true,
they accuſe him that he Preach'd <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but they thought it no part
of their buſineſs to prove it, no nor ſo much as to
examine one Witneſs that ever heard the Doctor
utter the leaſt expreſſion that might favourably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate
a <hi>Syncretiſme</hi> with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; ſo
it is very odd that the Committee's conſideration
of his anſwers ſhould be named as one ground of
the Sentence which paſt againſt him, before the
General Commiſſion of the <hi>Viſitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> They conſidered his anſwers concerning
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> &amp;c. But
is it poſſible for a man at one and the ſame time,
to hold both thoſe Opinions? Or can a man Preach
<hi>Reconciliation</hi> with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
hold only <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> and yet recommend
to the People that the Doctrine of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>


                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:47542:47"/>
may be complied with, who ſay that there is no
ſuch thing as Bread in the holy Euchariſt after
Conſecration. It ſeems the <hi>Libeller</hi> thinks there is
no great difference between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the
<hi>Romaniſts;</hi> had he liſtned to an Impartial Monitor,
<hi>Lyſimachus Nicanor,</hi> in time of the late troubles,
he would have found that it is much more eaſie to
reconcile Popery and Presbytery than the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi>
and <hi>Romaniſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> But the Doctor acknowledges, that he had
Preached <hi>Praeſentiam credo, modum neſcio;</hi> and that it
had been good for the peace of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> the
manner of our Saviour's Preſence had never been
ſo hotly diſputed, but kept in the words of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.
This is a piece of Logick that the Doctor
cannot underſtand: muſt he that ſays, <hi>Praeſentiam
credo, modum neſcio,</hi> neceſſarily believe <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi>
or <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> one or both. I think
the Church of <hi>England</hi> will not ſay ſo, for it holds
the Real, effectual Spiritual Preſence, and yet denys
both <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and <hi>Conſubſtantiation.</hi> And
did not the Doctor ſay plainly <hi>modum neſcio,</hi> how
then can they affirm that he had any kindneſs for
either of thoſe opinions, ſince the fault of both is
ſo plainly diſowned by the Doctor: He believed
the Preſence, but the manner of the Preſence he
did not know.</p>
               <p>But ſince thoſe words in his anſwers, <hi>praeſentiam
credo,</hi> was ſo greedily laid hold on by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Miniſters, Members of that Committee, that
when they heard them they deſired the Clerk to
note that eſpecially, it will not be amiſs over and
above what is repreſented in his written anſwers,
to put thoſe Gentlemen in mind that they ſhould
read Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> more frequently, whom they have
deſerted ſhamefully in many things, and in his


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47542:47"/>
Tract <hi>De Caena Dom.</hi> after the words formerly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Doctor, they will meet with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words, <hi>Fatemur omnes, nos, cum juxta Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
inſtitutum fide Sacramentum recipimus, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiae

<hi>Calvin?</hi> If they do, I am ſure the Doctor ſaid leſs
than what may be deduced from them by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
conſequence, if they were contentiouſly inſiſted
on. And how can they be ſo captiouſly queru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
as to dream of Chimera's and Monſters in the
Doctrine ſo currently taught in the moſt Famous
Schools amongſt the Proteſtants?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may be Mr.</hi> Calvin'<hi>s Treatiſe</hi> de Coena Dom. <hi>is
not ſo eaſily had as his Book of</hi> Inſtit. <hi>which I think
very few of the Presbyterian Miniſters want, then
let me entreat them to look to the following Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
from Mr.</hi> Calvin,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. Cap. 17. Sect. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>in which he writes ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly
and Reverently of that Sacred Myſtery
of the Euchariſt,</hi> Quanquam autem cogitando animus
plus valet, quam lingua exprimendo: rei tamen magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine
ille quoque vincitur &amp; obruitur, itaque nihil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
reſtat niſi ut in ejus myſterii admirationem prorum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam,

               <p>
                  <hi>Several other Teſtimonies might be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from many other Reformed Divines; but
that is not the deſign of this Paper, it is enough
by one or two Authentick Teſtimonies to expoſe
the ſillineſs of ſuch men as find fault with every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that does not follow their words as well as
their Sentiments. I think the learned Biſhop</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews
<hi>underſtood the Doctrine of the Church of</hi>
England <hi>ſufficiently well, who in his anſwer to
Cardinal</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>hath theſe words,</hi> Dixit Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus
Hoc eſt Corpus meum: non hoc modo, hoc eſt corpus
meum. Nobis autem vobiſcum, de objecto convenit, de

ſive trans, nullum inibi verbum, &amp; quia verbum nullum
merito a fide procul ablegamus, inter Scita Scholae po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimus,
inter fidei Articulos non ponimus. <hi>And after
he had inſtanced the ſaying of</hi> Durandus, <hi>cited by
the Doctor, he adds,</hi> Praeſentiam credimus, nec mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
quam vos, veram. De modo praeſentiae nil te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere
definimus, addo, nec anxie inquirimus, non magis

               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:47542:48"/>
Notwithſtanding of all this, the <hi>Doctor</hi> did not
Believe, Aſſert, or Recommend, the Corporal and
Carnal Preſence of our Saviour in the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi>
but he lov'd to Expreſs his Reverence of that Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">Of this many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may be given in the time of the late trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, though it be a part of the conſtant nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt's Family upon Earth, till he return to Judge the quick and the dead.</note>
otherways than the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do; who,
for the moſt part ſhow ſo little regard unto it, that
in the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> their greateſt Zealots, did
not Adminiſter the Sacrament, of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for twenty years together.</p>
               <p>The next thing thoſe ſharp-ſighted Inquiſitors,
did conſider in the <hi>Doctor's</hi> Anſwers, is, that tho' he
denyed his being <hi>Arminian,</hi> yet he not only refuſed
to ſubſcribe their Confeſſions of Faith, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex,
but alſo declared, he would not then give a
preſent Anſwer whether or no he thought the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
about Freewill, and the firſt Article about
Juſtification were agreeable to the Word of God,
and whether he owned the ſame. In what Senſe
the <hi>Doctor</hi> denyed himſelf to be <hi>Arminian,</hi> may be
ſeen in his Anſwers to the <hi>Libel;</hi> of the reſt take
this following account. When they asked him,
if he would Subſcribe the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Confeſſion of
Faith, he anſwered that he would Subſcribe no
Confeſſion compoſed by fallible Men, but ſo far
as it might be agreeable to the Word of God.
For ſince thoſe Gentlemen at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were not
Divinely inſpired, their Dictates might be fairly
examined, and that his Subſcription to any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
did neceſſarily imply this reſerve and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Doctor</hi> was deſired to inſtance thoſe
Articles in the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Confeſſion,<note place="margin">Nor could it be reaſonably thought he came there to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by ſuch Pedagogues.</note> he thought
not agreeable to the Word of God. To this he
replyed, he was not obliged; it was enough that he
gave them this plain and poſitive Anſwer, he would
not Subſcribe the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Confeſſion, without


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47542:49"/>
the former Reſtriction: For he never made it much
his Buſineſs, ſince this <hi>Viſitation</hi> began; eſpecially,
to look ſo narrowly into the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Books;
and for the Particular Articles about which they
deſired to know his Judgement, it was needleſs
for them to be ſo Inquiſitive, for if he refuſed any
one part of what was required by the preſent Law,
he was ſure to be deprived, ſo it was not worth
the while to ſatisfie the Curioſity of the <hi>Committee</hi>-Men
in their little Punctilios.</p>
               <p>Yet he promiſed (ſaith the <hi>Report)</hi> to give a
particular Anſwer in writ concerning thoſe Articles
of Freewill, and Juſtification, and here they plainly
Inſinuate him guilty of Breach of promiſe; it is
true, the <hi>Doctor</hi> did promiſe if the <hi>Libel</hi> had been
Subſcribed and owned by any Informer, to return
a particular Anſwer to all the Articles that were
contained therein; but to give <hi>them</hi> an account of
his private Judgement in the Articles of <hi>Freewill,</hi>
and <hi>Juſtification</hi> was needleſs, for every Man's
Conſcience did plainly convince him, he had Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
elſe he could not ſee how the remorſe of
Conſcience could be underſtood, which makes
the Remembrance of our willful Sins ſo uneaſie
to us.</p>
               <p>Next they will have the <hi>Doctor</hi> Guilty of Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
becauſe he did not oblige the Students to
write his Dictates ſo often as the Viſitors would
have had him, though the frequent returns of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Exerciſes, (much more uſeful) made this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to him. But this is an impertinence not
worth conſidering, and the ſame exception hath
been ſufficiently anſwered in the former Tryals.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſince moſt of the Students of Divinity
are obliged once a Year to ſuſtain publick Diſputes,
and that the Profeſſor is allowed but two Dyets


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47542:49"/>
a Week, it was not convenient he ſhould Dictate
above ſeven or eight times a Year, elſe he could
not but hinder the Freedom and Solemnity of their
publick Diſputes and other Exerciſes.</p>
               <p>Now in the laſt place, they mention the <hi>Doctor</hi>
would not qualifie himſelf according to Law, it
is certainly true, that he will never proſtitute his
Conſcience ſo far as to do any thing wilfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Convictions in a matter of ſo great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence:
And it might be expected by ſuch as
did not well know the Miniſters that ſate in that
<hi>Committee,</hi> that they, who pretended ſo much to
a tender Conſcience, would have taken more pains
to inform the <hi>Doctor,</hi> than preſently to inſert in
their Report to the Commiſſion, (without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
him) what they had ſnatcht from his
Mouth upon ſurprize. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the
Year 1638 were truly more Civil, and took ſome
pains in the beginning to inform ſuch as differ'd
from them, tho' their Methods afterwards became
very ſevere. But the plain Truth in this matter is,
that the Suſpicion of being <hi>Arminian,</hi> (eſpecially
his Reading the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England)</hi>
was it that made his Enemies implacable, becauſe
that in the third Article of their <hi>Libel</hi> againſt him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they ſeem to paſs Sentence againſt him, upon this
very head before he was heard, for (ſay they) none
can Legally enjoy Benefices in the Church or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
who differ from the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>
in her <hi>Preſent Eſtabliſhment</hi> in <hi>Doctrine</hi> or
<hi>Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, he was Examin'd more particularly about
the <hi>Engliſh Liturgie;</hi> They ask'd, whether he uſed
that Service in his Family, before the Revolution?
To which he Anſwered, he did, tho' not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently;
yet he did not ſo conſtantly tye himſelf


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47542:50"/>
to that Form, but that he uſed <hi>Conceived Prayer;</hi>
upon the hearing of this, one of the Miniſters ſaid,
that it was not uſual for ſuch as were accuſtomed
with that Service, at any time to uſe <hi>extemporary</hi>
Prayers; neither did he think that ſuch could
pray after that manner; and therefore the <hi>Doctor,</hi>
making uſe thereof, was a <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> from the
<hi>Church of which he was a Member;</hi> ſo <hi>Saucily</hi>
do they talk, when they themſelves are <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
from the <hi>Vniverſal</hi> Church; yet they venture
to Brand all others that differ from them with that
<hi>Infamous</hi> Character; they think none can Pray as
they do; and the plain truth is, that, in ſome
Senſe, it's very true; for it's very difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
ſo much <hi>Boldneſs</hi> and <hi>Indiſcretion,</hi> as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
in their Prayers, either to the Fear of God,
or Chriſtian Humility.</p>
               <p>They then ask'd the Doctor, who concurred
with him in that Worſhip? He anſwer'd, That of
late, ſince the Church was pull'd down, a great
many of <hi>good Quality</hi> did frequent it. At which
they were greatly nettled, and asked him again,
who had pulled down the <hi>Church?</hi> To which the
Doctor replied, he was not obliged to give any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
anſwer, it was evident enough, that a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Church eſtabliſh'd by Law was pull'd down.
To which one of their number ſaid, that that was
pretty indeed, if the pulling down of fourteen
<note n="*" place="margin">Old Fellows.</note> Carles, was the pulling down of the Church.
This Gentleman ſhould have remembred that there
was many more than fourteen pull'd down by the
Rabble, and more ſince by Presbytery; but out of
kindneſs to him, I ſhall make no particular anſwers
to what he ſaid in his paſſion.</p>
               <p>He was next deſired to anſwer poſitively whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was an <hi>Arminian?</hi> The Doctor anſwered,


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47542:50"/>
that the <hi>Arminians</hi> were <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and he was
none. The ſame Perſon ask'd again what the
Doctors judgment might be of the five controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Articles? To which he anſwer'd, that he was not
obliged to declare his private judgment in thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies.
If they thought <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> a crime that
deſerved deprivation, they might accuſe him, and
prove it againſt him, for he was not obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
himſelf.</p>
               <p>At laſt, one of the Miniſters expreſly required
him to declare his opinion about the Doctrine of
Freewill and Juſtification, to which the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
as before. Sometime before the Doctor once
ask'd the Committee whether they were a Civil or
Eccleſiaſtick Judicatory? If a Civil, how came the
Presbyterian Miniſters to ſit there, who clamour'd
perpetually againſt the Biſhops for being Members
of Parliament, ſince now themſelves acted by
a Commiſſion from the Parliament; and if Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical,
he wiſh'd to know from whom they had
their Power? Thus the Doctor was toſſed and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their endleſs trifling and inſidious Queſtions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When I look back upon all the ſteps of Dr.</hi> Strachan'<hi>s
Tryal, it brings to my mind one of the Fables
we were taught when we were Boys.</hi> The Wolf
and the Lamb met at a Fountain, as ſoon as the Wolf
ſaw the Lamb he Lybelled, and accuſed him, firſt that
he troubled the Waters; for the Wolf alledged he could
not drink them; the Lamb anſwered that he could not
trouble the Waters, he ſtood much lower than the
Fountain. This Accuſation being removed, the Wolf
told him that ſix Months ago he heard the Lamb
curſe him. The Lamb anſwered that he was not ſix
Months old: ſo the ſecond Accuſation was as calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
as the firſt. Then the Wolf told him, if you did not,
your Father did curſe me: <hi>There was no anſwering the
third Article of the</hi> Libel, <hi>ſo the Lamb was worried.</hi>

               <p>THou haſt now heard how the <hi>Presbyterian Inquiſition</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt theſe two <hi>Doctors,</hi> with the ſame <hi>Rigour</hi> and <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
they <hi>Perſecuted</hi> all ſuch as they judged to be of the <hi>Epiſcopal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion</hi>
in that Colledge, and in all the Colledges of the Mother <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi>
at St. <hi>Andrews:</hi> One Inſtance more of the Presbyterian <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality in Judging,</hi> I muſt not here omit, and it's this.</p>
               <p>They admitted and ſuſtained Libels againſt all the Maſters that
they thought <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> without the leaſt ſhaddow of <hi>any Accuſer or
Informer,</hi> when themſelves alſo knew the Article to be moſt falſe;
yet if any of the Maſters who were <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or who had <hi>inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated</hi>
themſelves <hi>into their Favour;</hi> I ſay any ſuch were informed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
tho' the Indictment was ſubſcribed by Men of undoubted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
and contained many things that juſtly deſerved deprivation;
yet the matter was <hi>huddled up,</hi> without examining <hi>any one Article.</hi> As
in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Andr. Maſſie,</hi> againſt whom an Information was
given in, ſubſcribed by two Gentlemen of Great Learning and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the one a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Medicin,</hi> the other a Maſter of Arts in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi>
but the Inquiſitors knew that theſe Informers were not of their
<hi>Gang,</hi> nor had any liking to their Cauſe, and therefore they took
no notice of the Charge, which is as follows.</p>

               <head>Information againſt Mr. Maſſie.</head>
               <p>THere being a Commiſſion granted by Their Majeſties
and Eſtates of Parliament, to ſome Noblemen, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and Miniſters, for Viſiting the Univerſities of this
Kingdom; the ſaid Viſitors are earneſtly deſired to Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Examine the Behaviour and Management of Mr.
<hi>Andrew Maſſie,</hi> Regent in the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> who
theſe ſeveral years has been an uſeleſs and unfit Maſter of
the ſaid Univerſity.</p>
               <p>1. The Viſitors are deſired to conſider Mr. <hi>Maſſie</hi>'s baſe


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47542:51"/>
and indirect ways to procure Scholars to himſelf, which is
thus, While he was a Regent in old <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> during the
whole Vacance, he uſed to Travel up and down the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and where ever he heard there were any young Boys,
without any Introduction, he would impudently addreſs
himſelf to their Parents and Friends, and aſſure them that
the Boys were fit for the Colledge, albeit, very often they
did not underſtand a word of <hi>Latin;</hi> and if any of their
Parents or Friends did object to him, their Children not
being qualified, he did promiſe to make up the ſame, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
pains and care by himſelf, which he never did
yet, being the moſt ſuperficial and unconcerned Maſter
that ever was in an Univerſity, as will appear afterwards.
When he came to the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and found
that way not ſo practicable here, his method was, and is, to
ſpread confidently abroad, that none of the Courſes were
neceſſary, which preceeded that which he taught for the
time; ſo that he never fail'd to have Semies, Bauchelours,
and Magiſtrands, who were never at any Colledge before,
and he admitted them to be Scholars, without offering them
to be examined by the Principal or Maſters. And this he did
ſo frequently, that there was a publick Proceſs intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, in <hi>Anno. 1684.</hi> And as this is not our and known
to the whole Univerſity, ſo the ſame can be proven by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>2. The Viſitors are deſired to conſider his way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Teaching his Scholars, which is ſo trifling and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial,
that there can be no excuſe given for it. For, 1. He
never explains his Notes, but unconcernedly reads them
ſhortly over, without ever making any Digreſſion or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
upon them, ſo as to make his <hi>Scholars</hi> to underſtand
them. 2. There are many in his Claſs, at whom he will not
ask one queſtion in the whole year, nor once examine
them. 3. He takes no notice of the Abſents; ſince many
of them will be abſent for ſome weeks, and yet he never
miſſes nor calls for them, neither does he fine or puniſh
them for their abſence; and the effect of this, the time he


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47542:52"/>
taught his laſt courſe was, that the trafficking Prieſts
and Jeſuits did debauch more of his Scholars then of all
the other Students in <hi>Scotland</hi> beſide. 4. He takes as little
notice and care of his Scholars when preſent; for albeit
his Claſs be numerous, yet there will not be eight or ten
taking notice of what is ſaid or dictated, while the reſt in
his preſence are talking, toſſing, and fighting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the School: And an effect of this is, that
there is more expence for mending the Glaſs Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of his School, than of all the other Schools
beſides. 5. He gives very ill attendance; for all
along. and particularly the laſt Seſſion of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
he never entered the Colledge till half an
hour after eight in the Morning, and near eleven
in the Forenoon; and this was ſo well known to his
Scholars, who did not expect him ſooner, that it
made them either ſtay from the Colledge altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or ſo diſturb it, that it was hardly poſſible for
other Maſters to keep their Meetings at theſe times.
6. He has very few Meetings with his Scholars
on the Lords day, and takes no care that the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
attend, ſince of ſeventy or eighty, of which his
Claſs may conſiſt, there will not be above eight or
ten preſent. 7. He altogether neglects the Office of
<hi>Hebdomader</hi> (which was the moſt uſeful attendance
in the Colledge, for preventing of Tumults) in ſo much
that the Scholars did ordinarily brag, that <hi>Maſſie</hi>'s Week
was near; and that then they ſhould be reveng'd of one
another.</p>
               <p>3. The Viſitors are deſired to examine his care anent
the Library, which ſhould be very dear to all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
and yet Mr. <hi>Maſſie</hi> took no care to make his
Scholars pay their dues at their <hi>Matriculation,</hi> and
<hi>Laureation;</hi> and particularly this laſt three years there
were to the number of 58 of his Scholars, whom he
would not bring to <hi>Matriculation,</hi> notwithſtanding he
was deſired thereto by the Principal; and the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47542:52"/>
of theſe Scholars Names the Biblothecar can
exhibit to the Viſitors if required. 2. It is evident
by the Journal Books of the Library, that in the
Year 1680, or 1681, there was taken out of the
Money belonging to the Library Twenty Pounds
Sterling, or thereby, for uſes unknown to any of the
preſent Maſters, for which Mr. <hi>Maſſey</hi> gave his Tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
and which Ticket, without paying the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
he did again take up from Mr. <hi>Robert Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi>
the Biblothecar, or his Father; who can give
the beſt account of theſe Affairs, and his other Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
anent the Library.</p>
               <p>4. The Viſitors are deſired to conſider what he
Teaches, or rather what is contained in his Notes,
(which for the groſs of them he Copies from thoſe
of Mr. <hi>John Strachan,</hi> who was a Regent when he
entered to the Colledge of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
turned Jeſuit) and they will find in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
wherein there is occaſion of differing from
others; that his Doctrine is either ſuch as tends
to <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> and uncertainty of all things, or ſuch
as inclines to <hi>Atheiſme:</hi> As when he aſſerts that a
Creature may Create its own ſelf, and that even as
the principal and efficient Cauſe; Or ſuch as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<hi>Popiſh Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> as his Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Bilocation</hi> of Bodies; or ſuch as favours
<hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> as his Doctrine <hi>de Scientia media;</hi> or
ſuch as inclines to Superſtition, and the Diabolick
Art, as the Doctrine of Judiciary Aſtrology, and
particularly <hi>de Genituris,</hi> which, contrare to the
Example of all Chriſtian Schools, he inlarges upon
and Exemplifies; or ſuch as is pure incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Non-ſence, as when he ſays the <hi>Diagonal</hi> of
a Square is not really longer than the ſide; and
for his publick Appearances, his maintaining of
<hi>Theſes</hi> in the common School on the <hi>Saturdays,</hi>


                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:47542:53"/>
amounts to no more than giving of the Jeſuits an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to evident truths, <hi>viz.</hi> That the contrair is
the opinion of ſome Doctors, and conſequently
probable, and may be ſafely followed; and on the
laſt <hi>Saturday</hi> of <hi>March</hi> laſt in the hearing of all
the Maſters, and ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen
who were accidentally preſent, he ſtuck not to ſay
in expreſs words, That <hi>Deus non juſtè punit peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>
And always at theſe publick Diſputes he falls
out in ſuch paſſions, when any thing is reaſonably
urged againſt him, that the Students cannot forbear
to hiſs at him.</p>
               <p>5. Albeit, for the time the Viſitors be not troubled
with an Account of his groſs Hypocriſie, Covetouſneſs
and the Immoralities of his Life: Yet it is not amiſs
that they know his merits in relation to the preſent
Eſtabliſhed Government of Church and State; it's
true, he was bred Presbyterian, and did take all the
Oaths, and lies under all the Obligations that were at
thoſe times impoſed when he was bred, and firſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in publick Employment, from the year 1647 to
the year 1660. But it's as true, that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſcruple, he broke all theſe Bonds, took the
Declaration and all Oaths of courſe in King
<hi>Charles</hi>'s Reign, and conformed and complied as
much as any man. And when he came to be
Regent in the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he owned
his diſlike of the Students burning of the Pope in the
year 1680; and in the year 1681 he took and ſwore
the Oath of the Teſt; and again in the year 1685
in the late-King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, he ſwore the ſame
Oath again on his bended knees before the then
Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> His courting of the Popiſh
Prieſts was ſo often and barefac'd, that (beſide
his conniving at their ſeducing and perverting his
Scholars to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion) in the year 1687


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47542:53"/>
at the publick <hi>Laureation</hi> in the common School,
He, as a <hi>Praeſes,</hi> Invited, and had with him in the
Pulpit, Father <hi>Reid,</hi> as he called him, a Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
Fryar, and a trafficking Papiſt.</p>
               <p>After the Battel of <hi>Gillicrankie,</hi> he went to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
a Popiſh Lady on the Victory: And fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
this Summer he has averred that the Church
of <hi>England</hi> is the beſt conſtitute Church, and that
the <hi>Scots</hi> Epiſcopal Clergy are the honeſteſt Men
in the World. It's true, he will take all the Oaths
that can be put to him, but the Viſitors would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that he hath already broken all the Ingagements
by which he was tyed to the Presbyterian intereſt:
Neither can the Government ever be ſecure of him,
ſince beſide his practice, he teaches in his Notes,
That <hi>Poteſt dari Dominium duorum in ſolidum in unam
&amp; eandem rem per notabile aliquod tempus.</hi> So that
tho' he ſwear that King <hi>William</hi> is King <hi>de Jure,</hi>
yet, according to his Principles, King <hi>James</hi> may be
ſo too.</p>
