            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A COMPLEAT DISCOVERY OF THE State of Carolina, In the YEAR 1682.</head>
            <p>THE Diſcourſes of many Ingenious Travellers (who have lately ſeen this part of the <hi>Weſt Indies)</hi> have for Salubrity of Air, Fertility of Soyl, for the Luxuriant and Indulgent Bleſſings of Nature, juſtly rendred <hi>Carolina</hi> Famous.

to hazard their Lives, Families, and Fortunes, to the Mercy of Wind, Seas and Storms, to enjoy the Sweets of ſo deſirable a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Having ſpent near three Years Abroad, in which time I had a fair Opportunity of a Survey of great part of our Engliſh <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi> You my Worthy Friend, knowing in what Character I went abroad, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of my being at <hi>Carolina,</hi> did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligingly requeſt (that at Leiſure) I would collect ſuch Notices of my own whilſt there, with thoſe Remarques and Obſervations which I had learnt from the moſt Able and Ingenious Planters, who have had their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence on the place from its firſt being Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniz'd: You deſiring to be aſſured whether the true State of the Country did anſwer the Reports of Common Fame. Which in Compliance with, and in Obedience to your Commands, I have undertaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carolina</hi> derives her name either from our preſent Illuſtrious Monarch, under whoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

Since which, nor <hi>French,</hi> nor <hi>Spaniard</hi> have made any Attempt for its Re-Settlement. <hi>Carolina</hi> is the Northermoſt part of the ſpacious and pleaſant Province of <hi>Florida</hi>; it lies in the <hi>Northern</hi> temperate Zone, between the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Twenty Nine, and Thirty Six De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and Thirty Minutes: It's boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> with the Atlantick, or <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern,</hi> on the <hi>Weſt,</hi> with the Pacifick or <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi>

In <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> they have ſometimes Touches of Agues and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, but not violent, of ſhort continuance, and never Fatal. <hi>Engliſh</hi> Children there born, are commonly ſtrong and luſty, of ſound Conſtitutions, and freſh ruddy Complexions. The Seaſons are regularly diſpoſed according to Natures Laws; the Summer not ſo torrid, hot and burning as that of their <hi>Southern,</hi> nor the Winter ſo rigorouſly ſharp and cold, as that of their <hi>Northern</hi> Neighbours.

            <p>The Soil near the Sea, of a Mould Sandy, farther diſtant, more clayey, or Sand and Clay mixt; the Land lies upon a Level in fifty or ſixty Miles round, having ſcarce the leaſt Hill or Eminency. It's cloathed with odoriferous and fragrant Woods, flouriſhing in perpetual and conſtant Verdures, <hi>viz.</hi> the lofty Pine, the ſweet ſmelling <hi>Cedar</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> Trees, of both which are compoſed good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Boxes, Cheſts, Tables, Scrittores, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets.

Of <hi>Cedar</hi> there are many ſorts; this in <hi>Carolina</hi> is eſteemed of equal Goodneſs for Grain, Smell and Colour with the <hi>Bermudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Cedar,</hi> which of all the <hi>Weſt Indian</hi> is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt excellent; that in the <hi>Caribbe</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands

and <hi>Jamaica</hi> being of a courſer kind, Oyl and the Spirit of Wine penetrating it; but with this they make Heading for their Cask, which the ſharpeſt and moſt ſearching Liquors does not pierce. With the Berry of the Tree at <hi>Bermudaz,</hi> by Decoction, they make a very wholeſome and ſovereign Drink. This Tree in the Sacred Writ is famous, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> for their Stately Stature; but thoſe in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be of a low and humble height. The <hi>Saſſafraſs</hi> is a Medicinal Tree, whoſe Bark and Leaves yield a pleaſing Smell: It profits in all Diſeaſes of the Blood, and Liver, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in all Venereal and Scorbutick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. There are many other Fragrant ſmelling trees, the <hi>Myrtle, Bay</hi> and <hi>Lawrel,</hi> ſeveral Others to us wholly unknown. Fruit Trees there are in abundance of various and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent kinds, the Orange, Lemon, Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Fig and Almond. Of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fruits, the Apple, Pear, Plumb, Cherry, Quince,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97019:6"/>
Peach, a ſort of Medlar, and Cheſnut. Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut Trees there are of two or three ſorts; but the Black Wallnut for its Grain, is moſt eſteem'd: the Wild Wallnut, or Hiquery-Tree, gives the <hi>Indians,</hi> by boyling its Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, a wholeſome Oyl, from whom the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> frequently ſupply themſelves for their Kitchen uſes: It's commended for a good Remedy in Dolors, and Gripes of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; whilſt new it has a pleaſant Taſte; but after ſix Moneths, it decays and grows acid; I believe it might make a good Oyl, and of as general an uſe as that of the Olive, if it were better purified and rectified. The <hi>Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copin</hi> Tree bears a Nut not unlike the <hi>Hazle,</hi> the Shell is ſofter: Of the Kernel is made <hi>Chocolate,</hi> not much inferiour to that made of the <hi>Cacoa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Peach</hi> Tree in incredible Numbers grows Wild: Of the Fruit expreſs'd, the Planters compoſe a pleaſant refreſhing Liquor; the Remainder of the Fruit ſerves the Hogg and Cattle for Proviſion. The <hi>Mulberry
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97019:7"/>
Tree</hi> every-where amidſt the Woods grows wild: The Planters, near their Plantations, in Rows and Walks, plant them for Uſe, Ornament and Pleaſure: What I obſerved of this Fruit was admirable; the Fruit there, was full and ripe in the latter end of <hi>April</hi> and beginning of <hi>May,</hi> whereas in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> they are not ripe before the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> A Manufactory of Silk well encouraged might ſoon be accompliſht, conſidering the numerouſneſs of the Leaf for Proviſion, the clemency and moderateneſs of the Climate to indulge and nouriſh the Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm: To make tryal of its Succeſs, was the Intention of thoſe <hi>French Proteſtant Paſſengers</hi> tranſported thither in His Majeſties Frigat the <hi>Richmond</hi> being Forty Five the half of a greater Number deſign'd for that place; but their Deſign was too early anticipated: the Eggs which they brought with them being hatch'd at Sea, before we could reach the Land, the Worms for want of Proviſion were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely loſt and deſtroyed. The <hi>Olive Tree</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97019:7"/>
thrives there very well. Mr. <hi>James Colleton,</hi> Brother to Sir <hi>Peter,</hi> one of the Honourable Proprietors, brought an <hi>Olive Stick</hi> from <hi>Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> (one of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Iſlands) cut off at both Ends to <hi>Carolina,</hi> which put into the Ground, grew and proſpered exceedingly; which gave ſo great an Encouragement, that ſince I left the place, I hear that ſeveral more were brought there, there being great Hopes, that if the <hi>Olive</hi> be well improved, there may be expected from thence perhaps as good <hi>Oyl</hi> as any the World yields.</p>

               <hi>Vines</hi> of divers ſorts, bearing both Black and Gray <hi>Grapes,</hi> grow, climbing their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Trees, running and over-ſpreading their lower Buſhes: Five Kinds they have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſtinguiſh'd, three of which by <hi>Re-plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and if well cultivated, they own, will make very good <hi>Wine</hi>; ſome of which has been tranſported for <hi>England,</hi> which by the beſt Pallates was well approved of, and more is daily expected, 'tis not doubted, if the <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> as induſtriouſly proſecute the <hi>Propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97019:8"/>
of <hi>Vineyards</hi> as they have begun; but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina</hi> will in a little time prove a <hi>Magazine</hi> and <hi>Staple</hi> for <hi>Wines</hi> to the whole <hi>Weſt Indies</hi>; and to enrich their Variety, ſome of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors and Planters have ſent them the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and Excellenteſt <hi>Vines</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> viz. the <hi>Rheniſh, Clarret,</hi> the <hi>Muſcadel</hi> and <hi>Canary,</hi> &amp;c. His Majeſty to, improve ſo hopeful a Deſign, gave thoſe <hi>French</hi> we carried over their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage free for themſelves, <hi>Wives, Children Goods</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> they being moſt of them well experienced in the Nature of the <hi>Vine,</hi> from whoſe Directions doubtleſs the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have received and made conſiderable Advantages in their Improvements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trees</hi> for the Service of building Houſes and Shipping, beſides thoſe and many more which we have not nam'd; they have all ſuch as we in <hi>England</hi> eſteem Good, Laſting, and Serviceable, as the <hi>Oak</hi> of three ſorts, the <hi>White, Black</hi> and <hi>Live Oak,</hi> which for Toughneſs, and the Goodneſs of its Grain is much eſteemed: <hi>Elm, Aſh, Beech,</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar,</hi>

&amp;c Into the Nature, Qualities and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of their Herbs, Roots and Flowers, we had little time to make any curious Enquiry: This we were aſſured by many of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Planters, that they had Variety of ſuch whoſe <hi>Medicinal</hi> Vertues were rare and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. The <hi>China</hi> grows plentifully there, whoſe Root infus'd, yields us that pleaſant Drink, which we know by the Name of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Ale</hi> in <hi>England</hi>: in <hi>Medicinal</hi> Uſes it's far more excellent. Monſieur <hi>Tavernier,</hi> in his late Voyages to <hi>Perſia,</hi> obſerves that Nation, by the frequent uſe of Water in which this Root is boyl'd, are never troubled with the Stone or Gout: It mundifies and ſweetens the Blood: It's good in <hi>Fevers, Scurvy, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhaea,</hi> and the <hi>Lues Venerea.</hi> They have three ſorts of the <hi>Rattle-Snake Root</hi> which I have ſeen; the <hi>Comous</hi> or <hi>Hairy,</hi> the <hi>Smooth,</hi> the <hi>No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dous,</hi> or <hi>Knotted</hi> Root: All which are lactiferous, or yielding a <hi>Milkie Juice</hi>; and if I do not very much in my Obſervations err, the Leaves of all theſe Roots of a Heart
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97019:9"/>
had the exact Reſemblance: They are all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign againſt the Mortal Bites of that Snake, too frequent in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi>: In all <hi>Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Diſtempers,</hi> as <hi>Plague, Small Pox,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fevers,</hi> it's a Noble <hi>Specifick</hi>; when ſtung, they eat the Root, applying it to the Venemous Wound; or they boyl the Roots in Water; which drunk, fortifies and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borates the Heart, exciteing ſtrong and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sweats; by which endangered Nature is relieved, and the Poyſon carried off, and expelled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gardens</hi> as yet they have not much impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or minded, their Deſigns having other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe more profitably engaged them in ſettling and cultivating their <hi>Plantations</hi> with good Proviſions and numerous Stocks of Cattle; which two things by <hi>Planters</hi> are eſteemed the <hi>Baſis</hi> and <hi>Props</hi> of all New <hi>Plantations</hi> and <hi>Settlements</hi>; before which be well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed and performed, nothing to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe can be effected; and upon which all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, Manufactories,</hi> &amp;c. have their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97019:9"/>
Dependance. But now their <hi>Gardens</hi> begin to be ſupplied with ſuch <hi>European Plants</hi> and <hi>Herbs</hi> as are neceſſary for the Kitchen, <hi>viz. Potatoes, Lettice, Coleworts, Parſnip, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nip, Carrot</hi> and <hi>Reddiſh</hi>: Their Gardens alſo begin to be beautified and adorned with ſuch <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> which to the Smell or Eye are pleaſing and agreable, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Roſe, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, Carnation</hi> and <hi>Lilly.</hi> &amp;c. Their Proviſion which grows in the Field is chiefly <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, which produces a vaſt Increaſe, year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yielding Two plentiful Harveſts, of which they make wholeſome Bread, and good Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, which gives a ſtrong, ſound, and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diet; with Milk I have eaten it dreſs'd various ways: Of the Juice of the Corn, when green, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with <hi>Chocolet,</hi> aromatiz'd with <hi>Spices,</hi> make a rare Drink, of an excellent Delicacy. I have ſeen the <hi>Engliſh</hi> amongſt the <hi>Caribbes</hi> roaſt the green Ear on the Coals, and eat it with a great deal of Pleaſure: The <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Carolina</hi> parch the ripe Corn, then pound it to a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97019:10"/>
putting it in a Leathern Bag: When they uſe it, they take a little quantity of the Powder in the Palms of their Hands, mixing it with Water, and ſup it off: with this they will travel ſeveral days. In ſhort, it's a Grain of General Uſe to Man and Beaſt, many thouſands of both kinds in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> having from it the greater part of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. The <hi>American Phyſicians</hi> obſerve that it breeds good Blood, removes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens <hi>Oppellations</hi> and <hi>Obſtructions.</hi> At <hi>Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> they have lately invented a way of make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it good ſound Beer; but it's ſtrong and heady: By <hi>Maceration,</hi> when duly fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, a ſtrong Spirit like <hi>Brandy</hi> may be drawn off from it, by the help of an <hi>Alembick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pulſe they have of great Variety, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of what <hi>Europe</hi> yield, <hi>viz. Beans, Peaſe, Callavance, Figolaes,</hi> and <hi>Bonaviſt,</hi> &amp;c. but many other kinds proper to the place, and to us unknown: <hi>Green Peaſe</hi> at the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> at my being there, I eat as good as ever I did <hi>England. Strawberries Rasberries, Bill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:97019:10"/>
and <hi>Blackberries</hi> grow frequently up and down the Woods. <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax</hi> thrives exceeding well; there grows a ſort of wild Silk Pods, call'd <hi>Silk-Graſs,</hi> of which they may make fine and durable Linnen.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Wheat</hi> they have planted has been rather for Experiment and Obſervation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would be agreeable to the Soil and Climate, than for any ſubſtance for themſelves, or for Tranſportation abroad; what they have ſown, the Planters aſſured us grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding well; as alſo <hi>Barly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Linch</hi> an ingenious Planter, having whilſt we were there very good growing in his Plantation, of which he intended to make Malt for brewing of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Beer and Ale, having all Utenſils and Conveniencies for it. <hi>Tobacco</hi> grows very well; and they have of an excellent ſort, miſtaken by ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Smoakers for <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tobacco, and valued from 5 to 8 <hi>s.</hi> the Pound; but finding a great deal of trouble in the Planting and Cure of it, and the great Quantities which <hi>Virginia,</hi> and other
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97019:11"/>
of His Majeſties Plantations make, rendring it a Drug over all <hi>Europe</hi>; they do not much regard or encourage its Planting, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready before them better and more profitable Deſigns in Action. <hi>Tarr</hi> made of the reſinous Juice of the <hi>Pine</hi> (which boyl'd to a thicker Conſiſtence is Pitch) they make great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties yearly, tranſporting ſeveral Tuns to <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, Jamaica,</hi> and the <hi>Caribbe</hi> Iſlands. <hi>Indigo</hi> they have made, and that good: The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they have deſiſted I cannot learn. To conclude, there grows in <hi>Carolina</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Caſſiny,</hi> whoſe admirable and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Vertues are highly applauded and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled by <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Writers: It is the Leaves of a certain Tree, which boyl'd in Water (as we do <hi>Thea)</hi> wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enliven and envigorate the Heart, with genuine eaſie <hi>Sweats</hi> and <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations,</hi> preſerving the Mind free and ſerene, keeping the Body brisk, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and lively, not for an hour, or two but for as many days, as thoſe Authors
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97019:11"/>
report without any other Nouriſhment or Subſiſtance, which, if true, is really admirable; they alſo add, that none amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> but their great Men and Captains, who have been famous for their great Exploits of War and Noble Actions, are admitted to the uſe of this noble Bevaridge. At my being there I made Enquiry after it; but the Ignorance of the Planter did not inform me. <hi>Sponges</hi> growing on the Sandy Shoars, I have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good and large; for which <hi>Samos</hi> in times paſt was famous, ſuppoſed by the Ancients to be the only place in the World where they grew: a courſer ſort I have ſeen pull'd up by Fiſhers, fiſhing among the Rocks of the Iſland of <hi>Berbadoes. Ambergriſe</hi> is often thrown on their Shoars; a pretious Commodity to him who finds it, if <hi>Native,</hi> and pure in Worth and Value It ſurpaſſes Gold; being eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at 5 and 6 Pound the Ounce, iſ not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated. What it is I ſhall not decide, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to the Judgment of the more Learned, whether it be the Excrement of the <hi>Whale,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:97019:12"/>
becauſe ſometimes in diſſecting and opening their Bodies it's there diſcovered. I think as well it may be argued the Excrements of other Creatures, Birds and ſome Beaſts greedily deſireing and affecting it, eſpecially the <hi>Fox,</hi> who eating it, by Digeſtion it paſſes through his Body; after ſome Alteration it's again recover'd, and is that which we call <hi>Fox Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergriſe.</hi> Others, that it is a bitumious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ebullating or boiling up from the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea, and floating on the Surface of the Waters, is condenſed by the circumam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Air: of which Opinion is the Learned <hi>Sennertus.</hi> Some that it is a Plant of a viſcous oleaginous Body, really growing at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea, the ſwift and violent Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Waters in Storms cauſing an Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication or Evulſion of the Plant, forcing it to the adjacent Shoars; that its moſt plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully found after Storms is certain: if true, as an intelligent man informed me, who lived many years at the <hi>Bermudaz,</hi> and among the <hi>Behama</hi> Iſlands, who ſaw at the <hi>Behama</hi> a piece
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97019:12"/>
of <hi>Ambergriſe</hi> weighing thirty pound (for its bigneſs famous in thoſe Parts) having perfect and apparent Roots, equal to the Body in worth and goodneſs. Others, that it's the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid reſinous Tears of ſome odoriferous Tree, hanging over <hi>Seas</hi> or <hi>Rivers,</hi> coagulated in that Form which we find it. Dr. <hi>Trapham,</hi> an ingenious Phyſitian in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> differs lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from this laſt opinion, thinking it the Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Juice of ſome fragrant Plant which grows on Rocks near the Sea, whoſe Trunks broken by the rude and boyſterous Waves, emit that precious Liquor. In Medicinal and Phyſical uſes it has a high eſteem, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the richeſt Cordials, admirable in the languiſhes of the Spirit Faintings, and <hi>Deliquium</hi> of the Heart; given as the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to <hi>agonizing</hi> Perſons. In Perfumes of Linnen Wollen, Gloves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is none eſteemed more coſtly or precious.

            <p>The great encreaſe of their Cattel is rather

The <hi>Planter</hi> in <hi>Winter</hi> takes no care for their Proviſion, which is a great Advantage; the <hi>Northern</hi> Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions obliging the Planters to ſpend great part of their <hi>Summer</hi> to provide Fodder and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for their Cattle, to preſerve them from ſtarving in the <hi>Winter.</hi> The <hi>Cows</hi> the Year round brouzing on the ſweet Leaves growing on the Trees and Buſhes, or on the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Herbage</hi> growing underneath: They u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually call them home in the Evening for their Milk, and to keep them from running wild. <hi>Hogs</hi> find more than enough of Fruits in the <hi>Summer,</hi> and Roots and Nuts in the <hi>Winter</hi>; from the abundance of their Feeding, great numbers forſake their own Plantations, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wild in the Woods, the <hi>Tyger, Wolf,</hi> and <hi>wild Cat,</hi> by devouring them, oftentimes goes Share with the Planter; but when the Stock encreaſes and grows ſtrong, the older

ſurround the younger, and boldly oppoſe, and oftentimes attack their Invaders. Their <hi>Sheep</hi> bears good Wooll; the Ewes at a time often have 2 or 3 Lambs; they thrive very well, the Country being ſo friendly to their Natures, that it's obſerved, they are neither liable or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to any known Diſeaſe or Diſtemper. Of Beaſts bearing <hi>Furrs,</hi> they have great ſtore of Variety, whoſe Skins ſerve the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> for <hi>Cloathing</hi> and <hi>Bedding,</hi> and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> for many uſes, beſides the great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage made of them, by their being ſent for <hi>England.

out of the Sand immediately making their way towards the Water. At this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when they moſt uſually come aſhore, which is in <hi>April, May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> the Seamen or <hi>Turtlers,</hi> at ſome convenient diſtance watch their opportunity, getting between them and the Sea, turn them on their Backs, from whence they are unable ever to riſe, by which means the Seamen or Turtlers ſometimes turn 40 or 50 in a night, ſome of 2, 3, 400 weight: If they are far diſtant from the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor or Market to which they deſign to bring them, they kill, cutting them to pieces, which Salted, they Barrel: This is the way of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the <hi>Caymana</hi>'s, an Iſland lying to Leeward of <hi>Jamaica. Turtle,</hi> Barrel'd and Salted, if well condition'd, is worth from 18 to 25 ſhillings the Barrel. If near their Market or Harbor they bring them in Sloops alive, and afterwards keep them in Crauls, which is a particular place of Salt Water of Depth and Room for them to ſwim in, palliſado'd or ſtaked, in round above
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97019:17"/>
the Waters Surface, where, upon occaſion they take them out, and kill them, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to pieces, ſell their Fleſh for two pence or three pence the pound: the Belly, which they call the <hi>Callope</hi> of the Turtle, pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd and ſalted, or roaſted and baked, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Diſh, much eſteemed by our Nation in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi>: the reſt of the Fleſh boil'd, makes as good and nouriſhing Broath, as the beſt Capon in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially if ſome of the <hi>Eggs</hi> are mixt with it; they are ſome white, and others of a yellow or golden Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, in largeneſs not exceeding a Walnut, wrapt in a thin Skin or Membrane, ſweet in Taſte, nouriſhing and wholeſome: and of this property, that they never grow hard by boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the Liver is black; it freely opens and purges the Body: if little of it be eaten, it dies the Excrements of a deep black Colour: The Fat in Color inclines to a Sea Green; in Taſte it's ſweet and luſcious, equalling, if not ſurpaſſing the beſt Marrow, if freely eaten it deeply ſtains the Urine of its Color: It's of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97019:18"/>
a very penetrating piercing quality, highly comended in Strains and Aches: Of it the Turtlers oftentimes make an Oyl, which in Lamps burns much brighter and ſweeter than common Lamp or Train Oyl. In general, the Fleſh is commended for a good <hi>Antiſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butique</hi> and an <hi>Antivenereal</hi> Diet; many in the former, and ſome that have been far gone in <hi>Conſumptions,</hi> with the conſtant uſe alone of this Diet, have been thoroughly recovered and cured in 3 or 4 months. It hath 3 Hearts, by thin <hi>Pellicules</hi> only ſeparated, which has cauſed ſome to Philoſophize on its <hi>Amphibious Nature,</hi> alluding to thoſe <hi>participating</hi> and <hi>aſſimulating Qualities</hi> which it has to the reſt of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, it ſwiming like a Fiſh, laying <hi>Eggs</hi> like a Fowl, and feeding on Graſs like an Ox. This I am aſſured of, that after it's cut to pieces, it retains a Senſation of Life three times longer than any known Creature in the Creation: Before they kill them they are laid on their Backs, where hopeleſs of Relief, as if ſenſible of their future Condition, for ſome
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97019:18"/>
hours they mourn out their Funerals, the Tears plentifully flowing from their Eyes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with paſſionate Sobs and Sighs, in my Judgment nothing more like than ſuch who are ſurrounded and overwhelmed with Troubles, Cares and Griefs, which raiſes in Strangers both Pity and Compaſſion. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly ſix hours after the Butcher has cut them up and into pieces, mangled their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I have ſeen the <hi>Callope</hi> when going to be ſeaſoned, with pieces of their Fleſh ready to cut into Stakes, vehemently contract with great Reluctancy riſe againſt the Knife, and ſometimes the whole Maſs of Fleſh in a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tremulation and Concuſſion, to him who firſt ſees it ſeems ſtrange and admirable. There is farther to the <hi>Southward</hi> of <hi>Carolina,</hi> eſpecially about the <hi>Shoars</hi> and <hi>Rivers</hi> of <hi>Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola</hi> and <hi>Cuba</hi> a Fiſh in Nature ſomething like the former, call'd the <hi>Manacy</hi> or <hi>Sea-Cow,</hi> of an extraordinary Bigneſs, ſometimes of 1000 pound weight: It feeds on the Banks and Shoar ſides on the graſſy <hi>Herbage,</hi> like a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97019:19"/>
               <hi>Tortoiſe</hi>; but that which is more wonderful of this Creature is, that ſhe gives her young Ones Suck from her <hi>Duggs</hi>; ſhe is headed like a <hi>Cow,</hi> of a green Colour, her Fleſh by ſome eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt delicate in the World, ſweeter than the tendereſt <hi>Veal,</hi> ſold at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> where it's ſometimes brought for 6 <hi>d.</hi> the pound: It hath a Stone in the Head which is a gallant Remedy againſt the Pains and Dolors of the Stone; ſo are the <hi>Bones</hi> of its Body to provoke Urine, when pulveriz'd and exhibited in convenient Liquors. Its Skin makes excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Whips for Horſes, if prudently us'd, which are very ſerviceable and laſting; with one of theſe <hi>Manaty</hi> Strapps, I have ſeen a Bar of Iron cut and dented: It cuts ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and deep, that by the Publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> Maſters are forbidden and prohibited with it to ſtrike their White Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>There is in the mouth of their Rivers, or in Lakes near the Sea a Creature well known in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> call'd the <hi>Alligator</hi> or <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile,</hi>

River, both for its Strength and Commerce It's very commodiouſly ſcituated from many other Navigable Rivers that lie near it on which the Planters are ſeated; by the Advantage of Creeks, which have a Communication from one great River to another; at the Tide or Ebb the Planters may bring their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to the Town as to the Common Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and Magazine both for Trade and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. The Town is regularly laid out into large and capacious Streets, which to Buildings is a great Ornament and Beauty.
