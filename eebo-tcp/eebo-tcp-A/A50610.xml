         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Apologetical Defence OF FERNAND MENDEZ PINTO HIS HISTORY.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F it be true that Authors do render themselvs commendable by their Works, there is no doubt, but that <hi>Fernand Mendez Pinto</hi> hath by this same of his justly acquired such reputation, as will make him be esteemed for ever. He was a man of a strong wit, and sound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and indued with a most rare, and extraordinary memory, as appears in the Relation of his Voyages and Adventures, which suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently testifie how far he excelled therein, retaining in his remembrance an infinitie of such strange and wonderful things, (whereof to his cost he was for the most part an eye witness) as many great Personages of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> took no little delight in hearing him recount them; especially <hi>Philip</hi> the second King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times spent many houres in discoursing with him there about, which question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he would never have done, being a Prince, in the opinion of all the world, of a most exact and profound judgment, had he not been verily perswaded that what he delivered was true. Nevertheless since there may be some who in regard of the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious things which he delivers, wil seem to give no credit thereunto; I have held it very necessary to cite here many several authentick Authors, that in their writings have confirmed the verity of his Narrations, as followeth.</p>

               </gap> my first years, I find that I have a great deal of reason to complain of Fortune, for that she seemeth to have taken a particular care to persecute me, and to make me feel that which is most insupportable in her, as if her glory had no other foundation then her cruelty. For not content to have made me be born, and to live miserably in my Country during my youth, she conducted me, notwithstanding the fear I had of the dangers that menaced me, to the <hi>East Indiaes,</hi> where in stead of the relief which I went thither to seek, she made me find an increase of my pains, according to the increase of my age. Since then it hath pleased God to deliver me from so many dangers, and to protect me from the fury of that adverse Fortune, for to bring me into a Port of safety and assurance, I see that I have not so much cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to complain of my Travels past, as I have to render him thanks for the benefits which until now I have received of him, seeing that by his divine bounty he hath preserved my life, to the end I might have means to leave this rude and unpolished Discourse unto my children for a memorial and an inheritance. For my intention is no other but to write it for them, that they may behold what strange fortunes I have run for the space of one and twenty years, during the which I was thirteen times a captive, and seventeen times sold in the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> in <hi>Tartaria,</hi> in <hi>Madagascar,</hi> in <hi>Sumatra,</hi> and in divers other Kingdoms and Provinces of that Oriental Archipalage upon the Confines of <hi>Asia,</hi> which the <hi>Chineses, Siames, Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereby men, for the time to come, may take example, and a resolution not to be discouraged for any crosses that may arrive unto them in the course of their lives. For no disgrace of Fortune ought to esloign us never so little from the duty which we are bound to render unto God, because there is no adversity, how great soever, but the nature of man may well undergo it, being favored with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50126:9"/>
the assistance of Heaven. Now that others may help me to praise the Lord Almighty for the infinite mercy he hath shewed me, without any regard to my sins, which I confess were the cause and original of all my mis-fortunes, and that from the same divine Power I received strength and courage to resist them, escaping out of so many dangers with my life saved, I take for the beginning of my Voyage the time which I spent in this Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and say, That after I had lived there till I was about eleven or twelve years old in the misery and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of my fathers house within the Town of <hi>Monte-mor Ovelho,</hi> an Uncle of mine, desirous to advance me to a better fortune then that whereunto I was reduced at that time, and to take me from the caresses and cockering of my Mother, brought me to this City of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where he put me into the service of a very honorable Lady: To the which he was carried out of the hope he had, that by the favor of her self and her friends he might attain to his desire for my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, and this was in the same year, that the funeral pomp of the deceased King <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> of happy memory was celebrated at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> namely Saint <hi>Luces</hi> day, the thirteenth of <hi>December,</hi> 1521. which is the furthe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> contrary to that which he had promised to himself in favor of me; For having been in the service of this Lady about a year and an half, an accident befell me, that cast me into manifest peril of my life, so that to save my self I was constrained to abandon her house with all the speed that possibly I could. Flying away then in very great fear, I arrived before I was aware at the Ford of <hi>Pedra,</hi> which is a small Port so called; There I found a Carvel of <hi>Alfama,</hi> that was laden with the horses and stuff of a Lord, who was going to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuval,</hi> where at that instant King <hi>Ioana</hi> the Third kept his Court by reason of a great plague that raigned in divers parts of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Perceiving then that this Carvel was ready to put to Sea, I imbarqued my self in her, and departed the next day. But alas! a little after we had set sail, having gotten to a place named <hi>Cezmibra,</hi> we were set upon by a <hi>French</hi> Pirate, who having boarded us, caused fifteen or sixteen of his men to leap into our Vessel, who finding no resistance made themselves Masters of her: Now after they had pillaged every one of us, they emptied all the Merchandise where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall ours was laden, which amounted to above six thousand duckets, into their ship, and then sunk her; so that of seventeen of us that remained alive, not so much as one could escape slavery, for they clapped us up all bound hand and foot under hatches, with an intent to go and sell us at <hi>La Rache</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> whither also, as we found by being amongst them, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Arms to the <hi>Mahometans</hi> in way of Trade; for this purpose they kept us thirteen days together, continually whipping us; but at the end thereof it fortuned that about Sun set they discovered a ship, unto which they gave chase all the night, following her close, like old Pirates long used to such Theeveries; Having fetcht her up by break of day, they gave her a volley of thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sters of her, killing six <hi>Portugals,</hi> and ten or eleven slaves. This was a goodly Vessel, and belonged to a <hi>Portugal</hi> Merchant of the Town of <hi>Conde,</hi> named <hi>Silvestre Godinho,</hi> which divers other Merchants of <hi>Lisbon</hi> had laden at Saint <hi>Tome</hi> with great store of Sugar and Slaves; In such sort that those poor people seeing themselves thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> taken and robbed fell to lament their loss, which they esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted to be forty thousand Duckets. Whereupon these Pirates, having gotten so rich a booty, changed their design for going to <hi>la Rache,</hi> and bent their course for the Goast of <hi>France,</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them such of ours for slaves, as they judged fit for the service of their Navigation. The remainder of us they left at night in the Road, at a place called <hi>Melides,</hi> where we were landed miserably naked, our bodies covered with nothing but with the stripes of the lashes which so cruelly we had received the days before. In this pitiful case we arrived the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Saint <hi>Iago de Cacen,</hi> where we were relieved by the inhabitants of the place, especially by a Lady, that was there at that time, named <hi>Donna Beatrix,</hi> daughter to the Earl of <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nova,</hi> and wife to <hi>Alonso Perez Pantoia,</hi> Commander and grand Provost of the Town. Now after the sick and wounded were recovered, each of us departed, and got him where he hoped to find best assistance; for my self, poor wretch, I went with six or seven that accompanied me in my misery to <hi>Setuval:</hi> Thither I was no sooner come, but my good fortune placed me in the service of <hi>Francisco de Faria,</hi> a Gentleman belonging to the great Commander of Saint <hi>Iago,</hi> who in recompence of four years service, that I did him, put me to the said Commander to wait on him in his chamber, which I performed for an year and an half after. But in regard the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, which was given at that time in Noble-mens houses, was so small as I was not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50126:9"/>
able to live on it, necessity constrained me to quit my Master, with a design to imbarque my self by his favor to go to the <hi>Indiaes</hi>; for that I thought was the best way I could take to free me of my poverty. So albeit I were but meanly accommodated I imbarqued my self notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, submitting my self to whatsoever fortune should arrive unto me in those far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, either good or bad.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. My departure from Portugal for the Indiaes, and my imbarquing there for the Straight of Mecqua.</head>
            <p>IT was in the year 1537. and the eleventh of <hi>March,</hi> that I parted from this Kingdom in a Fleet of five Ships, whereof there was no General;<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> for each of those Vessels was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by a particular Captain: For example, in the ship named the Queen, commanded <hi>Don Pedro de Silva,</hi> surnamed the Cock, son to the Admiral <hi>Don Vasco de Gama</hi>; In the ship, called S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Rock, commanded <hi>Don Fernando de Lima,</hi> son to <hi>Diego Lopez de Lima,</hi> grand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost of the Town of <hi>Guimaranes,</hi> who dyed valiantly in defence of the Fortress of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> whereof he was Captain the year following, 1538. In the S. <hi>Barba,</hi> commanded <hi>Don Fernando de Lima,</hi> who was to be Governor of the Town of <hi>Chaul</hi>; Of that, which was called the <hi>Flower of the Sea, Lope Vaz Vagado</hi> was Captain; And in the fifth and last ship, named <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lega,</hi> commanded <hi>Martimde Freitas,</hi> born in the Isle of <hi>Madera,</hi> who the same year was slain at <hi>Damao,</hi> together with five and thirty men that followed him. These Vessels, sailing different ways, arrived at length at a good Port called <hi>Mozambique</hi>; There we met with the S. <hi>Michel,</hi> that wintered there, and was commanded by <hi>Duart Tristao,</hi> who parted thence richly laden for to return into <hi>Portugal</hi>; Howbeit I beleeve she was taken, or suffered ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, as it happens but too often in this Voyage to the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> for he was never heard of since. After our five Vessels were equipped with all that was necessary for them, and ready to set sail from <hi>Mozambique,</hi> the Lievtenant of the Fortress, called <hi>Vincent Pegado,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Captains of the said five ships a Mandate from the Governor, named <hi>Nunho de Cunha,</hi> whereby he expresly commanded that all <hi>Portugal</hi> ships, which did arrive in that Port this year, should go to <hi>Diu,</hi> and leave their men there for the guard of the Fortress, because of the fear they were in of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Army, which was every hour expected in the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> by reason of the death of <hi>Sultan Bandur</hi> King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> whom the said Governor had put to death the Summer before. In regard this affair was of great importance, it was the cause that all the Captains assembled together to deliberate thereupon; At length to meet with the present ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity they concluded, that three of those five ships, appertaining to the King, should go to <hi>Diu,</hi> conformable to the contents of the said Mandate, and that the other two, which belonged to particular Merchants, should pursue their course to <hi>Goa:</hi> The Kings three ships sailing to <hi>Diu,</hi> and the other two Merchants towards <hi>Goa,</hi> it pleased God to conduct them safe thither. Now as soon as the Kings three ships came to the mouth of the River of the Port of <hi>Diu,</hi> which fell on the fifth of <hi>September</hi> the same year, 1538. <hi>Antonio de Silv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ra,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Louys Silvera,</hi> Earl of <hi>Sortelha,</hi> who was Captain there at that time, gave them all the testimony that possibly he could of the joy he took at this their arrival; For proof whereof he bestowed liberally on every one, keeping a set table for above seven hundred persons which they brought along with them, besides his secret rewards, and extraordinary gifts, whereby he supplyed the necessities they had suffered during their Voyage. Whereupon the Soldiers considering how this Captain entreated them very royally, that he payed them before-hand, distributed their pay and munition unto them with his own hands, caused the sick to be carefully tended, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself most ready to assist every one, it so wrought upon them, that of their own accord they offered to stay there for to serve him, being no way constrained thereunto, as they use to be in those Countries in all the Fortresses which expect a siege. This done, as soon as the three ships had sold the Merchandise they had brought, they set sail for <hi>Goa,</hi> carrying none with them but the Officers of the Vessels, and some Sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Seventeen days after we were arrived at the Fortress of <hi>Diu,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> where at that time two Foists were ready prepared to go to the Streight of <hi>Mecqua,</hi> for to discover, and find out the design of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Army, whose coming was greatly feared in the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> because one of those
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50126:10"/>
Foists was commanded by a Captain that was a great friend of mine, who gave me good hope of the Voyage he was bound for, I imbarqued my self with him; Relying then on the promises which the Captain made me, that by his favor and means I should quickly be rich, the only thing in the world that I most desired, and suffering my self to be deceived by my hopes, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that I was already Master of great wealth, never considering how vain and uncertain the promises of men are, and that I could not reap much benefit by the Voyage I was going to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, by reason it was dangerous, and unseasonable for Navigation in that Country. Now being departed from <hi>Diu,</hi> we sailed in a time full of storms, because it was about the end of Winter, which seemed to begin anew, so impetuous were the winds, and so great was the rain: Nevertheless, how violent soever the Tempest was, and dark the weather, we letted not to discover the Isles of <hi>Curia, Muria,</hi> and <hi>Avedalcuria,</hi> at the sight whereof we thought our selves quite lost, and without hope of life. Whereupon to decline the danger we turned the prow of our Vessel to the South-east, knowing no other mean then that to avoyd shipwrack; But by good fortune for us, it pleased God, that we let fall an anchor at the point of the Island of <hi>Socotora</hi>; there we presently anchored, a league below the place, where <hi>Don Francisco d' Almeyda</hi> caused a Fortress to be built in the year 1507. when he came from <hi>Portugal,</hi> as the first Victory that ever was in the <hi>Indiaes.</hi> In the said place we took in fresh water, and some provision of Victuals, that we bought of the Christians of the Country, which are the descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of those, whom the Apostle S. <hi>Thomas</hi> converted in those parts. Being refreshed thus, we parted from thence with a purpose to enter the <hi>Straight,</hi> so that after we had sailed nine days with a favorable wind we found our selves right against <hi>Mazua</hi>; There about Sun set we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scryed a sail at Sea, whereunto we gave so hard chace, that before the first watch of the night we came up close to her, and then to satisfie the desire we had for to learn something of the Captain by gentleness touching the <hi>Turkish</hi> Army, we demanded of him whether it was parted from <hi>Sues,</hi> or whether he had not met with it in any place; and that we might be the better informed we spake aloud to all those that were in the ship. But in stead of answer, without speaking a word, and in contempt of us, they gave us a dozen pieces of Ordnance, whereof, five were small, and the other seven, field Pieces, together with good store of Musquet shot; And withall, in a kind of jollity, and as it were beleeving that we were already theirs, they made all the ayr about resound again with their confused cries; After this, to brave and terrifie us the more, they flourished a many flags and streamers up and down, and from the top of their poop they brandished a number of naked Scymitars, commanding us with great threatening to come aboard and yield our selves unto them. At the first view of so many Rhodomontades and bravings we were in some doubt and amaze, which caused the Captains of our Foists to call the Soldiers to Councel for to know what they should do, and the conclusion was to continue shooting at them till the next morning, that so by day-light they might be the better fought withall and invested, it being agreed upon of all sides that they were not to be let go unpunished for their presumption: Which accordingly was performed, and all the rest of the night we gave them chace, plying them with our Ordnance. So morning come, their ship being shot through and through in many places, and cruelly battered all over, they rendred themselves into our hands. In the incounter there were threescore and four of their men killed, and of fourscore that remained, the most part, seeing themselves reduced to extremity, cast themselves into the Sea, choosing rather there to be drowned, then to be burnt in their ship with the artificial fires that we had hurled into her, so that of all the fourscore there escaped but five very sore hurt, whereof one was the Captain. This same, by force of torture, whereunto he was exposed by the Command of our two Captains, confessed that he came from <hi>Iudaa,</hi> and that the <hi>Turkish</hi> Army was already departed from <hi>Sues,</hi> with a design to take in <hi>Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>air <hi>Greekish Mahumetan,</hi> that was then his wife, for the love of her he had abjured Christianity, and embraced the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Our Captains much amazed hereat, gently perswaded him to acquit this abominable belief, and become a Christian again, whereunto the wicked Caytiff made answer with a brutish obstinacy, that at no hand he would yield to forsake his Law, shewing himself so hardened in the resolution

to continue therein, as if he had been born in it, and never had profest any other. By these speeches of his, the Captains, perceiving there was no hope of recalling him from his damnable error, caused him to be bound hand and foot, and so with a great stone tyed about his neck to be cast alive into the Sea, sending him to participate with the torments of his <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and to be his companion in the other world, as he had been his confident in this. This Infidel being executed in this sort, we put the other prisoners into one of our Foists, and then sunk their Vessel with all the goods that were in her, which consisted most in packs of stained Cloths, whereof we had no use, and a few pieces of Chamlet that the Soldiers got to make them apparel.</p>

The cause of that his abode was to deliver a Letter from the said <hi>Henrico,</hi> as accordingly he did to the Captains of our Foi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The first night we lay at a very fair Monastery, called <hi>Satilgaon</hi>; The next day before the Sun rose we travelled along by a River, and by that time we had rode five leagues we arrived at a place, named <hi>Bitonte,</hi> where we spent that night in a Convent of religious persons, dedicated to S. <hi>Michael</hi>; there we were very well entertained both by the Prior, and the Fryers: A little after our arrival, the son of <hi>Bernagais,</hi> Governor of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> a very proper and courteous Gentleman, about seventeen years old, came to see us, accompanied with thirty men, all mounted upon Mules, and himself on a horse fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished after the <hi>Portugal</hi> manner; the furniture was of Purple Velvet trimmed with Gold fringe, which two years before the Governor <hi>Nuno de Cunha</hi> sent him from the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> by one <hi>Lopez Chanoca,</hi> who was afterwards made a slave at <hi>Gran Cario,</hi> whereof this young Prince being advertised, he presently dispatched away a <hi>Iewish</hi> Merchant of <hi>Azabiba</hi> to redeem him, but as ill fortune would he dyed before the Jew could get thither, which so grieved this Prince when he understood of it, as the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

four of his servants to accompany us, who during our Voyage entertained us every where very sumptuously. That day our lodging was at a goodly place, called <hi>Betenigus,</hi> which signifies a royal house, and in truth it was not without reason so named, for on whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever part one cast an eye it was invironed with gallant high Trees for three leagues about, nor is it to be credited how pleasing this Wood was, for that it was composed all of Cedars, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres, Palm, Date Trees, and Cocos, like to those in the <hi>Indiaes</hi>; Here we past the night with all kind of contentment; In the morning we proceeded on our journey, and travelling after five leagues a day we past over a great Plain, all full of goodly Corn; Then we arrived at a Mountain, named <hi>Vangaleu,</hi> inhabited by Jews, which were very white and handsom; Two days and an half after we came to a good Town, called <hi>Fumbau,</hi> not above two leagues distant from the Fort of <hi>Gileytor,</hi> there we found <hi>Barbosa,</hi> and the forty <hi>Portugals</hi> aforesaid, who received us with great demonstrations of joy, but not without shedding of some tears, for though they lived there at their ease, and were absolute Masters of all the Country, as they said, yet the consideration how they were as men banished from their Country into this place, did very much trouble them.</p>
            <p>Now because it was night when we arrived, and that we had all need of rest, <hi>Barbosa</hi> was of the opinion that we should not see the Emperors Mother till the next morning, which was a Sunday, the fourth of <hi>October</hi>; that come, and we well refreshed, we went, accompanied with <hi>Barbosa</hi> and his forty <hi>Portugals,</hi> to the Princesses Palace, where we found her at Mass in her Chappel: A while after being advertised of our arrival, she caused us to be admitted into her presence; Whereupon we fell on our knees before her, and with all kind of humility kissed the Ventilow that she held in her hand; To these submissions we adjoyned many other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies according to their fashion, conformable to the instructions we had taken from the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> that conducted us thither. She received us with a smiling countenance, and to testifie how much she was pleased with our coming; <hi>Verily,</hi> said she, <hi>you cannot imagine how glad I am to see you, that are right Christians, for it hath been a thing which I have always as much desired, as a fair garden enameled with flowers doth the mornings dew, wherefore you are most welcome come, and may your entrance into my house be as propitious, as that of the vertuous Queen</hi> Helena<hi>'s was into blessed Ierusalem.</hi> Herewith she made us to sit down upon ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, not above five or six paces distant from her; Then shewing her self exceedingly contented, she questioned us about certain matters, of which, she assured us, that she very much longed to be satisfied: First she asked us the name of our holy Father the Pope, also how many Kings there were in Christendom, and whether any of us had ever been in the holy Land; whereupon she much condemned the Christian Princes, for their neglect and want of care in seeking to ruine the power of the <hi>Turk,</hi> who, she said, was the common Enemy of them all. Likewise she would know of us whether the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was great in the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> what Forts he had there, in what places they were seated, and how defended. She made us many other like demands, to the which we answered the best we could for to content her; whereupon she dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed us, and we returning to our lodging, continued there nine days, which we spent in waiting on this Princess, with whom we had much discourse on several subjects: That Term expired, we went to take our leaves of her, and in kissing of her hands she seemed to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what troubled at our departure. <hi>Truly,</hi> said she, <hi>it grieves me that you will be gone so soon, but since there is no remedy, I wish your Voyage may be so prosperous, that at your arrival in the Indiaes you may be as well received by yours, as the Queen of</hi> Sheba <hi>was heretofore by King</hi> Solomon <hi>in the admirable Palace of his greatness.</hi> Now before we departed she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on us twenty four <hi>Oquea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In his Company he had a certain <hi>Cacis,</hi> who was <hi>Moulana,</hi> the chiefest Sacerdotal dignity, and because he had been a little before in pilgrimage at the Temple of their Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> in <hi>Mecca,</hi> he was held by all the people for a very holy man: This Impostet rode up and down the Town in a triumphant Charret, covered all over with Silk Tapestry, and with a deal of Ceremony blessed the people as he went along, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to render all possible thanks unto their Prophet for the Victory, which <hi>Solyman Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As soon as they arrived at this place, we nine that remained alive were set on shore, tyed altogether with a great chain, and amongst us was the <hi>Abissin</hi> Bishop, so pitifully wounded that he dyed the next day, and in his end shewed the repentance of a true Christian, which very much encouraged and comforted us. In the mean time all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that were assembled about us, hearing that we were the Christians which were taken Captives, being exceedingly transported with choller, fell to beating of us in that cruel manner, as for my own part I never thought to have escaped alive out of their hands, whereunto they were especially incited by the wicked <hi>Cacis,</hi> who made them believe that they should obtain the more favor and mercy from their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the worse they intreated us. Thus chained all together, and persecuted by every one, we were led in triumph over all the Town, where nothing was heard but acclamations and shouts, intermingled with a world of musick, as well of instruments, as voyces. Moreover, there was not a woman, were she never so retired, that came not forth then to see us, and to do us some outrage; for from the very least children to the oldest men, all that beheld us pass by cast out of the windows and balcons upon us pots of piss, and other filth, in contempt and derision of a name of a Christian, wherein every one strived to be most forward, in regard their cursed Priest continued still preaching unto them, that they should gain remission of their sins by abusing us. Having been tormented in this sort until the evening, they went and layd us bound as we were in a dark Dungeon, where we remained seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, exposed to all kind of misery, having no other victual all that time, but a little oatmeal, which was distributed to us every morning to serve us all the day: Sometimes they gave us the same measure in dry Peason a little soaked in water, and this was all the meat we had.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 1.</note>THe next day, in regard that we had been so miserably moiled, and our hurts, that were great, but ill looked unto, of us nine there dyed two, whereof one was named <hi>Nuno Delgado,</hi> and the other <hi>Andre Borges,</hi> both of them men of courage, and of good families. The Jaylor, which in their language is called <hi>Mocadan,</hi> repairing in the morning to us, and finding our two companions dead, goes away in all haste therewith to acquaint the <hi>Gauzil,</hi> which is as the Judg with us, who came in person to the prison, attended by a great many of Officers, and other people; Where having caused their irons to be striken off, and their feet to be tyed together with a rope, he commanded them so to be dragged from thence clean through the Town, where the whole multitude, to the very children, pursued and palted them with staves and stones, until such time as being wearied with harrying those poor bodies in such fashion, they cast them all battered to pieces into the Sea. At last we seven, that were left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, were chained all together, and brought forth into the publique place of the Town, to be sold to them that would give most: There all the people being met together, I was the first that was put to sale; whereupon, just as the Cryer was offering to deliver me unto whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would buy me, in comes that very <hi>Cacis Moulana,</hi> whom they held for a Saint, with ten or eleven other <hi>Cacis</hi> his Inferiors, all Priests like himself of their wicked Sect, and addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his speech to <hi>Heredrin Sofo,</hi> the Governor of the Town, who sate as President of the Portsale, he required him to send us, as an alms, unto the Temple of <hi>Mecqua,</hi> saying, that he was upon returning thither, and having resolved to make that pilgrimage in the name of all the people, it were not fit to go thither without carrying some offering to the Prophet <hi>Noby,</hi> (so they termed their <hi>Mahomet,</hi>) a thing, said he, that would utterly displease <hi>Razaadat Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lana,</hi> the Chief Priest of <hi>Medina Talnab,</hi> who without that would grant no kind of grace or pardon to the Inhabitants of this Town, which by reason of their great offences stood in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream need of the favor of God, and of his Prophet.</p>
            <p>The Governor having heard the <hi>Cacis</hi> speak thus, declared unto him that for his particular he had no power to dispose with any part of the booty, and that therefore he should apply himself to <hi>Solyman Dragut</hi> his Son-in-law, who had made us slaves, so that in right it appertained only unto him to do with us as he pleased; and I do not think, added he, that he will contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict so holy an intention as this is. Thou hast reason for it, answered the <hi>Cacis,</hi> but withall thou must know, that the things of God, and the alms that are done in his name, lose their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and force, when they are sifted through so many hands, and turmoiled with such humane opinions, for which very cause seldom doth any divine resolution follow thereupon, especially in a subject such as this is, which thou mayst absolutely dispose of, as thou art soveraign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of this people: Moreover, as there is no body can be displeased therewith, so I do not see how it can bring thee any discontent. For besides that, this demand is very just, it is also most agreeable to our Prophet <hi>Noby,</hi> who is the absolute Lord of this prize, in regard the Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory came solely from his holy hand, though with as much falshood as malice thou goest about to attribute the glory of it to the valor of thy Son-in law, and the courage of his Soldiers. At this instant a <hi>Ianizary</hi> was present, Captain of one of the three Gallies that took us, a man that for his exceeding valor was in great esteem amongst them, called <hi>Copa Geynal,</hi> who netled with that which he heard the <hi>Cacis</hi> speak, so much in contempt both of himself, and the rest of the Soldiers, that had carried themselves very valiantly in the fight with us, returned him this answer. Certainly you might do better for the Salvation of your Soul, to distribute some part of the excessive riches you possess amongst these poor Soldiers, then seek with feigned speeches, full of hypocrisie and deceit, to rob them of these slaves, which have cost the lives of so many brave men, their fellows in arms, and have been dearly bought by us that survive, even with our dearest blood, as the wounds we have upon us can but two well witness; so can it not be said of your Cabayage (a Sacerdotal Robe after their fashion,) which for all it sits so trim and neat upon you, covers a pernicious habit you have of purloyning other mens estates from them: Wherefore I would wish you to desist from the damnable plot you have layd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the absolute Masters of this Prize, whereof you shall not have so much as a token, and

            <p>This <hi>Cacis Moulana</hi> having received so bold an answer from this Captain, found it very rude, and hard of digestion, which made him in bitter terms, and voyd of all respects, exceedingly to blame the Captain, and the Soldiers that were there present, who, as well <hi>Turks</hi> as <hi>Saracens,</hi> being much offended with his ill language, combined together and mutined against him, and the rest of the people, in whose favor he had spoken so insolently; nor could this mutiny be appeased by any kind of means, though the Governor of the Town, Father-in-law to the said <hi>Solyman Dragut,</hi> together with the Officers of Justice, did all that possibly they could. In a word, that I may not stand longer upon the particulars of this affair, I say, that from this small mutiny did arise so cruel and enraged a contention, as it ended not but with the death of six hundred persons, of the one and the other side: But at length the Soldiers party prevailing, they pillaged the most part of the Town, especially the said <hi>Cacis Moulana</hi>'s house, killing seven wives and nine children that he had, whose bodies together with his own were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, and cast into the Sea with a great deal of cruelty. In the same manner they intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that belonged unto him, not so much as giving life to one that was known to be his. As for us seven <hi>Portugals,</hi> which were exposed to sale in the publique place, we could find out no better expedient to save our lives, then to return into the same hole, from whence we came, and that too without any Officer of Justice to carry us thither; neither did we take it for a small favor that the Jaylor would receive us into the prison. Now this Mutiny had not ceased but by the authority of <hi>Solyman Dragut,</hi> General of the Gallies aforesaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For this man with very gentle words gave an end to the sedition of the people, and pacified the Mutiners, which shews of what power courtesie is, even with such as are altogether ignorant of it. In the mean time <hi>Heredrin Sopho,</hi> Governor of the Town, came off but ill from this hurly burly, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that in the very first incounter he had one of his arms almost cut off. Three days after this disorder was quieted we were led all seven again to the Market place, there to be sold with the rest of the booty, which consisted of our Stuff, and Ordnance, that they had taken in our Foists, and were sold at a very easie rate: For my self, miserable that I was, and the most wretched of them all, Fortune, my sworn enemy, made me fall into the hands of a Greek renegado, whom I shall detest as long as I have a day to live, because that in the space of three Months I was with him, he used me so cruelly, that becoming even desparate, for that I was not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the evil he did me, I was seven or eight times upon the point to have poysoned my self, which questionless I had done, if God of his infinite mercy and goodness had not diverted me from it, whereunto I was the rather induced to make him lose the mony he payd for me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was the most covetous man in the world, and the most inhumane, and cruellest enemy to the name of a Christian. But at the end of three Months it pleased the Almighty to deliver me out of the hands of this Tyrant, who for fear of losing the mony I cost him, if I should chance to make my self away, as one of his neighbors perswaded him I would, telling him that he had discovered so much by my countenance, and manner of behavior, wherefore in pity of me he counselled him to sell me away, as he did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There, by the advice of the Captains, coasting along by the Land for to learn some news, we descryed a great number of fires all that night, also at times we heard divers Pieces of Ordnance discharged, which very much troubled us, by reason we could not imagine what those fires, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

During this incertainty our best advice was, to sail the rest of the night with as little cloth as might be, until that on the next morning by the favor of day light we perceived a great many sails, which invironed the Fort on all sides. Some affirmed that it was the Governor newly come from <hi>Goa</hi> to make peace for the death of <hi>Sultan Bandur,</hi> King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> that was slain a little before. Others said that it was the Infant, Brother to the King <hi>Dom Iovan,</hi> lately arrived there from <hi>Portugal,</hi> because he was every day expected in the <hi>Indiaes.</hi> Some thought that it was the <hi>Pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These Gallies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come forth in this sort, turned their prows towards us in such a couragious and confident manner, that by their sailing we presently judged them to be <hi>Turks</hi>; Which we no sooner knew to be so indeed, but we clapt on all our cloth, for to avoyd them, and to get into the main Sea, not without exceeding fear, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These five Gallies having observed our flight, took a resolution to pursue us, and chased us till night, at which time it pleased God that they tacked about, and returned to the Army from whence they came. Seeing our selves freed from so great a danger we went joyfully on, and two days after arrived at the Town of <hi>Chaul,</hi> where our Captain and the Merchants only landed for to visit the Captain of the Fort, named <hi>Simon Guedez,</hi> unto whom they reported that which had befallen them. Assuredly, said he, you are very much bound to give God thanks for delivering you from one of the greatest perils that ever you were in, for without his assistance it had been impossible for you ever to have declined it, or to tell me of it with such joy as now you do: Thereupon he declared unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Army they had incountred was the very same, which had held <hi>Antonio de Silveyra</hi> twenty days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether besieged, being composed of a great number of <hi>Turks,</hi> whereof <hi>Solyman</hi> the <hi>Bassa,</hi> Vice-roy of <hi>Caire,</hi> was General, and that those Sails they had seen, were eight and fifty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies great and small, each of which carried five Pieces of Ordnance in her prow, and some of them were Pieces of Battery, besides eight other great Vessels, full of <hi>Turks,</hi> that were kept in reserve to succor the Army, and supply the places of such as should be killed; Moreover he added, that they had great abundance of victuals, amongst the which there was twelve Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisks. This news having much amazed us, we rendered infinite praise to the Lord for shewing us such grace, as to deliver us from so imminent a danger.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>We stayed at <hi>Chaul</hi> but one day, and then we set sail for <hi>Goa</hi>; Being advanced as far as to the River of <hi>Carapatan,</hi> we met with <hi>Fernand de Morais,</hi> Captain of three Foists, who by the command of the Vice-roy, <hi>Dom Garcia de Noronha,</hi> was going to <hi>Dabul,</hi> to the end he might see whether he could take or burn a <hi>Turkish</hi> Vessel, which was in the Port, laden with Victuals by order from the <hi>Bassa.</hi> This <hi>Fernand de Morais</hi> had no sooner gotten acquaintance of our ship, but he desired our Captain to lend him fifteen men, of twenty that he had, for to supply the great necessity he was in that way, by reason of the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ship departing for <hi>Goa, Fernand de Morais</hi> with his three Foists continued his Voyage towards the Port of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bul,</hi> where we arrived the next day about nine of the clock in the morning, and presently took a Patach of <hi>Malabar,</hi> which laden with Cotton Wool and Pepper, rode at anchor in the midst of the Port. Having taken it we put the Captain and Pilot to torture, who instantly confessed that a few days before a ship came into that Port expresly from the <hi>Bassa</hi> to lade Victuals, and that there was in her an Embassador, who had brought <hi>Hidalcan</hi> a very rich <hi>Cabaya,</hi> that is a garment worn by the Gentlemen of that Country, which he would not accept of, for that

Moreover they said, that it was not above two days since the ship, they spake of, parted from the Port, and that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of her, named <hi>Cide Ale,</hi> had denounced War against <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> vowing that as soon as the Fort of <hi>Diu</hi> was taken, which could not hold out above eight days, according to the estate wherein h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With these news Captain <hi>Morais</hi> returned towards <hi>Goa,</hi> where he arrived two days after, and gave accompt to the Vice-roy of that which had past. There we found <hi>Gonçallo vaz Coutinho,</hi> who was going with five Foists to <hi>Onor,</hi> to demand of the Queen thereof one of the Gallies of <hi>Solymans</hi> Army, which by a contrary wind had been driven into her Ports: Now one of the Captains of those Foists my special friend, seeing me poor and necessitous, perswaded me to accompany him in this Voyage, and to that end got me five duckets pay, which I very gladly accepted of, out of the hope I had that God would thereby open me a way to a better fortune. Being imbarqued then, the Captain and Soldiers pitying the case I was in, bestowed such spare clothes as they had upon me, by which means being reasonably well pieced up again, we parted the next morning from the Road of <hi>Bardees,</hi> and the Monday following we cast anchor in the Port of <hi>Onor</hi>; where, that the inhabitants of the place might know how little account we made of that mighty Army, we gave them a great peal of Ordnance, putting forth all our fights, beating our D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

whereof our General, fearing least some greater loss then the former should befall him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to the water side, carrying along with him both the dead bodies, and all the hurt men, and so went where his Foists lay, into the which every one being imbarqued, we returned with strength of rowing to the place from whence we came, where with extream sorrow he caused the slain to be interred, and all that were hurt to be drest, which were a very great number.</p>
            <p>The same day that was so fatal to us, a list being taken of all the surviving Soldiers,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> that so it might be known how many had been lost in the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st fight upon assaulting of the Trench, we found that of fourscore which we were, there was fifteen slain, fifty four hurt, and nine quite maimed for ever: The rest of the day, and the night following, we kept very good watch to avoyd all surprizes of the Enemy. As soon as the next morning appeared, there came an Embassador from the Queen of <hi>Onor</hi> to the General <hi>Gonçallo,</hi> with a Present of Hens, Chickens, and new layd Eggs for the relief of our sick men; Now though we had great need of those things, yet in stead of receiving our General utterly refused them, and shewing himself very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with the Queen he could not forbear lashing out some words, that were a little more harsher then was requisite; saying, that the Vice-roy should ere long be advertised of the bad Offices she had rendred the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and how much he was obliged to pay her that debt, when occasion should serve: Further he bid him tell her, that for an assurance of that which he said, he had left his son dead and buried in her Land, together with the other <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi> who had been miserably slaughtered through her practises, by assisting the <hi>Turks</hi> against them: and in a word, that he would thank her more fully another time for the Present she had sent, the better to dissemble what she had executed against him, for which he would one day return her a recompence according to her merit.</p>
            <p>The Embassador, very much terrified with this speech, departed; and being come to the Queen his Mistress, he so throughly represented <hi>Gonçallo</hi>'s answer unto her, as she greatly doubted that this Galley would be an occasion of the loss of her Kingdom; wherefore to decline so great a mischief she thought it necessary to seek by all means possible to maintain the League with our General, to which end she assembled her Councel, by whose advice she dispatched another Embassador unto him, who was a <hi>Brachman,</hi> a grave and reverent personage, and her nearest kinsman. At his arrival where our Foists lay, our General gave him very good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and after the ordinary ceremonies and complements the <hi>Brachman</hi> having demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed permission to deliver his Embassage; <hi>Signior,</hi> said he to our Governor, <hi>if you will give me audience, I will declare the cause of my coming hither from the Queen of</hi> Onor <hi>my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress.</hi> Hereunto <hi>Gonçallo</hi> replyed, <hi>That Embassadors had always assurance for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and permission freely to deliver the particulars of their Embassy, so that he might boldly say what he would.</hi> The <hi>Brachman</hi> having thanked him, <hi>Verily,</hi> continued he, <hi>I am not able to express unto you, how sensible the Queen my Mistress is of the death of your son, and of those other Portugals, that were yesterday slain in the fight; And without lying I swear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by her life, and by this string of a Brachman that I wear, the mark of my Priestly dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and only proper to those which are of that profession, wherein I have been exercised from my youth, that she was so exceedingly afflicted at the notice of your disaster, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie success of your conflict, as she could not have been more vexed if she had been made to eat Cows flesh (which is the greatest sin committed amongst us) at the principal gate of the Temple, where her father is interred: Whereby you may judg, Signior, what a share she bears of your sorrow. But since there is no remedy for things done, she desireth, and very instantly beseecheth you to confirm the Peace unto her anew which other Governers have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways granted her heretofore; Whereunto she the rather intreats you, because she knows of what power you are with the Vice-roy: Now that confirmed unto her, she assures you, and faithfully promiseth, within four days to burn the Galley, that hath put you to so much pain, and turn the Turks out of the limits of her Kingdom, which is all that she can do, and which you may be most confident she will not fail to execute accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our General knowing of what importance this affair was,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> presently accepted of the <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> offer, and told him that he was contented that the League should be renewed betwixt them, according whereunto it was instantly published on either part with all the ceremonies accustomed in such cases; Thereupon the <hi>Brachman</hi> returned to the Queen, who afterwards labored all she could to make good her word; But because <hi>Gonçallo</hi> could not stay the four days, which she had demanded, in regard of the extream danger he should thereby have exposed

            <head>CHAP. VI. What passed till such time as <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> arrived at <hi>Malaca;</hi> his receiving an Embassador from the King of <hi>Batas;</hi> with his sending me to that King, and that which arrived to me in that Voyage.</head>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 1.</note>THe next day our General <hi>Gonçallo vaz Coutinho</hi> arrived at <hi>Goa,</hi> with so many of us as remained alive; There he was exceedingly welcomed by the Vice-roy, unto whom he rendred an accompt of his Voyage, as also of that which he had concluded with the Queen of <hi>Onor,</hi> who had promised to burn the Galley within four days, and to chace the <hi>Turks</hi> out of all the Confines of her Kingdom, wherewith the Vice-roy was very well satisfied. In the mean time after I had remained three and twenty days in the said Town of <hi>Goa,</hi> where I was cured of two hurts which I had received in fight at the <hi>Turks</hi> Trenches, the necessity whereunto I saw my self reduced, and the counsel of a Fryer, my Friend, perswaded me to offer my service unto a Gentleman, named <hi>Pedro de Faria,</hi> that was then newly preferred to the Charge of Captain of <hi>Malaca,</hi> who upon the first motion was very willing to entertain me for a Soldier, and promised me withall to give me something over and above the rest of his Company during the Voyage which he was going to make with the Vice-roy. For it was at that very time when as the Vice-roy <hi>Dom Garcia de Noronha</hi> was preparing to go to the succor of the Fortress of <hi>Diu,</hi> which he certainly knew was besieged, and in great danger to be taken, by reason of the great Forces wherewithall it was invested by the <hi>Turk,</hi> and to relieve it the Vice-roy had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled a mighty Fleet at <hi>Goa,</hi> consisting of about two hundred and twenty five Vessels, whereof fourscore and three were great ones, namely Ships, Gallions, Carvels, and the rest Brigantins, Foists, and Galleys, wherein it was said there were ten thousand Land-men, and thirty thousand Mariners, besides a great number of Slaves. The time of setting sail being come, and the Foists provided of all things necessary, the Vice-roy imbarqued himself on <hi>Saturday</hi> the fourteenth of <hi>November,</hi> 1538. Howbeit five days past away before he put out of the Haven, in regard he stayed for his men that were not all ready to imbarque, the mean while a Catur ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Town of <hi>Diu</hi> with a Letter from <hi>Antonio de Silveyra,</hi> Captain of the Fortress, whereby he advertised the Vice-roy, that the <hi>Turks</hi> had raised the siege, and were retired. Now though these were good news, yet was the whole Fleet grieved thereat for the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire every one had to fight with the Enemies of our Faith. Hereupon the Vice-roy abode there five days longer, during the which he took order for all things necessary to the conservation of his Government of the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> and then commanding to hoist sail he departed from <hi>Goa</hi> on a Thursday morning the sixteenth of <hi>December:</hi> The four<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eenth of his Navigation he went and cast anchor at <hi>Chaul,</hi> where he remained three days, during the which he entred into confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with <hi>Inezamuluco,</hi> a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Prince, and took order for certain affairs very much importing the surety of the Fortress: After that he cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed some of the Vessels of the Fleet to be rigged, which he furnished with Soldiers and Victuals, and then d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>parted for to go to <hi>Diu</hi>; But it was his ill fortune, as he was crossing the Gulph, to be suddenly overtaken by such a furious Tempest, that it not only separated his Fleet, but was the loss of many Vessels, chiefly of the Bastard Galley, which was cast away at the mouth of the River <hi>Dabul,</hi> whereof <hi>Dom Alvaro de Noronha,</hi> the Vice-roys son, and General of the Sea-forces, was Captain; In the same Gulph also perished the Galley named <hi>Espinheyro,</hi> commanded by <hi>Iovan de Sousa,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the most part of their men were saved by <hi>Christophilo de Gama,</hi> who came most oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely to their succor. During this Tempest there were seven other ships likewise cast away, the names of which I have forgotten, in so much that it was a month before the Vice-roy could recover himself of the loss he had sustained, and re-assemble his Fleet again which this storm had scattered in divers places: At length the sixteenth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1539. he arrived at the Town of <hi>Diu,</hi> where he caused the Fortress to be re-built, the greater part whereof had been demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the <hi>Turks,</hi> so as it seemed that it had been defended by the besieged, rather by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, then force: Now to effect it the better he made proclamation, that all the Captains with their Soldiers should each of them take in charge to re-build that quarter, which should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50126:15"/>
them; and because never a Commander there had more then <hi>Pedro de Faria,</hi> he thought fit to appoint him the Bulwark, which looked to the Sea, for his quarter, together with the out-wall that was on the Lands side; wherein he bestowed such care and diligence, that in six and twenty days space, both the one and the other were restored to a better state then before, by the means of three hundred Soldiers that were employed about it. This done, for that it was the fourteenth of <hi>March,</hi> and a fit time for Navigation to <hi>Malaca, Pedro de Faria</hi> set sail for <hi>Goa,</hi> where by vertue of a Pattent granted him by the Vice-roy he furnished himself with all things necessary for his Voyage; Departing then from <hi>Goa</hi> on the thirteenth of <hi>April</hi> with a Fleet of eight Ships, four Foists, and one Galley, wherein there were five hundred men, he had so favorable a wind, that he arrived at <hi>Malaca</hi> the fifth day of <hi>Iune</hi> in the same year, 1539.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> succeeding <hi>Dons Estevano de Gama</hi> in the Charge of Captain of <hi>Malaca,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> arrived there safely with his Fleet, nothing hapning in his Voyage worthy of writing. Now because at his arrival, <hi>Estevan de Gama</hi> had not yet ended the time of his Commission, he was not put into the possession of that Government until the day that he was to enter upon his Charge. Howbeit, in regard <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> was ere long to be Governor of the Fortress, the neighboring Kings sent their Embassadors to congratulate with him, and to make a tender of their amity, and of a mutual conservation of Peace with the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Amongst these Embassadors there was one from the King of <hi>Batas,</hi> who raigned in the Isle of <hi>Samatra,</hi> where it is held for a surety that the Island of Gold is, which the King of <hi>Portugal, Dom Ioana</hi> the Third, had resolved should have been discovered by the advice of certain Captains of the Country. This Embassador, that was Brother-in-law to the King of <hi>Batas,</hi> named <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem Dabolay,</hi> brought him a rich Present of Wood of <hi>Aloes, Calambaa,</hi> and five quintals of Benjamon in flowers, with a Letter written on the bark of a Palm tree, where these words were inserted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>More ambitious then all men of the service of the crowned Lyon, seated in the dreadful Throne of the Sea, the rich and mighty Prince of</hi> Portugal, <hi>thy Master and mine, to whom, in thee</hi> Pedro de Faria, <hi>I do now render obedience with a sincere and true amity, to the end I may become his Subject with all the purity and affection which a Vassal is obliged to carry unto his Master; I</hi> Angeessiry Timorraia, <hi>King of</hi> Batas, <hi>desiring to insinuate my self into thy friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that thy Subjects may be inriched with the fruits of this my Country, I do offer by a new Treaty to replenish the Magazins of thy King, who is also mine, with Gold, Pepper, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, Benjamon, and Aloes, upon condition that with an entire confidence thou shalt send me a safe conduct, written and assigned with thine own hand, by means whereof all my</hi> Lanchares <hi>and</hi> Jurupanges <hi>may navigate in safety. Furthermore, in favor of this new amity, I do again beseech thee to succor me with some Powder and great Shot, whereof thou hast but too much in thy Store-houses, and therefore mayst well spare them; for I had never so great need of all kind of warlike munitions as at this present. This granted, I shall be much indebted to thee if by thy means I may once chastise those perjured</hi> Achems, <hi>the mortal and eminent Enemies of thy</hi> Malaca, <hi>with whom, I swear to thee, I will never have peace as long as I live, until such time as I have had satisfaction for the blood of my three children, which call upon me for vengeance, and that therewith I may asswage the sorrow of their noble Mother, who having given them suck, and brought them up, hath seen them since miserably butchered by that cruel Tyrant of</hi> Achem <hi>in the Towns of</hi> Jacur <hi>and</hi> Lingua, <hi>as thou shalt be more particularly informed by</hi> Aquarem Dabolay, <hi>the Brother of those childrens desolate Mother, whom I have sent unto thee for a confirmation of our new amity, to the end, Signior, that he may treat with thee about such things as shall seem good unto thee, as well for the service of God, as for the good of thy people. From</hi> Paniau <hi>the fifth day of the eighth Moon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Embassador received from <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> all the honor that he could do him after their manner, and as soon as he had delivered him the Letter it was translated into the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> out of the <hi>Malayan</hi> Tongue wherein it was written. Whereupon the Embassador by his Interpreter declared the occasion of the discord, which was between the Tyrant of <hi>Achem,</hi> and the King of <hi>Batas,</hi> proceeding from this, that the Tyrant had not long before propounded unto this King of <hi>Batas,</hi> who was a Gentile, the imbracing of <hi>Mahomet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Law, conditionally that he would wed him to a Sister of his, for which purpose he should quit his wife, that was also a Gentile, and married to him six and twenty years; Now because the King of <hi>Batas</hi> would by no means condescend thereunto, the Tyrant, incited by a <hi>Cacis</hi> of his, immediately
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50126:16"/>
denounced War against him: So each of them having raised a mighty Army, they fought a most bloody Battel, that continued three hours, and better, during the which the Tyrant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the advantage the <hi>Bataes</hi> had of him, after he had lost a great number of his people, he made his retreat into a Mountain, called <hi>Cagerrendan,</hi> where the <hi>Bataes</hi> held him besieged by the space of three and twenty days, but because in that time many of the Kings men fell sick, and that also the Tyrants Camp began to want Victuals, they concluded a Peace, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Tyrant should give the King five bars of Gold (which are in value two hundred thousand crowns of our mony) for to pay his Soldiers, and that the King should marry his eldest son to that sister of the Tyrant, who had been the cause of making that War. This accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing signed by either part, the King returned into his Country, where he was no sooner arrived, but relying on this Treaty of Peace he dismist his Army, and discharged all his Forces. The tranquillity of this Peace lasted not above two months and an half, in which time there came to the Tyrant three hundred <hi>Turks,</hi> whom he had long expected from the Straight of <hi>Mecqua,</hi> and for them had sent four Vessels laden with Pepper, wherein also were brought a great many Cases full of Muskets and Hargebusezes, together with divers Pieces both of Brass and Iron Ordnance. Whereupon the first thing the Tyrant did was to joyn those three hundred <hi>Turks</hi> to some Forces he had still afoot, then making as though he would go to <hi>Pacem</hi> for to take in a Captain that was revolted against him, he cunningly fell upon two places, named <hi>Iacur</hi> and <hi>Lingua,</hi> that app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m least thought of it, for the Peace newly made between them took away all the mistrust of such an attempt, so as by that means it was easie for the Tyrant to render himself Master of those Fortresses. Having taken them he put three of the Kings sons to death, and seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Ouroballones,</hi> so are the noblest and the valiant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st of the Kingdom called. This while the King of <hi>Batas,</hi> much resenting, and that with good cause, so great a Treachery, sware by the head of his god <hi>Quiay Hocombinor,</hi> the principal Idol of the Gentiles sect, who hold him for their god of Justice, never to eat either fruit, salt, or any other thing, that might bring the least gust to his palate, before he had revenged the death of his children, and drawn reason from the Tyrant for this loss; protesting further, that he was resolved to dye in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of so just a War. To which end, and the better to bring it to pass, the King of <hi>Batas</hi> straightway assembled an Army of fifteen thousand men, as well natives, as strangers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall he was assisted by some Princes his friends: and to the same effect he emplored the Forces of us Christians, which was the reason why he sought to contract that new amity, we have spoken of before, with <hi>Pedro de Faria,</hi> who was very well contented with it, in regard he knew that it greatly imported, both the service of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fortress, besides that by this means he hoped very much to augment the Revenue of the Customs, together with his own particular, and all the rest of the <hi>Portugals</hi> profit, in regard of the great Trade they had in those Countries of the <hi>South.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>After that the King of <hi>Batas</hi> Embassador had been seventeen days with us, <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> dismissed him, having first granted whatsoever the King his Master had demanded, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over and above, as fire-pots, darts, and murdering Pieces, wherewith the Embassador departed from the Fortress so contented, that he shed tears for joy, nay, it was observed, that passing by the great door of the Church, he turned himself towards it, with his hands and eyes lift up to Heaven, and then as it were praying to God; <hi>Almighty Lord,</hi> said he openly, <hi>that in rest and great joy livest there above seated on the Treasure of thy Riches, which are the spirits formed by thy Will, here I promise thee, if it may be thy good pleasure to give us the victory against this Tyrant of</hi> Achem, <hi>and to permit us to regain that from him, which with such notable treachery he hath taken from us in those places of</hi> Jacur <hi>and</hi> Lingua, <hi>we will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways most faithfully and sincerely acknowledg thee according to the Law of the</hi> Portugals, <hi>and according to that holy Verity, wherein consists the Salvation of all that are born in the world: Furthermore, in our Country we will build fair Temples unto thee, perfumed with sweet odours, where all living Souls shall on their bended knees adore thee, as it hath been always used to be done unto this present in the Land of</hi> Portugal. <hi>And hear what besides I promise, and swear unto thee with all the assuredness of a good and faithful servant, that the King my Master shall never acknowledg any other King then the great</hi> Portugal, <hi>who is now Lord of Malaca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having made this protestation, he presently imbarqued himself in the same <hi>Lanchara,</hi> wherein he came thither, being accompanied with eleven or twelve <hi>Balons,</hi> which are small
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50126:16"/>
Barques, and so went to the Isle of <hi>Vpa,</hi> distant not above half a league from the Port. There the <hi>Bandara</hi> of <hi>Malaca</hi> (who is as it were chief Justicer amongst the <hi>Mahometans</hi>) was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in person by the express commandment of <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> for to entertain him; And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he made him a great Feast, which was celebrated with Hoboys, Drums, Trumpets, and Cymbals, together with an excellent consort of voyces framed to the tune of Harps, Lutes, and Viols after the <hi>Portugal</hi> manner. Whereat this Embassador did so wonder, that he would often put his finger on his mouth, an usual action with those of that Country when they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel at any thing. About twenty days after the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>parture of this Embassador, <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> being informed, that if he would send some Commodities from the <hi>Indiaes</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>Batas,</hi> he might make great profit thereof, and much more of those which should be returned from thence, he to that effect set forth a <hi>Iurupango,</hi> of the bigness of a small Carvel, wherein he ventured a matter of some ten thousand duckets; In this Vessel he sent, as his Factor, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Mahometan,</hi> born at <hi>Malaca,</hi> and was desirous to have me to accompany him, telling me that thereby I should not only much oblige him, but that also under pretext of being sent as Embassador thither, I might both see the King of <hi>Batas,</hi> and going along with him in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney against the Tyrant of <hi>Achem,</hi> which some way or other would questionless redound to my benefit. Now to the end that upon my return out of those Countries I might make him a true relation of all that I had seen, he prayed me carefully to observe whatsoever should pass there, and especially to learn whether the Isle of Gold, so much talked of, was in those parts, for that he was minded, if any discovery of it should be made, to write unto the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> about it. To speak the truth, I would fain have excused my self from this Voyage, by reason those Countries were unknown to me, and for that the inhabitants were by every one account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faithless and treacherous, having small hope besides to make any gain by it, in regard that all my stock amounted not to above an hundred duckets; But because I durst not oppose the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains desire I imbarqued my self, though very unwillingly, with that Infidel who had the charge of the Merchandise. Our Pilot steered his course from <hi>Malaca</hi> to the Port of <hi>Sorotilau,</hi> which is in the Kingdom of <hi>Aaru,</hi> always coasting the Isle of <hi>Samatra</hi> towards the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, till at length we arrived at a certain River, called <hi>Hicandure</hi>; After we had continued five days sailing in this manner we came to an Harbor, named <hi>Minhatoley,</hi> distant some ten leagues from the Kingdom of <hi>Peedir.</hi> In the end finding our selves on the other side of the Ocean we sailed on four days together, and then cast anchor in a little river, called <hi>Gaateamgim,</hi> that was not above seven fathom deep, up the which we past some seven or eight leagues. Now all the while we sailed in this River with a fair wind, we saw athwart a Wood, which grew on the bank of it, such a many Adders, and other crawling creatures, no less prodigious for their length, then for the strangeness of their forms, that I shall not marvel if they that read this History will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve my report of them; especially such as have not travelled, for they that have seen little beleeve not much, whereas they that have seen much beleeve the more. All along this River, that was not very broad, there were a number of Lizards, which might more properly be called Serpents, because some of them were as big as an <hi>Almadia,</hi> with scales upon their backs, and mouths two foot wide. Those of the Country assured us, that these creatures are so hardy, as there be of them that sometimes will set upon an <hi>Almadia,</hi> chiefly when they perceive there is not above four or five persons in her, and overturn it with their tails, swallowing up the men whole, without dismembering of them. In this place also we saw strange kind of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which they call <hi>Caquesseitan</hi>; They are of the bigness of a great Goose, very black, and scaly on their backs, with a row of sharp pricks on their chins, as long as a writing pen: Moreover, they have wings like unto those of Bats, long necks, and a little bone growing on their heads resembling a Cocks spur, with a very long tail spotted black and green, like unto the Lizards of that Country; These creatures hop and fly together, like Grashoppers, and in that manner they hunt Apes, and such other beasts, whom they pursue even to the tops of the highest Trees. Also we saw Adders, that were copped on the crowns of their heads, as big as a mans thigh, and so venomous, as the <hi>Negroes</hi> of the Country informed us, that if any living thing came within the reach of their breath, it dyed presently, there being no remedy nor antidote against it. We likewise saw others, that were not copped on the crowns, nor so venomous as the former, but far greater and longer, with an head as big as a Calves. We were told that they hunt their prey in this manner: They get up into a tree, and winding their tails about some branch of it, let their bodies hang down to the foot of the tree, and then laying one of their ears close to the ground, they harken whether they can hear any thing stir during the still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50126:17"/>
of the night, so that if an Ox, a Boar, or any other beast doth chance to pass by, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently seize on it, and so carries it up into the tree where he devours it. In like sort we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scryed a number of Baboons, both grey and black, as big as a great Mastiff, of whom the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> of the Country are more afraid, then of all the other beasts, because they will set upon them with that hardiness, as they have much ado to resist them.</p>

Whereunto I answered, as I had in commission, that I was come to serve his Highness in the Wars, where I hoped to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This poor King presently believed all that I said to be true, and so much the rather, for that it was conformable to his desire, in such sort, that rising out of his Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50126:17"/>
               <hi>Malaca.</hi> Having spent some time therein, he very courteously dismissed me, with a promise to cause the Merchandise, which the <hi>Mahometan</hi> had brought in the Captain of <hi>Mala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a</hi>'s name, to be well and profitably put off, which indeed was the thing I most desired. Now for as much as the King at my arrival was making his preparations for to march against the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of <hi>Achem,</hi> and had taken order for all things necessary for that his Voyage, after I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained nine days in <hi>Panaiu,</hi> the Capital City of the Kingdom of <hi>Batas,</hi> he departed with some Troops towards a place, named <hi>Turban,</hi> some five leagues of, where he arrived an hour before Sun-set, without any manner of reception, or shew of joy, in regard of the grief he was in for the death of his children, which was such as he never appeared in publique, but with great demonstrations of sorrow.</p>
            <p>The next morning the King of <hi>Batas</hi> marched from <hi>Turban</hi> towards the Kingdom of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> being eighteen leagues thither: He carried with him fifteen thousand men of War, whereof eight thousand were <hi>Bataes,</hi> and the rest <hi>Menancabes, Lusons, Andraguires, Iambes,</hi> and <hi>Bournees,</hi> whom the Princes his neighbors had assisted him with, as also forty Elephants, and twelve Carts with small Ordnance, namely, Faulcons, Bases, and other field Pieces, amongst the which there were three that had the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> and were taken in the year 1526. at such time as <hi>Lopo Vaz d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Sampayo</hi> governed the State of the <hi>Indiaes.</hi> Now the King of <hi>Batas</hi> marching five leagues a day came to a River, called <hi>Quilem</hi>; There by some of the Tyrants Spies, which he had taken, he learnt that his Enemy waited for him at <hi>Tonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,</hi> two leagues from <hi>Achem,</hi> with a purpose to fight with him, and that he had great store of strangers in his Army, namely <hi>Turks, Cambayans,</hi> and <hi>Malabars:</hi> Whereupon the King of <hi>Batas</hi> assembling his Councel of War, and falling into consultation of this affair, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded as most expedient to set upon the Enemy before he grew more strong. With this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution having quit the River he marched somewhat faster then ordinary, and arrived about ten of the clock in the night at the foot of a Mountain, half a league from the Enemies Camp, where, after he had reposed himself a matter of three hours, he marched on in very good order, for which effect having divided his Army into four Squadrons, and passing along by a little hill, when he came to the end thereof he discovered a great Plain sowed with Rice, where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my stood ranged in two Battalions. As soon as the two Armies descryed one another, and that at the sound of their Trumpets, Drums, and Bells the Soldiers had set up a terrible cry, they encountred very valiantly together, and after the discharge of their shot on both sides, they came to fight hand to hand with such courage, that I trembled with fear to behold their fury. The Battel continued in this manner above an hour, and yet could it not possibly be discerned which party had the better. At last the Tyrant foreseeing, that if he persisted in the fight, he should lose the day, because he perceived his men to grow faint and weary, he retreated to a rising ground, that lay South of the <hi>Bataes,</hi> and about a Faulcons shot distant from them. There his intention was to fortifie himself in certain Trenches which before he had caused to be cast up against a Rock in form of a garden, or tilth of Rice; But a brother to the King of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draguire</hi> interrupted his design, for stepping before him with two thousand men, he cut off his way, and stopt him from passing further, in so much that the medly grew to be the same it was before, and the fight was renewed between them with such fury, as cruelly wounding one another, they testified sufficiently how they came but little short of other Nations in courage. By this means the Tyrant, before he could recover his Trenches, lost fifteen hundred of his men, of which number were the hundred and threescore <hi>Turks,</hi> that a little before were come to him from the Straight of <hi>Mecqua,</hi> with two hundred <hi>Sarrazins, Malabars,</hi> and some <hi>Abissins,</hi> which were the best men he had; Now because it was about mid-day, and therefore very hot, the King of <hi>Batas</hi> retired towards the Mountain, where he spent the rest of the day in causing those that were wounded to be looked unto, and the dead to be buried. Hereupon, not being well resolved what to do, in regard he was altogether ignorant of the Enemies design, he took care to have good watch kept all that night in every part. The next morning no sooner began the Sun to appear but he perceived the Valley, wherein the <hi>Achems</hi> had been the day before, to be quite abandoned, and not one of them to be seen there, which made him think the Enemy was defeated: In this opinion, the better to pursue the first point of his Victory, he dismissed all the hurt men, as being unfit for service, and followed the Tyrant to the City, where arriving two hours before Sun-set, to shew that he had strength and courage enough to combat his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he resolved to give them proof of it by some remarkable action before he would encamp himself; To which effect he fired two of the Suburbs of the Town, as also four Ships, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50126:18"/>
two Gallions, which were drawn on Land, and were those that had brought the <hi>Turks</hi> from the Straight of <hi>Mecqua</hi>: And indeed the fire took with such violence on those six Vessels, as they were quite consumed in a very little time, the Enemy not daring to issue forth for to quench it. After this, the King of <hi>Batas</hi> seeing himself favored by Fortune, to lose no opportunity began to assault a Fort, called <hi>Penacao,</hi> which with twelve Pieces of Ordnance defended the entry of the River, to the Scalado of this he went in person, his whole Army looking on, and having caused some seventy or eighty ladders to be planted, he behaved himself so well, that with the loss only of seven and thirty men he entred the place, and put all to the sword that he found in it, to the number of seven hundred persons, without sparing so much as one of them. Thus did he on the day of his arrival perform three memorable things, whereby his Soldiers were so heartned, as they would fain have assaulted the City the very same night if he would have permitted them, but in regard it was very dark, and his men weary, he gave thanks to God, and contented himself with that which he had done.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>The King of <hi>Batas</hi> held the City besieged by the space of three and twenty days, during the which two sallies were made, wherein nothing past of any reckoning, for there were but ten men slain on either part; Now as victories and good success in War do ordinarily encourage the victorious, so oftentimes it happens that the weak become strong, and cowards so hardy, as laying aside all fear they dare undertake most difficile and dangerous things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence also it as often falls out, that the one prospers, and the other is ruined, which appeared but too evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that which I observed of these two Princes; For the King of <hi>Batas,</hi> seeing that the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant had shut himself up in his City, thereby as it were confessing that he was vanquished, grew to such an height of confidence, that both he and his people beleeving it was impossible for them to be resisted, and trusting in this vain opinion, that blinded them, were twice in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to be lost by the rash and inconsiderate actions which they entred into. In the third sally, made by the inhabitants, the King of <hi>Batas</hi> people encountred them very lustily in two places, which those of <hi>Achem</hi> perceiving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they made as though they were the weaker, and so retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the same Fort, that was taken from them by the <hi>Bataes</hi> the first day of their arrival, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing closely followed by one of the Kings Captains, who taking hold of the opportunity, entred pell-mell with the <hi>Achems,</hi> being perswaded that the Victory was sure his own; But when they were all together in the Trenches the <hi>Achems</hi> turned about, and making head afresh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themselves very couragiously<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At length in the heat of their medley, the one side en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to go on, and the other to withstand them, those of <hi>Achem</hi> gave fire to a Myne they had made, which wrought so effectually, as it blew up the Captain of the <hi>Bataes,</hi> and above three hundred of his Soldiers, with so great a noise, and so thick a smoak, as the place seemed to be the very portraiture of Hell: In the mean time the Enemies giving a great shout, the Tyrant sallied forth in person, accompanied with five thousand resolute men, and charged the <hi>Bataes</hi> very furiously; Now for that neither of them could see one another by reason of the smoak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Myne, there was a most confused and cruel conflict between them, but to speak the truth I am not able to deliver the manner of it, sufficeth it that in a quarter of an hours space, the time this fight endured, four thousand were slain in the place on both sides, whereof the King of <hi>Batas</hi> lost the better part, which made him retire with the remainder of his Army to a Rock, called <hi>Minacaleu,</hi> where causing his hurt men to be drest, he found them to be two thousand in number, besides those that were killed, which because they could not be so suddenly buried were thrown into the current of the River. Hereupon the two Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued quiet for four days after, at the end whereof one morning, when nothing was less thought of, there appeared in the midst of the River on <hi>Penaticans</hi> side a Fleet of fourscore and six Sails, with a great noise of musick, and acclamations of joy: At first this object much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the <hi>Bataes,</hi> because they knew not what it was, howbeit the night before their scouts had taken five fishermen, who put to torture confessed, that this was the Army which the Tyrant had sent some two months before to <hi>Tevassery,</hi> in regard he had War with the <hi>Sornau,</hi> King of <hi>Siam,</hi> and it was said that this Army was composed of five thousand <hi>Lussons</hi> and <hi>Sornes,</hi> all choyce men, having to their General a <hi>Turk</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> named <hi>Hametecam,</hi> Nephew to the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Cairo.</hi> Whereupon the King of <hi>Batas</hi> making use of these fishermens confession, resolved to retire himself in any sort whatsoever, well considering that the time would not permit him to make an hours stay, as well because his Enemies Forces were far greater then his, as for that every minute they expected succors from <hi>Pedir</hi> and <hi>Pazen,</hi> whence, as it was reported for certain, there were twelve ships full of strangers coming. No sooner was the King fortified

in this resolution, but the night ensuing he departed very sad, and ill contented for the bad su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of his enterprize, wherein he had lost above three thousand and five hundred men, not comprising the wounded, which were more in number, nor those that were burnt with the fire of the Myn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THe <hi>Mahometan</hi> and I returning to our lodging, departed not in four days after,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that time in shipping an hundred Bars of Tin, and thirty of Benjamin, which were still on Land. Then being fully satisfied by our Merchants, and ready to go, I went to wait upon the King at his <hi>Passeiran,</hi> which was a great place before the Palace, where those of the Country kept their most solemn Fairs; There I gave him to understand, that now we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to do but to depart if it would please his Majesty to permit us: The entertainment that he gave me then was very gracious, and for answer he said to me, I am very glad for that <hi>Hermon Xabandar</hi> (who was chief General of the Wars) assured me yesterday that your Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains commodities were well sold, but it may be that that which he told me was not so, and that he delivered not the truth for to please me, and to accommodate himself to the desire he knew I had to have it so, wherefore, continued he, I pre-thee declare unto me freely whether he dealt truly with me, and whether the <hi>Mahometan</hi> that brought them be fully satisfied, for I would not that to my dishonor those of <hi>Malaca</hi> should have cause to complain of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Panaiu,</hi> saying, that they are not men of their word, and that there is not a King there who can constrain them to pay their debts; and I swear to thee by the faith of Pagan,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50126:19"/>
that this affront would be no less insupportable to my condition, then if I should chance to make peace with that Tyrant, and perjured Enemy of mine, the King of <hi>Achem.</hi> Whereunto having replyed, that we had dispatched all our affairs, and that there was nothing due to us in his Country; Verily, said he, I am very well pleased to hear that it is so, wherefore since thou hast nothing else to do here, I hold it requisite, that without any further delay thou shouldst go, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,</hi> who they say are come from the end of the world, calling them <hi>Tyrannical men, and Vsurpers in a soveraign degree of other mens Kingdoms in the Indiaes, and Isles of the Sea.</hi> This is the title wherein they glory most, and which they attribute particularly to themselves, as being sent them from <hi>Mecqua</hi> in recompence of the golden Lamps, which they offered to the Alcoran of their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as they use to do every year. Furthermore, although heretofore I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> often advised thy Captain of <hi>Malaca</hi> to take careful heed of this Tyrant of <hi>Achem,</hi> yet do not thou omit to advertise him of it once more from me; for know that he never had, nor shall have other thoughts then to labor by all means to expel him out of the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> and make the <hi>Turk</hi> Master of them, who to that end promiseth to send him great succors; but I hope that God will so order it, as all the malice and cunning of this disloyal wretch shall have a contrary success to his intentions. After he had used this language to me, he gave me a Letter in answer to my Embassage, together with a present, which he desired me to deliver from him to Captain <hi>de Faria</hi>; this was six small Javelins headed with Gold, twelve <hi>Cates</hi> of <hi>Calambuca</hi> Wood, every one of them weighing twenty ounces, and a box of exceeding value, made of a Tortoise sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then he dismissed me with as much demonstration of honor as he had always used to me before, protesting to me in particular, that the amity which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with our Nation should ever continue inviolable on his part. Thus I imbarqued my self with <hi>Aquarem Dab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>The next morning, leaving that Island of <hi>Apofingua,</hi> we ran along by the coast of the Ocean Sea for the space of five and twenty leagues, until such time as at length we entered into the Straight of <hi>Minhagaruu,</hi> by which we came; then passing by the contrary coast of this other <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, we continued our course along by it, and at last arrived near to <hi>Pullo Bugay:</hi> There we crost over to the firm Land, and passing by the Port of <hi>Iunçalan,</hi> we sailed two days and an half with a favorable wind, by means whereof we got to the River of <hi>Parles</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Queda,</hi> there we rode five days at anchor in expectation of a fit wind to carry us on. During that time, the <hi>Mahometan</hi> and my self, by the counsel of certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of the Country, went to visit the King with an <hi>Odiaa,</hi> or Present of divers things, that we thought were convenient for our design, which was received with much demonstration of being very well pleased therewith. When we came to his Court we found, that with a great deal of pomp, excellent musick, dancing, and largess to the poor, he was solemnizing the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of his Father, whom he himself had poynarded, of purpose for to marry his own mother, after he had gotten her with child: Wherewithall not being contented, to decline the murmur, which so wicked and horrible an act might provoke unto, he had made proclamation, that on pain of a most rigorous death no person whatsoever should be so daring, as to speak a word of that which had past, and it was told us there, how for that cause he had most tyrannically put the principal Personages of his Kingdom, and a number of Merchants already to death, whose goods he had confiscated to his own use, and thereby enriched his Coffers with two millions of Gold; So that upon our arrival we perceived such a general fear to be amongst the people, as not the most hardy of them all durst so much as make the least mention in the world of it. Now in regard the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> my companion, named <hi>Coia Ale,</hi> was a man liberal of his tongue,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50126:19"/>
and that would say any thing which came into his head, he perswaded himself, in regard he was a stranger, and the Captain of <hi>Malaca</hi>'s Factor, that he might with more liberty then those of the Country talk what he listed, and the King not punish him for it, as he did his Subjects; But he found himself far short of his account, and this presumption cost him his life: For being invited to a feast by another <hi>Mahometan</hi> like himself, a Merchant stranger, born at <hi>Patana,</hi> when as they were both of them high with wine and meat, as I learned since, they began to talk boldly, and without any respect of the Kings Brutality and Parracide, whereof the King, being incontinently advertised by Spies, which he had in every corner for that purpose, he caused the house to be presently invested, and all the guests to be apprehended, to the number of seventeen persons; These poor wretches were no sooner brought bound before him, but immediately, without observing any form of Justice, or hearing what they could say for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves either good or bad, he commanded them to be put to a most cruel kind of death, called by them <hi>Gregoge,</hi> which is, to saw off the feet, hands, and heads of them that are condemned to it, as I beheld afterwards my self. This execution done, the King, fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing lest the Captain of <hi>Malaca</hi> should be offended for that he had executed his Factor thus with the rest, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might arrest some goods that he had at <hi>Malaca,</hi> sent the night following for me to the <hi>Iurupango,</hi> where I was sleeping, and altogether ignorant of that which had past: understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings pleasure away I went, and coming about midnight to the Palace I perceived in the outward Court a great many men in arms; the sight whereof I must confess put me into a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty amazement and mistrust, because I could not imagine what should be the cause of it, and doubting lest it might be some such Treason as at other times they had practised against us, I would fain have returned, but they that accompanied me, judging that my fear proceeded from the Soldiers which I beheld there, bid me be afraid of nothing, for these men were only going forth to apprehend an offendor by the Kings commandment; Having said thus with an intent to confirm me, I could not for all that be satisfied, but was seized with so terrible a fear, as I was not able to utter a word, howbeit at length recollecting my self a little, I signified to them the best I could, how if they would permit me to return to my Skiff for to fetch a thing which I had forgotten, I would give them forty Crowns in Gold; whereunto they answered, that if I would give them all the Silver in <hi>Malaca</hi> they would not let me go, for if they should, they were sure to lose their heads: This speech of theirs redoubled my fear, which yet increased when I saw my self invironned with twenty more of those armed men, who guarded me all that night. The next morning the King being advertised that I was there, commanded me to be brought unto him, into the next Court, where I found him mounted on an Elephant, and accompanied with an hundred persons besides those of his guard, which were far more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; When he saw me coming towards him, much troubled, and indeed more dead then alive, he said twice to me, <hi>Be not afraid, but come nearer to me, and thou shalt know the cause why I sent for thee.</hi> Thereupon having made a sign to me with his hand that I should look that way he pointed me to, I turned me about and beheld a great many bodies extended on the place, and weltring in their own blood, amongst the which I presently knew the <hi>Mahometan, Coia Ale,</hi> with whom I came, which I no sooner perceived, but like a man distraught of his wits I cast my self at the feet of the Elephant whereupon the King rode, and with tears in my eyes cryed out, O Sir, have pity on me, and take me for thy slave, rather then cause me to end my days with the torments which have taken those out of the world whom I see here; I swear unto thee by the faith of a Christian, that I have not deserved death, as having no way offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee; Consider likewise, I beseech thee, that I am Nephew to the Captain of <hi>Malaca,</hi> who will give thee any ransom for me thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> desire, as also that thou hast the <hi>Iurupango,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I came, in thy Port, full of goods, all which thou mayst take it if thou pleasest. Hearing me speak in this sort, <hi>God forbid,</hi> said he, <hi>that ever I should do any such thing, no, no, be not afraid, but stand up, and recollect thy self, for I see well thou art much troubled, and when thou art in better case to hear me I will tell thee wherefore I caused the Moor, that came with thee, to be executed; and in good faith if he had been either a Portugal, or a Christian, I would not have put him to death, no, though he had killed mine own son.</hi> Howbeit perceiving, that all which he could say would not rid me of my fear, he commanded a pot of fresh water to be brought me, whereof I drunk a pretty quantity, and withall made one of his followers to fan me with a ventilow for to refresh me: A quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, was spent in this action, at the end thereof finding that I was so well recovered, as I was able with good sence to answer unto the questions he should ask me; <hi>Portugal,</hi> said he unto me, I know that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50126:20"/>
thou hast bern told, since thy coming hither, how I killed my Father, as indeed I did, because I was sure he would have killed me, incited thereunto by the false reports of some of his slaves, would have made him believe that I had gotten my mother with child, whereof I had never so much as the least thought, whereby thou mayst see what ill tongues can do. Indeed it is true, that being most assured he had without all reason given such credit to those slanderous reports, as he was fully resolved to have taken away my life, to decline that imminent peril I prevented him, and caught him in the same snare he had layd for me; But God knows how much against my mind this fell out, and how I always made it my chiefest glory to render him the dutiful of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of a most obedient son, as it may well appear now at this present: for to keep my mother from being a sad and desolate widow, as many others are, seeing my self to be the cause of her misery, and obliged to comfort her, I have taken her to wife; judg then whether I have been wrongfully blamed, or no, since that for her I have refused many great parties, that have been propounded unto me from <hi>Patacia, Berdio, Tanauçarin, Siaca, Iamba,</hi> and <hi>Andragia,</hi> who were no less then Sisters and Daughters of Kings, and offered unto me with very rich dowries. Now being informed that such false reports had been dispersed abroad of me, for to arrest the tongues of Detractors, which are so audacious as to talk of any thing comes in their heads, I caused it to be proclaimed, that none should dare to speak of that affair; But for as much as without any regard at all of this my Injunction, this fellow of thine, which lies there in the company of those other Dogs, like unto himself, spoke yesterday of me most reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in publique, saying, I was an Hog, or worse then a very Hog, and my mother a salt Bitch; as well to punish his slanders, as to preserve my honor, I was constrained to put him to death, together with these other Dogs, who were no less slanderous then he: Wherefore I am to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire thee, that as my friend thou wilt not think this procedure of mine any way strange. Now if thou shouldst happen to think, that I have done it on purpose to seize upon the Captain of <hi>Malaca</hi>'s goods, be confident that I never meant it, &amp; thou mayst truly certifie him so much; For I swear unto thee by my Law, that I have ever been a great friend to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and so will continue all my life. Hereupon being somewhat recovered from the fear I was in a little before, I answered him, How his Highness had much obliged his very good friend, and brother, the Captain of <hi>Malaca,</hi> by the execution of that <hi>Mahometan,</hi> who had imbezelled away a great part of the goods committed to his charge, and understanding that I had discovered his knavery he had twice gone about to poyson me; whereunto also I added, how this Dog when he was drunk would bark at every one, and speak his pleasure at large. This answer made upon the sudden, and not knowing well what I said, very much pleased the King, who commanding me to come nearer to him, Verily, continued he, by this speech of thine I perceive thou art an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man, and my friend, and being so I doubt not but thou wilt give a good interpretation to my actions, contrary to those mastiff Dogs that lie there weltring in their own blood. Having said so, he took a purse from his girdle trimmed with gold, and gave it me, as also a Letter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to <hi>Pedro de Faria,</hi> whereupon I took my leave of him, with a promise that I would stay there a week longer; howbeit getting speedily aboard my <hi>Iurupango,</hi> I made not a minutes stay, but instantly caused the Mariners to hoist sail, and away, still imagining that some were following to apprehend me, by reason of the extream fear I was in, having so lately escaped, as I thought, the danger of a most cruel death.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>Being departed from the River of <hi>Parles</hi> on a Saturday about Sun-set, I made all the speed that possibly I could, and continued my course until the Tuesday following, when it pleased God that I reached to the Isles of <hi>Pullo Sambalin,</hi> the first Land on the Coast of <hi>Mallayo.</hi> There by good fortune I met with three <hi>Portugal</hi> ships (whereof two came from <hi>Bengala,</hi> and the other from <hi>Pegu</hi>) commanded by <hi>Tristan de Gaa,</hi> who had sometimes been Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the person of <hi>Don Lorenzo,</hi> son to the Vice-roy <hi>Don Francesco d' Almeda,</hi> that was afterward put to death by <hi>Miroocem</hi> in <hi>Chaul</hi> Roade, as is at large delivered in the History of the Discovery of the <hi>Indiaes.</hi> This same <hi>Tristan</hi> furnished me with many things that I had great need of, as tackle, and Mariners, together with two Soldiers, and a Pilot; moreover, both himself and the other to ships had always a care of me until our arrival at <hi>Malaca</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where dis-imbarquing my self, the first thing I did was to go to the Fortress for to salute the Captain, and to render him an account of the whole success of my Voyage, where I discoursed unto him at large what Rivers, Ports, and Havens I had newly discovered in the Isle of <hi>Samatra,</hi> as well on the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> as on the Ocean Seas side, as also what commerce the inhabitants of the Country used; Then I declared unto him the manner of all that Coast, of all those Ports,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50126:20"/>
and of all those Rivers; whereunto I added the scituations, the heights, the degrees, the names, and the depths of the Ports, according to the direction he had given me at my departure. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall I made him a description of the Rode wherein <hi>Rosado,</hi> the Captain of a <hi>French</hi> ship, was lost, and another, named <hi>Matelote de Brigas,</hi> as also the Commander of another ship, who by a storm at Sea was cast into the Port of <hi>Diu</hi> in the year 1529. during the raign of <hi>Sultan Bandur,</hi> King of <hi>Cambaya.</hi> This Prince having taken them all, made fourscore and two of them abjure their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover I brought him the description of a place fit for anchorage in <hi>Pullo Botum</hi> Roade, where the <hi>Bisquayn</hi> Ship suffered shipwrack, which was said to be the very same, wherein <hi>Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Further, I told him what course was usually held for the fishing of seed pearl betwixt <hi>Pullo Tiquos</hi> and <hi>Pullo Quenim,</hi> which in times past were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the <hi>Bataes</hi> to <hi>Pazem</hi> and <hi>Pedir,</hi> and exchanged with the <hi>Turks</hi> of the Straight of <hi>Mecqua,</hi> and the Ships of <hi>Iud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Since that time there hath been no talk of the discovery of this Island of Gold, although it seems very much to import the common good of our Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> if it would please God it might be brought to pass.</p>

Hereunto <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> made answer, that if he would relinquish his Government for the time he had yet to come in it, or give him full power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the publique Magazins, he would provide for the succor that he thought was necessary. In a word, and not to stand long on that which past betwixt them, it shall suffice to say, that this Embassador was utterly denyed his demand by these two Captains, whereof the one alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for excuse, that he was not yet entered upon his Charge, and the other that he was upon the finishing of his: whereupon he returned very ill satisfied with this refusal, and so far resented injustice, which he thought was done unto his King, as the very morning wherein he imbarqued himself, having met by chance with the two Captains at the gate of the Fortress, he said aloud before them publiquely with the tears in his eyes; <hi>O God! that with a soveraign Power and Majesty raignest in the highest of the Heavens, even with deep sighs fetch'd from the bottom of my heart, I take thee for Iudg of my cause, and for witness of the just occasion I have to make this request to these Captains here, and that in the name of my King, the faithful Vassal of the great King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>upon homage sworn by his Ancestors to the famous</hi> Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The succor we require of you for to secure us, and to keep this faithless wretch from seizing on our Kingdom, is a very small matter, namely, forty or fifty</hi> Portugals, <hi>that may instruct us in the military art, together with four barrels of Powder, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Bullets for field Pieces; a poor thing in comparison of that you have. Now if you can yet be perswaded to grant us this little ayd, you shall thereby so much oblige our King, as he will ever remain a faithful slave to the mighty Prince of</hi> Portugal, <hi>your Master and ours, in whose name I beseech you, once, twice, nay an hundred times, that you will perform that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains unto your duty to do, for this which I thus publikely demand of you is of so great importance, that therein consists, not so much the preservation of the Kingdom of</hi> Aaru, <hi>as the safety of this your Fortress of</hi> Malaca, <hi>which that Tyrant of</hi> Achem <hi>our enemy so extreamly desires to possess, and to that purpose he hath gotten the assistance of divers strange Nations; but because he finds that our Kingdom is a let to the execution of his design, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to usurp it upon us, and then he intends to guard this Straight in such sort, as he will quite exclude you from all Commerce with the Spices of</hi> Banda <hi>and the</hi> Molucques, <hi>and from all the Trade and Navigation of the Seas of</hi> China, Sunda, Borneo, Timor, <hi>and</hi> Jappon, <hi>and this his own people stick not to boast of even already, being also further manifested by the accord,

            </p>
            <p>Having finished this speech in form of a request, which availed him nothing, he stooped down to the ground, from whence taking up two stones, he knocked with them upon a Piece of Ordnance, and then the tears standing in his eyes he said, <hi>The Lord, who hath created us, will defend us if he please,</hi> and so imbarquing himself he departed greatly discontented for the bad answer he carried back. Five days after his departure <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> was told how all the Town murmured at the small respect, that both he and <hi>Dom Stephano</hi> had carried to that poor King, who had ever been a friend both to them, and the whole <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually done very good offices to the Fort, for which cause his Kingdom was now like to be taken from him: This advice causing him to see his fault, and to be ashamed of his proceeding, he labored to have palliated it with certain excuses, but at last he sent this King by way of succor fifteen quintals of fine Powder, an hundred pots of Wild-fire, an hundred and fifty Bullets for great Ordnance, twelve Harquebuzes, forty sacks of stones, threescore Headpieces, and a Coat of guilt Mail, lined with Crimson Sattin for his own person, together with many other garments of divers sorts, as also twenty pieces of <hi>Caracas,</hi> which are stained linnen, or Cotten Tapestry, that come from the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> and cloth of <hi>Malaya,</hi> wherewith they usually apparel themselves in that Country, as well for his wife, as his daughters. All these things being laden aboard a <hi>Lanchara</hi> with oars, he desired me to conduct and present them from him to the King of <hi>Aaru,</hi> adding withall, that this business greatly concerned the King of <hi>Portugals</hi> service, and that at my return, besides the recompence I should receive from him, he would give me an extraordinary pay, and upon all occasions employ me in such Voyages, as might redound to my profit; whereupon I undertook it, in an ill hour as I may say, and for a punishment of my sins, in regard of what arrived unto me thereupon, as shall be seen hereafter. So then I imbarqued my self on Tuesday morning, the fifth of <hi>October,</hi> 1539. and used such speed, that on Sunday following I arrived at the River of <hi>Panetican,</hi> upon which the City of <hi>Aaru</hi> is scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</p>
            <p>I no sooner got to the River of <hi>Panetican,</hi> but presently landing I went directly to a Trench,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> which the King in person was causing to be made at the mouth of the River for to impeach the Enemies dis-imbarquing; Presenting my self unto him, he received me with great demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of joy, whereupon I delivered him <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi>'s Letter, which gave him some hope of his coming in person to succor him, if need required, with many other complements, that cost little the saying, wherewith the King was wonderfully contented, because he already imagined that the effect thereof would infallibly ensue; But after he saw the Present I brought him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of Powder, and Ammunitions, he was so glad, that taking me in his arms, My good friend, said be unto me, I assure thee that the last night I dreamt how all these things, which I behold here before me, came unto me from the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> my Masters Fortress, by m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

great store of Gold, which he possesseth, that covers his weakness, and by means whereof he wageth such forces of strangers, wherewith he is continually served: But now that thou mayst on the other side understand how vile and odious poverty is, and how hurtful to a poor King, such as I may be, come thee along with me, and by that little which I will presently let thee see thou shalt perceive, whether it be not too true, that Fortune hath been exceeding niggardly to me of her goods; Saying so, he carried me to his Orsenal, which was covered with thatch, and shewed me all that he had within it, whereof he might say with reason, that it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in comparison of what he needed for to withstand the attempts of two hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Vessels, replenished with such warlike people, as the <hi>Achems</hi> and <hi>Mulabar Turks</hi> were; Moreover, with a sad countenance, and as one that desired to discharge his mind of the grief he was in for the danger was threatened him, he recounted unto me, that he had in all but six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men <hi>Aaruns,</hi> without any other forraign succor, forty Pieces of small Ordnance, as Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conets, and Bases, and one cast Piece, which he had formerly bought of a <hi>Portugal,</hi> named <hi>Antonio de Garcia,</hi> sometimes Receiver of the Toll and Customs of the Ports of the Fortress of <hi>Pacem,</hi> whom <hi>Georgio <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I labored to answer this which he had said unto me with such resentment, but he confuted all my reasons with so much truth, as I had not the heart to make any farther reply; withall he represented divers foul and enormous actions unto me, wherewithall he charged some particulars amongst us, which I am contented to pass by in silence, both in regard they are nothing pertinent to my discourse, and that I desire not to discover other mens faults; For a conclusion of his speech, he related unto me the little punishment which was ordained for such as were culpable of these matters, and the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that he had seen conferred on those which had not deserved them; whereunto he added, that if the King desired throughly to perform the duty of his Charge, and by Arms to conquer people so far distant from his Kingdom, and to preserve them, it was as necessary for him to punish the wicked, as to recompence the good. This said, he sent me to lodg in a Merchants house, who for five days together, that I remained there, entertained me bravely, though to speak truth I had rather have been at that time in some other place with any poor victuals, for here I was always in fear, by reason of the Enemies continual alarms, and the certain news that came to the King the next day after my arrival, how the <hi>Achems</hi> were already marching towards <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru,</hi> and would be there within eight days at the farthest, which made him in all haste to give directions for such things as he had not taken order for before, and to send the women, and all that were unfit for War, out of the City five or six leagues into the Wood, amongst the which the Queen her self made one, mounted on an Elephant. Five days after my arrival, the King sent for me, and asked me when I would be gone, whereunto I replyed, at such time as it would please his Greatness to command me, though I should be glad it might be with the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, for that I was to be employed by my Captain with his Merchandise to <hi>China:</hi> Thou hast reason, answered he; then taking two Bracelets of massy Gold off from his wrists, worth some thirty Crowns, I pre-thee now, said he, giving them to me, do not impute it to miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness that I bestow so little on thee, for thou mayst be assured, that it hath been always my desire for to have much for to give much; withall I must desire thee to present this Letter, and

            <p>Having taken leave of the King of <hi>Aaru,</hi> I presently imbarqued my self,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> and departed about Sun-set, rowing down the River to an Hamlet, that is at the entrance thereof, composed of ten or eleven houses covered with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>traw: This place is inhabited with very poor people, that get their living by killing of <hi>Lezards,</hi> of whose livers they make a poyson, wherewith they anoint the heads of their arrows; For the poyson of this place, chiefly that, which is called <hi>Pocausilim,</hi> is held by them the best of those Countries, because there is no remedy for him that is hurt with it. The next day, having left this small Village, we sailed along the coast with a land wind until evening, that we doubled the Islands of <hi>Anchepisan,</hi> then the day and part of the night following we put forth somewhat farther to Sea: But about the first watch the wind changed to the North-east, for such winds are ordinary about the Isle of <hi>Samatra,</hi> and grew to be so tempestuous, that it blew our mast over board, tore our sails in pieces, and so shattered our Vessel, that the water came in that abundance into her at two several places, as she sunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently to the bottom, so that of eight &amp; twenty persons, which were in her, three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were drowned in less then a quarter of an hour. For as five that escaped by the mercy of God, we passed the rest of the night upon a Rock, where the waves of the Sea had cast us. There all that we could do was with tears to lament our sad fortune, not knowing what counsel or course to take, by reason the Country was so moorish, and invironned with so thick a Wood, that a bird, were she never so little, could hardly make way through the branches of it, for that the trees grew so close together; We sat crouching for the space of three whole days upon this Rock, where for all our sustenance we had nothing but Snails, and such filth, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oam of the Sea produced there. After this time, which we spent in great misery and pain, we walked a whole day along by the Isle of <hi>Samatra,</hi> in the owze up to the girdle-stead, and about Sun-set we came to the mouth of a little River, some Crossbow-shot broad, which we durst not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to swim over, for that it was deep, and we very weak and weary; so that we were forced to pass all that night, standing up to the chin in the water. To this misery was there adjoyned the great affliction which the Flies and Gnats brought us, that coming out of the neighboring Woods, bit and stung us in such sort, as not one of us but was gore blood. The next morning as soon as we perceived day, which we much desired to see, though we had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hope of life, I demanded of my four companions, all Mariners, whether they knew the Country, or whether there was any habitation thereabout; Whereupon the eldest of them, who had a wife at <hi>Malaca,</hi> not able to contain his tears, Alas! answered he, the place that now is most proper for you, and me, is the house of death, where ere it be long we must give an account of our sins, it therefore behoves us to prepare our selves for it without any further delay, and patiently to attend that which is sent us from the hand of God: For my part, let me intreat thee to be of a good courage whatsoever thou seest, and not be terrified with the fear of dying, since, every thing well considered, it matters not whether it be to day, or to morrow. This spoken, he embraced me, and with tears in his eyes desired me to make him a Christian, because he beleeved, as he said, that to be so was sufficient to save his Soul, which could not otherwise be done in the cursed sect of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> wherein he had lived till then, and for which he craved pardon of God. Having finished these last words, he remained dead in mine arms, for he was so weak, as he was not able to subsist any longer, as well for that he had not eaten ought in three or four days before, as in regard of a great wound the wrack of the <hi>Lanchara</hi> had given him in his head, through which one might see his brains all putrefied and corrupted, occasioned both for want of looking unto, as by salt water and flies that were gotten into it. Verily this accident grieved me very much, but for my self I was in little better case, for I was likewise so weak, that every step I made in the water I was ready to swoon, by reason of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hurts on my head and body, out of which I had lost a great deal of blood. Having buried him in the owze the best we could, the other three Mariners and my self resolved to cross the River, for to go and sleep on certain great Trees, that we saw on the other side, for fear of the Tygers and Crocodiles, whereof that Country is full, besides many other venomous creatures, as an infinite of those copped Adders I have spoken of before in the sixth Chapter, and divers sorts of Serpents with black and green scales, whose venom is so contagious, as they kill men with their very breath. This resolution being thus taken by us, I desired two of them to swim

over first, and the other to stay with me for to hold me up in the water, for that in regard of my great weakness I could hardly stand upon my legs: whereupon they two cast themselves presently into the water, exhorting us to follow them, and not be afraid; But alas! they were scarce in the midst of this River, when as we saw them caught by two great L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thereupon one amongst them, whom we guessed to be the chiefest of them, spake to us thus, By that which I see, you are not in case to do us any service, and gain your meat, if we should receive you into our Barque, wherefore if you have any mony hidden, you shall do well to give it us aforehand, and then we will use towards you that charity you require of us, for otherwise it is in vain for you to hope for any help from us: Saying so, they made shew as though they would be gone; whereupon we besought them again weeping, that they would take us for slaves, and go sell us where they pleased; hereunto I added, how they might have any ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som for me they would require, as having the honor to appertain very nearly unto the Captain of <hi>Malaca.</hi> Well, answered he then, we are contented to accept of thy offer, upon condition, that if that which thou sayst be not true, we will cast thee, bound hand and foot, alive into the Sea. Having replyed, that they might do so if they found it otherwise, four of them got pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to us, and carried us into their Barque, for we were so weak at that time, as we were not able to stir of our selves. When they had us aboard, imagining that by whipping they might make us confess where we had hid our mony, for still they were perswaded that we had som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Being departed from this River, which was called <hi>Arissumhea,</hi> we went the next day after dinner ashore at a place, where the houses were covered with straw, named <hi>Ciaca,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Iambes,</hi> there they kept me seven and twenty days, in which time by the assistance of Heaven I got my self throughly cured of all my hurts. Then they that had a share in my person, who were seven in number, seeing me unfit for their Trade, which was fishing, exposed me to sale three several times, and yet could meet with no body that would buy me; whereupon being out of hope of selling me, they turned me out of doors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not be at the charge of feeding me.

The <hi>Mahometan</hi> hearing me say thus, If it be true, replyed he, that thou art such as thou deliverest thy self to be, what so great sin hast thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that could reduce thee to this miserable estate wherein I now see thee? Then I recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him from point to point how I was cast away, and in what sort the fishermen had first brought me thither in their Barque, and afterwards had turned me out to the wide world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not find any body that would buy me. Hereat he seemed to be much astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so that musing a pretty while by himself, Know stranger, said he unto me, that I am but a poor Merchant, all whose wealth amounts not to above an hundred <hi>Pardains</hi> (which are worth two shillings a piece of our mony) with which I trade for the rows of Shads, thereby hoping to get my living; Now I am assured that I might gain something at <hi>Malaca,</hi> if so be the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the Officers of the Custom-house there, would not do me the wrong, which I have heard say they do to many Merchants that come thither to traffique; wherefore if thou thinkst that for thy sake I should be well used there, I could be contented to redeem thee from the fishermen, and go thither with thee. Thereunto I answered him, with tears in mine eyes, that considering the state I was in at the present, it was not likely he could give credit to any thing I said, because it was probable that to free my self out of my miserable captivity I would prize my person at a far higher value then it would be esteemed for at <hi>Malaca</hi>; howbeit if he would lend any belief to my oaths, since I had no other assurance to give him, I would swear to him, and also set it under my hand, that if he would carry me to <hi>Malaca,</hi> the Captain should do him a great deal of honor for my sake, and besides the exempting of his Merchandise from paying of custom, he should receive ten times as much as he should disburse for me. Well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> I am contented to redeem, and reconduct thee to <hi>Malaca,</hi> but thou must take heed that thou speakest not a word of that we have concluded on, for fear thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters hold thee at so dear a rate, as I shall not be able to draw thee out of their hands though I would never so fain; whereupon I gave him my faith to do nothing but what he would have me do, especially in that particular, which I held to be most necessary for the better effecting of our desire.</p>
            <p>Four days after this agreement, the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Merchant,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> that he might the more easily redeem me, used the interposure of a man born in the Country, who under hand went to the fishermen, and carried the business so cunningly with them, as they quickly consented to my redemption, for they were already very weary of me, as well in regard that I was sickly, as for that I could no way stand them in any stead, and therefore, as I delivered before, they had turned me out of doors, where I had continued a month and better; so by the means of this third person, whom the <hi>Mahometan</hi> had employed, the fishermen sold me to the Merchant for the sum of seven <hi>mazes</hi> of gold, which amounts in our mony to seventeen shillings and six pence. The <hi>Mahometan</hi> as soon as he had redeemed me, brought me to his house, where I was five days out of the tyranny of these fishermen, and in a far better captivity then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; At the end whereof my new Master went five leagues off to a place, named <hi>Sorobaya,</hi> where he got his Merchandise aboard, which, as I said before, was nothing but the rows of Shads; For there is such great abundance of them in that River, as the Inhabitants do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with every year lade above two thousand Vessels, which carry at least an hundred and fifty, or two hundred Barrels, whereof each one contains a thousand rows, the rest of the fish not yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a peny. After that the <hi>Mahometan</hi> had laden a <hi>Lanchara</hi> with this commodity, he presently set sail for <hi>Malaca,</hi> where within a while he safely arrived, and carrying me to the Fortress presented me to the Captain, relating unto him what agreement we had made together. <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> was so amazed to see me in such a lamentable plight, as the tears stood in his eyes, whereupon he bade me speak out aloud, that he might know whether it was I that he beheld, for that I did not seem to be my self, in regard of the strange deformity of my face. Now because that in three months space there had been no news of me, and that every one thought me to be dead, there came so manyfolks to see me, as the Fortress could scarce hold them:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50126:24"/>
Here being demanded the occasion of my mis-fortune, and who had brought me into that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable case, I recounted the adventures of my Voyage, just in the same manner as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready delivered them, whereat the whole company were so astonished, that I saw some go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without speaking a word, and others shrink up their shoulders, and bless themselves in admiration of that which they had heard from me; but in conclusion their compassion towards me was such, that with the very alms they bestowed on me I became far richer then I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I undertook that unlucky Voyage. As for <hi>Pedro de Faria,</hi> he caused threescore duckets to be given to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Merchant that brought me, besides two pieces of good <hi>China</hi> Damask; moreover he freed him of all the duties he was to pay for the custom of his Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, which amounted to very near a like sum, so as he remained exceeding well satisfied of the bargain he had made with me. After this, to the end I might be the better used and looked unto, the Captain commanded me to be lodged in the Registers house of the Kings Customs, where for that he was married there he thought I might be better accommodated then in any other place, as indeed I was very well entreated by him and his wife, so that having kept my bed about the space of a month, it pleased God to restore me unto my perfect health.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>When I had recovered my health, <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> sent for me to the Fortress, where he questioned me about that which had past betwixt me and the King of <hi>Aaru,</hi> as also how and in what place I was cast away, whereupon I made him an ample relation thereof. But before I proceed any further, it is requisite I should here report what was the success of the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kings of <hi>Aaru</hi> and <hi>Achem,</hi> to the end, that the desolation, which I have so often foretold, of our Fortress of <hi>Malaca,</hi> may the more evidently appear, it being a matter of too much importance for to be so neglected as it is by those, who ought to have more care of it. For this is certain, that either the power of the King of <hi>Achem</hi> is utterly to be ruined, or by it we shall be miserably expelled out of all the Countries we have conquered all along the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Coast, as <hi>Malaca, Banda, Maluco, Sunda, Borneo,</hi> and <hi>Timor,</hi> and Northwards, <hi>China, Iapan,</hi> and the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>qmos,</hi> as also many other parts and Ports, where the <hi>Portugals</hi> are very much interessed by reason of the Traffique which they dayly use there, and where they reap more profit then in any other place, that is yet discovered, beyond the Cape of good hope, the extent thereof being so great, that it contains along the Coast above three thousand leagues, as may easily be seen by the cards and globes of the world, if so be their graduation be true. Besides, if this loss should happen, which God of his infinite mercy forbid, though we have but two much deserved it for our carelessness and sins, we are in danger in like manner to lose the Customs of <hi>Mandorim</hi> of the City of <hi>Goa,</hi> which is the best thing the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> hath in the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> for they are Ports and Islands, mentioned heretofore, whereon depends the greatest part of his Revenue, not comprehending the Spices, namely, the Nutmegs, Cloves, and Maces, which are brought into this Kingdom from those Countries. Now to return to my discourse, I say, that the Tyrant of <hi>Achem</hi> was advised by his Councel how there was no way in the world to take <hi>Malaca,</hi> if he would assail it by Sea, as he had done divers times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when as <hi>Dom Stephano de Gama</hi> and his Predecessors were Captains of the Fortress, but first to make himself Master of the Kingdom of <hi>Aaru,</hi> to the end he might afterwards fortifie himself on the River of <hi>Panetican,</hi> where his Forces might more commodiously and nearly maintain the War he intended to make: For then he might have means with less charge to shut up the Straights of <hi>Cincapura,</hi> and <hi>Sabaon,</hi> and so stop our Ships from passing to the Seas of <hi>China, Sunda, Banda,</hi> and the <hi>Molucques,</hi> whereby he might have the profit of all the Drugs which came from that great Archipelague; And verily this counsel was so approved by the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that he prepared a Navy of an hundred and threescore Sails, whereof the most part were <hi>Lanchares</hi> with oars, Galiots, <hi>Calabuzes</hi> of <hi>Iaoa,</hi> and fifteen Ships high built, furnished with Munition and Victual. In these Vessels he imbarqued seventeen thousand men, namely twelve thousand Soldiers, the rest Sailers and Pioners. Amongst these were four thousand Strangers, <hi>Turks, Abissins, Malabares, Gusurates,</hi> and <hi>Lusons</hi> of the Isle of <hi>Borneo.</hi> Their General was one, named <hi>Heredin Mahomet,</hi> Brother-in-law to the Tyrant, by marriage with a Sister of his, and Governor of the Kingdom of <hi>Baarros.</hi> This Fleet arrived safely at the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Panetican,</hi> where the King of <hi>Aaru</hi> attended them with six thousand of his own natural Subjects, and not a forraigner amongst them, both in regard he wanted mony for to entertain Soldiers, and that also he had a Country unprovided of victual to feed them. At their arrival the Enemies found them fortifying of the Trench, whereof I spake heretofore; Whereupon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50126:24"/>
without any further delay they began to play with their Ordnance, and to batter the Town on the Sea side with great fury, which lasted six whole days together. In the mean time the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged defended themselves very valiantly, so as there was much blood spilt on either side: The General of the <hi>Achems,</hi> perceiving he advanced but little, caused his Forces to Land, and mounting twelve great Pieces he renewed the battery three several times with such impetuosity, that it demolished one of the two Forts that commanded the River, by means whereof, and under the shelter of certain packs of Cotton which the <hi>Achems</hi> carried before them, they one morning assaulted the principal Fortress: In this assault an <hi>Abissin</hi> commanded, called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medecan,</hi> who a month, or thereabout, before was come from <hi>Iuda,</hi> to confirm the new League made by the Bassa of <hi>Caire</hi> on the behalf of the grand <hi>Signior</hi> with the Tyrant of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi> whereby he granted him a Custom-house in the Port of <hi>Pazem.</hi> This <hi>Abissin</hi> rendered himself Master of the Bulwark, with threescore <hi>Turks,</hi> forty <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> and some <hi>Malabar</hi> Moo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King following his good fortune, at the same instant caused the gates of the Trench to be opened, and sallying out with a good part of his Forces, he combated his Enemies so valiantly, as he quite routed them; In like manner he took eight of their twelve Pieces of Ordnance, and so retreating in safety he fortified himself the best he could for to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain his Enemies future assaults.</p>

               </gap>ly put in execution, that in seventeen days it was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted nine several times, in so much as by divers sorts of fire-works, continually invented by a <hi>Turkish</hi> Engineer, that was in their Camp, they demolished the greater part of the Trench; Moreover they overthrew two of the principal Forts on the South side, together with a great Platform, which in the manner of a false-bray defended the entry of the River, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the resistance the King of <hi>Aaru</hi> could make with his people, though they behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so valiantly, as the <hi>Achems</hi> lost above two thousand and five hundred men, besides those that were hurt, which were far more then the slain, whereof the most part dyed shortly after for want of looking to. As for the King of <hi>Aaru,</hi> he lost not above four hundred men, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit for that his people were but few, and his Enemies many, as also better ordered, and better armed, in the last assault, that was given on the thirteenth day of the Moon, the business ended unfortunately by the utter defeat of the King of <hi>Aaru</hi>'s Forces; For it was his ill hap, that having made a salley forth by the advice of a <hi>Cacis</hi> of his, whom he greatly trusted, it fell out that this Traytor suffering himself to be corrupted with a bar of gold, weighing about forty thousand duckets, which the <hi>Achem</hi> gave him, whereof the King of <hi>Aaru</hi> being ignorant, set couragiously on his Enemies, and fought a bloody battel with them, wherein the advantage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained on his side in all mens judgment, but that Dog, the perfidious <hi>Cacis,</hi> whom he had left Commander of the Trench, sallied forth with five hundred men, under colour of seconding the King in his pursuit of so prosperous a beginning, and left the Trench without any manner of defence, which perceived by one of the Enemies Captains, a <hi>Mahometan Malabar,</hi> named <hi>Cutiale Marcaa,</hi> he presently with six hundred <hi>Gusarates</hi> and <hi>Malabars,</hi> whom he had led thither for that purpose, made himself Master of the Trench, which the traytrous <hi>Cacis</hi> for the bar of gold he had received had left unguarded, and forthwith put all the sick and hurt men that he found there to the sword, amounting to the number of about fifteen hundred, whereof he would not spare so much as one. In the mean time the unhappy King of <hi>Aaru,</hi> who thought of nothing less then the treachery of his <hi>Cacis,</hi> seeing his Trench taken, ran to the succoring of it, being a matter that most imported him: But finding himself the weaker, he was constrained

to quit the place, so that as he was making his retreat to the Town ditch, it was his ill fortune to be killed by a shot of an Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>quebuse from a <hi>Turk</hi> his enemy. Upon this death of his ensued the loss of all the rest, by reason of the great disorder it brought amongst them. Whereat the Enemies exceedingly rejoycing, took up the Corps of that wretched King, which they found amongst the other dead bodies, and having imbowelled and salted him they put him up in a Case, and so sent him as a Present to the Tyrant, who, after many ceremonies of Justice, caused him to be publiquely sawed into sundry pieces, and then boiled in a great Cauldron full of Oyl and Pitch, with a dreadful Publication, the tenor whereof was this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>See here the Iustice, which</hi> Sultan Laradin, <hi>King of the Land of the two Seas, hath caused to be executed, whose will and pleasure it is, that as the body of this miserable Mahometan hath been sawed in sunder, and boiled here on Earth, so his Soul shall suffer worse torments in Hell, and that most worthily, for his transgressing of the Law of</hi> Mahomet, <hi>and of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect belief of the</hi> Musselmans <hi>of the House of</hi> M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>After that this infortunate King of <hi>Aaru</hi> had miserably ended his days, as I have before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and that his whole Army was utterly defeated, both the Town and the rest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were easily and quickly taken in. Thereupon the General of the <hi>Achems</hi> repaired the Trenches, and fortified them in such manner as he thought requisite for the conservation and security of all that he had gained: which done, he left there a Garison of eight hundred of the most couragious men of his Army, who were commanded by a certain <hi>Lusan Mahometan,</hi> named <hi>Sapetù de Raia,</hi> and incontinently after departed with the rest of his Forces. The common report was that he went to the Tyrant of <hi>Achem,</hi> who received him with very much honor for the good success of this enterprize; For, as I have already delivered, being before but Governor and <hi>Mandara</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Baarros,</hi> he gave him the title of King, so that ever after he was called <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Baarros,</hi> which is the proper denomination of such as are Kings amongst the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> Now whilest things passed in this sort, the desolate Queen remained some seven leagues from <hi>Aaru,</hi> where being advertised and assured of the death of the King her husband, and of the lamentable issue of the War, she presently resolved to cast her self into the fire, for so she had promised her husband in his life time, confirming it with many and great oaths; But her friends and servants, to divert her from putting so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate a design in execution, used many reasons unto her, so that at length, overcome by their perswasions, <hi>Verily,</hi> said she unto them, <hi>although I yield to your request, yet I would have you know, that neither the considerations you have propounded, nor the zeal you seem to sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50126:25"/>
themselves such things as they needed, in which regard if she could possibly have continued this War other twenty days longer, she had so famished them, as they would have been constrained to render the Town: But because at that time it rained continually by reason of the Climate, and that the place was boggy and full of bushes, as also the fruits, wherewithall they nourished themselves in the Wood, were all rotten, so that the most part of her people fell sick, and no means there to relieve them, the Queen was constrained to depart to a River, named <hi>Minha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çumbaa,</hi> some five leagues from thence, where she imbarqued her self in sixteen Vessels, such as she could get, which were fishermens <hi>Paroos,</hi> and in them she went to <hi>Malaca,</hi> with a belief that at her Arrival there she should not be denyed any thing she would ask.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pedro de Faria,</hi> being advertised of the Queens coming, sent <hi>Alvaro de Faria,</hi> his son,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> and General of the Sea-forces, to receive her with a Galley, five Foists, two Catures, twenty Balons, and three hundred men, besides divers persons of the Country. So she was brought to the Fortress, where she was saluted with an honorable peal of Ordnance, which lasted the space of a good hour. Being landed, and having seen certain things, which <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> desired to shew her, as the Custom-house, the River, the Army, the Manufactures, stores of Powder, and other particulars, prepared before for that purpose, she was lodged in a fair house, and her people, to the number of six hundred, in a field, called <hi>Ilher,</hi> in Tents and Cabbins, where they were accommodated the best that might be. During all the time of her abode, which was about a matter of five months, she continued soliciting for succor, and means to revenge the death of her husband. But at length perceiving the small assistance she was likely to have from us, and that all we did was but a meer entertainment of good words, she determined to speak freely unto <hi>Pedro de Faria,</hi> that so she might know how far she might trust to his prom ses; To which end, attending him one Sunday at the gate of the Fortress, at such time as the place was full of people, and that he was going forth to hear Mass, she went to him, and after some complements between them, she said unto him; <hi>Noble and valiant Captain, I bese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Consider, I pray you, that albeit I am a Mahometan, and that for the greatness of my sins I am altogether ignorant in the knowledg of your holy Law, yet in regard I am a woman, and have been a Queen, you ought to carry some respect to me, and to behold my misery with the eyes of a Christian.</hi> Hereunto at first <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> knew not what to answer, in the end putting off his cap, he made her a low reverence, and after they had both continued a good while without speaking, the Queen bowed to the Church gate, that was just before them, and then spake again to <hi>Pedro de Faria. Truly,</hi> said she, <hi>the desire I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had to revenge the death of my husband, hath been, and still is, so great, that I have resolved to seek out all the means that possibly I may to effect it, since by reason of the weakness of my sex Fortune will not permit me to bear arms; Being perswaded then that this here, which is the first I have tryed, was the most assured, and that I more relyed upon then any other, as trusting in the ancient amity which hath always been betwixt us and you Portugals, and the obligation wherein this Fortress is engaged to us, passing by many other considerations well known to you, I am now to desire you with tears in mine eyes, that for the honor of the high and mighty King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>my soveraign Lord, and unto whom my husband was ever a loyal Subject and Vassal, you will ayd and succor me in this my great adversity, which in the presence of many noble Personages you have promised me to do; howbeit now I see that in stead of performing the promises which you have so often made me, you alledg for an excuse that you have written unto the Vice-roy about it, whereas I have no need of such great Forces as you speak of, for that with an hundred men only, and such of my own people as are flying up and down in hope and expectation of my return, I should be able enough, though I be but a woman, in a short space to recover my Country, and revenge the death of my husband, through the help of Almighty God, in whose Name I beseech and require you, that for the service of the King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>my Master, and the only refuge of my widowhood, you will, since you can, assist me speedily, because expedition is that which in this affair imports the most, and so doing you shall prevent the plot which the wicked enemy hath upon this Fortress, as too well you may perceive by the means he hath used to effect it. If you will be pleased to give me the succor I demand of you, say so; if not, deal clearly with me, for that you will prejudice me as much in making me lose time, as if you refused me that which so earnestly I desire, and which as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian you are obliged to grant me, as the Almighty Lord of Heaven and Earth doth well know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom I take to witness of this my request.</hi>

               <hi>PEdro de Faria,</hi> having heard what this desolate Queen said openly unto him, convinced by his own conscience,<note place="margin">1.</note> and even ashamed of having delayed her in that fashion, answered her, that in truth, and by the faith of a Christian, he had recommended this affair unto the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, and that doubtless there would some succor come for her ere it were long, if so be there were no trouble in the <hi>Indiaes</hi> that might hinder it, wherefore he advised and prayed her to stay still in <hi>Malaca,</hi> and that shortly she should see the verity of his speeches. Thereunto this Princess having replyed upon the uncertainty of such succor, <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> grew into choller, because he thought she did not believe him, so that in the heat of his passion he lashed out some words that were more rude then was fit. Whereupon the desolate Queen, with tears in her eyes, and beholding the Church gate, which was just against her, and sobbing in such manner as she could scarcely speak; <hi>The clear Fountain,</hi> said she, <hi>is the God which is adored in that house, out of whose mouth proceeds all truth, but the men of the Earth are sinks of troubled water, wherein change and faults are by nature continually remaining, wherefore accursed is he that trusts to the opening of their lips; For I assure you, Captain, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To him she recounted all that had past betwixt her and <hi>Pedro de Faria,</hi> and how she had lost all hope of our friendship; Unto whom, it is said, the King made this answer, <hi>That he did not marvel at the little faith she had found in us, for that we had shewed it but too much upon sundry occasions unto all the world.</hi> Now the better to confirm his saying, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited some particular examples of matters, which he said had befallen us, conformable to his purpose; and like a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and our Enemy, he made them appear more enormous then they were: So after he had recounted many things of us very ill done, amongst the which he interlaced divers Treacheries, Robberies, and Tyrannies, at length he told her, that as a good King, and a good <hi>Mahometan,</hi> he would promise her, that ere it were long she should see her self by his means restored again to every foot of her Kingdom; and to the end she might be the more assured of his promise, he told her that he was content to take her for his wife, if so she pleased, for that thereby he should have the greater cause to become the King of <hi>Achems</hi> Enemy, upon whom for her sake he should be constrained to make War, if he would not by fair means be perswaded to abandon that which he had unjustly taken from her. Whereunto she made answer, that albeit the honor he did her was very great, yet she would never accept of it, unless he would first promise, as in way of a dowry, to revenge the death of her former husband, saying, it was a thing she so much desired, as without it she would not accept of the Soveraignty of the whole world. The King condescended to her request, and by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath taken on a Book of their Sect confirmed the promise which to that effect he made her.</p>

I, thine Ally in flesh and in blood, do give thee to understand by my Embassador, that about the seventh Moon of this present year the noble Widow</hi> Anchesiny, <hi>Queen of</hi> Aaru, <hi>came to me full of grief and tears, and prostrating her self on the ground before me, she told me that thy Captains had taken her Kingdom from her, as also the two Rivers of</hi> Lava <hi>and</hi> Panetican, <hi>and slain</hi> Alibon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car <hi>her husband, together with five thousand</hi> Amborraias <hi>and</hi> Ouroballons, <hi>all men of mark, that were with him, and made three thousand children slaves, which had never offended, tying their hands behind them, and scourging them continually without pity, as if they had been the sons of unbelieving mothers. Wherefore being moved with compassion I have received her under the protection of my faith, to the end that I might with more certainty inform my self of the reason and right thou hadst so to do, and perceiving by her oaths that thou hadst none, I have taken her to my wife, that I might the more freely before God demand that which is hers. I desire thee then, as being thy true Brother, that thou wilt render that thou hast taken from her, and thereof make her a good and full restitution; And touching the proceeding that is to be held in this restitution which I demand of thee, it is to be done according to the manner that</hi> Syribican <hi>my Embassador will shew thee.

escaped, and the other hundred threescore and six were taken, and in them were thirteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and five hundred men killed, besides the fourteen hundred that were slain in the Trench. These fourteen Sails that so escaped returned to <hi>Achem,</hi> where they gave the Tyrant to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how all had past, at which, it is reported, he took such grief, as he shut up himself for twenty days without seeing any body, at the end whereof he struck off the heads of all the Captains of the fourteen Sails, and commanded all the Soldiers beards that were in them to be shaved off, enjoyning them expresly upon pain of being sawed asunder alive, to go ever after attired in womens apparel, playing upon Timbrels in all places where they went, and that whensoever they made any protestation, it should be in saying, <hi>So may God bring me back my husband again, as this is true,</hi> or, <hi>So may I have joy of the children I have brought into the world.</hi> Most of these men seeing themselves inforced to undergo a chastisement so scandalous to them, fled their Country, and many made themselves away, some with poyson, some with halters, and some with the sword.

Thus was the Kingdom of <hi>Aaru</hi> recovered from the Tyrant of <hi>Achem,</hi> and remained in the hands of the King of <hi>Iantana</hi> until the year 1574.

            <p>TO return unto the Discourse where I left, I say,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> that when I was recovered of the sickness which I got in my Captivity at <hi>Siaca, Pedro de Faria,</hi> desiring to find out some occasion to advance and benefit me, sent me in a <hi>Lanchara</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>Pan</hi> with goods of his, to the value of ten thousand duckets, for to consign them into the hands of a Factor of his, that recided there, named <hi>Tome Lobo,</hi> and from thence to go to <hi>Patava,</hi> which is an hundred leagues beyond that. To that purpose he gave me a Letter and a Present for the King, and an ample Commission to treat with him about the redemption of five <hi>Portugals,</hi> who in the Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> were Slaves to <hi>Monteo de Bancha</hi> his Brother-in-law. I parted then from <hi>Malaca</hi> upon this employment, and the seventh day of our Voyage, just as we were opposite to the Island of <hi>Pullo Timano,</hi> which may be distant from <hi>Malaca</hi> some ninety leagues, and ten or twelve from the mouth of the River of <hi>Pan,</hi> a little before day we heard at two several times great lamentations at Sea, and being not able in regard of the darkness of the night to know what it was, we were all suspended into divers opinions, for that we could not imagine what it should be, in so much that to learn the certainty thereof I caused them to hoist up sail, and row towards that part where we heard the lamentation, every one looking down round about close to the water, the better to discern and hear that of which we were in such doubt. After we had continued a pretty while in this manner, we perceived far from us a black thing that floated on the Sea, and unable at first to discover what it was, we advised together about it. Now there being but four <hi>Portugals</hi> of us in the <hi>Lanchara,</hi> we were all of different minds, so that I was told how I was to go directly to the place whither <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> had sent me, that losing but an hours time I might endanger the Voyage, and hazard the goods, and so for want of performing the duty of my charge I might very much wrong him. Whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that happen what might, I would not leave off laboring to know what it was, and that if in so doing I committed any fault, the <hi>Lanchara</hi> appertained to none but <hi>Pedro de Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> unto whom my self was to render an account of the goods in it, and not they, that had nothing else in the Vessel but their persons, which were in no more danger then mine: During this debate it pleased God that the day appeared, by the light whereof we perceived p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

were cast away, who floated pell-mell together upon planks, and other pieces of wood: Whereupon without further fear we turned our prow towards them, and with force of sails and oars we made to them, hearing them cry six or seven times, without using any other speech, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us.</hi> At the sight of this strange and pitiful spectacle we remained so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, that we were almost besides our selves, and causing some of the Mariners to get with all speed into the Cock-boat, they fetcht three and twenty persons of them into the Lanchara, namely fourteen <hi>Portugals,</hi> and nine Slaves, which were all so dis-figured in the face, as they made us afraid to look on them, and so weak as they could neither speak nor stand. After they had been thus taken up by us, and entreated in the best manner we could, we demanded of them the cause of their mis-fortune, whereunto one of the company we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next day we perceived that our Junk sank, so that of an hundred forty and seven persons that were in her there were saved but six and twenty, and now it is fourtain days that we have been upon these planks, having during all that time eaten nothing but a slave of mine that dyed, with whom we have sustained our selves eight days, and the very last night two <hi>Portugals</hi> more dyed, on whom we would not feed, although we were very much prest to it by our hunger, because we hoped that this or the next day would give an end both to our lives and misery.</p>

This done, we went to seek out the Port of <hi>Pan,</hi> where we arrived near about midnight, casting anchor in the Roade, just against a little inhabited place, called <hi>Campalaru.</hi> The next morning by break of day we rowed up the River about some league to the Town, where we found <hi>Tome Lobo,</hi> who, as I have already declared, resided there, as Factor for the Captain of <hi>Malaca,</hi> into whose hands I consigned all the Merchandise that I brought along with me. The same day three of the fourteen <hi>Portugals,</hi> which we took up at Sea, dyed, whereof the afore-named <hi>Fernando Gil Porcalho</hi> was one, as also five young men that were Christians, whom we cast all into the Sea, with great stones tyed to their feet and about their necks for to make them sink to the bottom, in regard we could not be permitted to bury them in the Town, although <hi>Tome Lobo</hi> offered them forty duckets for that purpose, the reason they alledged was, that if they should suffer it, their Country would remain accursed, and incapable of nourishing any thing, because the deceased were not purged from the Hogs flesh they had eaten, it being the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable and enormous sin of all others; As for those which rested alive, <hi>Tome Lobo</hi> gave them very good entertainment, and furnished them with all things that they wanted, until such time as they recovered and returned to <hi>Malaca.</hi> Not long after, preparing my self for my Voyage to <hi>Patana, Tome Lobo</hi> very earnestly desired me not to go thither, and told me that he held not himself safe in that Town, by reason he was advertised that one <hi>Taan N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50126:28"/>
in part of payment given him rotten stuffs, which he could make nothing of; moreover, that for all his five thousand duckets worth of Commodities, that in <hi>Malaca</hi> would have yielded him ten thousand, and by exchange of vendible wares, he might easily have returned, would have made him ten thousand more, he never could get above seven hundred duckets; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be revenged of this wrong, he had picked quarrels of purpose to tole him forth to kill him, in regard whereof he instantly desired me to stay, and not abandon him and the Captains stock to such apparant danger: Whereupon having used all the reasons I could to facilitate my voyage, he would by no means approve of them, but contradicted me in all my propositions. For conclusion, I remonstrated unto him, that if it were his ill fortune, as he said he feared, to be killed for that which he had, I should be in no better case, and therefore I marvelled why he would let those eleven <hi>Portugals</hi> go, with whom rather he should have imbarqued himself for <hi>Malaca.</hi> Hereunto after a little pause he made answer, that he was very sorry he had not done so, but since it was now too late, he intreated me not to forsake him in this extremity, and that for the Captains sake, who he knew would not take it well I should leave him so alone with his goods, which were no less worth then thirty thousand duckets, besides those belonging to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that amounted to almost as much more. This request of his made to me with such instance on the one side, somewhat perplexed me, and on the other considering the extream hazard I ran if I stay'd, I knew not what to resolve; At length after I had well thought of the matter, I was constrained to come to this accord with him, that in case he did not within fifteen days imbarque himself with me in my <hi>Lanchara</hi> for <hi>Patana,</hi> with all his Commodities reduced into gold, or stones, whereof there was great plenty in the Town, that then I might go where I pleased without him; an offer that he was forced to accept of, and so we remained agreed.</p>
            <p>The fear <hi>Tome Lobo</hi> was in, left that wherewithall he was threatened should befall him,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> made him use such diligence in selling away of his commodities, that by means of the good peny-worths he afforded them at, in less then eight days he cleared his Warehouse, and the other places wherein they lay; so that utterly refusing Pepper; Cloves, and such other Drugs, which took up too much room, he trucked all away for gold of <hi>Menencabo,</hi> for Diamonds of <hi>Lavo</hi> and <hi>Taucampura,</hi> and Pearls of <hi>Borneo.</hi> Now having made a full dispatch of all, and that we were resolved to imbarque the next day, by ill fortune a most terrible accident happened the night ensuing, which was, that one, named <hi>Coin Geinal,</hi> the King of <hi>Borneo's</hi> Embassador, who had been three or four years resident in the King of <hi>Pan's</hi> Court, and a marvelous rich man, killed the King upon finding him in bed with his wife, which caused such a commotion in the Town, that it seemed to be a Tumult of Hell rather then any humane business; Whereupon certain rogues and vagabonds, that wished for nothing more then such like occasions, to the end they might do what before for fear of the King they durst not enterprize, made a Troop of five or six hundred, which separated into three bands, went directly to the house, where <hi>Tome Lobo</hi> dwelt. Having assaulted it in six or seven places, they entred by force, notwithstanding all the resistance we could make, and that in defending it we lost eleven men, whereof the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi> which came with me from <hi>Malaca,</hi> were three. During this violence, all that <hi>Tome Lobo</hi> could do was to escape away with six great blows of a sword, one of the which had cut his right cheek almost away, so as he was like to dye of that hurt. We were both of us then constrained to abandon the house to them, together with all the goods that were in it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the <hi>Lanchara,</hi> where we remained with five Boys and eight Mariners, not having so much as the worth of a peny left of all our merchandize, which amounted to fifty thousand crowns in gold and stone only. In this <hi>Lanchara</hi> we past away all the night very much afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and still harkening what might be the end of this mutiny, which was risen among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as I have before related. At length perceiving the matters grew worse and worse, and that there was no hope for us to recover any part of our goods, we thought it a far safer course to go away to <hi>Patana,</hi> then by staying to run a hazard of being killed, as above four thousand persons were. With this resolution we parted from this place, and in six days arrived at <hi>Patana,</hi> where we were very well received by the <hi>Portugals</hi> which were in that Country, unto whom we recounted all that had past at <hi>Pan</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the pitious estate wherein we had left that miserable Town. This accident very much afflicted them, so that desiring to give some remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, with a true affection of charitable Christians they went all to the Palace of the King, and complained to him of the wrong that had been done to the Captain of <hi>Malaca,</hi> beseeching him thereupon they might be permitted to recover, if it were possible, the loss they had sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have leave granted to right themselves upon any merchants goods belonging to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50126:29"/>
Kingdom of <hi>Pan,</hi> to the value of the sum they had been despoyled of. The King having heard their complaint, and presently granting what they demanded; It is reasonable, said he, that you should do as you have been done unto, and that you should spoyl them that first have spoyled you, especially in a matter that concerns the Captain of <hi>Malaca,</hi> unto whom all of you are so much obliged. The <hi>Portugals,</hi> having rendred him very humble thanks for this grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their houses, where they concluded to seize upon all the goods they could meet with belonging to the Kingdom of <hi>Pan,</hi> until such time as they had fully recovered their loss. It hapned then about nine days after they being advertised, that some ten leagues off, in the river of <hi>Calantan,</hi> were three Junks of <hi>China,</hi> very rich, and appertaining to <hi>Mahometan</hi> Merchants, Natives of the Kingdom of <hi>Pan,</hi> that by foul weather at Sea were constrained to put in there, our people resolved to fall upon them: To which effect, out of three hundred <hi>Portugals,</hi> that were then in the Country, we chose out fourscore, with whom we imbarqued our selves in two Foysts, and one round ship, well provided of all things we thought to be necessary for this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize. So we departed three days after with all speed, for fear lest the <hi>Mahometans</hi> of the Country, having discovered our design, should advertise them of it whom we went to seek; Of these three vessels one <hi>Ioano Fernandez Dabrea,</hi> born in the Isle of <hi>Madera,</hi> was General, who with forty Soldiers went in the round ship, and the other two Foysts were commanded by <hi>Laurenco de Goes,</hi> and <hi>Vasco Sermento,</hi> both of them of the City of <hi>Braganea</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and very well experienced in Sea-service. The next day we arrived at the river of <hi>Calentan,</hi> where as soon as we decryed the three Junks riding at anchor, which we had been told of, we set very valiantly upon them, and albeit those that were in them did at first do their best endevor to defend themselves, yet at length all their resistance was in vain, for in less then an hour we reduced them all under our power, so as seventy and four of theirs were slain, and but three of ours, though we had many men hurt. I will not hold you here with any particular discourse of what was done on either side, let it suffice, that after the three Junks had rendred themselves, we presently set sail, and carryed them away with us in all haste, because the whole Country thereabout was in an uproar, directing our course towards <hi>Patana,</hi> where by the favor of a fair wind we arrived the next day in the afternoon: Having then cast anchor, we saluted the Town with a peal of Ordnance in sign of joy, which put the <hi>Mahometans</hi> of the Country out of all patience; for though we stood in the terms of good friends with them, yet they left not to use all possible means, both of Presents which they gave to the Governors and the Kings Favorites, and otherwise, for to make our prizes voyd, and that the King would expel us out of his dominions, whereunto he would at no hand consent, saying, that he would not for any thing in the world break the peace, which his Ancestors had made with the Christians of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca,</hi>

Thus were the fifty thousand duckets recovered, that <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> and <hi>Tome Lobo</hi> had lost, and the <hi>Portugals</hi> were in great esteem over all that Country, so that their valor rendred them very formidable to the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> A little after the Soldiers assured us, that in the three Junks we had taken, there was only in lingo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now for as much as the said <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> had brought along with him some ten or twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand crowns worth of <hi>Indian</hi> woolen and linnen cloth, which he had taken up on his credit at <hi>Malaca,</hi> and that he saw there was so little utterance of that commodity, as he could not meet with any Merchant that would deal for it, he was fain to resolve for to spend the winter there until such time as he might meet with some opportunity to put it off; Howbeit he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised by some of the best experienced of the Country to send it unto <hi>Lugor,</hi> which is a great Town in the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> an hundred leagues lower towards the North, for they alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this Port was very rich, and of great vent, by reason of a world of Junks that arrived there dayly from the Isle of <hi>Iaoa,</hi> from <hi>Lava, Taniampura, Iapara, Demaa, Panaruca Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayo, Passarvan, Solor,</hi> and <hi>Borneo,</hi> whose Merchants were used to give a good rate for such like commodities, in exchange of gold, or stone. This advice was well approved of by <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio de Faria,</hi> who instantly went about to put it in execution; To which end he took order for the providing of a vessel, by reason the Foyst wherein he came was altogether unfit for a further voyage: Matters thus disposed of, he deputed one, named <hi>Christovano Borhalho,</hi> for his Factor, a man exceeding well vers'd in business of Traffique, with whom there imbarqued some sixteen men, as well Soldiers as Merchants, with a hope that one crown would yield them six or seven, what in the commodities they should carry, as in those they should return. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wretched I being one of the sixteen, we parted from the Port on a Saturday, and sailed with a favorable wind along the coast till Thursday next in the morning, that we arrived at <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor</hi> Road, and anchored at the mouth of the River; There it was thought fit to pass the rest of the day, to the end we might inform our selves of what was behoveful for us to do, as well for the sale of our commodities, as for the safety of our persons: And to say truth, we learnt such good news, that we were confident of gaining above six times double, and to be sure of freedom and liberty during all the month of <hi>September,</hi> according to the Ordinance of the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> because it was the month of the Kings <hi>Sumbayas.</hi> Now the better to clear this, you must know, that all along this coast of <hi>Malaya,</hi> and within the Land, a great King commands, who for a more famous and recommendable Title above all other Kings, causeth himself to be called <hi>Prechau Saleu,</hi> Emperor of all <hi>Sornau,</hi> which is a Country wherein there are thirteen Kingdoms, by us commonly called <hi>Siam,</hi> to the which fourteen petty Kings are subject, and yield homage, that were anciently obliged to make their personal repair unto <hi>Odiaa,</hi> the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal City of this Empire, as well to bring their Tribute thither, as to do the <hi>Sumbaya</hi> to their Emperor, which was indeed to kiss the Courtelas that he ware by his side; Now because this City was seated fifty leagues within the Land, and the Currents of the Rivers so strong, as these Kings were oftentimes forced to abide the whole winter there to their great charge, they petitioned the <hi>Prechau,</hi> King of <hi>Siam,</hi> that the place of doing this their homage might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, whereupon he was pleased to ordain, that for the future there should be a Viceroy resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Town of <hi>Lugor,</hi> which in their language is called <hi>Poyho,</hi> unto whom every three years those fourteen Kings should render that duty and obedience they were accustomed to do unto himself, and that during that time they spent there in performing the same, being the whole month of <hi>September,</hi> both their own merchandize, and that of all others, as well natives as strangers, that either came in, or went out of the Country, should be free from all manner of imposts whatsoever: So that we arriving in the time of this freedom, there was such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Merchants that flocked thither from all parts, as we were assured there was no less then fifteen hundred Vessels in the Port, all laden with an infinity of Commodities of very great value: And this was the good news we learnt at such time as we arrived at the mouth of the River; wherewith we were so well pleased, that we presently resolved to put in as soon as the wind would permit us. But alass! we were so unfortunate, that we could never come to see what we so much desired; for about ten of the clock, just as we had dined, and were preparing to set sail, we saw a great Junk coming upon us, which perceiving us to be <hi>Portugals,</hi> few in number, and our Vessel small fell close with our prow on the larboard side, and then those that were in her threw into us great Cramp-irons, fastened unto two long chains, wherewithall they grappled us fast unto them, which they had no sooner done, but straightway some seventy or eighty <hi>Mahometans</hi> came flying out from under their hatches, that till then had lien lurking

The next day, being the seventh of our disaster, about Sun-set we espyed a great Barque coming rowing up the River, whereupon as soon as it was near us, we prostrated our selves on the ground, beseeching those that were aboard her to take us in; They wondering at us, presently made a stand, seeming much amazed to see us so on our knees, and our hands lift up to Heaven, as though we were at our prayers; nevertheless without speaking at all to us, they made as if they would go on, which constrained us afresh to cry aloud to them with tears that they would not suffer us for want of succor to dye miserably there.

            <p>This honorable woman, departing from the place where she found us,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> went some two leagues up the River, till she came to a little Village, where she lay that night; The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parting from thence, she made directly to the Town of <hi>Lugor,</hi> which was above five leagues further.

               <note place="margin">§. 1.</note>AS soon as <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> was ready, he departed from <hi>Patana</hi> on a Saturday the ninth of <hi>May,</hi> 1540. and steered North North-west, towards the Kingdom of <hi>Champaa,</hi> with an intent to discover the Ports and Havens thereof, as also by the means of some good booty to furnish himself with such things as he wanted; for his haste to part from <hi>Patana</hi> was such, as he had not time to furnish himself with that which was necessary for him, no not with victual and warlike ammunition enough. After we had sailed three days we had sight of an Island, called <hi>Pullo Condor,</hi> at the height of eight degrees and three quarters, on the North Coast, and almost North-west towards the mouth of the River of <hi>Camboia,</hi> so that having rounded all the Coast, we discovered a good Haven Eastward, where in the Island of <hi>Camboia,</hi> distant some six leagues from the firm Land, we met with a Junk of <hi>Lequios,</hi> that was going to the Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> with an Embassador from the <hi>Nautauquim</hi> of <hi>Lindau,</hi> who was Prince of the Island of <hi>Tosa,</hi> and that had no sooner discovered us but he sent a message by a <hi>Chinese</hi> Pilot to <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> full of complements, whereunto was added these words from them all: <hi>That the time would come when as they should communicate with us in the true love of the Law of God, and of his in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the <hi>Chinese</hi> arrived with this message they were distant above a league at Sea from us. Hereupon we went ashore, where we spent three days in taking in fresh water, and fishing. Then we put to Sea again, laboring to get to the firm Land, there to seek out a River, named <hi>Pullo Cambim,</hi> which divides the State of <hi>Camboia</hi> from the Kingdom of <hi>Champaa,</hi> in the height of nine degrees, where arriving on a Sunday the last of <hi>May,</hi> we went up three leagues in this River, and anchored just against a great Town, called <hi>Catimparu,</hi> there we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained twelve days in peace, during the which we made our provision of all things necessary.

Harquebusiers of our Nation should go and assault it, without doubt they would carry it: Moreover that in another of those Villages, called <hi>Buaquirim,</hi> there was a quarry, where out of an old Rock they digged a great quantity of Diamonds, that were very fine, and of greater value then those of <hi>Lava</hi> and <hi>Taniampura</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Iaoa.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Antonio de Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> having questioned them about many other particularities, they made him a relation of the fertility of the Country, which was further up this River, no less fit to be desired, then easie to be conquered, and that with little charge.</p>
            <p>Being departed from this River of <hi>Pullo Cambim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> we sailed along the Coast of the Kingdom of <hi>Champaa,</hi> till we came to an Haven, called <hi>Saleyzacau,</hi> seventeen leagues farther on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, whereinto we entred. Now because there was nothing to be gotten there, we went out of this place about sun-setting, and the next morning we came to a River, named <hi>Toobasoy,</hi> without the which <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> cast anchor, because the Pilot would not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to enter into it, for that he had never been there before, and therefore knew not the depth of it. As we were contesting hereabout, some for to enter, and others gainsaying it, we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned a great sail making towards this Port from the main Sea. Hereupon, without stirring from the place where we were, we prepared to receive them in a peaceable manner, so that as soon as they came neer us, we saluted them, and hung up the flag of the Country, called <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachina,</hi> which is a sign of friendship, used among them in such like occasions. They of the ship, in stead of answering us in the same manner, as in reason it seemed they should have done, and knowing that we were <hi>Portugals,</hi> to whom they wished not well, gave us very vile and base words, and from the top of their poup made a capher slave hold up his arse bare to us with a mighty noise and din of Trumpets, Drums, and Bells, by way of scorn and derision of us. Whereat <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> was so offended, that he gave them a whole broad side, to see if that would make them more courteous; To this sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We conceived by their silent approaching to us, that they were the Enemies we had seen over night, so that <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> said unto us, <hi>My masters, this is some Pyrat coming to set upon us, who thinks we are not above six or seven at the most, as the manner is in such kinde of Vessels; wherefore let every man stoop down, so as they may not see any of us, and then we shall soon know their design; in the mean time let the pots of powder be made ready, with which, and our swo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, <hi>here present, slew about two years ago in</hi> Liampao, <hi>with five and twenty other</hi> Portugals <hi>that were in his ship. Antonio de Faria</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, cryed out, like a man amazed, and said, Nay now I care not for knowing any more; is this then that dog <hi>Similau,</hi> that slew thy master? <hi>Yes,</hi> answered he, <hi>it is he, and that meant likewise to have done as much to you, thinking that ye were not above six or seven, for which effect he came away in haste with a purpose, as he said, to take you alive, for to make your brains fly out of your heads with a frontal of cord, as he did to my Master, but God I hope will pay him for all the mischief he hath committed. Antonio de Faria</hi> being also advertised by this slave, that this dog <hi>Similau</hi> had brought all his men of war along with him, and left none in his Junk but some <hi>Chinese</hi> Mariners, he resolved to make use of this good fortune, after he had put <hi>Similau</hi> and his companions to death, by making their brains fly out of their heads with a cord, as <hi>Similau</hi> had done to <hi>Gaspar de Mello,</hi> and the other <hi>Portugals</hi> in <hi>Liampao:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he presently imbarqued himself with thirty Soldiers in his Boat, and the three <hi>Machna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lood and a favorable wind, he arrived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less then an hour, where the Junk rode at anchor within the River about a league from us, whereupon he presently boarded her, and made himself master of the poup, from whence, with only four pots of powder, which he cast in among the Rascals that were asleep upon the hatches, he made them all leap into the Sea, where nine or ten of them were drowned, the rest crying out for help were taken up and saved, because we stood in need of them for the navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Junk, that was a great tall Vessel. Thus you see how it pleased God out of his divine justice to make the arrogant confidence of this cursed dog a means to chastise him for his cruelties, and to give him by the hands of <hi>Portugals</hi> a just punishment for that which he had done unto them. The next morning, taking an inventory of this prize, we found six and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> parted from this River of <hi>Toobasoy</hi> on a Wednesday morning, being <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Eve, in the year 1540. and sailed along by the Coast of the Kingdom of <hi>Champaa,</hi> fearing to abandon it, the wind being Easterly, which in that place is oftentimes very impetuous, especially in the conjunction of the new and full Moons. The Friday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we found our selves just against a River, called by the inhabitants of the Country <hi>Tinaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reu,</hi> and by us <hi>Varella,</hi> whereinto we thought fit to enter, as well to be informed of certain things <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> desired to know, as also to see whether he could learn any news of <hi>Coia Acem</hi> whom he sought for, in regard that all the Junks of <hi>Siam,</hi> and of all the Coast of <hi>Malaya,</hi> that sail to <hi>China,</hi> use to trade in this River, where many times they sell their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities well in exchange of gold, <hi>Calembouc</hi> wood, and Ivory, whereof there is abundance in that Kingdom; and having cast anchor a little within the mouth of the River, over against a Village, named <hi>Taquilleu,</hi> there came a number of <hi>Paroos,</hi> and many other small Boats with fishermen, full of refreshments, who having never seen men made like unto us, said one to another; <hi>Lo, this is a strange novelty wherewithall God doth visit us, let us beseech him he will be pleased, that these bearded men may not be such as for their particular profit do spy Countries like Merchants, and afterwards rob them like Theeves. Let us get to the woods for fear lest the sparks of these firebrands do not burn up our houses, and reduce the fields of our labors into ashes, as they use to do unto the Lands of other men.</hi> Whereunto some of them
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50126:32"/>
made answer, God forbid it should be so; but if by misfortune they should come amongst us, let us carry our selves in such sort, as they may not perceive we fear them as Enemies, for so they would set upon us with the more confidence; wherefore the best course for us will be, in a fair way, and with gentle words, to endevor to learn of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m what they would have of us, that upon knowledg thereof we may certifie it unto <hi>Hoyaa Paquir,</hi> who is now at <hi>Congrau. Antonio de Faria,</hi> making as though he did not understand them, although all that they said was delivered to him by an Interpreter, received them very courteously, and bought the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshments, which they brought, of them at their own price, wherewithall they were very well satisfied; And they demanding of him from whence he came, and what he would have, he answered them, that he was of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> and as a Merchant was going to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique in the Isle of <hi>Lequios,</hi> being come into that place only to learn some news of a friend of his named <hi>Coia Acem,</hi> that was also bound thither: whereupon he enquired of them whether he were past by, or no; howsoever he intended to depart thence suddenly, both for to lose no time, as for that he knew he could not sell his commodities there. To which they replyed, You say true, for in this village of ours there is nothing but nets and fisher Boats, wherewith we get our living, and that poorly enough God knows. Howbeit, added they, if thou wilt go up the River to the Town of <hi>Pilaucacem,</hi> where the King is, thou wilt sell not only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which are in thy ships, be they never so rich, but likewise more then ten such ships as thine could carry, by reason that there are Merchants in that place so wealthy, and that drive so great a trade, as they go with whole Troops of Elephants, Oxen, and Camels, whom they send laden with goods to the Lands of the <hi>Lauhos, Pafuaas,</hi> and <hi>Gueos,</hi> which are inhabited by very rich people. <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> seeing a good occasion offered to inform himself of that he desired to know, questioned them at large concerning many things, whereunto some of them, that seemed to be of more authority then the rest, answered very aptly, how the River, where we rode at anchor, was called <hi>Tinacoreu,</hi> and that it extended to <hi>Moncalor,</hi> a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Further, they told us, that these Countries were divided into Kingdoms, and Regions inhabited with people, that were white, tawny, and others somewhat blacker; and that in exchange of those commodities they returned Gold, Diamonds, and Rubies. Having thereupon demanded of them whether those people had Arms, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered none, but staves hardened in the fire, and daggers with blades two spans long; They also assured us that from hence one could not go thither by the River in less then half two months, or two months and an half, by reason of the impetuosity of the waters descending with a great and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So continuing his course very discreetly, he came to a place where he beheld a mighty company of great and small Ships, to the number as he guessed of thousand Sails, passing through the which very stilly he arrived at a Town of above ten thousand housholds, enclosed with a strong wall of Brick, with Towers and Bulwarks after our manner, and with Curtains full of water.

Being returned to <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> they related unto him what they had seen, particularly the great Army that lay up in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as also the Junk, which they had left rid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

These news so rejoyced him, that instantly he weighed anchor, and set sail, saying, his mind gave him that it was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly he; and if it proved so, he assured us all that he was contented to lose his life in fighting with him, for to be revenged of such a Rogue as had done him so much wrong. Approaching within sight of the Junk, he commanded the Lorch to pass unto the other side of her, to the end they might board her both together at once, and charged that not a Piece should be shot off, for fear they should be heard of the Army that lay up in the River, who might thereupon come to discover them. As soon as we were come to the Junk, she was presently invested by us, and twenty of our Soldiers leaping in made themselves Masters of her without any resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for the most of her men threw themselves into the Sea, the rest that were more couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous valiantly made head against our people; but <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> presently getting in with twenty Soldiers more made an end of defeating them, killing above thirty of theirs, so as there remained none alive but those which voluntarily cast themselves into the Sea, whom he caused to be drawn up to serve for the Navigation of his Vessels, and for to learn who they were, and from whence they came, to which purpose he commanded four of them to be put to torture, whereof two chose rather to dye so then to confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

At this report <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> striking himself on the brest, as a man amazed at this discourse, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> said he, <hi>this seems to be a dream that I hear</hi>; then turning himself to his Soldiers that stood about him, he related the life of this <hi>Quiay</hi> unto them, and further affirmed, that he had slain at times in strayed Vessels above an hundred <hi>Portugals,</hi> and despoyled them of an hundred thousand duckets at least; And though his name was such, as this <hi>Armenian</hi> delivered, to wit, <hi>Quiay Taijano,</hi> yet after he had killed <hi>Christovano Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinha</hi> in <hi>Cincaapura,</hi> in a vain-glory of that which he had done he caused himself to be called Captain <hi>Sardinha.</hi> Whereupon having demanded of the <hi>Armenian</hi> where he was, he told us, that he was very sore hurt, and hidden in the hold of the Junk amongst the Cables with five or six others. Hereat <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> arose, and went directly to the place where this Dog was hidden, followed by the greatest part of his Soldiers, which opened the scuttle where the Cables lay to see whether the <hi>Armenian</hi> spake true or no; in the mean time the Dog, and the six others that were with him, got out at another scuttle, and most desperately fell upon our men, who were above thirty in number, besides fourteen boys. Then began there so furious and bloody a fight, that in less then a quarter of an hour we made a clean dispatch of them all, but in the mean while two <hi>Portugals,</hi> and seven boys were slain, besides I know not how many hurt, whereof <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> received two downright blows on his head, and one on his arm, which put him to very much pain. After this defeat, and that the wounded men were drest, he set sail, for fear of the forty Junks that were in the River: So getting far from Land, about evening we went and anchored on the other side of <hi>Cauchenchina,</hi> where <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> causing an Inventory to be taken of all that was in this Pyrats Junk, there was found in her five hundred Bars of Pepper, after fifty quintals to the Bar, forty of Nutmegs and Mace, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score of Tin, thirty of Ivory, twelve of Wax, and five of Wood of fine Aloes, which might be worth according to the rate of the Country seventy thousand duckets; besides a little field Piece, four Faulcons, and thirty Bases of Brass, the greatest part of which Artillery had been ours, for this <hi>Mahometan</hi> had taken them in the ships of <hi>Sardinha, Oliveyra,</hi> and <hi>Bartole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meu de Matos:</hi> There were also found three Coffers covered with Leather, full of Silk quilts, and the apparel of <hi>Portugals,</hi> with a great Bason and Ewer silver and guilt, and a Salt-seller of the same, two and twenty Spoons, three Candlesticks, five guilt Cups, eight and fifty Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzes, twelve hundred twenty and two pieces of <hi>Bengala</hi> Cloth, all which were <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals</hi> goods, eighteen quintals of Powder, and nine Children about seven or eight years of age, chained together by the hands and the feet, most lamentable to behold, for that they were so weak and lean, that one might easily through their skins have counted all the bones in their bodies.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 1.</note>THe next day after noon, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> parted from the place where he rode at anchor, and returned towards the Coast of <hi>Ainan,</hi> by the which he kept all the rest of that day, and the next night with five and twenty or thirty fathom water. In the morning he came to a Bay, where there were many great Boats fishing for Pearls, and being unresolved what course to take, he bestowed all the forenoon in counsel with his company thereabout, whereof some were of the opinion that he should seize upon the Boats that were fishing for Pearls, and others opposed it, saying, it was a safer way to treat with them as Merchants, for that in exchange of the great store of Pearls, which were in that place, they might easily put off the most part of their Commodities. This appearing to be the best and safest advice, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> caused the Flag of Trade to be hung out, according to the Custom of <hi>China,</hi> so that instantly there came two Lanteaas from Land to us, which are Vessels like to Foists, with great abundance of refreshments, and those that were in them, having saluted us after their manner, went aboard the great Junk wherein <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> was; but when they beheld men, such as we were, having never seen the like before, they were much amazed, and demanded what people we were, and wherefore we came into their Country. Whereunto we answered by an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that we were Merchants born in the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> and were come thither to sell or barter our Commodities with them, if so be they would permit us. To this, an old man, much respected of all the rest, replyed, that here was no Traffique used, but in another place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urther forward, called <hi>Guamboy,</hi> where all strangers that came from <hi>Cantan, Chincheo, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau, Comhay, Sumbor, Liampau,</hi> and other Sea-coast Towns, did ordinarily trade: Wherefore he counselled him to get him suddenly from thence, in regard this was a place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined only to the fishing of Pearls for the Treasure of the house of the son of the Sun, to the which, by the Ordinance of the <hi>Tutan</hi> of <hi>Comhay,</hi> who was the soveraign Governor of all the Country of <hi>Cauchenchina,</hi> no Vessel was permitted to come, but only such as were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that service, and that all other ships, which were found there, were by the Law to be burnt, and all that were in them; but since he, as a stranger, and ignorant of the Laws of the Country, had transgressed the same, not out of contempt, but want of knowledg, he thought fit to advertise him of it, to the end he might be gone from thence before the arrival of the <hi>Mandarim</hi> of the Army, which we call General, to whom the Government of that fishing appertained, and that would be within three or four days at the most, being gone not above six or seven leagues from thence to a Village, named <hi>Buhaquirim,</hi> for to take in Victual. <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> thanking him for his good advice, asked him how many Sails, and what Forces the <hi>Mandarim</hi> had with him: Whereunto the old man answered, that he was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with forty great Junks, and twenty five <hi>Vancans</hi> with oars, wherein there were seven thousand men, namely, five thousand Soldiers, and the rest Slaves and Mariners; and that he was there every year six Months, during the which time was the fishing for Pearls, that is to say, from the first of <hi>March</hi> to the last of <hi>August.</hi> Our Captain desiring to know what du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were payd out of this fishing, and what revenue it yielded in those six Months, the old man told him, that of Pearls which weighed above five Carats they gave two thirds, of the worser sort h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lf less, and of seed Pearl the third part; and that this Revenue was not always alike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the fishing was sometimes better in one year, then in another, but that one with another he thought it might yield annually four hundred thousand <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is. Antonio de Faria</hi> made very much of the old man, and gave him two cakes of Wax, a bag of Pepper, and a tooth of Ivory, wherewith both he and the rest were exceedingly well pleased. He also demanded of them, of what bigness this Isle of <hi>Ainan</hi> might be, whereof so many wonders were spoken. Tell us first, replyed they, who you are, and wherefore you are come hither, then will we satisfie you in that you desire of us; for we vow unto you, that in all our lives we never saw so many young fellows together in any Merchants ships, as we now see in this of yours, nor so spruce and ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t; and it seems that in their Country <hi>China</hi> Silks are so cheap as they are of no esteem, or else that they have had them at so easie a rate, as they have given nothing near the worth for them, for we see them play away a piece of Damask at one cast at Dice, as those that come

lightly by them: A speech that made <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> secretly to smile, for that thereby he well perceived how these fishermen had a shrewd guess that the same were stollen, which made him tell them, that they did this like young men, who were the sons of very rich Merchants, and in that regard valued things far under that they were worth, and had cost their fathers; dissembling then what they thought, they answered in this manner, It may very well be as you say. Whereupon <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> gave a sign to the Soldiers to leave off their play, and to hide the pieces of Silk that they were playing for, to the end they might not be suspected for Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by these folks, which immediately they did, and the better to assure these <hi>Chineses</hi> that we were honest men, and Merchants, our Captain commanded the scuttles of the Junk to be opened, that we had taken the night before from Captain <hi>Sardinha,</hi> which was laden with Pepper, whereby they were somewhat restored to a better opinion then they had of us before, saying one to another, Since now we find that they are Merchants indeed, let us freely answer to their demand, so as they may not think, though we be rude, that we know nothing but how to catch fish and Oysters.</p>

               <hi>since now I know what you are, and that only out of curiosity you fairly require to learn this particular of me, I will clearly tell you all that I know thereof, and what I have heard others deliver concerning it, that have been elder then my self, and which have a long time governed this Archipelague; They said then, that this Island was an absolute State under a very rich and mighty King, who, for an higher and more transcendent title then other Monarchs his Contemporaries car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, caused himself to be stiled</hi> Prechau Gam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheless I will not counsel you to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbarque your goods on land, but to sell them in your Vessels, in regard that many times the sight causeth desire, and desire disorder amongst peaceable persons, much more with them that are mutinous and of an evil conscience, whose wicked inclination carries them rather to take away another mans goods from him, then give of their own to the needy for Gods sake. This said, both he that spake, and those that accompanyed him, took leave of our Captain, and us, with many complements and promises, whereof they are not ordinarily very sparing in those parts, bestowing on <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> in return of that he had given them, a little Box made of a Tortoise shell, full of seed-pearl, and twelve pearls of a pretty bigness, craving his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for that they durst not traffique with him in this place, for fear lest if they should do so, to be all put to death, conformably to the Law of the rigorous justice of the Country; and they again intreated him to make haste away before the <hi>Mandarims</hi> arrival with his Army, for if he found him there, he would burn both his Vessel, and him and all his company. <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> unwilling to neglect the counsel of this man, lest that which he told him should prove true, he set sail immediately, and passed to the other side towards the South, and in two days with a Westerly wind he arrived at the River of <hi>Tanauquir,</hi> where just over against a little village, called <hi>Neytor,</hi> he cast anchor.</p>

Whereupon he commanded a Manchuas, which is a little boat, to be made ready, wherein he and this man went and sought for him amongst the other dead bodies that floated on the water, where they found him with a great cut over his head, and a thrust quite through the body; so causing him to be taken up, and layd upon the hatches, he demanded of that man again, if he were sure that this was he, who answered, how without doubt it was he. Whereunto <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> gave the more credit, by reason of a great chain of gold he had about his neck, to which was fastned an Idol of gold with two heads, made in the form of a Lizard, having the tail and paws enammelled with green and black, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to be drawn towards the prow, he caused his head to be chopt off, and the rest of the body to be cut in pieces, which were cast into the Sea.</p>

Both the Junks were great and good, yet were we constrained to burn one of them for want of Mariners to man it: There was in them besides seventeen pieces of brass Ordnance, namely four Faulconets, and thirteen small pieces, the most part whereof had the Royal Arms of <hi>Portugal</hi> upon them, for the Pyrat had taken them in the three ships where he killed the forty <hi>Portugals.</hi> The next day <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> went about once more to get into the River, but he was advised by fishermen, which he took a little before, that he should beware of going to the Town, because they were advised there of all that had passed betwixt him and the renegado Pyrat, for whose death the people were in an uproar, in so much that if he would let them have his commodities for nothing, yet would they not take them, in regard that <hi>Chileu,</hi> the Governor of that Province, had contracted with him, to give him the third part of all the prizes he took, in lieu whereof he would render him a safe retreat in his Country; so that his loss now being great by the death of the Pyrat, he should be but badly welcomed by him, and to that purpose had already commanded two great Rafts, covered with dry wood, barrels of pitch, and other combustible stuff, to be placed at the entering into the Port, that were to be kindled and sent down upon us, as soon as we had cast anchor, for to fire us, besides two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Paraos,</hi> full of shot, and men of war were also in readiness to assault us.

After we had continued so three days together, with a contrary wind, and in great want of victual, our good fortune about Evening brought four <hi>Lanteaas</hi> unto us, that are like unto Foysts, in one of the which was a Bride, that was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Village, named <hi>Pandurea:</hi> Now because they were all in jollity, they had so many Drums beating aboard them, as it was almost impossible to hear one another for the noise they made. Whereupon we were in great doubt what this might be, and wherefore there was such triumphing; some thought that they were spies sent from the Captain of <hi>Tanauquir's</hi> Army, who insulting, for that we were already in their power, gave this testimony thereof. <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> left his anchors in the Sea, and preparing himself to sustain all that might happen unto him, he displayed all his Banners and Flags, and with demonstration of joy attended the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of these <hi>Lanteaas,</hi> who when they perceived us to be all together, imagining it was the Bridegroom that stay'd to receive them, they came joyfully towards us. So after we had salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one another after the manner of the Country, they went and anchored by the shore. And because we could not comprehend the mystery of this affair, all our Captains concluded that they were spies from the Enemies Army, which forbore assaulting us in expectation of some other Vessels that were also to come; In this suspicion we spent the little remainder of that Evening, and almost two hours of the night: But then the Bride, seeing that her Spouse sent not to visit her, as was his part to do, to shew the love she bore him she sent her Uncle in one of the <hi>Lanteaas</hi> with a Letter to him, containing these words. <hi>If the feeble sex of a woman would permit me to go from the place where I am for to see thy face, without reproach to mine honor, assure thy self that to kiss thy tardy feet my body would fly as doth the hungry Faulcon

All the answer we made them was to lay hold of them, and clap them presently under hatches; now because the most part of them were drunk, those that were in the <hi>Lanteaa</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard our bustling with them, nor if they had, could they have had time to escape, for sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly from the top of our poup we fastned a cable to their mast, whereby they were so arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it was impossible for them to get loose of us; whereupon casting in some pots of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der amongst them, the most of them leapt into the Sea, by which time six or seven of our Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and as many Mariners, got into the <hi>Lanteaa,</hi> and straight rendred themselves masters of her, where the next thing they did was to take up the poor wretches, who cryed out that they drowned: Having made them sure, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> went towards the other three <hi>Lanteaas,</hi> that anchored some quarter of a league from thence, and coming to the first, wherein was the Bride, he entred her without any resistance, in regard there were none other in her but a few Mariners, and six or seven men, that seemed to be of good reckoning, all of kin to the Bride, being there only to accompany her, together with two little boys her brothers, that were very white, and certain ancient women, of such as in <hi>China</hi> are hired for mony to dance, sing, and play of instruments upon like festival occasions. The other two <hi>Lanteaas</hi> beholding this sad success, left their anchors in the Sea, and fled in such haste, as if the Devil had been in them, but for all that we took one of them, so that we had three of the four: This done, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned aboard our Junk, and by reason it was now midnight, we did nothing for the present but take our prisoners, and shut them up under the hatches, where they remained until day, that <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> came to view them, and seeing they were most of them aged, full of sorrow, and fit for nothing, he caused them to be set a shore, retaining only the Bride, and her two brothers, because they were young, white, and well-favored, and some twenty Mariners, which afterwards were of great use to us for the navigation of our Junks.

Upon the appearing of the Moon, which was about eleven of the clock, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> sent away one of his <hi>Lanteaas,</hi> well furnished, and twelve Soldiers in her, besides the Captain, named <hi>Valentino Martins Dalpoem,</hi> a discreet man, and of great courage, that at other times had given good proof of himself in like occasions, who departing went always sounding the depth of the River, until he arrived where divers Vessels rode at anchor; There he took two men that were sleeping in a Barque laden with earthen ware, and returning aboard undiscovered he rendred <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> an accompt of what he had found touching the greatness of the place, and the fewness of the Ships that were in the Port, wherefore his opinion was, that he might boldly enter into it, and if it happened he could not trade there as he desired, no body could hinder him from issuing forth whensoever he pleased, by reason the River was very large, clean, and without any shelves, sands, or other things that might endanger him. Having consulted then with his company, he concluded by their advice, not to put the two <hi>Mahometans,</hi> that were taken, to torture, as was before ordained, because there was no need of it; Day being come, <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio de Faria</hi> desiring, before he stirred, to be informed from those two <hi>Mahometans</hi> of some particulars he would fain know, and thinking he might sooner prevail with them by fair mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, then by menaces and torment, he made very much of them, and then declared his mind: Whereupon both of them with one accord said, that touching the entrance of the River there was nothing to be feared, in regard it was one of the best in all that Bay, and that ordinarily far greater Vessels then his went in and out there, for that the shallowest place was fifteen fathom at the least, and as for the people of the Country he was not to stand in any doubt of them, by reason they were naturally weak, and without arms; And that the strangers, which were at that instant there, arrived some nine days before from the Kingdom of <hi>Benan</hi> in two Companies of fifty Oxen a piece, laden with store of Silver, Wood of Aloes, Cloth, Silk, Linnen, Ivory, Wax, Lacre, Benjamin, Camphire, and Gold in Powder, like to that of the Isl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

into the world, clothed with a humane form, they said No, because there could be nothing that might oblige him to so great an extremity, in regard he was through the excellency of the divine Nature delivered from our miseries, and far esloigned from the Treasures of the Earth, all things being more then base in the presence of his splendor. By these answers of theirs, we perceived that these people had never attained to any knowledg of our truth, more then their eyes made them to see in the picture of Heaven, and in the beauty of the day, for continually in their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayes,</hi> which are their prayers, lifting up their hands they say, <hi>By thy works, Lord, we confess thy greatness.</hi> After this <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> set them at liberty, and having given them certain presents, wherewith they were very well pleased, he caused them to be conveyed to Land; that done, the wind beginning a little to rise he set sail, having all his Vessels ado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To this offer they rendred no answer, but detained him that carried the message prisoner; <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> seeing that his messenger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned not, set s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>il immediately, hanging forth a number of flags, as one that cared not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he sold or no; Whereupon the Merchants strangers, that were come thither to trade, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Commodities, of which they hoped to make some profit, to be going out of the Port, through the perversness and obstinacy of the <hi>Nautarel</hi> of the Town, they went all to him, and desired him to recall <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> otherwise they protested to complain to the King of the injustice he did them, in being the cause of hindring their Traffique. The <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarel,</hi> that is the Governor, with all the Officers of the Custom-house, fearing left they might upon this occasion be turned out of their places, condescended to their request, upon condition, since we would pay but ten in the hundred, that they should pay five more, whereunto they agreed, and instantly sent away the Merchant, whom they had detained prisoner, with a Letter full of complements, wherein they declared the agreement they had made. <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> answered them, that since he was out of the Port, he would not re-enter it upon any terms,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50126:38"/>
by reason he had not leasure to make any stay, howbeit if they would buy his Commodities in gross, bringing lingots of silver with them for that purpose, he would sell them to them, and in no other manner would deal, for he was much distasted with the little respect the <hi>Nautarel</hi> of the Town had carried towards him, by despising his messages; and if they were contented to accept thereof, that then they should let him know so much within an hour at the farthest, otherwise he would sail away to <hi>Ainan,</hi> where he might put off his Commodities far better then there. They finding him so resolved, and doubting to lose so fair an occasion, as this was, for them to return into their Country, embarqued themselves in five great Lighters with forty chests full of lingots of silver, and a many sacks to bring away the Pepper, and arriving at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio de Faria</hi>'s Junk, they were very well received by him, unto whom they represented anew the agreement they had made with the <hi>Nautarel</hi> of the Town, greatly complaining of his ill Government, and of some wrongs, which without all reason he had done them; but since they had pacified him by consenting to give him fifteen in the hundred, whereof they would pay five, they desired him to pay the ten, as he had promised, for otherways they could not buy his Commodities. Whereunto <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> answered, that he was contented so to do, more for the love of them, then for any profit he hoped to reap thereby, for which they gave him many thanks, and so being on all sides agreed they used such diligence in discharging the goods, as in three days the most of it was weighed and consigned into the hands of the owners thereof; whereupon the accompts were made up, and the lingots of silver received, amounting in all to an hundred and thirty thousand <hi>Taeis,</hi> after the rate of seven shillings and six pence the <hi>Taei,</hi> as I have said elsewhere. And though all possible speed was used herein, yet before all was finished, news came of that which we had done to the Pyrat in the River of <hi>Tananquir,</hi> in so much that not one of the inhabitants would come near us afterward, by reason whereof <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> was constrained to set sail in all haste.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>After we had quit the River of <hi>Mutepinan,</hi> directing our course Northward, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> thought good to make to the Coast of the Island of <hi>Ainan,</hi> for to seek out a River, named <hi>Madel,</hi> with a purpose there to accommodate the great Junk, wherein he was, because it took in much water, or provide himself of a better in exchange upon any terms whatsoever; So having sailed for the space of twelve days with a contrary wind, at length he arrived at the Cape of <hi>Pullo Hinhor,</hi> which is the Island of Cocos; There hearing no news of the Pyrat he sought for, he returned towards the South Coast, where he took certain Prizes, which were of good value, and well gotten as we thought. For it was the main intention of this Captain to deal with the Pyrat, which frequented this Coast of <hi>Ainan,</hi> as they before had done with divers Christians in depriving them of their lives and goods; For as God doth ordinarily draw good out of evil, so it pleased him out of his divine Justice to permit, that <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> in revenge of the Robbery, committed by <hi>Coia Acem</hi> upon us in the Port of <hi>Lugor,</hi> should in the pursuit of him chastise other Theeves, that deserved to be punished by the hands of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals.</hi> Now having for certain days together with much labor continued our Navigation within this Bay of <hi>Cauchenchina,</hi> as we were newly entred into a Port, called <hi>Madel,</hi> upon the day of the nativity of our Lady, being the eight of <hi>September,</hi> for the fear that we were in of the new Moon, during the which there oftentimes happens in this Climate such a terrible storm of wind and rain, as it is not possible for ships to withstand it, which by the <hi>Chineses</hi> is named <hi>Tufan,</hi> and that the Sky charged full with Clouds had four days together threatened that which we feared, it pleased God amongst many other Junks that fled into this Port for shelter, there came in one belonging to a notorious <hi>Chinese</hi> Pyrat, named <hi>Hinimilau,</hi> who of a Gentile, that he had been, was not long before become a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> induced thereunto (as it was said) by a <hi>Cacis</hi> of that accursed Sect, who had made him such an Enemy to the Christian name, as he vaunted publiquely, that God did owe Heaven unto him for the great service he had done him upon Earth, in depopulating it by little and little of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who from their mothers wombs delighted in their offences, as the very Inhabitants of the smoaky House, a name which they give to Hell; And thus did he with such sayings, and other like blasphemies, speak as villanously and abominably of us as could be imagined. This Pyrat, entring into the River in a very great and tall Junk, came up to us where we rode at anchor, and saluted us after the custom of the Country, whereunto we returned the like, as it is the manner there to do at the entry into any of the Ports, they neither knowing us to be <hi>Portugals,</hi> nor we what they were; for we thought they had been <hi>Chineses,</hi> and that they came into the Port to shrewd themselves from the storm as others did, whereupon, behold,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50126:38"/>
five young men, that were Christians, whom this Robber held as Slaves in his Junk, guessing us to be <hi>Portugals,</hi> fell a crying out three or four times together, <hi>Lord, have mercy upon us.</hi> At these words we all stood up to see who they were, and perceiving them to be Christians, we called aloud to the Mariners for to stay their course, which they would not do, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily beating up a Drum, as it were in contempt of us, they gave three great shouts, and withall brandished their naked Scymitars in the ayr in a way of threatening us, and then cast an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor some quarter of a league beyond us. <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> desiring to learn the reason hereof, sent a <hi>Balon</hi> to them, which no sooner arrived near them, but the barbarous Rogues pelted them with so many stones, that the Vessel was almost overwhelmed, so that they were glad to return, both Mariners and Soldiers being very sore hurt; <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> seeing them come back all bloody, demanded the cause of it: <hi>Sir,</hi> answered they, <hi>we are not able to tell you, only you behold in what plight we are</hi>; saying so, and shewing him the hurts on their heads, they declared unto him in what manner they had been entertained. At first this accident much troubled <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> so that he stood musing a good while upon it, but at length turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to them that were present, <hi>Let every one here,</hi> said he, <hi>prepare himself, for I cannot be perswaded but this is that Dog</hi> Coia Acem, <hi>who I hope this day shall pay for all the wrong he hath done us.</hi> Whereupon he commanded presently to weigh anchor, and with all the speed that might be he set sail with the three Junks and Lanteas. Being come within a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket shot of them, he saluted them with six and thirty Pieces of Ordnance, whereof twelve were Faulconets, and other Field-pieces, amongst the which was one of Battery, that carried cast Bullets, wherewith the Enemies were so amated, as all the resolution they could take for the instant was to leave their anchors in the Sea, not having leasure to weigh them, and to make to the shoar, wherein also they failed of their desire; for <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> perceiving their design got before them, and boarded their Junk with all the Forces of his Vessels; hereupon began a most furious Combat both with Pikes, Darts, and pots full of Powder thrown from either side, so that for half an hour it could not be discerned who had the better: But at length it pleased God to favor us so much, that the Enemies, finding themselves weary, wounded, and hurt, threw themselves into the Sea. <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> seeing these wretches ready to sink by reason of the impetuousness and strength of the current, he imbarqued himself with some Soldiers in two Balons, and with much ado saved sixteen men, whereunto he was induced by the great need he stood in of them for the maning of his <hi>Lanteas,</hi> because he had lost a great many of his people in the former fights.</p>

Whereunto the Pyrat, being mad with rage, having answered that he could not tell, upon the second demand that was made him with menaces, he said, that if first they would give him a little water, in regard he was so dry as he was not able to speak, that then he would consider what answer to make. Thereupon having water brought him, which he drunk so greedily as he spilt the most part of it without quenching his thirst, he desired to have some more given him, protesting, that if they would let him drink his fill, he would oblige himself by the Law of <hi>Mahomets Alcoran</hi> voluntarily to confess all that they desired to know of him. <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> having given him as much as he would drink, questioned him again about the young Christians, whereto he replyed, that he should find them in the chamber of the prow; thereupon he commanded three Soldiers to go thither and fetch them, who had no sooner opened the scuttle to bid them come up, but they saw them lie dead in the place with their throats cut, which made them cry out, <hi>Iesus, Iesus, come hither we beseech you, Sir, and behold a most lamentable spectacle</hi>; hereat <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> and those that were with him, ran thither, and beholding those youths lying so o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

upon another, he could not forbear shedding of tears; having caused them then to be brought upon the deck, together with a woman and two pretty children, about seven or eight years old, that had their throats also cut, he demanded of the Pyrat why he had used such cruelty to those poor innocents: Whereunto he answered, that it was because they were Traytors, in discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves to those, which were such great Enemies to him as the <hi>Portugals</hi> were, and also for that having heard them call upon their Christ for help, he desired to see whether he would deliver them; as for the two infants, there was cause enough to kill them, for that they were the childr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n of <hi>Portugals,</hi> whom he ever hated: with the like extravagancy he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to many other questions, which were propounded to him, and that with so much obstinacy as if he had been a very Devil. Afterwards being asked whether<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he were a Christian, he answered, no, but that he had been one at such time as <hi>Don Paulo de Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> was Captain of <hi>Malaca.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> demanded of him, what moved him, since he had been a Christian, to forsake the Law of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> wherein he was assured of his salvation, for to embrace that of the false Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> from whence he could hope for nothing but the loss of his Soul. Thereunto he answered, that he was induced so to do, for that so long as he was a Christian, the <hi>Portugals</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways contemned him, whereas before when he was a <hi>Gentile</hi> they called him <hi>Quiay Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coda,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Signior</hi> Captain, but that respect immediately upon his Baptism for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook him, which he verily believed did arrive to him by <hi>Mahomets</hi> express permission, to the end it should open his eyes to turn <hi>Mahometan,</hi> as after he did at <hi>Bintan,</hi> where the King of <hi>Iantana</hi> was in person present at the ceremony, and that ever since he had much honored him, and that all the <hi>Mandarins</hi> called him brother, in regard of the vow he had made upon the holy Book of Flowers, that as long as he lived he would be a sworn Enemy to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and of all others that profest the Name of Christ, for which both the King and the <hi>Cacis Moulana</hi> had exceedingly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended him, promising that his Soul should be most blessed if he performed that vow. Being likewise demanded how long ago it was since he revolted, what <hi>Portugal</hi> Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels he had taken, how many men he had put to death, and what Merchandize he had despoyled them of? He answered, that it was seven years since he became a <hi>Mahometan</hi>; that the first Vessel he took was <hi>Luiso de Pavia's</hi> Junk, which he surprized in the River of <hi>Liamp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o</hi> with four hundred Bars of Pepper only, and no other spice, whereof having made himself master, that he had put to death eighteen <hi>Portugals,</hi> besides their slaves, of whom he made no reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because they were not such as could satisfie the Oath he had made; That after this prize he had taken four ships, and in them put to death above an hundred persons, amongst whom there was some threescore and ten <hi>Portugals,</hi> and that he thought the Merchandize in them amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fifteen or sixteen hundred Bars of Pepper, whereof the King of <hi>Pan</hi> had the better moity for to give him a safe retrait in his Ports, and to secure him from the <hi>Portugals,</hi> giving him to that purpose an hundred men, with commandment to obey him as their King. Being further demanded, whether he had not killed any <hi>Portugals,</hi> or lent an hand for the doing thereof, he said no, but that some two years before, being in the River of <hi>Choaboquec</hi> on the Coast of <hi>China,</hi> a great Junk arrived there with a great many <hi>Portugals</hi> in her, whereof an intimate friend of his, named <hi>Ruy Lobo,</hi> was Captain, whom <hi>Don Estevan de Gama,</hi> then Governor of the Fortress of <hi>Malaca,</hi> had sent thither in the way of commerce, and that upon the sale of his commodities going out of the Port, his Junk about five days after took so great a leak, as not being able to clear her, he was constrained to return towards the same Port from whence he parted, but that by ill fortune clapping on all his sails to get the sooner to Land, she was overset by the violence of the wind, so as all were cast away saving <hi>Ruy Lobo,</hi> seventeen <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi> and some slaves, who in their skiff made for the Island of <hi>Laman,</hi> without sail, without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that after he had taken them in, he was counselled by the <hi>Mahometans</hi> not to trust unto the friendship of Christians, lest he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger his own life, for when they had recovered strength, they would without doubt seize upon his Junk, and all the goods that were in her, it being their usual custom so to do in all places where they found themselves the strongest: wherefore fearing lest that which the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> suggested should befall him, he slew them all on a night as they slept, for the which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50126:39"/>

of day we set sail without any great notice taken of us. So returning to Sea, although it were with a contrary wind, in twelve days with a troublesom navigation he visited the shores both of the South and North Coasts, without incountring any thing worthy the observation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were replenished with a many of little Villages, whereof divers were inclosed with walls of brick, but not strong enough to withstand the force of thirty good Soldiers, the people of themselves being very weak, and having no other Arms but staves hardned in the fire; howsoever the scituation of this Country was under one of the best and fertilest Climates on the Earth, abounding with great store of cattel, and many goodly large fields, sowed with Wheat, Rice, Barly, Millet, and sundry other kinds of grain; as also replenished with many great groves of Pine, and <hi>Angeline</hi> trees, as in the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> able to furnish a world of ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Moreover, by the relation of certain Merchants, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> was informed, that in this Land there were many Mynes of Copper, Silver, Tin, Saltpeter, Sulphur, and an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite deal of untilled, but excellently good ground, altogether neglected by this weak Nation, which were it in our power, we might in all probability be more advanced in the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> then now we are through the unhappiness of our sins.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>After we had been seven months and an half in this Country, sometimes on the one side, sometimes on the other, from River to River, and on both Coasts, North and South, as also in the Isle of <hi>Ainan,</hi> without hearing any news of <hi>Coia Acem,</hi> the Soldiers, weary of so long and tedious travel, assembled all together, and desired <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> to make a partition of that which had been gotten, according to a promise before made to them by a note under his hand, saying that thereupon they would return unto the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> or where else they thought good, whereby a great deal of stir arose amongst us; At length it was agreed, that we should go and winter in <hi>Siam,</hi> where all the goods which were in the Junk should be sold, and being reduced into gold, division should be made of it, as was desired. With this accord, sworn and signed by all, we went and anchored in an Island, called the Island of Thieves, in regard it was the outermost Island of all that Bay, to the end that from thence we might make our voyage with the first fair wind that should blow. So having continued there twelve days with an earnest desire to effect the agreement we had made together, it fortuned, that by the conjunction of the new Moon in <hi>October,</hi> which we had always feared, there arose such a tempest of rain and wind, as seemed to be no natural thing, in so much that lying open to the South wind, as we traverst the Coast, the waves went so high, that though we used all means possible to save our selves, cutting down our Masts, and all the dead works from poop to prow, as also casting into the Sea even the most part of our merchandize, reducing our great Ordnance into their places again, out of which they had been toss'd, and strengthening our Cables, that were half rotten, with ropes; But all this was not able to preserve us, for the night was so dark, the weather so cold, the sea so rough, the wind so high, and the storm so horrible, that in these extremities nothing could deliver us but the meer mercy of God, whom with continual cries and tears we called upon for help: But for as much as in regard of our sins we did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to receive this grace at his hands, his divine justice ordained, that about two hours after midnight there came such a fearful gust of wind, as drove our four vessels foul one of another upon the shore, where they were all broken to pieces, so that four hundred and fourscore men were drowned, amongst which were eight <hi>Portugals,</hi> and it pleased God that the remainder, being fifty three persons, were saved, whereof three and twenty were <hi>Portugals,</hi> the rest slaves and Mariners. After this lamentable shipwrack we got half naked, and most of us hurt, into a Marish hard by, where we stay'd till the next morning, and as soon as it was day we return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Sea side, which we found all strewed with dead bodies, a spectacle of that dread and horror as scarce any one of us could forbear swooning to behold it; over them we stood lamenting a great while, till such time an <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> who by the mercy of God was one of those that remained alive, whereof we were all very glad, concealing the grief which we could not dissemble, came where we were, having on a scarlet coat, that he had taken from one of the dead, and with a joyful countenance, his eyes dry and voyd of tears, he made a short speech unto us, wherein he remonstrated how variable and uncertain the things of this world were, and therefore he desired us as Brethren, that we would endevor to forget them, seeing the remembrance of them was but a means to grieve us; for considering the time and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This brief ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation was heard by us all with tears and discomfort enough, so we spent two days and an half there in burying the dead, during which time we recovered some wet victuals and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to sustain us withall, but they lasted not above five days of fifteen that we stayed there, for by reason of their wetness they corrupted presently, and did us little good. After these fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days it pleased God, who never forsakes them that truly put their trust in him, miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously to send us a remedy, whereby we escaped out of that misery we were in, as I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare hereafter.</p>

            <p>BEing escaped from this miserable shipwrack,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> it was a lamentable thing to see how we walked up and down almost naked, enduring such cruel cold and hunger, that many of us talking one to another fell down suddenly dead with very weakness, which proceeded not so much from want of victuals, as from the eating of such things as were hurtful to us, by reason they were all rotten, and stunk so vilely, that no man could endure the taste of them in his mouth; But as our God is an infinite good, there is no place so remote, or desert, where the misery of sinners can be hid from the assistance of his infinite mercy, which I speak, in regard that on the day when as the feast of S. <hi>Michael</hi> is celebrated, as we were drowned in tears, and without hope of any humane help, according as it seemed to the weakness of our little faith, a Kite came unexpectedly flying over our heads from behind a point, which the Island made towards the South, and by chance let fall a fish, called a Mullet, about a foot long. This fish falling close by <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> it somewhat amazed him till he perceived what it was, so that having considered a little he fell on his knees, and with tears pronounced these words from the bottom of his heart. <hi>O Lord Iesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, I humbly beseech thee by the sorrows of thy sacred Passion, that thou wilt not suffer us to be overwhelmed with the unbelief, whereinto the misery of our weakness hath cast us; for I hope, and am almost assured, that the same succor which thou didst send unto</hi> Daniel <hi>in the Lions den by the hand of thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> Abacuc, <hi>thou wilt grant us at this present out of thy infinite goodness, and not only here, but in every other place, where a sinner shall invoke thy ayd with a firm and true faith; Wherefore, my Lord, and my God, I pray thee, not for mine, but thine own sake, that thou wilt not cast thine eyes on that we have merited from thee, but on that thou hast merited for us, to the end it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ay please thee to accord us the succor which we hope to receive from thee, and out of thy blessed mercy to send us the means whereby we may get from hence into some Christian Country, where still persevering in the holy Worship of thee, we may for ever continue thy faithful servants.</hi> This said, he took the Mullet and caused it to be broiled upon coals, and given to such of the sick as had most need of it; Then looking towards the point of the Island from whence the Kite came, we perceived divers others, that in their flying made many stoopings, whence we concluded that there was some kind of prey there whereon these fowls fed; now all of us being most desirous of relief, we went thither in all haste, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the top of the higher ground we discovered a low valley full of divers fruit trees, and in the middle a river of fresh water, whereupon by good fortune before we went down we saw a Stag newly killed, and a Tyger beginning to eat him, therewith we made a great cry, which frighted him away into the Wood, leaving us the Stag as he was; Then descended we to the River, and by the bank of it stayd all that night, making a feast, as well with the Stag, as with divers Mullets that we took there, for there were a great number of Kites, that from the water catched a many of those fishes, and oftentimes let them fall being scared with our cries: Thus continued we by this River till Saturday following, when about the break of day we discerned a Sail making as we thought towards the Island where we were, the better to be assured where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we returned to the shoar where we were wracked, and there staying about half an hour, we found it to be so indeed, in which regard we got us presently into the Wood to decline disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from those in the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50126:41"/>
the better to accommodate a plank for to pass in and out of her. Being all dis-imbarqued out of her to about the number of thirty persons, more or less, they went presently some to making provision of water and wood, some to washing of their linnen, and dressing of meat, and others to wrastling, and such like pastimes, little thinking to find any body in that place which could any way annoy them. <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> seeing them altogether without fear and order, and that there was none remaining in the Vessel able to resist us; <hi>My Masters,</hi> said he unto us, <hi>you behold the wretched estate whereinto our mis-fortune hath reduced us, whereof I confess my sins are the cause, but the mercy of God is so infinite, as I am verily perswaded he will not suffer us to perish thus miserably here, and therefore hath as it were miraculously sent this Vessel hither, by seizing whereupon we may escape from hence, which before to humane reason seemed almost impossible; wherefore I exhort you all to joyn with me in making our selves Masters suddenly of her ere ever we be heard or seen, and having so done, let our only care be to possess our selves of the Arms we shall find in her, that therewith we may defend our selves, and make good our possession, upon which, next under God, our safety depends; and as soon as you shall hear me say three times,</hi> Jesus, <hi>do as you shall see me do:</hi> Whereunto we answered, that we would diligently perform what he had enjoyned us; so that we standing all prepared to execute his design, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> gave the signal which he had spoken of, and withall ran as fast as over he could, and we along with him, till he arrived at the <hi>Lantea,</hi> whereinto we suddenly entred without any contradiction; then unloosing the two cables with which she was fastened, we put out to Sea about a Crossbow shot from Land. The <hi>Chineses</hi> surprized in this manner, ran all to the Sea side upon the noise that they heard, and seeing their Vessel taken, were much amazed, but knew not how to help it, for we shot at them with an Iron Base that was in the <hi>Lantea,</hi> which made them fly into the Wood, where no doubt they passed the rest of that day in lamenting the sad success of their ill fortune, as we had done ours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>After we were gotten into the <hi>Lantea,</hi> and that we were sure the deceived <hi>Chineses</hi> could no way hurt us, we sat us down to eat that at leasure which they had caused to be made ready for their dinner by an old man, that we found there, and it was a great Skillet full of Rice with hached Lard, whereunto we fell with good stomacks, as being not a little hungry: Dinner done, and thanks rendred to God for his gracious mercy to us, an Inventory was taken of the goods that were in the <hi>Lantea,</hi> which was raw Silks, Damasks, Sattins, together with three great pots of Musk, amounting in all to the value of four thousand Crowns, besides good store of Rice, Sugar, Gammons of Bacon, and two Coups full of Poultry, whereof we had more need then of all the rest for the recovery of our sick men, which were not a few amongst us. Hereupon we all began without fear to cut out pieces of Silk, therewith to accommodate every one with clothes. <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> having found a pretty boy in the <hi>Lantea,</hi> about some twelve or thirteen years old, demanded of him from whence she came, and what she did in this place, as also to whom she belonged, and whither she was bound. <hi>Alas!</hi> answered the boy, <hi>she not long since belonged to my unfortunate Father, whose ill hap it is to have that taken from him by you in less then an hour, which he hath been above thirty years in getting: He came from a place, called</hi> Quoaman, <hi>where in exchange of lingots of Silver he bought all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> smiling as it were in disdain, he answered, <hi>Think not though I am but a child, that I am so foolish to beleeve, that having robbed my Father, thou canst ever use me like thy son: But if thou wilt do as thou sayst, I beseech thee for the love of thy God suffer me to swim unto that sad Land where he remains that begot me, who indeed is my true father, with whom I had rather dye where I see him lamenting, then live with such wicked people as you are.</hi> Then some of them that were present reprehending and telling him that it was not well spoken; <hi>Would you know,</hi> replyed he, <hi>why I said so? it was because I saw you after you had filled your bellies praise God with lifted up hands, and yet for all that like hypocrites never care for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king restitution of that you have stollen; but he assured, that after death you shall feel the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous chastisement of the Lord Almighty for so unjustly taking mens goods from them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50126:41"/>
Whereunto, earnestly beholding him, he answered, <hi>I understand not what you say, nor that you propound; declare it first unto me, and then you shall know my mind further.</hi> Then <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio de Faria</hi> began to instruct him therein after the best manner he could, but the boy would not answer him a word, only lifting up his hands and eyes to Heaven he said weeping, <hi>Blessed be thy Power, O Lord, that permits such people to live on the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that speak so well of thee, and yet so ill observe thy Law, as these blinded Miscreants do, who think that robbing and preaching are things that can be acceptable to thee.</hi> Having said so, he got him into a corner, and there remained weeping for three days together without eating any thing that was presented unto him. Hereupon falling to consult whether were the best course for us to hold from this place, either Northward, or Southward, much dispute arose thereabout, at length it was concluded that we should go to <hi>Liampoo,</hi> a Port distant from thence Northwards two hundred and threescore leagues, for we hoped that along this Coast we might happen to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and seize on some other greater and more commodious Vessel then that we had, which was too little for so long a Voyage, in regard of the dangerous storms that are ordinarily caused by the new Moons on the Coast of <hi>China,</hi> where dayly many Ships are cast away. With this design we put to Sea about Sun-set, and so went on this night with a South-west wind, and before day we discovered a little Island, named <hi>Quintoo,</hi> where we surprized a fisher-boat full of fresh fish, of which we took as much as we had need of, as also eight of twelve men that were in her for the service of our <hi>Lantea,</hi> by reason our own were so feeble as they were not able to hold out any longer. These eight fishermen, being demanded what Ports there were on this Coast to <hi>Chincheo,</hi> where we thought we might meet with some Ship of <hi>Malaca,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that about eighteen leagues from thence there was a good River and a good Rode, called <hi>Xingrau,</hi> much frequented with Junks, where we might be easily and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodated with all that we stood in need of; that at the entring into it, there was a little Village, named <hi>Xamoy,</hi> inhabited with poor fishermen, and three leagues beyond that the Town, where there was great store of Silks, Musk, Pourcelains, and many other sorts of Commodities, which were transported into divers parts. Upon this advice we steered our course towards that River, where we arrived the next day immediately after dinner, and cast anchor just against it about a league in the Sea, for fear lest our ill fortune should run us into the same mischief we were in before. The night following we took a <hi>Paroo</hi> of fishermen, of whom we demanded what Junks there were in this River, and how they were man'd, with divers other questions proper for our design. Whereunto they answered, that at the Town up the River there was not above two hundred Junks, by reason the greatest part were already gone to <hi>Ainan, Sumb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> seeing that the <hi>Lantea</hi> wherein we sailed could not carry us to <hi>Liampoo,</hi> where we purposed to lie all the Winter, he concluded by the advice of his company to furnish himself with a better Vessel, and although we were not then in case to enterprise any thing, yet necessity constrained us to undertake more then our Forces would permit; Now there being at that instant a little Junk riding at anchor fast by us alone, and no other near her, having but few men in her, and those asleep, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> thought he had a good opportunity to effect his purpose, wherefore leaving his anchor in the Sea, he got up close to this Junk, and with seven and twenty Soldiers and eight Boys boarded her on a sudden unespyed, where finding seven or eight <hi>Chinese</hi> Mariners fast asleep, he caused them to be taken, and bound hand and foot, threatening if they cryed out never so little to kill them all, which put them in such a fear as they durst not so much as quetch. Then cutting her cables, he got him straight out of the River, and sailing away with all the speed he could; The next day we arrived at an Island, named <hi>Pullo Quirim</hi>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they answered, that without doubt they had killed and hurt a great number. Then <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio de Faria,</hi> putting off his cap, fell down on his knees, and with his hands and eyes lifted up to Heaven he said weeping, <hi>O Lord Iesus Christ, my God and Saviour, even as thou art the true hope of those that put their trust in thee, I, that am the greatest sinner of all men, do most humbly beseech thee in the name of thy servants, that are here present, whose Souls thou hast bought with thy precious blood, that thou wilt give us strength and victory against this cruel Enemy, the murtherer of so many</hi> Portugals, <hi>whom with thy favor and ayd, and for the honor of thy holy Name I have resolved to seek out, as hitherto I have done, to the end he may pay to thy Soldiers and faithful servants what he hath so long owed them.</hi> Whereunto all that were by answered with one cry, <hi>To them, to them, in the Name of Iesus Christ, that this dog may now render us that, which for so long together he hath taken, as well from us, as from our poor miserable companions.</hi> Hereupon with marvelous ardor and great acclamations we set sail for the Port of <hi>Lailoo,</hi> which we had left eight leagues behind us, whither by the advice of some of his company <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> went to furnish himself with all that was necessary for the fight he hoped to make with the Pyrat, in the quest of whom (as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready delivered) he had spent so much time, and yet could never till then hear any news of him in all the Ports and places where he had been.</p>

Hereupon some of our Company went ashore, who with all diligence bought whatsoever we wanted, as Saltpeter and Sulphur to make powder, Lead, Bullets, Victual, Cordage, Oyl, Pitch, Rosin, Ockam, Timber, Planks, Arms, Darts, Staves hardened in the fire, Masts, Sails, Sail-yards, Targets, Flints, Pullies, and Anchors; that done, we

Besides for that <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> was exceeding liberal, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he spent out of the general booty, before the partitions were made, he payd for all that he bought at the price the sellers would set, by means whereof he had more brought him by far then he had use for, so that within thirteen days he went out of this Port wonderfully well accommodated, with two other new great Junks, which he had exchanged for two little ones that he had, and two <hi>Lanteaas</hi> with Oars, as also an hundred and sixty Mariners, both for rowing, and for governing the sails. After all these preparations were made, and we ready to weigh anchor, a general muster was taken of all that were in our Army, which in number was found to be five hundred persons, as well for fight, as for the service and navigation of our Vessels, amongst whom were fourscore and fifteen <hi>Portugals,</hi> young and resolute, the rest were Boys, and Mariners, and men of the other Coast, which <hi>Quiay Panian</hi> kept in pay, and were well practised in Sea-fight, as they that had been five years Pyrats. Moreover we had an hundred and sixty Harquebuses, forty pieces of brass Ordnance, whereof twenty were field-pieces, that carryed stone-bullets, threescore quintals of powder, namely fifty four for the great Ordnance, and six for the Harquebuses, besides what the Harquebusiers had already delivered to them, nine hundred pots of artificial fire, whereof four hundred were of powder, and five hundred of uns<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus accommodated and ordered for the execution of his enterprize, he set sail towards the River of <hi>Tinlau,</hi> where he arrived about Sun-set, and there keeping good watch he past the night till three of the clock in the morning, at which time he made to the Enemy, who rode some half a league up in the River.</p>

Whereupon <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> seeing we were discovered, cryed out to his company, <hi>To them, my Masters, to them in the name of God before they be succored by their Lorches,</hi> wherewith discharging all his Ordnance, it pleased Heaven, that the shot lighted to such purpose, as it overthrew and tore in pieces the most part of the valiantest, that then were mounted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on the deck, even right as we could have wished: In the neck hereof our Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers, which might be some hundred and threescore, failed not to shoot upon the signal, that had formerly been ordained for it, so that the hatches of the Junk were cleared of all those that were upon them, and that with such a slaughter as not an Enemy durst appear there after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; At which very instant our two Junks boarded their two in the case they were in, where the fight grew so hot on either side, as I confess I am not able to relate in particular what passed therein, though I was present at it, for when it began it was scarce day. Now that which rendred the conflict betwixt us and our Enemies most dreadful was the noise of Drums, Basins, and Bells, accompanyed with the report of the great Ordnance, wherewith the valleys and rocks thereabouts resounded again. This fight continuing in this manner some quarter of an hour, their <hi>Lorches</hi> and <hi>Lanteaas</hi> came from the shore to assist them with fresh men, which one, named <hi>Diego Meyrelez,</hi> in <hi>Quiay Panians</hi> Junk, perceiving, and that a Gunner employed not his shot to any purpose, in regard he was so beside himself with fear, that he knew not what he did, as he was ready to give fire to a Piece, he thrust him away so rudely, as he threw him down into the scuttle, saying to him, <hi>Away villain, thou canst do nothing, this business belongs to men, such as I am, not to thee:</hi> whereupon pointing the Gun with its wedges of level, as he knew very well how to do, he gave fire to the Piece, which was charged with bullets and stones, and hitting the Lorch that came foremost, carryed away all the upper part of her from Poup to Prow, so that she presently sank, and all that were in her, not a man saved: The shot then having past so through the first <hi>Lorch,</hi> fell on the hatches of another <hi>Lorch,</hi> that came a little behind, and killed the Captain of her, with six or seven more that were by him, wherewith the two other <hi>Lorches</hi> were so terrified, that going about to fly back to Land, they fell foul one of another, so as they could not clear themselves, but remained entangled together, and not able to go forward or backward, which perceived by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of our two <hi>Lorches,</hi> called <hi>Gasparo d' Oliveyra,</hi> and <hi>Vincentio Morosa,</hi> they presently set upon them, casting a great many artificial pots into them, wherewith they were so fired, that they burnt down to the very water, which made the most of those that were in them to leap into the Sea, where our men killed them all with their Pikes, so that in those three <hi>Lorches</hi> alone there dyed above two hundred persons; and in the other, whereof the Captain was slain, there was not one escaped, for <hi>Quiay Panian</hi> pursued them in a <hi>Champana,</hi> which was the Boat of his Junk, and dispatched most of them as they were getting to Land, the rest were all battered against the rocks that were by the shore: which the Enemies in the Junks percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, being some hundred and fifty <hi>Mahometans, Luzzons, Borneos,</hi> and <hi>Iaos,</hi> they began to be so discouraged, that many of them threw themselves into the Sea; whereupon the dog <hi>Coia Acem,</hi> who yet was not known, ran to this disorder, for to animate his men. He had on a Coat of Mail lined with Crimson Sattin, edged with gold fringe, that had formerly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to some <hi>Portugal,</hi> and crying out with a loud voyce, that every one might hear him, he said three times, <hi>Lah hilah, hilah la Mahumed, rocol halah, Massulmens, and true Believers in the holy Law of</hi> Mahomet, <hi>will you suffer your selves to be vanquished by such feeble slaves, as these Christian Dogs, who have no more heart then white Pullets, or bearded women? To them, to them, for we are assured by the Book of Flowers, wherein the Prophet</hi> Noby <hi>doth promise eternal delights to the</hi> Daroezes <hi>of the House of</hi> Mecqua, <hi>that he will keep his word both with you and me, provided that we bathe our selves in the blood of these dogs without Law:</hi> With these cursed words the Devil so encouraged them, that rallying all into one body, they re-inforced the fight, and so valiantly made head against us, as it was a dreadful thing to see how desperately they ran amongst our weapons. In the mean time <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> thus
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50126:44"/>
exhorted his men: <hi>Courage valiant Christians, and whilest those wicked Miscreants fortifie themselves in their devilish Sect, let us trust in our Lord Iesus Christ, nailed on the Cross for us, who will never forsake us, how great sinners soever we be, for after all we are his, which these Dogs here are not.</hi> With this ferver and zeal of faith flying upon <hi>Coia Acem,</hi> to whom he had most spleen, he discharged so great a blow on his head with a two-handed sword, that cutting through a Cap of Mail he wore, he layd him at his feet, then redoubling with another reverse stroke he lamed him of both his legs, so as he could not rise, which his followers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding they gave a mighty cry, and assaulted <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> with such fury and hardiness, as they made no reckoning of a many of <hi>Portugals,</hi> by whom they were invironned, but gave him divers blows that had almost overthrown him to the ground; Our men seeing this ran pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to his ayd, and behave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n passant,</hi> I have labored to speak succinctly in divers places, where possibly better wits then mine would amplifie matters in a more accomplished manner, and this is the reason that I have now delivered nothing but what was needful to be written. Returning then to my former discourse, I say, that the first thing <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> did after this Victory was to see his hurt men looked unto, whereof there were about fourscore and twelve, the most part <hi>Portugals,</hi> our servants being included; As for the number of the dead, there were on our side forty two, amongst which eight were <hi>Portugals,</hi> the loss of whom afflicted <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio de Faria</hi> more then all the rest, and of the Enemies three hundred and eighty, whereof an hundred and fifty fell by fire and sword, the remainder were drowned. Now albeit this Victory brought a great deal of content to us all, yet were there many tears shed both in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and particular for the slaughter of our companions, the most part of whose heads were cleft asunder with the Enemies hatchets. After this <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> notwithstanding he was hurt in two or three places, went presently ashoar with those that were in case to accompany him, where the first thing he did was to give order for the burial of the dead; thereupon he surrounded the Island for to see what he could discover: Compassing of it then in this sort he lighted upon a very pleasant Valley, wherein were many gardens, replenished with sundry kinds of fruits; there also was a Village of about forty or fifty very low houses, which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous <hi>Coia Acem</hi> had sacked, and in them slain many of the inhabitants, that had not the means to escape his hands. Further, in the said Valley, and by a delicate River of fresh water, wherein were a number of Mullets and Trouts, he met with a very fair house, which seemed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50126:45"/>
to be the <hi>Pagod</hi> of the Village, that was full of sick and hurt persons, whom <hi>Coia Acem</hi> had put there to be cured; amongst these were divers <hi>Mahometans</hi> of his kinred, and others of his best Soldiers, to the number of ninety six, who as soon as they perceived <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> afar off cryed out to him for mercy and forgiveness, but he would by no means harken unto them, alledging that he could not spare those that had killed so many Christians; Saying so, he caused the house to be fired in six or seven places, which in regard it was of wood, bepitched; and covered with dry Palm tree leaves, burned in such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ort as it was dreadful to behold; In the mean time it would have moved any man to pity to hear the lamentable cries made by these wretches within, and to see them cast themselves headlong out of the windows, where ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> reasonable I should, in regard it would be much against the duty of either of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, for me to give, and you to receive it.</hi> Having spoken in this manner, <hi>Mem Taborda</hi> and <hi>Antonio Anriques,</hi> who little looked for any such favor, fell down at his feet, and with tears of joy rendred him a world of thanks, and then presently went ashoar for to seek out their goods, taking with them about fifty or threescore servants, whom their Masters had lent them for to help gather up the Silks that were wet, and hanged up by the Enemies on Trees a drying, besides two great rooms full of such as had never been wet, all which amounted, as it was said, to an hundred thousand <hi>Taeis,</hi> wherein above an hundred Merchants had a share, as well of them that dwelt at <hi>Liampoo,</hi> as at <hi>Malaca,</hi> to whom they were consigned; The rest of their Commodities, being a third part thereof, were lost, and could never be heard of. The next morning, as soon as it was light, he went to the great Junk that he had taken, which was full of the bodies of them that were slain in her the day before, whom without further ado he caused to be thrown into the Sea; howbeit for <hi>Coia Acems,</hi> in regard he was of a more eminent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then the rest, and consequently deserving a greater honor in his funerals, he commanded him clothed and armed as he was to be cut into four quarters, and so cast also into the Sea, where for the merit of his works his body was intombed in the bellies of the hungry Lizards, whereof there was a great company all about our Junk, that shewed themselves above water, allured by the appast of those formerly thrown over-board; and in precipitating him so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered into the Sea, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> in stead of a prayer, <hi>Go wicked wretch,</hi> said he, <hi>to the bottom of Hell, where thy damned Soul doth now enjoy the promised delights of thy Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, as thou didst yesterday publish to these other Dogs such as thy self.</hi> Thereupon he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Slaves and Captives of his company, together with their Masters, before him, unto whom he made a speech like a true Christian, as indeed he was, whereby he prayed them in the Name of God to manumit these Slaves, according to the promise he had made them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fight, engaging himself to satisfie them for it out of his own Estate: Whereunto they answered all with one consent, that since it was his desire they were wel contented, and that they did even then set them at full liberty, whereof he caused a writing to be presently made with all their hands unto it, being as much as could be done for the instant, but afterwards each of them had in particular Letters of manumission granted unto them. This done, an Inventory was taken of such Commodities as were found to be good and merchantable, over and above those which were given to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and all was praised at an hundred and thirty thousand <hi>Taeis</hi> in Silver Lingots of <hi>Iapan,</hi> consisting of Sattin, Damask, raw Silk, Taffety, Musk, and very fine Porcelain, for as touching the rest they were not put in writing; And all these Robberies

the Pyrats had committed on the Coasts between <hi>Sumbor</hi> and <hi>Fucheo,</hi> where for above a year together they had coursed up and down.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> had remained four and twenty days in this River of <hi>Tinlau,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> during which time all his hurt men were cured, he set sail directly for <hi>Liampoo,</hi> where he purposed to pass the Winter, to the end that with the beginning of the Spring he might set forth on his Voyage to the Mynes of <hi>Quoaniaparu,</hi> as he had resolved with <hi>Quiay Panian,</hi> the <hi>Chinese</hi> Pyrat that was in his company, but being advanced even to the point of <hi>Micuy,</hi> which is at the height of six and twenty degrees, so great a Tempest arose towards the North-west, that we were fain to strike our top-sails, for fear we should be forced back again from our course; but after dinner it increased with such a terrible storm of rain, and the Sea went so high, that the two <hi>Lanteas</hi> were not able to brook it, so that about evening they made to Land, with an intent to recover the River of <hi>Xilendau,</hi> which was about a league and an half from thence, whereupon <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> doubting some misfortune, carried as little sail as possibly he could, as well for that he would not outgo the <hi>Lanteas,</hi> as in regard of the violence of the wind, which was such, as they durst not carry more: Now by reason the night was so dark, and the billows so great, they could not discern a shelf of sand, that lay betwixt an Island and the point of a Rock, so that passing over it our Junk struck her self so rudely on it, as her upper keel cleft in two or three places, and her under keel a little, whereupon the Gunner would have given fire to a Falconet, for to have warned the other Junks to come in to succor us in this extremity, but <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> would by no means permit him, saying, that since it pleased God he should be cast away in that place, there was no reason that others should be lost there also for his cause; But he desired every one to assist him, both with manual labor, and secret prayers unto God to pardon their sins: Having said so, he caused the main Mast to be cut down, whereby the Junk came to be in somewhat a better case then she was before; but alas! the fall of it cost three Mariners and one of our servants their lives, who chancing to be under it when it fell were battered all to pieces; In like manner he made all the other Masts from poop to prow to be hewed down, together with all the dead works, as the cabins and galleries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, so that all was taken away close to the hatches. And though all this was done with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible diligence, yet it stood us in little stead, for that the weather was so foul, the sea so swoln, the night so dark, the waves so furious, the rain so great, and the violence of the storm so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, that no man was able to withstand it: In the mean time the other four Junks made a sign to us, as if they also were cast away; Whereupon <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> lifting up his eyes and hands to Heaven, <hi>Lord,</hi> said he before them all, <hi>as through thy infinite mercy thou wast fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened upon the Cross for the Redemption of sinners, so I beseech thee, who art all mercy, that for the satisfaction of thy Iustice I alone may suffer for the offences which these men have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, since I am the principal cause of their trespassing against thy divine goodness; permit not then, O Lord, that in this woful night they may fall into that danger wherein I see my self as this present by reason of my sins; but with a repentant Soul I most humbly beseech thee, and that in the name of all the rest, though I am most unworthy to be heard, that in stead of having regard to our sins, thou wilt behold us with the eyes of that pity and infinite clemency wherewith thou art replenished.</hi> Upon these words we all fell a crying out so lamentably, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> that it would have grieved any heart in the world to have heard us; And as all men, that find themselves in the like extremity, are naturally carried to the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their lives, without any regard at all of ought else, there was not one amongst us that sought not the means to safe his, so that all of us together employed our selves in discharging our Vessel, by casting our goods into the Sea; To which effect about an hundred men of us, as well <hi>Portugals,</hi> as Slaves and Mariners, leapt down into the Ship, and in less then an hour heav'd all over-board, without any respect in so eminent a danger of that which we did, for amongst the rest we threw twelve great chests full of lingots of Silver into the Sea, which in the last incounter we had taken from <hi>Coia Acem,</hi> besides many other things of great value, whereby our Junk was somewhat lightened.</p>
            <p>Having past the night in that miserable state we were in, at length,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> as the day began to break, it pleased God that the wind also began to slack, whereby our Junk remained a little more at rest, though she was still in great peril, by reason of the water sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50126:46"/>
or cast against the Rocks, which had already happened to eleven or twelve of our company for want of taking heed: Now when the day began perfectly to appear, it pleased God that <hi>Mem Taborda</hi>'s and <hi>Antonio Anriquez</hi> Junks discovered us, and presently coming up close to us, they that were in her threw us a great many staves tyed to cords, to the end we might fasten our selves to them, as we presently did, and therein an hour was spent with much ado, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the extream disorder amongst us, every man desiring and striving to be first saved, by which occasion twenty men were drowned, whereof five were <hi>Portugals,</hi> for whom <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio de Faria</hi> was more grieved, then for the loss of the Junk, and all the goods that were in her, although the value thereof was not so small, but that it amounted to above an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now because it was almost night, we thought it not fit to go to them for some reasons given there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, but having made them a sign they answered us presently with the like according to our desire, and about the end of the last watch they approached so near unto us, that after they had sadly saluted us they demanded how the Captain General and the rest did; whereunto we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that as soon as it was day we would tell them, and that in the mean time they should retire from thence till the next morning that it was light, for that the waves then went so high, as some disaster might otherwise ensue thereupon. The next day as soon as the Sun began to appeared two <hi>Portugals</hi> came to us from <hi>Quiay Panians</hi> Junk, who seeing <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> in the case he was in aboard <hi>Mem Taborda</hi>'s Junk, and understanding the bad success of his fortune, they recounted theirs unto us, which seemed to be little better then ours; for they declared that a gust of wind had caught up and thrown three of their men a stones cast from the Vessel into the Sea, a thing never seen nor heard of before: Withall they delivered, how the little Junk was cast away, with fifty men in her, almost all Christians, amongst the which were seven <hi>Portugals,</hi> and the Captain, named <hi>Nuno Preto,</hi> an honorable man, and of great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and wisdom, whereof he had given good proof in the former adversities: A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We learnt afterwards, that such-like fortunes at Sea do ordinarily happen on this Coast of <hi>China,</hi> more then in any other part, so that it is impossible to sail there a whole year together without shipwrack, unless upon the Conjunction of the new Moons one fly into the Ports for shelter, which are there so many, and so good, that without fear of any thing one may enter them easily, because they are all very clear, except those of <hi>Lamau</hi> and <hi>Sumbor,</hi> which have certain Rocks lying some half a league South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the mouth of the River.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50126:46"/>
consisted of three Junks, and one <hi>Lorch,</hi> or <hi>Lantea,</hi> as the <hi>Chineses</hi> term them. The first thing he did then was to go and anchor in the Haven of <hi>Nouday,</hi> to the end he might learn some news of the thirteen Captives, that were carried thither; being arrived there about night he sent two small Barques, called <hi>Baloes,</hi> well man'd, to spy the Port, and sound the depth of the River, as also to observe the scituation of the Country, and to learn by some means what Ships were riding there, together with divers other matters answerable to his design; For which effect he commanded the Mariners to endeavor all they could for to surprize some of the Inhabitants of the Town, that by them he might be truly informed what was become of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> by reason he was afraid they were already carried further up into the Country. These <hi>Baloes</hi> went away about two hours after midnight, and arrived at a little Village seated at the mouth of the River on a little stream of water, called <hi>Nipaphau</hi>; There it pleased God that they behaved themselves so well, as they returned before day aboard our Junk, bringing along with them a Barque laden with earthen vessel, and Sugar canes, which they had found lying at anchor in the midst of the River: In this Barque there were eight men, and two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, together with a little child some six or seven years old, who seeing themselves thus in our power, became so transported with the fear of death, that they were in a manner besides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> perceiving labored all he could to comfort them, and began to speak them very fair, but to all his questions, he could draw no other answer from them then these words following, <hi>Do not kill us without cause, for God will require an account of our blood from you, because we are poor folks</hi>; and saying thus, they wept and trembled in such sort, as they could scarce pronounce a word; Whereupon <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> pitying their misery and simplicity, would importune them no further: Howbeit, the better to compass his intent, he intreated a <hi>Chinese</hi> woman, that was a Christian, and came along with the Pilot, to make much of them, and to assure them they should have no hurt, to the end, that being more confirmed by this means, they might answer to that should be demanded of them; Wherein the <hi>Chinese</hi> so well acquitted her self, and made them so tractable, as about an hour after they told her, that if the Captain would let them freely return in their boat to the place from whence they were taken, they would willingly confess all that either they had heard or seen. <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> having promised them to do so, and that with many words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations one amongst them, that was ancienter, and that seemed to be of more authority then the rest, addressing himself to him: <hi>Truly,</hi> said he, <hi>I do not rely much on thy words, because that by amplifying of them in such manner thou makest me afeard, that the affect will not be conformable to thy steech; Wherefore I beseech thee to swear unto me by this Element that bears thee, that thou wilt not fail to perform that which thou hast promised unto me: for otherwise perjuring thy self, be assured that the Lord, whose hand is Almighty, will be incensed against thee with such indignat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Antonio de Faria</hi> obliging himself by oath, as the old man required, to perform his word, the <hi>Chinese</hi> said he was satisfied, and then he continued in this sort: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two days since I saw those men, whom thou enquirest after, layd in prison at</hi> Nouday <hi>with great irons on their legs, because it was beleeved they were notorious Theeves, that made a trade of robbing such as they met upon the Seas.</hi> This relation very much enraged and disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> who was perswaded that it might well be as the old man delivered, so that desiring to take some course for their deliverance as soon as might be, he sent them a Letter by one of the <hi>Chineses,</hi> retaining all the rest in hostage for him, who departed the next morning by break of day, and because it much imported the <hi>Chineses</hi> to be delivered out of captivity, he that carried the Letter, and that was husband to one of the two women, which had been taken in the boat of earthen vessel, and were now aboard in our Junk, made such speed, that he returned about noon with an answer, endorsed on the Letter we sent, and sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the five <hi>Portugals</hi>; Thereby they gave <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> to understand, that they were cruelly detained in prison, out of which they did not think they should ever get, unless it were to go to execution, and therefore they besought him for the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he would not suffer them to perish there for want of succor, according as he had promised them at their setting forth in that Voyage, and the rather in regard it was only for his sake that they were reduced to that miserable estate; Hereunto they added many other very
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50126:47"/>
pitiful entreaties, as might well come from such poor wretches, that were Captives under the Tyranny of such fell and cruel people, as the <hi>Chineses</hi> were. <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d this Letter, read it in the presence of all his Company, of whom he asked counsel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; but as they were many, so were their opinions many and different, which was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of much contention amongst them; whereby perceiving that nothing would be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded concerning this affair, he said to them as it were in choller; <hi>My Masters and Friends, I promised to God by a solemn oath that I have taken, never to part from hence, till by some means or other I have recovered these poor Soldiers, my companions, though I should therefore venture my life a thousand times, yea and all my estate, which I make little reckoning of in regard of them; wherefore, my Masters, I earnestly desire you, that no man go about to oppose this resolution of mine, upon the execution whereof mine honor wholly depends, for whosoever shall contrary me therein I must take him for mine enemy, as one that would seek the prejudice of my Soul.</hi> To this speech all made answer, that he was in the right, and that for the discharge of his conscience nothing should stay him from performing the same; adding moreover, that all of them would stand to him in that behalf to the death. The Captain hereupon giving them many thanks, and with tears in his eyes and his hat in his hand embracing them, protested that he would when time should serve acknowledg this good-will of theirs in such real manner as it deserved, wherewith they all remained very well satisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>This resolution being taken, they fell to councel concerning the carriage of this affair, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they concluded to treat with the <hi>Mandarin</hi> in a gentle manner, and for that end to send unto him to demand these Prisoners, with promise to give him for their ransom whatsoever should be thought reasonable, and that according to his answer such further course should be taken therein as should seem requisite: A Petition then was presently drawn answerable to the form, that was usually presented to the Judges, which <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> sent to the <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> by two of the chiefest of the <hi>Chineses</hi> he had taken, who also carried him a present worth two hundred duckets, whereby he hoped to induce him to restore the poor prisoners; but it fell out far otherwise then he expected: For as soon as the <hi>Chineses</hi> had delivered the Petition and the Present, they returned the next day with an answer written on the back of the Petition, the tenor whereof was this: <hi>Let thy mouth come and present it self at my feet, and after I have heard thee I will do thee justice. Antonio de Faria</hi> seeing what high words the <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> gave was exceedingly troubled, because he well perceived by this beginning, that he should have much ado to deliver his companions, wherefore having communicated this affair in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to some few, whom for that end he had called unto him, they were of several opinions; nevertheless after good deliberation it was at length concluded to send another Messenger, that should more effectually demand the Prisoners of him, and for their ransom offer the sum of two thousand <hi>Tacis</hi> in lingots of Silver and Commodities, declaring unto him, that he would not part from that place till he had returned them; for he made account that it might be this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution would oblige him to do that which he had refused him another way, or that he would be carried to it by the consideration of his own gain and interest. So the two <hi>Chineses</hi> went again the second time with a Letter sealed up, as from one person to another, without any kind of ceremony or complement, which these Gentiles so much use amongst themselves; And this <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> did of purpose, to the end that by the sharpness of this Letter the <hi>Mandarin</hi> might know he was displeased, and resolved to execute what he had written. But before I proceed any further I will only relate the two main points of the contents of the Letter, which were the cause of the utter ruine of this business. The first was, where <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> said, that he was a Merchant stranger, a <hi>Portugal</hi> by Nation, that was going by way of Traffique towards the Port of <hi>Liampoo,</hi> where there were also many other Merchants strangers like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who duly payd the usual Customs, without committing any manner of ill or injustice. The second point was, where he said, that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> his Master was allyed in a brotherly amity with the King of <hi>China,</hi> by reason whereof they traded in his Country, as the <hi>Chineses</hi> used to do at <hi>Malaca,</hi> where they were entertained with all favor and justice duly ministred unto them. Now though both these points were distastful to the <hi>Mandarin,</hi> yet the last, wherein he mentioned the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to be brother to the King of <hi>China,</hi> was that which put him so out of patience, that without any regard at all he commanded them that brought the Letter, not only to be cruelly scourged, but to have their noses cut off, and in that pickle he sent them back to <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> with an answer written on a scurvy piece of torn p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; he had also some Pieces of Ordnance, and other things necessary for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
            <p>The next morning a little before day <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> sailed up the River with three Junks,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> the <hi>Lorches,</hi> and the four Barques he had taken, and so went and anchored at six fathom and an half of water close by the walls of the Town; Then causing the sails to be taken down without any noise, or discharge of Ordnance, he displayed the Banner of Trade according to the fashion of <hi>China,</hi> to the end that by this demonstration of peace no complement should rest unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, although he was perswaded that nothing would prevail with the <hi>Mandarin:</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he sent another Messenger unto him, never making shew that he had received any ill usage from him, by whom with a great deal of complement he demanded the Prisoners, and offered him a round sum of mony for their ransom, with a promise of perpetual correspondence and amity; But so far was this Dog the <hi>Mandarin</hi> from harkening thereunto, that contrariwise he made the poor <hi>Chinese,</hi> that carried the Letter, to be hewed in pieces, and so shewed him from the top of the wall to the whole Fleet, the more to despight us. This tragical act wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> of that little hope, which some had given him for the deliverance of the Prisoners; hereupon the Soldiers, being more incensed then before, said unto him, that since he had resolved to land, he should no longer defer it, because further delay would but give his Enemies leasure to gather more strength: This counsel seeming good to him, he presently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued with them he had chosen for the action, having first given order to his Junks to shoot continually at the Town, and the Enemy, wheresoever they perceived any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> along the shoars side directly to the Town: In the mean time a number of people appeared upon the walls, with divers ensigns of different colours, where these Barbarous made a mighty nois<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Fifes, Drums, and Bells, and withall hooting at us, made us signs with their caps to approach, thereby intimating the little reckoning they made of us: Now by that time we were come within a Musket shot of the walls, we discerned some thousand, or twelve hundred men, as we guessed, sally out at two several gates, of which some sixscore were mounted on horses, or to say better, on lean carrion Tits that were nothing but skin and bone, wherewith they began to course up and down the field in a skirmishing manner, wherein they shewed themselves so untoward, as they often ran one upon another, and tumbled down together; which when <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> saw he was exceeding glad, and encouraging his men to the fight he stood firm attending the Enemy, who continued still wheeling about us, being perswaded, it seems,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50126:48"/>
that that would suffice to skare us, and make us retire to our vessels; But when they perceived us remain unmoved, without turning our backs as they beleeved, and as it may be, they desired we would doe, they closed themselves into one body, and so in very ill order they made a stand without advancing on. But then our Captain, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in this posture, caused all his Muskettiers to discharge at one instant, who till that time had not stirred, which succeeded with such effect, as it pleased God that he most part of this goodly Cavalry fell to the ground with feare; we taking this for a good presage ran and lustily pursued them, invoking to our aid the name of Jesus, whose good pleasure it was though his divine mercy, to make our enemies slye before us so amazed, and in such disorder, as they tumbled pell mell one upon another, in which manner arriving at a bridge that crost the town ditch, they were so pestered together, as they could neither go forward nor backward; in the mean time our forces coming up to them discharged their shot to such purpose amongst them, that we laid three hundred of them on the earth, which in truth was a pittifull sight to behold, because there was not one of them that had the heart so much as to draw a sword: whereupon hotly pursuing the first point of this victory, we ran to the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> assembling his men into one body, for fear of some disorder, marched with them directly to the prison, where our companions lay, who seeing us coming, gave a great cry, saying, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> straightway the doors and iron grates were broken up, and our poor fellows irons knocked off their legs, which being done, and they set at liberty, all our company had leave to make what purchase they could, to the end that without speaking afterwards of partition, every one might be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of what he had gotten. Howbeit <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> desired them to perform it sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and therefore he gave them but half an houres time for it, whereunto they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended very willingly, and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the mean space <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio de Faria</hi> went to that of the <hi>Mandarin,</hi> which he took for his part, where he met with eight thousand <hi>Taeis</hi> in silver, together with eight great vessels full of Muske, and that he caused to be reserved for himself; the rest he left to the servants that were with him, who moreover found there a great deal of raw Silke, Sattin, Damask, and fine Pourcellain, whereof every one took as much as he could carry, so as the four Barques, and the three Champanaes, that brought our men on shore, were four several times la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unladen aboard the Juncks, insomuch that the meanest Marriner amongst us spake not of this booty but by whole cases, besides what each one concealed in his particular.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> perceived that an hour and half had been spent in pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging, he commanded a surcease thereof, but his company were so hot upon the spoil, that by no means they would be drawn from it, wherein the persons of qualitie were most saul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in which regard our Captain fearing least some disaster might happen by reason the night approached, he caused the Town to be set on fire in eleven or twelve places; Now for that most of it was built of Firr, and other wood, it was in such a flame within a quarter of an hour, as to see it burn so, one would have taken it for a pourtraiture of Hell. This done, and all our company retired, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> embarqued without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, every man being well satisfied and contented, onely it was great pittie to behold a number of handsome maids lead away, tied four and four and five and five together

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, by the advice of his company, he resolved to go and winter, during the three moneths he had yet to make his voyage in, at a certain desart Island, distant some fifteen leagues from the Sea of <hi>Liampoo,</hi> called <hi>Pullo Hinhor,</hi> where there was a good road, and good water; whereunto he was chiefly induced, because he thought that going directly to <hi>Liampoo,</hi> his voyage thither might bring some prejudice to the traffique of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who wintered there peaceably with their goods: And indeed this advice was so approved of every one, as it was generally applauded. Being departed then from <hi>Nouday</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after we had sailed five dayes between the Isles of <hi>Comolem,</hi> and the continent, we were set upon on <hi>Saturday</hi> about noon by a Pirate, named <hi>Premata Gundel,</hi> a sworn enemy to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> unto whom he had oftentimes done much damage, as well at <hi>Patana,</hi> as at <hi>Sunda, Siam,</hi> and many other places, when he found himself the stronger. This Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beleeving that we were <hi>Chineses</hi> came and assailed us with two great Juncks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there were two hundred fighting men, besides Mariners; One of them being grappled to <hi>Mem Taborda</hi>'s Junk had almost made her self Master of it, which <hi>Quiay Panian</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, who was a little before, he turned upon her, and with full sails running her on the Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Howbeit we got not this victorie so cheap, but that it cost seventeen mens lives, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of five were <hi>Portugals,</hi> and of the best Souldiers we had, besides three and fourty were hurt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

With this prize <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> retired to a little Island, called <hi>Buncalou,</hi> which was three or four Leagues Westward from thence, and much commended for good wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and safe riding: Having landed in this place, we spent eighteen dayes there, lodging in Cabbins, that were made for the accommodation of our hurt men. From this Island we sailed towards that part, whither we had resolved before to go, namely, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> in the great Junk, <hi>Mem Taborda,</hi> and <hi>Antonio Anriquez</hi> in theirs, <hi>Pedro de Sylva</hi> in the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Junk, that was taken at <hi>Nouday,</hi> and <hi>Quiay Panian</hi> with all his followers in the Pyrats, last taken, which was given him in recompence of his that he had lost, together with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand <hi>Taeis</hi> out of the general booty, wherewith he rested very well contented, being done with the consent of the whole company at the request of <hi>Antonio de Faria.</hi> Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this manner we arrived six dayes after at the Ports of <hi>Liampoo,</hi> which are two Islands, one just against another, distant three Leagues from the place, where at that time the <hi>Portugals</hi> used their commerce; There they had built above a thousand houses, that were governed by Sheriffs, Auditors, Consuls, Judges, and six or seven other kinde of Officers, where the Notaries underneath the publique Acts, which they made, wrote thus, <hi>I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such a one, publique Notarie of this Town of Liampoo for the King our Soveraign Lord.</hi> And this they did with as much confidence and assurance, as if this place had been scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated between <hi>Santarem</hi> and <hi>Lisbon</hi>; so that there were houses there which cost three or four thousand Duckats the building, but both they and all the rest were afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished for our sins by the <hi>Chineses,</hi> as I hope to relate more amply hereafter: Whereby one may see how uncertain our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>Between these two Islands, which the Inhabitants of the Country, and they that sail in those Seas, call the Ports of <hi>Liampoo,</hi> there is a channel, some two Harquebuse shot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and five and twenty fathom deep, where in certain places is very good anchoring, as also a pleasant River of fresh water, which takes his beginning from the top of a mountain, and passeth by thick woods of Cedar, Oak, and Firr trees, whereof many Ships make their provision for Sail-yards, Masts and Planks, never costing them a penny. At these Islands <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> cast anchor on Wednesday morning, and there <hi>Mem Taborda,</hi> and <hi>Antonio Anriquez</hi> desired him to give them leave to go and advertise the Town of his Arrival, as likewise to understand the news of the Country, and whether there was any speech of that which he had done at <hi>Nouday</hi>; For in case his coming should prove ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ction by his extraordinary liberality towards them, for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50126:49"/>
which they hoped that God would throughly requite him: As for the fear he was in touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wintering there, by reason of what had past at <hi>Nouday,</hi> he might be confident that way, because the Country was so full of trouble, by occasion of a mighty uprore that was then amongst the people thereof, as if he had razed the very Citie of <hi>Canton</hi> it self, they would not much regard it, wherefore he might well thinke they would care much lesse for that which he had done at <hi>Nouday,</hi> which in <hi>China,</hi> compared with many others, was no greater then <hi>Oeyras</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi> is, being equally with <hi>Lisbon</hi>: And concerning the good news he had sent them of his arrivall in their Port, they earnestly desired him to continue still at anchor there six dayes longer, that they might in the mean while make some fit preparation for his entertaiment, seeing that thereby onely they should be able to testifie their good will unto him, having not the power other wayes to acquit so many obligations, wherein they stood ingaged unto him. These words of kindness were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with many other complements, whereunto <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> returned them a most curteous Answer, and condescending to their desire, he sent all his sick men on shore in the two <hi>Lanteaas,</hi> which brought the refreshments, whom those of <hi>Liampoo</hi> received with great shew of affection and charity, for presently they were lodged in the richest houses of the Town, and plentifully accommodated with all things necessary for them, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing. Now during the six dayes <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> remained in that place, there was not a man of any qualitie in all the Town, but came and visited him with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny presents, and divers sorts of provisions, refreshments, and fruits, and that in such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that we were amazed to behold them, the more too for the good order and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence wherewith every thing was accompanied.</p>
            <p>During the six dayes,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> that <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> continued in the Port according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to them of <hi>Liampoo,</hi> he never budgd from his Ships<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At length on Sunday morning before day, which was the time limited for our going to the Town, an excellent consort of Musick was heard, both of Instruments and Voyces, the harmony whereof was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully pleasing, and after that a Triumph of Drums and Trumpets together, according to the manner of our own country: Then some two houres before Sun-rising, the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very quiet, and the Moon exceeding bright, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> set sail with his whole Fleet, having all his Ships decked with Silken Flaggs, and streamers of sundry Colours, and every <hi>scuttle</hi> both of the greater and lesser masts hung round about with cloth of Silver, and many brave Standards of the same: After these Vessels followed a number of row-Barges, wherein were a great many of Trumpets, Hoboyes, Flutes, Fifes, Drums, and other such Instruments, each one of a several Invention.</p>
            <p>When it was broad day the winde began to calm, as we were within half a League of the Town, whereupon there came presently to us some twenty <hi>Lanteaas,</hi> very well set forth, and full of Musicians, that played on divers Instruments; So in lesse then an hour we arrived at the Road, but first there came aboard <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> about threescore Boats and <hi>Manchaas,</hi> adorned with Pavilions and Banners of Silke, as also with Turkie Carpets of great value; In these Boats were about three hundred men, all richly apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, with chains of Gold, and guilt Swords, hanging in Belts after the fashion of <hi>Affrick,</hi> every thing so well accommodated, that we which beheld this Equipage, were no lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented then astonished therewith. With this train <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> came to the Town, where there stood ranged in excellent order twenty six ships, and fourscore Junks, besides a great sort of <hi>Vancons</hi> and <hi>Barcasses,</hi> all in File one after another, so making as it were a fair long street, every where beautified with Pines, Laurels, and green Canes, with many Triumphal Arches, beset with Cherries, Pears, Lemons, Oranges, and sundry odoriferous green Herbs, wherewith the Masts and Cordage were covered all over. As soon as <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio de Faria</hi> came neer the place, which was prepared for his landing, he saluted the Town with a great pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in the world, whereof our ancient Historians for want of knowledge of them have made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Writings, and it seems that above them all, the King of these</hi> Portugals <hi>is to be most esteemed, for by that which is delivered to us of his greatnesse, he must needs be richer, more mighty, and greater then either the Tartar, or the Cauchin, as is most apparent, since be that shooes his horses, which is but an ordinary and contemptible trade in every Country, is so respected by those of his Nation</hi>; Whereupon another that heard his Companion say thus, <hi>Certainly,</hi> said he, <hi>this Prince is so great, that if it were not a blasphemy, one might almost compare him to the Son of the Sun</hi>; The rest that were about him added, <hi>It well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be so by the great riches which this bearded Nation get in every place where they come by the power of their armes, wherewith they affront all the People of the world.</hi> This salutation being ended on either part, a <hi>Lanteaa</hi> came aboard <hi>Antonio de Faria's</hi> Junk, gallantly equipped, and covered all over with boughs of Chesnut trees, full of their bristled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this sort was <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> carried along till alighting out of his chair he went to visit the Governours of the Town, who in way of complement prostrated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at his feet, wherein some small time being spent, two ancient Gentlemen, who had lived long in that place, the one named <hi>Tristan de Gaa,</hi> and the other <hi>Ieronimo de Rego,</hi> made an eloquent Oration in the commendation of him: That done, he was led from thence to the Church through a long street, adorned on both sides with Laurel and Firr Trees, below strewed with Rushes, and above hung with Sattin and Damask, amongst the which divers court-cupboards were placed, whereon stood very curious perfuming pans of Silver, from whence most pleasing and delicious odours breathed forth: Neer to the end of this street was a Tower of Deal Boards erected, painted all over, as if it had been stone, on the top whereof, under a Banner of white Damask, the Royal Arms of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> were limned in Gold; and in a window of the same Tower, certain little Boyes were drawn, attired after the <hi>Portugal</hi> fashion, as al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Masse being ended, the Sermon follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that was made by <hi>Estevano Nogueyra,</hi> an ancient man, and Curate of the place, vvho, to speak the truth through discontinuance of preaching, was but little verst in Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit matters, and illiterate vvithall, howbeit desiring to shew himself that day a learned man in so remarkable a solemnity, he laboured to make demonstration of his best Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick; To which effect he grounded all his Sermon on the Prayses of <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> and that in words so ill placed, and so far from his Text, as our Captain was much asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at it, wherefore some of his friends pluckt him three or four times by the Surplis for to make him give over, wherewith being ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After they were dismissed which were not for the Banquet, there onely remained those that were invited, being fourscore in number, besides fiftie of <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi>'s Souldiers: These being set at Table were served by young Wenches, very beautiful, and finely apparrelled, according to the manner of the <hi>Mandarins</hi>; At eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry course that was served up they sung very melodiously to the tune of certain Instruments vvhereon some of their companions played: As for <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> he was served by eight Maidens, the Daughters of worthy Merchants, exceeding fair and comely, whom their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had brought thither for that purpose at the request of <hi>Mateus de Brito,</hi> and <hi>Tristan de Gaa</hi>; They were attired like Mermaids, and carried the meat to the Table, dancing to the sound of divers Instruments, a marvellous thing to behold, and vvherewithal the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> vvere so mightily taken, as they could not sufficiently commend the excellent Order and Gentilenesse of these Magnificencies, by which their eyes and eares were so charmed; Remarkable it was also, that at every health, the Trumpets, Hoboys, and Drums plaid their parts.

               </gap>t over a Gulf of forty leagues, and discovered a very high Mountain, called <hi>Nangafo,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the which bending Northerly, we sailed fiftie dayes; at length the wind abated somewhat, and because in that place the Tides were very great, <hi>Similau</hi> put into a little Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, where was good anchoring and riding, inhabited by men that were white and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, having very little eyes, like to the <hi>Chineses,</hi> but much different from them, both in language and attire.

Antonio de Faria,</hi> embracing, and giving him many thanks, fell to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with him about that other safer way of which he spake: Whereupon <hi>Similau</hi> told him, that some hundred and forty leagues further forwards to the North, there was a River somewhat larger by half a league, called <hi>Sumhepadano,</hi> where he should meet with no Obstacle, for that it was not peopled like the streight of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> wherein they now were, but that then they should be retarded a month longer, by the exceeding much wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this River. <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> thinking it far better to expose himself to a length of time, then to hazard his life for abridgement of way, followed the counsel that <hi>Similau</hi> gave him; so that going out of the streight of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> he coasted the land five dayes, at the end whereof we discovered a very high Mountain towards the East, which <hi>Similau</hi> told us was called <hi>Fanius</hi>; approaching somewhat neer unto it we entred into a very fair Port, forty fathom deep, that extending it self in the form of a Crescent was shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred from all sorts of winds, so spacious withall, as two thousand Vessels how great soever might ride there at ease. <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> went ashore with some ten or eleven Souldiers, and rounded this haven, but could not meet with any one body, that could instruct him in the way he pretended to make, whereat he was very much vext, and greatly repented him for that without any kinde of consideration, or taking advice of any one, he had rashly, and out of a capacious humour, undertaken this Voyage: Howbeit he dissembled this displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his the best he could for fear lest his company should tax him with want of courage. In this Haven he discoursed again with <hi>Similau</hi> before every one concerning this our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, which he told him was made but by guesse; whereunto the <hi>Chinese</hi> answered, <hi>Signior Captain, If I had any thing I could engage to you of more value then my head, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test unto you I would most willingly do it, for I am so sure of the course I hold, that I would not fear to give you my very children in Hostage of the promise I made you at</hi> Liampoo: <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse I advertise you again, that if repenting the undertaking of this enterprise you fear to proceed any further, in regard of the tales your people are ever tatling in your ear, as I have often observed, do but command, and you shall finde how ready I am to obey your pleasure: And whereas they would make you believe that I spin out this Voyage longer then I promised you at</hi> Liampoo, <hi>the reason thereof you know well enough, which seemed not amisse when I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it unto you, seeing then you once allowed of it, let me intreat you to set your heart at rest for that matter, and not to break off this design by returning back, whereby at length you shall finde how profitable this patience of yours will prove.</hi> This speech somewhat quieted <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi>'s minde, so that he bid him go on as he thought best, and never trouble himself with the murmuring of the Souldiers, whereof he complained, saying, that it was ever the manner of such as were idle, to finde fault with other mens actions, but if they did not mend their error the sooner, he would take a course with them to make them to do it; wherewith <hi>Similau</hi> rested very well satisfied and contented.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>After we were gone from this Haven, we sailed along the coast above thirteen dayes together, alwaies in sight of land, and at length arrived at a Port, called <hi>Buxipalem,</hi> in the height of fortie nine degrees. We found this Climate somewhat colder then the rest, here we saw an infinite company of Fishes and Serpents, of such strange forms, as I cannot speak of them without fear; <hi>Similau</hi> told <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> incredible things concerning them, as well of what he had seen himself, having been there before, as of that had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported unto him, especially in the full Moons of the months of <hi>November, December,</hi> and <hi>Ianuary,</hi> when the storms raign there most, as indeed this <hi>Chinese</hi> made it appear to our own eyes, whereby he justified unto us the most of that which he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50126:52"/>
For in this place we saw Fishes in the shape of Thornbacks that were four fathoms about, and had a Muzzle like an Oxe; likewise we saw others resembling great Lizards, spotted all over with green and black, having three rows of prickles on their backs, that were very sharp, and of the bignesse of an arrow; their bodies also were full of the like, but they were neither so long, nor so great as the others: These Fishes would ever and anon bristle up themselves like Porcupines, which made them very dreadful to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, they had Snouts that were very sharp and black, with two crooked teeth out of each jawbone, two spans long, like the tusks of a wild Boar. We also saw Fishes whose bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were exceeding black, so prodigious and great, that their heads onely were above six spans broad. I will passe over in silence many other Fishes of sundry sorts, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in this place, because I hold it not fit to stand upon things that are out of my discourse, let it suffice me to say, that during two nights we stayed here we did not thinke our selves safe, by reason of the Lizards, Whales, Fishes and Serpents, which in great numbers shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves to us. Having left this Haven of <hi>Buxipalem,</hi> by us called the River of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, which in great numbers shewed themselves to us, <hi>Similau</hi> sailed fifteen leagues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to another Bay named <hi>Calindano,</hi> which was in form of a Crescent, six leagues in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, and invironed with high Mountains, and very thick woods, amidst whereof divers Brooks of fresh waters descended, which made up four great Rivers that fell all into this Bay. There <hi>Similau</hi> told us, that all those prodigious creatures we had both seen and heard of, as well in this Bay, as in that where we were before, came thither to feed upon such Ordure and Carrion, as the overflowing of these Rivers brought to this place. <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> demanding of him thereupon, whence those Rivers should proceed, he answered that he knew not, but it was said that the Annals of <hi>China</hi> affirmed, how two of those Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers took their beginnings from a great L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke, called <hi>Moscombia,</hi> and the other two from a Province, named <hi>Alimania,</hi> where there are high Mountains, that all the year long are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Snow, so that the Snow coming to dissolve, these Rivers swelled in that manner as we then beheld them, for now they were bigger, then at any other time of the year. Hereunto he added, that entring into the mouth of the River, before the which we rode at anchor, we should continue our course, steering Eastward, for to finde out the Port of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> again, which we had left two hundred and threescore leagues behinde us, by reason that in all this distance we had multiplied a greater height then that of the Island was, which we were in quest of. Now although this was exceeding grievous unto us, yet <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lau</hi> desired <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> to think the time we had past well spent, because it was done for the best, and for the better securing of our lives; being asked then by <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> how long vve should be in passing through this River, he answered that vve should be out of it in fourteen or fifteen dayes, and that in five dayes after he would promise to land him and his Souldiers in the Island of <hi>Calempluy,</hi> vvhere he hoped fully to content his desire, and to make him think his pains vvell bestowed, vvhereof he now so complained. <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> having embraced him very lovingly thereupon; vowed to be his friend for ever, and reconciled him to his Souldiers, vvho were very much out vvith him before. Being thus reconfirmed by <hi>Similau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> speeches, and certified of this nevv course vve vvere to take, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged his company, and put all things in order convenient for his design, to that end pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring his Ordnance vvhich till then had never been charged; he caused also his Arms to be made ready, ordained Captains, and Sentinels to keep good vvatch, together vvith all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that he thought necessary for our defence, in case of any attempt upon us. That done, he spake unto <hi>Diego Lobato,</hi> who vvas the Priest that vve carried along with us, and one that we much respected as a man of the Church, to make a Sermon unto his company for to animate them against all dangers that might happen, which he worthily performed, and by the efficacy of his words, full of sweetnesse, and excellent examples, he so revived our spirits, that before were much dejected through the apprehension of the dangers that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced us, as there vvas not one amongst us, but presently took fresh heart, boldly to execute the enterprise vve had undertaken: Whereupon with great devotion and zeal vve sung a <hi>Salvo,</hi> before an Image of our Lady, every man promising vvithout any future fear to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Voyage we had begun. That done, vve joyfully hoysed sail, and entring into the mouth of the River, steering directly East, and vvith tears in our eyes invoked from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of our hearts, the assistance of that Soveraign Lord vvhich sits at the right hand of the Father everlasting, to preserve us by his Almighty povver.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>Continuing on our course with the force of Oares and Sails, and steering divers wayes, by reason of the many turnings of the River, the next day we arrived at a very high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain called <hi>Botinafau,</hi> whence sundry Rivers of fresh water ran down. In this mountain were a number Tygers, Rhinocerots, Lyons, Ounces, and such other creatures of severall kinds, which running and roaring in their wilde manner, made cruell war upon other weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Beasts, as Stags, Boars, Apes, Monkeys, Baboons, Wolves, and Foxes, wherein we took much delight, spending a great deal of time in beholding them; and ever and anon we cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out from our Ships to fright them, but they were little moved with it, in regard they were not used to be hunted: We were about six dayes in passing this Mountain, it being some forty or fifty leagues long. Within a pretty while after we had left this Mountain we came to another, named <hi>Gangitanon,</hi> no lesse wilde then the former, beyond the which all the Countrie was very stonie, and almost inaccessible; moreover it was full of such thick Woods, as the Sun could not possibly pierce them with his beams: <hi>Similau</hi> told us, that in this mountain there were ninety leagues of desert land, altogether unfit for Tillage, and the bottome thereof onely was inhabited by certain most deformed men, called <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gauhos,</hi> who lived after a most brutish fashion, and fed on nothing but what they got in hunting, or some Rice, that the Merchants of <hi>China</hi> brought them to <hi>Catan</hi> in exchange of Fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>a, which he told us was a stuffe very acceptable to these brutish men, and withall by signs demanded of him whether he would buy it; this drew him to the banke of the River, were he answered with an hoarse voice, some words that we could not comprehend, because there was not one in all our Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels that understood this barbarous language, so that of necessity this commerce was to be made by signs: <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> commanded three or four yards of the said piece of Taffeta to be given him, as also six Pourcelains, wherewith this Salvage seemed to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well pleased, for taking both the one and the other, transported with joy he said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to us, which we could understand no better then the former, then making a sign with his hand towards the place of his abode, he left his Cows, and ran away to the wood, clothed as he was with a Tigers skin, his arms and legs naked, bare-headed, and a staffe hardned at one end with the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For his person, he was well proportioned of his limbs, his hair red and curled hanging down on his shoulders; his stature by conjecture was above ten foot high, but we were amazed to see him return about a quarter of an hour to the very same place again, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50126:53"/>
at the sight whereof they very much rejoyced. These persons, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were apparrelled all after one and the same fashion, without any kinde of difference, saving that the women wore great tinnen Bracelets about the middle of their armes, and their hair a great deal longer then the mens, stuck all about with flowers, resembling our Flower de luces; they had chains also of red Cockles about their necks, almost as big as Oyster-shels; as for the men they carried great staves in their hands, covered to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest with the same skins wherewith they were clothed; moreover they had all of them fierce looks, great lips, flat noses, wide nosthrils, and were of stature very tall, but yet not so high as we thought they had been; for <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> having caused them to be measured, he found that the tallest of them exceeded not ten spans and an half, except one old man that reached to eleven. The womens stature was not fully ten spans: Their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry countenances shewed them to be very rude and blockish, and lesse rational, then all the other people which we had seen in our Conquests. Now <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> being glad that we had not altogether lost our labour, bestowed on them threescore Pourcelains, a piece of green Taffety, and a pannier full of Pepper, wherewith they seemed to be so contented, that prostrating themselves on the ground, and lifting up their hands to heaven, they fell to saying certain words which we took for a thanksgiving after their manner, because they fell down three several times on the earth, and gave us the three Cows and the Stag, as also a great many of Herbs: Having been talking about two houres with them by signs, and no lesse wondring at us, then we at them, they returned into the wood from whence they came, and we pursued our course up the River by the space of five dayes, during the which we saw more of them along by the water side; after we had past all this distance of land, which might be some forty leagues, or thereabouts, we navigated sixteen dayes more with the force of Oa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Being come into the gulf of <hi>Nanquin, Similau</hi> councelled <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> that at any hand he should not suffer any <hi>Portugal</hi> to be seen, because if such a thing should happen he feared some uproar would follow amongst the <hi>Chineses,</hi> in regard no strangers had ever been seen in those quarters; adding withall, that it would be safer for them to keep still in the middle of the gulf, then by the shore, by reason of the great number of <hi>Lorches</hi> and <hi>Lanteaas,</hi> that incessantly sailed up and down; this advice was approved of every one, so that having continued our course some six dayes East and East Northeast, we discovered a great Town, called <hi>Sileupamor,</hi> whither we directly went, and entred the Haven about two houres within night, where we found an infinite company of Vessels riding at anchor, to the number, according to our thinking, of three thousand at the least, which gave us such an alarum, as not daring scarce to wag vve got out again vvith all the secrecy that might be; crossing over the vvhole breadth of the River then, which vvas some six or seven leagues, vve prosecuted our course all the rest of that day, and coacted along by a great plain, with a resolution to accommodate our selves vvith Victuals vvheresoever vve could first meet vvith any, for vve were in such scarcitie, as for thirteen dayes together, no man had more then three mouthfuls of boyled Rice allowance. Being in this extremity we arrived close to certain old buildings, there went ashore one morning before day, and fell upon a house, that stood a little vvay off from the rest, where vve found a great quantity of Ryce, some Beans, dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon it fell out that <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> having one morning demanded of <hi>Similau</hi> in what part he thought they were, he

answered him so far from the purpose, and like a man that had lost his judgement, or that knew not which way he had gone, as put <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> into such choller, that he was going to st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> by some, that counselled him to forbear, lest it should be the cause of his utter ruine, whereupon moderating his anger he yeelded to the advice of his friends, neverthelesse he was not for all that so contained, but that taking him by the Beard he swore, that if within three dayes at the farthest, he did not let him see, either the truth or the falshood of what he had told him, he would Ponyard him infallibly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Similau</hi> was so exceedingly terrified, that the night following as we were abiding by the shore he slid down from the Vessel into the River, and that so closely, as he was never discovered by the Sentinels or any other untill the end of the first Watch, when as <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> was thereof advertised: This news put him so far besides himself, as he lost all patience, the rather for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e feared some revolt upon it from his Souldiers, who he saw were too much disposed thereunto. But he presently went ashore with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his company, and spent the most part of the night in seeking of <hi>Similau,</hi> without meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, or any other living soul that was able to tell any news of him, but the worst of it yet was, that upon his return into his Junk, of forty six <hi>Chinese</hi> Mariners, that he had aboard him, he found six and thirty fled away to prevent the danger they were afraid of, whereat <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> and all his company were so amazed, that lifting up their hands and eyes to heaven, they stood a long time mute, their tears supplying the defect of their speech, thereby testifying the secret sorrow of their hearts, for considering well what had hapned unto them, and the great peril they were in, the least that they could do in this confusion was to lose their courage and judgment, much more their speech. Howbeit falling at length to consult what we should do for the future, after much diversitie of opinion, it was in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with such of his company as he had called to it, there it was concluded that it was not possible so great and magnificent a thing should be without some kind of guard, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was resolved that with the greatest silence that might be, it should be round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all about, for to see what advenues it had, or what Obstacles we might meet with when there was question of landing, to the end that accordingly we might deliberate more amply on that we had to do: With this Resolution, which was approved by every one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> weighed anchor, and without any noyse got close to the Island, and compassing it about exactly observed every particular that presented it self to his sight. This Island was all inclosed with a platform of Jasper, six and twenty spans high, the stones whereof were so neatly wrought, and joyned together, that the wall seemed to be all of one piece, at which every one greatly marvelled, as having never seen any thing till then, either in the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> or elsewhere, that merited comparison with it; this Wall was six and twenty spans deep from the bottome of the River to the Superficies of the water, so that the full height of it was two and fifty spans. Furthermore the top of the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form was bordered with the same stone, cut into great Tower-work; Upon this wall, which invironed the whole Island, was a Gallerie of Balisters of turn'd Copper, that from six to six fathom joyned to certain Pillars of the same Mettal, upon each of the which was the figure of a Woman holding a bowl in her hand; within this gallery were divers Monsters cast in mettal, standing all in a row, which holding one another by the hand in manner of a dance incompassed the whole Island, being as I have said, a league about: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst these monstrous Idols there was likewise another row of very rich Arches, made of sundry coloured pieces; a sumptuous work, and wherewith the eye might well be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and contented; Within was a little wood of Orange Trees, without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of other plants, and in the midst an hundred and threescore Hermitages dedicated to the gods of the year, of whom these Gentiles recount many pleasant Fables in their Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles for the defence of their blindness in their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There he found an old man, that seemed to be an hundred years old; he was apparelled in a long violet coloured damask gown, and by his countenance appeared to be a man of quality, as we understood afterwards: Being amazed to see so many men, he fell to the ground, where he lay a good while without speaking a word, howbeit at length he began to be better confirmed, and beholding us with a serious look, he gravely demanded of us what we were, and what we would have; whereunto the Interpreter answered by the express commandment of <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> that he was a Captain stranger, a native of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> and that sayling in a Junk of his, laden with merchandise, and bound for <hi>Liampoo,</hi> he had suffered shipwrack, whence he had miraculously escaped with all his company, and for that he had vowed to make a pilgrimage to this holy place, to praise God for preserving him from so great a peril, he was now come to perform his vow; also to crave somwhat of him by way of alms, whereby his poverty might be relieved, protesting within three years to render him twice as much as he should then take from him: whereupon the Hermit, named <hi>Hiticon,</hi> having mused a little on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and fixing his eye on <hi>Antonio de Faria: Whoever thou art,</hi> said he unto him, <hi>know that I throughly understand what thou sayest, and that I perceive but too well thy damnable inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherewith out of the obscurity of thy blindness, like an infernal pilot, thou carriest both thy self, and these others, into the profound abism of the lake of night: for instead of rendring thanks to God for so great a favour, as thou confessest he hath shewed thee, thou comest hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to rob this holy house: But let me ask thee, if thou executest thy mischievous designe, what will the divine Iustice, thinkest thou, do with thee at the last gasp of thy life? Change then thy perverse inclination, and never suffer the imagination of so great a sin to enter thy thoughts; give credit unto me that tels thee nothing but the very truth, even as I hope to thrive by it all the rest of my life. Antonio de Faria</hi> seeming to approve of the counsel, which the old Hermit gave him, earnestly desired him not to be displeased, assuring him that he had no other means or way left to relieve him and his, but what he could find in that place: To which the Hermit wringing his hands, and lifting up his eyes, said weeping, <hi>Praised be thou, O Lord, that permittest men to live on the earth, who offend thee under pretext of seeking means to live, and that vouchsafe not to serve thee one hour, although they know how assured thy glory is.</hi> After he had uttered these words, he remained very pensive and much troubled to see the great disorder we used in breaking up the coffins, and flinging them out of their places; at length looking upon <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> who stood leaning upon his sword, he intreated him to sit down by him, which he did with a great deal of compliment, not desisting for all that from making signes to his souldiers to persist as they had begun, that was to take the silver which was min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled amongst the bones of the dead in the tombs, that they brake up; whereat the Hermit was so grieved as he fell down twice in a swoon from his seat, but being come to himself, he spake thus to <hi>Antonio de Faria, I will declare unto thee as to a man that seems discreet, the means whereby thou mayst obtain pardon for the sin, which thou and thy people now commit, to the end that thy soul may not perish eternally, when as the last breath of thy mouth shal go out of thy body: Seeing then, as thou sayest, that it is necessity constrains thee to offend in this grievous manner, and that thou hast a purpose to make restitution before thou dyest, of that thou takest away from hence; if thou hast time and power, thou mayst do these three things: First, thou must render again what thou now carriest away, that the Sovereign Lord may not turn his mercy from thee: Secondly, thou must with tears ask him forgiveness for thy fault, which is so odious unto him, never ceasing to chastise thy flesh both day and night: And thirdly, thou must distribute thy goods to the poor, as liberally as to thy self, giving them alms with prudence and discretion, to the end the servant of the night may have nothing to accuse thee of at the last day. Now, for recompence of this counsel, I desire thee to command thy follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to gather together the bones of the Saints, that they may not be despised on the earth. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio de Faria</hi> promised him very curteously to perform his request, wherewith the Hermit was a little better at quiet then before, but yet not fully satisfied, howbeit he spake him very fair, and assured him that after he had once seen him, he very much repented the undertaking of this enterprise, but his souldiers had threatned to kill him, if he returned without execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, and this he told him as a very great secret, <hi>God grant it be so,</hi> replyed the Hermit, <hi>for that thou shalt not be so blame-worthy as these other monst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

bones, and carryed it abord our ships, we were all of opinion not to go any farther to the rest of the Hermitages, as well because we knew not the Countrey, as for that it was almost night, upon hope that the next day we might continue our enterprise more at leisure. Now before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>qued himselfe, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> took leave of the Hermit, and giving him very good words, he desired him for Gods sake not to be offended with that his followers had done, being constrained thereunto by meer necessity: for as his for particular he exceedingly abhorred such like actions, adding withall, that at the first sight of him, he would have returned back, out of the remover of conscience, and true repentance; but that his company had hindered him, saying, that if he did so, they would surely kill him; so that for to have his life he was compelled to yeild and consent thereunto, though he plainly saw that it was a very great sin, in regard whereof he was resolved, as soon as he could rid his hands of them, to go up and down the world to perform such penance as was requisite for the purging of him from so enormous a crime. Hereunto the Hermit answered, <hi>Pleaseth the Lord, who living, reigneth above the beauty of the stars, that the knowledge, which by this discourse, thou shewest to have, be not prejudiciall unto thee; For I be assured, that he who knows these things, and doth them not, runs a far greater danger, than he that sins through ignorance.</hi> Then one of ours, named <hi>Nuno Coelho,</hi> who would needs have an oar in our talk, told him, that he was not to be angry for a matter of so small importance; whereunto the Hermit beholding him with so stern a countenance, answered, <hi>Certainly, the fear which thou hast of death is yet lesse, since thou imployest thy selfe in actions as infamous and black as the soul that is in thy body; and for my part, I cannot but be perswaded, that all thy ambition is wholly placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on money, as but too well appears by the the thirst of thy insatiable avarice, whereby thou wilt make an end of heaping up the measure of thine infernal appetite: Continue then thy theeveries, for seeing then thou must go to hell for that which thou hast already taken out of this holy house, thou shalt also go thither for those things which thou shalt steal otherwise, so the heavier the burden shall be that thou bearest, the sooner shalt thou be precipitated into the bottom of hell, where already thy wicked works have prepared thee an everlasting abode.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Nuno de Coelho</hi> prayed him to take all things patiently, affirming that the Law of God commanded him so to do. Then the Hermit lift up his hand by way of admiration, and as it were smiling at what the souldier had said, <hi>Truly,</hi> answered he, <hi>I am come to see, that I never thought to see or hear, namely, evil actions disguised with a specious pretext of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which makes me believe that thy blindnesse is exceeding great, since trusting to good words, thou spendest thy life so wickedly, wherefore it is not possible thou shouldest ever come to Heaven, or give any account to God at the last day, as of necessity they must do.</hi> Saying so, he turned him to <hi>Antonio de Faria,</hi> without attending further answer from him, and earnestly desired him not to suffer his company to spit upon and prophane the altar, which he vowed was more grievous to him, then the induring of a thousand deaths; whereupon to satisfie him, he presently commanded the forbearance of it; wherewith the Hermit was somewhat comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Now because it grew late, <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi> resolved to leave the place, but before he departed he held it necessary to inform himself of certain other particulars, whereof he stood in some doubt, so that he deserved of the Hermit how many persons there might be in all those Hermitages: whereunto <hi>Hiticon</hi> answered, that there were about three hundred and threescore <hi>Talagrepos,</hi> besides forty <hi>Menigrepos,</hi> appointed to furnish them with things requisite for their maintenance, and to attend them when they were sick: moreover he asked him, whether the King of <hi>China</hi> came not somtimes thither; he told him, No, for, said he, the King cannot be condemned by any body, he is the son of the Sun, but contrarily he had power to absolve every one. Then he enquired of him if there were any arms in their Hermitages? O no, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Hermit, <hi>for all such as pretend to go to heaven have more need of patience to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure injuries, then of arms to revenge themselves:</hi> Being also desirous to know of him the cause why so much silver was mingled with the bones of the dead. <hi>This silver,</hi> replied the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, <hi>comes of the alms that the deceased carry with them out of this into the other life, for to serve them at their need in the heaven of the Moon, where they live eternally: In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi> having demanded of him whither they had any women, he said, <hi>That they which would maintain the life of their souls, ought not to taste the pleasures of the flesh, seeing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience made it apparent, that the Bee which nourisheth her self in an hony-comb, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With this Resolution we went some six or seven leagues over rocks and hills, and on the other side discovered a great Marsh, so large and void, as it past the reach of our sight, there being no appearance of any land beyond it, which made us turn back again, towards the same place where we were cast away; being arrived there the day after about Sun-set, we found upon the shore the bodies of our men, which the Sea had cast up, over whom we recomenced our sorrow and lamentations, and the next day we buried them in the sand, to keep them from being devoured by the Tygers, whereof that Country is full, which we performed with much labour and pain, in regard we had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tools for that purpose but our hands and nails; After these poor bodies were interred we got us into a Marsh, where we spent all the night, as the safest place we could chuse to preserve us from the Tygers: From thence we continued our journey towards the North, and that by such Precipes and thick woods, as we had much adoe to pass through them. Having travelled in this manner three dayes, at length we arrived at a little straight, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting any body, over the which resolving to swim, by ill fortune the four first that entred into it, being three <hi>Portugals</hi> and a young youth, were miserably drowned, for being very feeble, and the straight somewhat broad, and the current of the water very strong, they were not able to hold out any longer when they came to the midst; so we eleven with three servants that remained, seeing the infortunate successe of our companions, could do nothing but weep and lament, as men that hourly expected such or a worse end. Having spent all that dark night, exposed to the winde, cold, and rain, it pleased our Lord that the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before day we discovered a great fire towards the East, whereupon as soon as the day broke, we marched fair and softly that way, recomending our selves to that Almighty God from whom alone we could hope for a remedy to our miseries, and so continuing our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney all along the River, the most part of that day, at last we came to a little wood, where we found five men making of coals, whom on our knees we besought for Gods sake to direct us to some place where we might get some relief; <hi>I would,</hi> said one of them, beholding us with an eye of pitie, <hi>it lay in our power to help you, but alas! all the comfort we can give you is to bestow some part of our Supper on you, which is a little rice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you may passe this night here with us if you will, though I hold it better for you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on your way, and recover the place you see a little below, where you shall finde an Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital that serves to lodge such Pilgrims, as chance to come into these quarters.</hi> Having thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for his good addresse, we fell to the Rice they gave us, which came but to two mouthfuls a piece, and so took our leaves of them, going directly to the place they had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, as well as our weakness would permit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:50126:57"/>About an hour within night, we arrived at the Hospital, where we met with four men,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> that had the charge of it, who received us very charitably: The next morning as soon as it was day they demanded of us, what we were, and from whence we came? Thereunto we answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that we were strangers, natives of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> and that coming from the Port of <hi>Liampoo</hi> to go to the fishing of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> we were cast away at sea by the violence of a storm, having saved nothing out of this shipwrack, but those our miserable and naked bodies. Whereupon demanding of us again, what we intended to do, and whither we would go; we replyed, that we purposed to go to the City of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> there to imbarque our selves as row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the first <hi>Lanteaa,</hi> that should put to sea, for to pass unto <hi>Cantan,</hi> where our countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by the permission of the <hi>Aito</hi> of <hi>Panquin,</hi> exercised their traffique under the protection of the son of the Sun, and <hi>Lyon</hi> crowned in the throne of the world, wherefore we desired them for Gods cause to let us stay in that Hospital, until we had recovered our healths, and to bestow any poor clothes of us to cover our nakednedness. After they had given good ear unto us; It was reason, answered they, to grant you that which you require with so much earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and tears; but in regard the House is now very poor, we cannot so easily discharge our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties unto you as we should, howbeit we will do what we may with a very good will; Then quite naked, as we were, they lead us all about the Village, containing some forty or fifty fires, more or less; the inhabitants whereof were exceeding poor, having no other living but what they got by the labour of their hands, from whom they drew by way of alms some two <hi>Taeis</hi> in mony, half a Sack of rice, a little meal, aricot beans, onions, and a few old rags, wherewith we made the best shift we could; over and above this they bestowed two <hi>Taeis</hi> more on us out of the Stock of the Hospital: But whereas we desired that we might be permitted to stay there, they excused themselves, saying, that no poor might remain there above three days, or five at the most, unless it were sick people, or women with child, of whom special care was to be had, because in their extremities they could not travel without endangering their lives, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could for no other persons whatsoever transgress that Ordinance, which had of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time been instituted by the advice of very learned and religious men; nevertheless, that three leagues from thence, we should in a great Town, called <hi>Sileyiacau,</hi> find a very rich hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, where all sorts of poor people were entertained, and that there we should be far better look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto then in their house, which was poor, and agreeable to the place of its scituation, to which end they would give us a letter of recommendation, by means whereof we should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently be received. For these good offices we rendred them infinite thanks, and told them that God would reward them for it since they did it for his sake, whereupon an old man, one of those four, taking the Speech upon him, <hi>It is for that consideration alone we do it,</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he, <hi>and not in regard of the world; for God and the World are greatly different in matters of works, and of the intention which one my have in the doing of them; For the world being poor and miserable as it is, can give nothing that is good, whereas God is infinitely rich, and a friend to the poor, that in the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The first thing we did, was to go to the house of the repose of the poor, for so the <hi>Chineses</hi> call the Hospitals; There we delivered our letters to the Masters of that Society, which they term <hi>Tanigories,</hi> whom
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50126:58"/>
we found altogether in a chamber, where they were assembled about the affairs of the poor; After they had received the letter with a kind of compliment, that seemed very strange to us, they commanded the Register to read it, whereupon he stood up and read thus to them that were sitting at the Table: <hi>We the poorest of the poor, unworthy to serve that Sovereign Lord, whose works are so admirable, as the Sun, and the stars that twinckle in the skie, during the darkness of the night do testifie: Having been elected to the succession of this his house of</hi> Buatendoo, <hi>scituated in this Village of</hi> Catihorau, <hi>with all manner of respect and honour, do beseech your humble persons, admitted to the service of the Lord, that out of a zeal of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you will lodg and favour these fourteen strangers, whereof three are tawny, the other eleven somewhat whiter, whose poverty will manifestly appear to your eyes, whereby you may judg how much reason we have to present this request unto you, for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Having spent eighteen days in this Hospital, where we were sufficiently provided for with all things necessary,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> it pleased God that we throughly recovered our healths, so that feeling our selves strong enough to travel, we departed from thence for to go to a place, called <hi>Zuzoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances,</hi> some five leagues from that Hospital, where we arrived about sun-set; Now in regard we were very weary, we sat us down upon the side of a fountain, that stood at the entrance of that Village, being much perplexed and unresolved what way to take: In the mean time, they which came to fetch water, seeing us set there in so sad an equipage, returned with their pitchers empty, and advertising the inhabitants of it, the most of them came presently forth to us; Then wondering much, because they had never seen men like unto us, they gathered alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as if they would consult thereupon, and after they had a good while debated one with another, they sent an old woman to demand of us what people we were, and why we sat so about that fountain, from whence they drew all the water they used: Hereunto we answered, that we were poor strangers, natives of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> who by a storm at sea were cast upon their Countrey, in that miserable plight wherein they beheld us. Tell me, replyed she, what course would you have us to take for you, and what resolve you to do, for here is no house for the repose of the poor whereinto you may be received? To these words one of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany answered with tears in his eyes, and a gesture conformable to our designe, that God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which he was, would never abandon us with his Almighty hand, but would touch their hearts to take compassion of us, and our poverty; and further, that we were resolved to travel in that miserable case we were in till we had the good fortune to arrive at the City of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> where we desired to put our selves into the <hi>Lanteaas,</hi> there to serve for rowers to the Merchants that ordinarily went from thence to <hi>Cantano,</hi> and so to get to <hi>Comhay,</hi> where great store of our Country Junks usually lay, in which we would imbarque our selves. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon having somewhat a better opinion of us then before; Seeing you are, said she, such as you deliver, have a little patience till I come again, and tell you what these folks resolve to do with

you; wherewith she returned to those country people, which were about some hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, with whom she entred into a great contestation, but at length she came back with one of their Priests, attired in a long gown of red damask; which is an ornament of chiefest dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity among them, in this equipage he came to us with an handful of ears of corn in his hand; Then having commanded us to approach unto him, we presently obeyed him with all kind of respect, but he little regarded it, seeing us so poor; whereupon after he had thrown the ears of corn into the fountain, he willed us to put our hands upon them, which we accordingly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done: <hi>You are to confess,</hi> said he unto us, <hi>by this holy and solemn oath, that now you take in my presence upon these two substances of bread and water, which the high Creator of all things hath made by his holy will to sustain and nourish all that is born into the world, during the pilgrimage of this life, whether that which you told this woman but now be true, for upon that condition we will give you lodging in this village conformably to the charities we are bound to exercise towards Gods poor people; whereas contrarily, if it be not so, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you in his Name that you presently get you gone, upon pain of being bitten and destroyed by the teeth of the gluttenous Serpent, that makes his abode in the bottom of the house of smoak.</hi> Hereunto we answered, that we had said nothing but what was most true, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Priest remaining satisfied; since you are, said he, such as you say, come you along boldly with me, and rely on my word: Then returning with us to the inhabitants of the place, be told them that they might bestow their alms upon us without offence, and that he gave them permission so to do, whereupon we were presently conducted into the Village, and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the porch of their <hi>Pagode,</hi> or Temple, where we were furnished with all that was needful for us, and had two mats given us to lie upon: The next morning as soon as it was day, we went up and down the street, begging from door to door, and got four <hi>Taeis</hi> in silver, wherewith we supplied our most pressing necessities. After this we went away to another place, called <hi>Xianguulea,</hi> that was not above two leagues from that, with a resolution to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in that sort, as it were in pilgrimage, to the City of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> to which it was then some hundred and forty leagues; for we thought that from thence we might go to <hi>Cantano,</hi> where our ships traded at that time, and it may be our designe had succeeded, had it not been for ill fortune. About even-song we arrived at that village, where we sat us down under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a great tree that stood by it self, but it was our ill hap to meet with three boyes that kept certain cattel there, who no sooner perceived us, but betaking them to their heels, they cried our, Thieves, thieves, whereat the inhabitants came instantly running out, armed with lances and cros-bowes, crying out, stop the thieves, stop the thieves; and so perceiving us, that fled from them, they mauld us cruelly with stones and staves, in such manner as we were all of us grievously hurt, especially one of our boyes that died upon it; Then seizing on us, they tied our arms behind us, and leading us like prisoners into the village, they so beat and buffeted us with their fists, as they had almost killed us, then they plunged us into a cistern of standing water, that reached up to our wasts, wherein were a great number of horse-leeches; In this miserable place we remained two days, which seemed two hundred years to us, having neither rest, nor any thing to eat all that time: At last, it was our good fortune, that a man of <hi>Zuzoangance,</hi> from whence we came, passing by, chanced to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how we had been used by those of the Village, and thereupon went and told them, that they did us great wrong to take us for thieves, for that we were poor stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which had been cast away by a storm at sea, wherefore they had committed a great sin to imprison, and handle us in that sort; The report of this man wrought so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually with them, that we were presently taken out of the cistern, being all gore blood with the sucking of the horse-leeches, and I verily believe that if we had stayed there but one day longer, we had all of us been dead: So we departed from this place about evening, and bewayling our bad fortune, continuing on our voyage.</p>
            <p>After our departure from <hi>Xianguulea</hi> we arrived at a Village, inhabited by very poor people, where we met with three men that were pilling Flax,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> who as soon as they saw us forsook their work, and fled hastily away into a wood of Firr trees, there they cryed out to those that passed by to take heed of us for that we w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50126:59"/>
it was day we got again into the way which we had left, and not long after we discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the top of a little hill a great plain full of trees, and in the midst thereof a very fair House hard by a River, whither forthwith we went, and sate us down by a fountain that was before the outer gate, where we remained two or three hours without seeing any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, at length a young Gentleman about sixteen or seventeen years of age came riding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a very good Horse, accompanied with four men on foot, whereof one carried two Hares, and another five <hi>Nivatores,</hi> which are Fowls resembling our Phesants, with a Gos-Hawk on his fist, and three or four couple of Spaniels at their heels; when this Gentleman came at us he staid his Horse, to ask us who we were, and whether we would have any thing with him. Hereunto we answered as well as we could, and made him an ample Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole event of our shipwrack, whereat he seemed to be very sorry, as we could gather by his countenance, so that ere he went, Stay there, said he unto us, for by and by I will send you what you have need of, and that for his sake that with a glory of great riches lives raigning in the highest of all the Heavens. A little after he sent an old woman for us, which was apparelled in a long garment, with a Chaplet hanging down on her neck, the good Dame coming to us, The son of him said she, whom me hold for Master in this house, and whose Rice we ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, within it was a man painted almost in the form of a <hi>Tortois,</hi> with the feet up, and the head downwards, and round about it these words were read for a device, <hi>Ingualec finguau, potim aquarau,</hi> that is to say, <hi>So is it with all that appertains to me</hi>; We learnt afterwards, that by this Monster the Figure of the world was represented, which the <hi>Chineses</hi> depaint in this manner to demonstrate that there is nothing in it but falshood, and so to dis-abuse all them that make such account of it by making them to see how all things in it are turned upside down. Out of this Court we went up a broad pair of stairs, made of fair hewed stone, and entred into a great Hall, where a woman of about fiftie years of age, was set upon a Tapestry Carpet, having two young Gentlewomen by her side, that were exceeding fair, and richly apparelled, with chains of Pearl about their necks, and hard by them was a reverend old man laid upon a little bed, whom one of the two Gentlewomen fanned with a V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereat the young Gentlewoman that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, not able to forbear smiling: <hi>Sir,</hi> said she, <hi>they have more need that you would be pleased to give order for the satisfying of their hunger, then to be questioned about a matter which it is likely they are ignorant of, wherefore me thinks it were better first to give them what they want, and afterwards to talk with them about that which concerns them lesse</hi>; For these words the Mother reprehending her, <hi>Go to,</hi> said she, <hi>you will ever be prating when you should not, but surely I shall make you leave this custome</hi>; whereunto the daughter smiling, replied, <hi>That you shall when you please, but in the mean time I beseech you, let these poor strangers have something to eat:</hi> For all this the old man would not give over questioning us, for he demanded of us who we were, of what country, and whither we were going, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many other such like things? To which we answered as occasion required, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unto him, how, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This answer rendred the old man pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive for a while, until at length turning him to his son, Well now, said he unto him, what

thinkest thou of that which thou hast heard these strangers deliver? It were good for thee to imprint it well in thy memory, to the end it may teach thee to know God better, and give him thanks for that he hath given thee a Father, who to exempt thee from the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and necessities of this life hath parted with three of the goodliest things in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whereof the least is worth above a hundred thousand <hi>Taeis,</hi> and bestowed them on thee, but thou art of a humour more inclined to hunt a Hare, then to retain this vvhich I novv tell thee; The young Gentleman made no reply, but smiling looked upon his Sisters. Then the old man caused meat to be brought unto us before him, and commanded us to fall to it, as vve most vvillingly did, whereat he took great pleasure, in regard his stomack was quite gone with his sickness, but his young daughters much more, who with their brother did nothing but laugh to see us feed our selves with our hands, for that is contrary to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome which is observed throughout the whole Empire of <hi>China,</hi> where the Inhabitants at their meat carry it to their mouthes with two little sticks made like a pair of Cizers; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had given God thanks, the old man that had well observed us, lifting up his hands to heaven, with tears in his eyes, <hi>Lord,</hi> said he, <hi>that livest raigning in the tranquility of thy high wisdome, I laud thee in all humility for that thou permittest men that are strangers, come from the farthest end of the world, and without the knowledge of thy doctrine, to render thee thanks, and give thee praise according to their weak capacity, which makes me beleeve that thou wilt accept of them with as good a will, as if it were some great offering of melodious mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick agreeable to thine eares.</hi> Then he caused three pieces of linnen cloth, and four <hi>Taeis</hi> of Silver to be given us, willing us withall to passe that night in his house, because it was somewhat too late for us to proceed on our journey; This offer we most gladly accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with complements, after the manner of the Country we testified our thankfulness to him, wherewith himself, his wife, and his son rested very well satisfied.</p>

Being gone from this place we continued on our journey to another Village, called <hi>Guinapalir,</hi> from whence we were almost two months travelling from country to country, untill at last our ill fortune brought us to a Town, named <hi>Taypor,</hi> where by chance there was at that time a <hi>Chumbrin,</hi> that is to say, one of those Super-intendents of Justice, that every three years are sent throughout the Provinces for to make report unto the King of all that passeth there: This naughty man seeing us go begging from door to door called to us from a window where he was, and would know of us who we were, and of what Nation, as also what obliged us to run up and down the World in that manner? Having asked us these questions in the presence of three Registers, and of many other persons, that were gathered together to behold us, we answered him, that we were strangers, Natives of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> who being cast away by a storm at Sea went thus travelling and begging our living, to the end we might su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain our selves with the charity of good people, until such time as we could arrive at <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>

whither we were going with an intent to imbarque our selves there in some of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants <hi>Lanteaas</hi> for <hi>Canton,</hi> where the shipping of our Nation lay. This answer we made unto the <hi>Chumbim,</hi> who questionless had been well enough contented with it, and would have let us go, had it been for one of his Clarks, for he told them that we were idle vagabonds, that spent our time in begging from door to door, and abusing the alms that were given us, and therefore he was at no hand to let us go free, for fear of incurring the punishment, ordained for such as offend in that sort, as is set forth in the seventh of the twelve books of the Statutes of the Realm; wherefore as his faithful servant he counselled him to lay us in good and sure hold, that we might be forth-coming to answer the Law: The <hi>Chumbim</hi> presently followed his Clarks advice, and carried himself toward us with as much barbarous cruelty, as could be expected from a Pagan, such as he was, that lived without God or religion; To which effect after he had heard a number of false witnesses, who charged us with many foul crimes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we never so much as dreamt, he caused us to be put into a deep dungeon, with irons on our hands and feet, and great iron collars about our necks; In this miserable place we endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red such hunger, and were so fearfully whipped, that we were in perpetual pain for six and twenty days together, at the end whereof we were by the sentence of the same <hi>Chumbim</hi> sent to the Parliament of the <hi>Cheam</hi> of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> because the Jurisdiction of this extended not to the condemnation of any prisoner to death.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 2</note>We remained six and twenty days in that cruel prison, whereof I spake before, and I vow we thought we had been six and twenty thousand years there, in regard of the great misery we suffered in it, which was such, as one of our companions called <hi>Ioano Roderiguez Bravo,</hi> died in our arms, being eaten up with lice, we being no way able to help him, and it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a miracle that the rest of us escaped alive from that filthy vermine; At length, one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when we thought of nothing less, loden with irons as we were, and so weak that we could hardly speak, we were drawn out of that prison, and then being chained one to another, we were imbarqued with many others, to the number of thirty or forty, that having been convicted for sundry hainous crimes, were also sent to the Parliament of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Having been imbarqued in the manner I spake of, the same day at night we went &amp; lay at a great tower, called <hi>Potinleu,</hi> in one of the prisons whereof were mained nine days, by reason of the much rain that fell then upon the conjunction of the New-moon: There we happened to meet with a <hi>Russian</hi> prisoner, that received as very charitably, of whom demanding in the <hi>Chinese</hi> tongue, which he understood as well as we, what countrey-man he was, and what fortune had brought him thither; he told us, that he was of <hi>Moscovy,</hi> born in a town, named <hi>Hiquegens,</hi> and that some five years past, being accused for the death of a man, he had been condemned to a perpetual prison, but as a stranger he appealed from that sentence to the tribunal of the <hi>Aytau</hi> of <hi>Batampina,</hi> in the City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> who was the highest of the two and thirty Admirals, established in this Empire, that is, for every Kingdom one: He added further, that this Admiral by a particular Jurisdiction, had absolute power over all strangers, whereupon he hoped to find some relief from him, intending to go and die a Christian among the Christians, if he might have the

After we had passed those nine days in this prison, being rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued, we sayled up a great river seven days together, at the end whereof we arrived at <hi>Nanquin.</hi> As this City is the second of all the Empire, so is it also the Capital of the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Liampoo, Fanius,</hi> and <hi>Sambor:</hi> Here we lay six weeks in prison, and suffered so much pain and misery, as reduced to the last extreamities, we died incensibly for want of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, not able to do any thing, but look up to heaven with a pitiful eye; for it was our ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to have all that we had stoln from us the first night we came thither: This prison was so great, that there were four thousand prisoners in it at that time, as we were credibly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so that one should hardly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Sentence was pronounced in the prison, where it had been better for us to have suffered death, then the stripes that we received, for all the ground round about us ran with blood upon our whiping, so that it was almost a miracle, that of the eleven which we were, nine escaped alive, for two of our company died three days after, besides one of our servants.</p>
            <p>After we had been whipped in that manner, I have declared,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> we were carried into a great Chamber, that was in the prison, where were a number of sick, and diseased persons, lying upon beds, and otherways; There we had presently our stripes washed, and things applyed unto them, whereby we were somewhat eased of our pain, and that by men, much like unto the fraternity of mercy among the Papists, which only out of charity, and for the honour of God, do tend those that are sick, and liberally furnish them with all things necessary. Hereafter some eleven or twelve days, we began to be pretily recovered, and as we were lamenting our ill fortune, for being so rigorously condemned to lose our thumbs, it pleased God one morning, when as we little dreamt ofit, that we espied two men come into the chamber, of a good aspect, clothed in long gowns of violet coloured satin, &amp; carrying white rods in their hands; As soon as they arrived, all the sick persons in the Chamber cried out, <hi>Blessed be the Ministers of the works ofGod:</hi> whereunto they answ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Continuing our course up this river,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> the first two days we saw not any remarkable town or place, but only a great number of Villages, and little hamlets of two or three hundred fires a piece, which by their buildings seemed to be houses of fisher men, and poor people, that live by the labour of their hands; For the rest, all that was within view in the countrey, was great woods of Firr, Groves, Forrests, and Orange trees, as also plains full of wheat, rice, beans, pease, millet, panick, barley, rye, flax, cotton wool, with great inclosures of gardens, and goodly houses of pleasure, belonging to the <hi>Mandarins,</hi> and Lords of the Kingdom: There was likewise all along the river such an infinite number of cattel of all sorts, as I can assure you there is not more in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> nor in all the dominions of <hi>Prester Iohn</hi>; upon the top of the mountains many houses of their Sects of <hi>Gentiles</hi> were to be seen, adorned with high Steeples guilt all over, the glistering whereof was such, and so great, that to behold them a far off was an admirable sight: The fourth day of our voyage we arrived at a town, called <hi>Pocasser,</hi> twice as big as <hi>Cantano,</hi> compassed about with strong wals of hewed stone, and towers and bulwarks almost like ours, together with a key on the river side, twice as long as the shot of a falconet, and inclosed with two rows of iron grates, with very strong gates, where the Junks and vessels that arrived there were unladen; This place abounds with all kinds of merchandise, which from thence is transported over all the Kingdom, especially with copper, sugar, and allum, whereof there is very great store; Here also in the middest of a carrefour, that is almost at the end of the town, stands a mighty strong castle, having three bulwarks and five towers, in the highest of which the present Kings Father, as the <hi>Chineses</hi> told us, kept a King of <hi>Tartaria</hi> nine years prisoner, at the end whereof he killed himself with poyson, that his subjects sent him, because they would not be constrained to pay that ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, which the King of <hi>China</hi> demanded for his deliverance: In this town the <hi>Chifuu</hi> gave three of us leave to go up and down for to crave the alms of good people, accompanied with four <hi>Hupes,</hi> that are as Sergeants, or Bailiffs amongst us, who led us, chained together, as we were, through six or seven streets, where we got in alms to the value of above twent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Afterwards we were brought to a <hi>Pagode,</hi> whither the people flocked from all parts that day, in regard of a very solemn feast that was then celebrated there: This Temple, or <hi>Pagode,</hi> as we were told<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had somtime been a Pallace royal, where the King then reigning was born, now because the Queen his Mother died there in child-birth, she commanded her self to be buried in the very same chamber where she was brought to bed, wherefore to honour her death the better, this Temple was dedicated to the invocation of <hi>Tauhinaret,</hi> which is one of the principal Sects of the <hi>Pagans</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> as I will more am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, when as I shall speak of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of the two and thirty laws that are in it; All the buildings of this Temple, together with all the gardens, and walks, that belong to it, are suspended in the ayr upon three hundred and threescore pillars, every one of the which is of one intire stone of a very great bigness; These three hundred and threescore pillars, are called by the names of three hundred and threescore days of the year, and in each of them is a particular feast kept there with many alms, gifts, and bloody sacaifices, accompanied with musick, dancing, and other sports; Under this <hi>Pagode,</hi> namely between those pillars, are eight very fair streets, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed on every side with grates of copper, and gates for the passage of pilgrims, and others, that run continually to this feast, as it were to a Jubilee; The Chamber above, where the Queen lay, was made in the form of a Chappel, but round, and from the top to the bottom all gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50126:63"/>
with silver, the workmanship whereof was of greater cost then the matter it self; In the midst of it stood a kind of Tribunal, framed round, like the Chamber, some fifteen steps high, compassed about with six gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es of silver, on the top whereof was a great bowl, and upon that a Lion of silver, that with his head supported a shrine of gold, three hand-bredths square, wherein they said, the bones of the Queen were, which these blinded ignorants reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced as a great relique; Below this Tribunal in equal proportion were four bars of silver, that traversed the Chamber, whereon hung three and forty lamps of the same mettal, in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the three and forty years that this Queen lived, and seven lamps of gold in commamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of seven sons that she had; moreover at the entry into the Chappel, just against the door, were eight other bars of iron, whereon also hung a very great number of silver lamps, which the <hi>Chineses</hi> told us were offered by some of the Wives of the <hi>Chaems, Aytaos, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toens,</hi> and <hi>Anchacys,</hi> who were assistant at the death of the Queen, so that in aknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that honour they sent those lamps thither afterwards; without the gates of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and round about six ballisters of copper that invironed it, were a great many Statues of Giants, fifteen foot high, cast in brass, all well proportioned with halberts or clubs in their hands, and some of them with battle-axes on their shoulders, which made so brave and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestical a shew, as one could never be satisfied enough with looking on them; Amongst these Statues, which were in number twelve hundred, as the <hi>Chineses</hi> affirmed, there were four and twenty very great Serpents also of brass, and under every one of them a woman seated, with a sword in her hand, and a silver crown on her head; It was said, that those four and twenty women carried the Titles of Queens, because they sacrificed themselves to the death of this Queen, to the end their souls might serve hers in the other life, as in this their bodies had served her body, a matter which the <hi>Chineses,</hi> that draw their extraction from these wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, hold for a very great honour, insomuch as they inrich the crests of their coats of arms with it; round about this row of Giants was another of triumphant arches, guilt all over, whereon a number of silver bels hung by chains of the same mettal, which moved with the air kept such a continual ringing, as one could hardly hear one another for the noise they made; Without these arches there were likewise at the same distance two rows of copper grates, that inclosed all this huge work, and among them certain pillars of the same mettal, which support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lions rampant, mounted upon bowls, being the arms of the Kings of <hi>China,</hi> as I have related elsewhere. At each corner of the Carrefour was a monster of brass, of so strange and unmeasurable an heighth, and so deformed to behold, as it is not possible almost for a man to imagine, so that I think it best not to speak of them, the rather for that I confess I am not able in words to express the form wherein I saw their prodigies; Howbeit as it is reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to conceal these things without giving some knowledg of them, I will say, as much as my weak understanding is able to deliver. One of these Monsters which is on the right hand, as one comes into the Carrefour, whom the <hi>Chineses</hi> call, the Serjeant <hi>Gluttom</hi> of the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or profound house of smoak, and that by their histories is held to be <hi>Lucifer,</hi> is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the figure of a Serpent of an excessive heighth, with most hideous and deformed adders coming out of his stomack, covered all over with green and black scares, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of prickles on their backs above a span long, like unto Porcupins quils; each of these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had a woman between his jaws, with her hair all dishevelled, and standing an end, as one affrighted; The monster carried also in his mouth, which was unmeasurable great, a Vizard that was above thirty foot long, and as big as a tun, with his nostrils &amp; chaps so full of blood, that all the rest of his body was besmeared with it, this Vizard held a great Eliphant between his paws, and seemed to gripe him so hard, as his very guts came out of his throat, and all this was done so proportionably, and to the life, that it made a man tremble to behold such a deformed figure, and which was scarce possible for one to imagine: His tail might be some twenty fathom long, was entortilled about such another Monster, that was the second of the four, whereof I spake, in the figure of a man, being an hundred foot high, and by the <hi>Chineses</hi> called <hi>Turcamparoo,</hi> who they say was the son of that Serpent; besides that he was very ugly, he stood with both his hands in his mouth, that was as big as a great gate, with a row of horrible teeth, and a foul black tongue, hanging out two fathom long, most dreadfull to behold: As for the other two Monsters, one was in the form of a woman, named by the <hi>Chineses, Magdelgau,</hi> seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen fathom high, and six thick; This same about the girdlesteed before had a face made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to her body, above two fathom broad, and she breathed out of her mouth and nostrils great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50126:63"/>
her head, where fire was continually kept, that in like manner came out of the said face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. By this Figure these Idolaters would demonstrate that she was the Queen of the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sphear, which according to their belief is to burn the earth at the end of the World. The fourth Monster was a man, set stooping, which with great swoln cheeks, as big as the main sail of a Ship, seemed to blow extreamly; this Monster was also of an unmeasurable height, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of such an hideous and gastly aspect, that a man could hardly endure the sight of it; the <hi>Chineses</hi> called it <hi>Vzanguenaboo,</hi> and said, that it was he which raised Tempests upon the Sea, and demolished Buildings, in regard whereof the people offred many things unto him, to the end he should do them no harm, and many presented him with a piece of money yearly, that he might not drown their Junks, nor do any of theirs hurt that went by Sea; I will omit many other abuses which their blindness makes them beleeve, and which they hold to be so true, as there is not one of them but would endure a thousand deaths for the maintenance thereof.</p>
            <p>The next day being gone from the Town of <hi>Pocasser</hi> we arrived at another fair and great Town, called <hi>Xinligau</hi>; there we saw many Buildings inclosed with walls of Brick,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> and deep ditches about them, and at one end of the Town two Castles, very well fortified with Towers and Bulwarks after our fashion; at the gates were draw Bridges, suspended in the air with great Iron chains, and in the midst of them a Tower five Stories high, very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously painted with several Pictures; the <hi>Chineses</hi> assured us, that in those two Castles there was as much Treasure, as amounted to fifteen thousand pieces of silver, which was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of all this <hi>Archipelage,</hi> and laid up in this place by the Kings Grandfather now raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in Memorial of a Son of his that was born here, and named <hi>Leuquinau,</hi> that is to say, <hi>The joy of all</hi>; those of the Country repute him for a Saint, because he ended his dayes in Religion, where also he was buried in a Temple, dedicated to <hi>Quiay Varatel,</hi> the God of all the Fishes of the Sea, of whom these miserable Ignorants recount a world of Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as also the Laws he invented, and the precepts which he left them, being able to asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish a man, as I will more amply declare when time shall serve. In this Town and in another five leagues higher the most part of the Silks of this Kingdome are dyed, because they hold that the waters of these places make the colours far more lively then those of any other part, and these Dyers, which are said to be thirteen thousand, pay unto the King yearly three hundred thousand <hi>Taeis.</hi> Continuing our course up the River the day after about evening we arrived at certain great plains, where were great store of Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f I have spoken before; at the end of the Suburbs of this Town we saw divers houses built in the water upon great Piles, in the form of Magazines; Before the gate of a little street stood a Tombe made of stone, invironed with an Iron grate, painted red and green, and over it a steeple framed of pieces of very fine Pourcelain, sustained by four pillars of curious stone; upon the top of the Tombe were five Globes, and two others that seemed to be of cast iron, and on the one side thereof were graven in Letters of gold, and in the <hi>Chinese</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, words of this substance. <hi>Here lyes</hi> Trannocem Mudeliar, <hi>Vncle to the King of</hi> Malaca, <hi>whom death took out of the World before he could be revenged of Captain</hi> Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Albuquerque, <hi>the Lyon of the robberies of the Sea.</hi> We were much amazed to behold this Inscription there, wherefore enquiring what it might mean, a <hi>Chinese,</hi> that seemed more honourable then the rest, told us; that about some fortie years before, this man which lay buried there, came thither as Embassador from a Prince, that stiled himself King of <hi>Malaca,</hi> to demand succour from the son of the Sun against men of a Country, that hath no name, which came by Sea from the end of the World, and had taken <hi>Malaca</hi> from him; this man recounted many other incredible things concerning this matter, whereof mention is made in a printed Book thereof, as also that this Embassador having continued three years at the Kings Court suing for this succour, just as it was granted him, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for it were a making, it was his ill fortune to be surprised one night at Supper with an Apoplexie, whereof he dyed at the end of nine dayes, so that extreamly afflicted to see himself carried away by a suddain death before he had accomplished his business, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed his earnest desire of revenge by the Inscription which he caused to be graven on his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50126:64"/>
tombe, that posterity might know wherefore he was come thither. Afterwards we departed from this place, and continued our voyage up the river, which thereabouts is not so large as towards the City of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> but the Country is here better peopled with Villages, Boroughs, and Gardens, then any other place, for every stones cast we met still with some <hi>Pagode,</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of pleasure, or Countrey house; Passing on about some two leagues further, we arrived at a place encompassed with great iron gates, in the midst whereof stood two mighty Statues of brass upright, sustained by pillars of cast mettal of the bigness of a bushel, and seven fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom high, the one of a man, and the other of a woman, both of them seventy four spans in heighth, having their hands in their mouths, their cheeks horribly blown out, and their eyes so staring, as they affrighted all that looked on them. That which represented a man, was called <hi>Quiay Xingatalor,</hi> and the other in the form of a woman, was named <hi>Apancapatur</hi>; Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving demanded of the <hi>Chineses</hi> the explication of these figures, they told us that the male was he, which with those mighty swoln cheeks blew the fire of hell for to torment all those mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretches, that would not liberally bestow alms in this life; and for the other monster, that she was Porter of hell gate, where she would take notice of those that did her good in this world, and letting them fly away into a river of very cold water, called <hi>Ochilenday,</hi> would keep them hid there from being tormented by the Divels, as other damned were: Upon this Speech one of our company could not forbear laughing at such a ridiculous and diabolical foolery, which three of their Priests, or <hi>Banzoes,</hi> then present observing, they were so exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly offended therewith, as they perswaded the <hi>Chifuu,</hi> which conducted us, that if he did not chastise us in such manner, as those gods might be well contented with the punishment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on us for our mockery of them, both the one and the other would assuredly torment his soul, and never suffer it to go out of hell; which threatning so mightily terrified this dog, the <hi>Chifuu,</hi> that without further delay, or hearing us speak, he caused us all to be bound hand and foot, and commanded each of us to have an hundred lashes given him with a double cord, which was immediately executed with so much rigour, as we were all in a gore bloud, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we were taught not to jeer afterwards at any thing we saw, or heard. At such time as we arrived here we found twelve <hi>Bonzoes</hi> upon the place, who with silver censors full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes of aloes and beniamin, censed those two divel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XXIX. Our Arrival at <hi>Sempitay,</hi> our encounter there with a Christian woman, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Original and Foundation of the Empire of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na; and who they were that first peopled it.</head>
            <p>FRom this place we continued our voyage eleven days more up the river, which in those parts is so peopled with Cities, Towns, Villages, Boroughs, Forts and Castles, that commonly they are not a flight shot distant one from another, besides a world of houses of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and temples, where Steeples were all guilt, which made such a glorious shew, as we were much amazed at it; In this manner we arrived at a Town, named <hi>Sempitay,</hi> where we abode five days, by reason the <hi>Chifuus</hi> wife, that conducted us, was not well: Here by his permission we landed, and chained together, as we were, we went up and down the streets craving of alms, which was very liberally given us by the Inhabitants, who wondering to see such men as we, demanded of us what kind of people we were, of what Kingdom, and how our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was called? Hereunto we answered conformably to that we had often said before, namely that we were natives of the Kingdom of of <hi>Siam,</hi> that going from <hi>Liampoo</hi> to <hi>Nanquin,</hi> we had lost all our goods by shipwrack, and that although they beheld us then in so poor a case, yet we had been forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly very rich; whereupon a woman who was come thither amongst the rest to see us; It is very likely, said she, speaking to them about her, that what these poor strangers have related is most true, for daily experience doth shew how those that trade by sea, do oftentimes make it their grave, wherefore it is best and surest to travel upon the earth, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50126:64"/>
to esteem of it, as of that, whereof it hath pleased God to frame us; saying, so she gave us two mazes, which amounts to about sixteen pence of our mony, advising us to make no more such long voyages, since our lives were so short: Hereupon she unbottoned one of the sleeves of a red Satin Gown she had on, and baring her left arm, she shewed us a crosse imprinted on it, like to the mark of a slave, saying, Do any of you know this signe, which amongst those, that follow the way of truth, is called a crosse? or have any of you ever heard it named? To this falling down on our knees, we answered, with tears in our eyes, that we know exceeding well; Then lifting up her hands, she cried out, <hi>Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name,</hi> speaking these words in the <hi>Portugal</hi> tongue, and because she could speak no more of our language, she very earnestly desired us in <hi>Chinese</hi> to tell her whether we were Christians; we replyed that we were, and for proof thereof, after we had kissed that arm, whereon the cross was, we repeated all the rest of the Lords prayer, which she had left unsaid, wherewith being assured that we were Christians indeed, she drew aside from the rest there present, and weeping said to us; Come along Christians of the other end of the world, with her that is your true Sister in the faith of Jesus Christ, or peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a kinswoman to one of you, by his side that begot me in this miserable exile, and so go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to carry us to her house, the <hi>Hupes</hi> which guarded us, would not suffer her, saying, that if we would not continue our craving of alms, as the <hi>Chifuu</hi> had permitted us, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn us back to the ship; but this they spake in regard of their own interest, for that they were to have the moitie of what was given us, as I have before declared, and accordingly they made as though they would have lead us thither again, which the woman perceiving, I understand your meaning, said she, and indeed it is but reason you make the best of your pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for thereby you live, so opening her purse, she gave them two <hi>Taeis</hi> in silver, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were very well satisfied; whereupon with the leave of the <hi>Chifuu,</hi> she carried us home to her house, and there kept us all the while we remained in that place, making exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much of us, and using us very charitably; Here she shewed us an Oratory, wherein she had a cross of wood guilt, as also candlesticks, and a lamp of silver: Furthermore she told us, that she was named, <hi>Inez de Leyria,</hi> and her Father <hi>Tome Pirez,</hi> who had been great Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour from <hi>Portugal</hi> to the King of <hi>China,</hi> and that in regard of an insurrection with a <hi>Portugal</hi> Captain, made at <hi>Canton,</hi> the <hi>Chineses</hi> taking him for a Spye, &amp; not for an Ambassodor, as he termed himself, clapped him and all his followers up in prison, where by order of Justice five of them were put to torture, receiving so many, and such cruel stripes on their bodies, as they died instantly, and that the rest were all banished into several parts, together with her father into this place, where he married with her mother, that had some means, and how he made her a Christian, living so seven and twenty years together, and converting many <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the faith of Christ, whereof there were above three hundred then abiding in that Town; which every <hi>Sunday</hi> assembled in her house to say the Catechisme: whereupon demanding of her what were their accustomed prayers, she answered, that she used no other but these, which on their knees, with their eyes and hands lift up to heaven, they pronounced in this manner, <hi>O Lord Iesus Christ, as it is most true that thou art the very Son of God, conceived by the Holy Ghost in the womb of the Virgine Mary for the salvation of sinners, so thou wilt be pleased to forgive us our offence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that thereby we may become worthy to behold thy face in the glory of thy Kingdom, where thou art sitting at the right hand of the Almighty. Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. In the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen.</hi> And so all of them kissing the Cross, imbraced one another, and thereupon returned every one to his own home. Moreover she told us, that her Father had left her many other prayers, which the <hi>Chineses</hi> had stollen from her, so that she had none left but those before recited; whereunto we replyed, that those we had heard from her were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, but before we went away we would leave her divers other good and wholsome prayers; do so then, answered she, for the respect you owe to so good a God, as yours is, and that hath done such things for you, for me, and for all in general: Then causing the cloth to be laid, she gave us a very good and plentiful dinner, and treated us in like sort every meal, during the five days we continued in her house, which as I said before, was permitted by the <hi>Chifuu</hi> in regard of a present that this good woman sent his wife, whom she earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated so to deal with her husband, as we might be well intreated, for that we were men of whom God had a particular care, as the <hi>Chifuus</hi> wife promised her to do with many thanks to her for the present she had received; In the mean space, during the five days we remained
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50126:65"/>
in her House, we read the Catechism seven times to the Christians, wherewithall they were very much edifyed, beside, <hi>Christophoro Borhalho</hi> made them a little Book in the <hi>Chinese</hi> tongue, containing the <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> the Creed, the Ten Commandments, and many other good Prayers. After these things we to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k our leaves of <hi>Inez de Leyria,</hi> and the Christians who gave us fifty <hi>Taeis</hi> in Silver, which stood us since in good stead, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>After our departure from the Town of <hi>Sempitay</hi> we continued our course upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Bataupina,</hi> unto a place, named <hi>Lequinpau,</hi> containing about eleven or twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand fires, and very well built, at least we judged so by that we could discern, as also inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with good Walls, and Curtains rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is written in the first Chronicle, of fourscore which have been made of the Kings of <hi>China,</hi> the thirteenth Chapter, as I have heard it many times delivered, That six hundred thirty and nine years, after the Deluge there was a Country called then <hi>Guantipocau,</hi> which as may be judged by the height of the Climate where it is scituated, being in sixty two degrees to the Northward, abutts on the backside of our <hi>Germany</hi>; In this Country lived at that time a Prince, named <hi>Turbano,</hi> whose state was not very great: It is said of him, that being a youth he had three children by a Woman, called <hi>Nancaa</hi> whom he extreamly affected, although the Queen his Mother then a Widow, was exceedingly displeased at it. This King being much importuned by the principal Persons of his Kingdom to marry, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways excused himself alledging some Reasons for it, which they did not well allow of, but incited by his Mother, they pressed him so far, that at length they perceived he had no intent to condescend unto them, for indeed his minde was to legitimate the eldest Son he had by <hi>Nancaa,</hi> and to resign his Kingdome unto him; to which effect he not long after put himself into Religion in a Temple named <hi>Gison,</hi> which seems to have been the Idol of a certain Sect that the <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>on King, the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would by no means approve of it, saying, <hi>That since the King her Son would needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess himself into that Religion, and leave the Kingdom without a lawful Heir, she would labour to remedy so great a disorder,</hi> as indeed she did by instantly marrying her self, being fifty years of age, to a Priest of hers, called <hi>Silau,</hi> that was but six and twenty, whom she proclaimed King, notwithstanding all opposition made to the contrary; whereof <hi>Turbano</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently advertised, and knowing that his Mother had done it of purpose to defeat his Son of the Crown, he got him forthwith out of his Religion for to repossess himself of it, and to that end used all the means and diligence he could, whereupon the Queen Mother, and <hi>Silau,</hi> fearing that which might follow thereof to both their destructions, if he were not in time, and that speedily prevented, they secretly assembled some of their partakers, to the number of thirty Horse, and fourscore Foot, who going one night where <hi>Turbano</hi> was, slew him, and all his Company; Howbeit <hi>Nancaa</hi> saved her self, with her three Sons, and accompanied with certain of her Domestical Servants, she imbarqued her self in a small <hi>Lanteaa,</hi> and fled away down the River to a place some seventy leagues from thence, where she landed with those few followers she had: There assisted with some others that resorted unto her, she fortified her self in a little Island, that was in the middest of the River,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50126:65"/>
and which she named <hi>Pilaunere,</hi> that signifies, <hi>The retreat of the poor,</hi> with an intent there to end the rest of her days; now having lived five years in that poor and miserable estate, the Tyrant <hi>Silan,</hi> whom the People hated, doubting lest the three young Princes coming to age might expell him o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t of what he had injustly usurped upon them, or at leastwise disturb him with Wars, by reason of the right they pretended to the Kingdom, he sent a Fleet of thirty <hi>Ienga's,</hi> wherein, as it is said, were sixteen hundred men, for to seek them out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them, whereof <hi>Nancaa</hi> receiving intelligence fell to consult what she should do, and at length resolved by no means to attend these Forces, in regard her Sons were but Infants, her self a weak Woman, her Men few in number, and unprovided of all that was necessary to make any defence against so great a number of Enemies, and so well furnished; whereupon taking a view of her People she found that they were but thirteen hundred in all, and of them onely five hundred Men, the rest being Women and Children, for all which company there were but three little <hi>Lanteaa's,</hi> and one <hi>Iangaa,</hi> in the whole River, and they not able to carry an hundred persons; so that <hi>Nancaa</hi> seeing no means to transport them away, the History saith, <hi>She assembled all her People, and declaring the fear she was in, desired them to advise her what she should do; but excusing themselves, they ingenuously confessed, they knew not what counsel to give her in that extremity:</hi> Whereupon, according to their ancient custome, they resolved to cast Lots, to the end that on whom the Lot did fall to speak, he should free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver what God would be pleased to inspire him with; For which purpose they took three days time, wherein with fasting, cries, and tears, they would all with one voice crav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the favour and assistance of the Lord Almighty, in whose hands was all the hope of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; This advice being approved of all in general, <hi>Nancaa</hi> made it to be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that upon pain of Death no person whatever should eat above once during those three days, to the end that by this abstinence of the Body, the Spirit might be carried with the greater attention towards God.</p>
            <p>The three days abstinence being expired, Lots were cast five times one after another,<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> and all those five times the Lot fell still on a little Boy of seven years of age, named, as the Tyrant was, <hi>Silau,</hi> whereat they were all exeedingly amazed, in regard that in the whole Troop there was not another of this same name: After that they had made their Sacrifices with all the accustomed Ceremonies of Musick, Perfumes, and sweet Odours, to render thanks unto God, they commanded the little Boy to lift up his hands unto Heaven, and then to say what he thought was necessary for the remedying of so great an Affliction, as that wherein they were; Whereupon the little Boy, <hi>Silau,</hi> beholding <hi>Nancaa,</hi> the History af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms he said these words; <hi>O feeble and wretched Woman, now that sorrow and affliction makes thee more troubled and perplexed then ever thou wert, in regard of the small relief that humane understanding doth represent unto thee, submit thy self with humble sighs to the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent hand of the Lord, Esloign then, or at leastwise labour to esloign, thy minde from the vanities of the Earth, lifting up thine eyes with Faith and Hope, and thou shalt see what the Prayers of an Innocent, afflicted and pursued before the Iustice of him that hath created thee, can do; For assoon as in all humility thou hast declared the weakness of thy power unto the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, Victory will incontinently be given thee from above over the Tyrant</hi> Silau; <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I command thee in his Name to imbarque thy self, thy Children, and all thy Followers in thine Enemies Vessels, wherein amidst the confused murmur of the Waters thou shalt wander so long, till thou arrivest at a placew here thou art to lay the Foundation of a House of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as the Mercy of the most High shall be published there from Generation to Generation by the Voice of a strange People, whose Cries shall be as pleasing to him, as those of sucking Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that lie in the Cradle.</hi> This said, the little Boy, according to the History, fell down stark dead to the ground, which much astonished <hi>Nancaa,</hi> and all hers; The said History further delivers, and as I have often heard it read, that five days after the success the thirty <hi>Iangaas</hi> were one morning seen coming down the River in very good equipage, but not so much as one man in them; the reason hereof, by the report of the History, which the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi> hold to be most true, was, that all these Ships of War being joyned together for to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute unmercifully upon <hi>Nancaa</hi> and her Children the cruel and damnable intentions of the Tyrant <hi>Silau,</hi> one night as this Fleet rode at Anchor in a place, called <hi>Catebasoy,</hi> a huge dark Cloud came over them, whereout issued such horrible Thunder and Lightning, accompanied with mighty Rain, the Drops whereof were so hot, that falling upon them which were asleep in the Vessels, it made them leap into the River, so as within less, then an hour they perished
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50126:66"/>
all; And it is said that one drop of this Rain coming to fall upon a body it burnt in such sort, as it penetrated to the very marrow of the bone with most insupportable pain, no cloths, nor arms, being able to resist it. <hi>Nancaa</hi> receiving this favour from the hand of the Lord, with abundance of tears and humble thanks, embarqued her self, her children, and all her company, in the said thirty <hi>Iangaas,</hi> and sailing down the River was carried by the strength of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which for her sake, the History saith, redoubled then, in seven and forty days to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place where now the City of <hi>Pequin</hi> is built; There she, and all hers landed, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lest the Tyrant <hi>Silau,</hi> whose cruelty she feared, might still pursue her, she fortified her self in this place the best she could.</p>

               </gap> Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance from these few Subjects of his, he made election of the place where the Fortress should be erected, together with the inclosure of the Wall; Afterwards, assoon as the first Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were laid, which was speedily done, he went out of his Tent, accompanied with his Mother, who governed all, together with his Brothers, and the chiefest of his company, attired in festival Robes, with a great stone carried before him by the noblest Personages, which he had caused to be wrought aforehand; and arriving at the said Foundations he laid his hand upon the Stone, and on his knees, with his eyes lifted up to Heaven, he said to all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, <hi>Brethren, and worthy Friends, know that I give mine own Name, that is,</hi> Pequin, <hi>to this Stone, upon which this new place is to be built, for I desire, that hereafter it should be so called; wherefore I pray you all, as Friends, and command you as your King, not to call it otherwise, to the end the memory thereof may remain immortal to those that shall come after us to the end of the World; By which means it shall be manifested to all men, that the thirteenth day of the eighth Moon, in the year one thousand six hundred thirty and nine, after the Lord of all things created had made those that lived upon the Earth, see how much he abhorred the sins of Men, for the which he drowned the whole World with Water, that he sent down from Heaven, in satisfaction of his divine Iustice, it shall, I say, be manifested to them, that the new Prince</hi> Pequin <hi>built this Fortress, whereunto he gave his Name; And so conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Prophesie, which the dead childe hath delivered, it shall be published over all, by the voice of strange People, in what manner the Lord is to be feared, and what Sacrifices are to be made, that they may be just and acceptable unto him.</hi> Now this was that which King <hi>Pequin</hi> said unto his Vassals, and which is at this day to be seen engraven on a silver Scutcheon, fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an Arch of one of the principal Gates of the City, called <hi>Pommicotay,</hi> where in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this Prophecy, there is ordinarily a Guard of forty Halberdiers, with their Captain, whereas there are but onely four in all the rest, who are bound to render an account of all that pass in and out there daily; And because the Histories relate, that this new King laid the first foundation of this City on the 3<hi>d</hi> of the moneth of <hi>August,</hi> the Kings of <hi>China</hi> do on that day usually shew themselves to the People, and that with such Pomp and Majesty, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I am not able to declare the least part of it, much less to describe the whole. Now in regard of this first Kings words, which the <hi>Chineses</hi> hold for an infallible Prophecy, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants do so fear the accomplishment thereof, that by a Law expresly made by them, the admittance of any Strangers into this Kingdom, saving Ambassadours and Slaves, is forbidden upon most grievous pains; So that when any do chance to arrive there, they banish them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently from one place to another, not permitting them to settle any where, as they practised it towards me, and my eight companions. And thus, as I have succinctly delivered, was this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>China</hi> founded, and peopled by the means of this Prince, named <hi>Pequin,</hi> the eldest of <hi>Nancaa</hi>'s three Sons; As for the other two, called <hi>Pacan</hi> and <hi>Nacau,</hi> they afterwards found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other two Towns aforesaid, and withall gave them their own Names. It is also the general opinion, that their Mother <hi>Nancaa</hi> founded the City of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> which took its denomination from her, continuing so to this day, and is the second City of this great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50126:66"/>
The Histories further affirm, that from the time of this first Founder, the Empire of <hi>China</hi> augmented always from one King to another, by a just Succession till a certain Age, which according to our Computation, was in the Year of Lord, one thousand one hundred and thirty; After which a King that then reigned, named <hi>Xixipan,</hi> inclosed the City of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> within the space of three and twenty years, in such manner as it is seen at this day, and that fourscore and two years after another King, his Grand-childe, called <hi>Iumbileytay,</hi> made the like, so that both together were sixty leagues in circuit, namely, each of them thirty, ten in length, and five in breadth: Now it is certain, and I have often times read it, that each of these Inclosures, or Walls, hath a thousand and threescore round Bulwarks, as also two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty Towers, very fair, strong, large, and high, with gilt Lions upon Globes, being the Arms of the Kings of <hi>China,</hi> which are very pleasing to the eye. Without the last Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is an exceeding great Ditch round about it, ten fathom deep, and forty broad, continually replenished with many Barques and Boats, covered over head as if they were Houses, where both Provisions, and all sorts of Merchandise are sold. This City, according to the <hi>Chineses</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, hath above three hundred and threescore Gates, in each of which, as I have before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, there are always four Halberdiers, who are obliged to render an account of all that go in and out daily: There are also certain Chambers in it, whither it is the custome to bring such Children as wander and go astray, in the Town; to the end their Parents that lose them may be sure to hear of them there. I will refer my speaking more largely of the Magnificences of this goodly City to another place, for that which I have now delivered in haste, and as it were <hi>en passant,</hi> was but to make a brief Relation of the original of this Empire, and of the first Founder of the City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> (which may be truly said to be the chiefest of all the World for greatness, policy, riches, and abundance of all things that can be desired of man) as also of the Foundation of the second City of this mighty Kingdom, that is <hi>Nanquin,</hi> and of the other two. <hi>Pacan</hi> and <hi>Nacan,</hi> whereof I have heretofore spoken, and in which the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them are buried in very stately and rich Temples, within Tombs of white and green Alabaster, all garnished with Gold, and erected upon Lions of Silver, with a world of Lamps, and perfuming Pans full of divers sorts of sweet Odours round about them.</p>
            <p>Now that I have spoken of the Original and Foundation of this Empire,<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> together with the circuit of the great City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> I hold it not amiss to intreat as succinctly as I may of another particular, which is no less admirable then those whereof I have made mention before: It is written in the fifth Book of the Scituation of all the remarkable places of this Empire, or rather Monarchy, (for to speak truly, there is no appellation so great but may be well attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto it) that a King, named <hi>Crisnagol Dicotay,</hi> who according to the computation of that Book, reigned in the year of our Lord five hundred and eighteen, happened to make war with the <hi>Tartar,</hi> about some difference between them concerning the State of <hi>Xenxinapau,</hi> that borders on the Kingdom of <hi>Lauhos,</hi> and so valiantly demeaned himself in a Battel against him, that he defeated his Army, and remained Master of the Field; whereupon the <hi>Tartar</hi> confederating himself with other Kings, his Friends, did by their assistance assemble together greater Forces then the former, and therewith invaded the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> where (it is said) he took three and thirty very important Towns, of which the principal was <hi>Panquilor,</hi> insomuch that the <hi>Chinese</hi> fearing he should not be well able to defend himself, concluded a Peace with him upon condition to relinquish his right, which he pretended to that in question betwixt them, and to pay him two thousand <hi>Picos</hi> of Silver for to defray the Charges of those strangers the <hi>Tartar</hi> had entertained in this War; by this means <hi>China</hi> continued for a good while quiet, but the King doubting lest the <hi>Tartar</hi> might in time to come return to annoy him again, resolved to build a Wall, that might serve for a Bulwark to his Empire; and to that end calling all his Estates together, he declared his determination unto them, which was presently not onely well approved of, but held most necessary; so that to enable him for the performance of a business so much concerning his state, they gave him ten thousand <hi>Picos</hi> of Silver, which amount, according to our account, unto fifteen Millions of Gold, after the rate of fifteen hundred Ducates each <hi>Pico</hi>; and moreover they entertained him two hundred and fifty thousand men to labour in the work, whereof thirty thousand were appointed for Officers, and all the rest for manual services; Order being taken then for whatsoever was thought fit for so prodigious an enterprise, they fell to it in such sort, as by the report of the History all that huge Wall was in seven and twenty years quite finished from one end to the other; which if credit may be given to the same Chronicle is seventy <hi>Iaos</hi> in length, that is six hundred and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50126:67"/>
fifteen miles after nine miles every <hi>Iao</hi>; wherein that which seemed most wonderfull and most exceeding the belief of man, was that seven hundred and fifty thousand men laboured incessantly for so long a time in that great work, whereof the Commonalty, as I delivered before, furnished one third part; the Priests, and Isles of <hi>Aynen,</hi> another third; and the King assisted by the Princes, Lords, <hi>Chaems,</hi> and <hi>Anchacys</hi> of the Kingdom, the rest of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I have both seen and measured, being thirty foot in height, and ten foot in breadth, where it is thickest: It is made of Lime and Sand, and plaistered on the outside with a kind of <hi>Bitumen,</hi> which renders it so strong, that no Cannon can demolish it: Instead of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks it hath Sentries, or Watch-towers, two stages high, flanked with Buttresses of Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try made of a certain black wood, which they call <hi>Caubesy,</hi> that is to say, Wood of Iron, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is exceeding strong and hard, every Buttress being as thick as an Hogshead, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high, so that these Sentries are far stronger then if they were made of Lime and Stone. Now this Wall, by them termed <hi>Chaufacan,</hi> which signifies, <hi>Strong resistance,</hi> extends in height equal to the Mountains, whereunto it is joyned, and that those Mountains also may serve for a Wall they are cut down very smooth and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eep, which renders them far stronger then the Wall it self; but you must know that in all this extent of land there is no Wall but in the void spaces from Hill to Hill, so that the Hills themselves make up the rest of the Wall and Fence: Further it is to be noted, that in this whole length of an hundred and fifteen leagues, which this Fortification contains, there are are but onely 5 Entries where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Rivers of <hi>Tartaria</hi> do pass, which are derived from the impetuous Torrents that descend from these Mountains, and running above five hundred leagues in the Country, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themselves into the Seas of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Cauchenchina</hi>; howbeit one of these Rivers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater then the rest, disemboques by the Bay of <hi>Cuy</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Sournau,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Siam.</hi> Now in all these five Passages both the King of <hi>China,</hi> and the King of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> keep Garrisons; the <hi>Chinese</hi> in each of them entertains seven thousand men gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them great pay, whereof six thousand are Horse, the rest Foot, being for the most part strangers, as <hi>Mogores, Pancrus, Champaas, Corosones, Gizares</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> and other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nations, bordering upon this Empire, and which in consideration of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pay they receive, serve the <hi>Chineses</hi>; who (to speak truth) are nothing couragious, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but little used to the Wars, and ill provided of Arms and Artillery. In all this length of Wall there are three hundred and twenty Companies, each of them containing five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers; so that there are in all one hundred and threescore thousand men, besides Officers of Justice, <hi>Anchacis, Chaems,</hi> and other such like persons necessary for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and entertainment of these Forces; so that all joyned together make up the number of two hundred thousand, which are all maintained at the Kings onely charge, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the most of them are Malefactours condemned to the reparations and labour of the Wall, as I shall more amply declare when I come to speak of the Prison destined to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, in the City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> which is also another Edifice, very remarkable, wherein there are continually above thirty thousand Prisoners, the most of them from eighteen to forty five years of age, appointed to work in this Wall.</p>
            <p>Being departed from those two Towns <hi>Pacau</hi> and <hi>Nacau,</hi> we continued our course up the River,<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> and arrived at another Town, called <hi>Mindoo,</hi> somewhat bigger then those from whence we parted, where about half a mile off was a great Lake of Salt-water, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Salt-houses round about it; The <hi>Chineses</hi> assured us, that this Lake did ebb and flow like the Sea, and that it extended above two hundred leagues into the Country, rendring the King of <hi>China</hi> in yearly Revenue one hundred thousand <hi>Taeis,</hi> onely for the third of the Salt that was drawn out of it; as also that the Town yielded him other one hundred thousand <hi>Taeis</hi> for the Silk alone that was made there, not speaking at all of the Camphire, Sugar, Pourcelain, Vermilion, and Quick-silver, whereof there was very great plenty; moreover, that some two leagues from this Town were twelve exceeding long Houses, like unto Magazines, where a world of people laboured in casting and purifying of Copper, and the horrible din which the Hammers made there was such, and so strange, as if there were any thing on earth that could represent Hell this was it; wherefore being desirous to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the cause of this extraordinary noise, we would needs go to see from whence it proceeded; and we found that there were in each of these Houses forty Fornaces, that is twenty of either side, with forty huge Anvils, upon every of which eight men beat in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and so swiftly, as a mans eye could hardly discern the blows, so as three hundred and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50126:67"/>
twenty men wrought in each of these twelve Houses, which in all the twelve Houses made up three thousand eight hundred and forty workmen, beside a great number of other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that laboured in other particular things; whereupon we demanded how much Copper might be wrought every year in each of these Houses, and they told us, one hundred and ten, or sixscore thousand <hi>Picos,</hi> whereof the King had two thirds, because the Mines were his, and that the Mountain from whence it was drawn was called <hi>Corotum baga,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a River of Copper, for that from the time since it was discovered, being above two hundred years, it never failed, but rather more and more was found. Having past about a league beyond those twelve Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now we had not past above five or six leagues from this place but we came to a great Town, about a league in circuit, quite destroyed and ruinated, so that asking the <hi>Chineses</hi> what might be the cause thereof, they told us, that this Town was anciently called <hi>Cohilouza,</hi> that is, <hi>The flower of the field,</hi> and had in former times been in very great prosperity, and that about one hundred forty and two years before, a certain stranger, in the company of some Merchants of the Port of <hi>Tanaçarim</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> chanced to come thither, being as it seems an holy man, although the <hi>Bonzes</hi> said he was a Sorcerer, by reason of the wonders he did, having raised up five dead men, and wrought many other Miracles, whereat all men were exceedingly astonished; and that having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times disputed with the Priests he had so shamed and confounded them, as fearing to deal any more with him, they incensed the Inhabitants against him, and persw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ring-leader of this mutiny, and seeing the Town-men retire away in consideration of that they had beheld, he threw a stone at the holy man, saying, <hi>They which do not as I do, may the Serpent of the night ingulf them into hell fire.</hi> At these words all the other <hi>Bonzes</hi> did the like, so that he was presently knock'd down dead with the stones they fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>the flower of the field,</hi> as I have declared heretofore.</p>
            <p>After our Departure from the ruines of <hi>Fiunganorsee,</hi> we arrived at a great Town, called <hi>Iunquinilau,</hi> which is very rich, abounding with all kind of things, fortified with a strong Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of Horse and Foot, and having a number of Junks and Vessels riding before it: Here we remained five days to celebrate the Funeral of our <hi>Chifuus</hi> wife; for whose soul he gave us by way of alms both meat and clothes, and withall freeing us from the oar, permitted us to go ashore without irons, which was a very great ease unto us.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50126:68"/>
continued our course up the river, beholding still on either side a world of goodly great Towns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with strong walls, as also many Fortresses and Castles all along the waters side; we saw likewise a great number of Temples, whose Steeples were all guilt, and in the fields such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of cattel that the ground was even covered over with them, so far as we could well discern: Moreover there were so many vessels upon this river, especially in some parts, where Fairs were kept, that at first sight one would have thought them to be populous Towns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other lesser companies of three hundred, five hundred, six hundred, and a thousand boats, which continually we met withall on both sides of the river, wherein all things that one could imagine were sold; Moreover the <hi>Chineses</hi> assured us, that in this Empire of <hi>China,</hi> the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those which levied upon the rivers, was not less, then those that dwelled in the Towns, and that without the good order which is observed to make the common people work, and to constrain the meaner sort to supply themselves unto trades, for to get their living, they would eat up one another. Now it is to be noted, that every kind of traffique and commerce is divided among them into three or four forms, as followeth: They which trade in Ducks, whereof there are great quantities in this Countrey, proceed therein diversly; some cause their egs to be hatched for to sell the Ducklings, others fat them when they are great for to sell them dead after they are salted; These traffique only with the egs, others with the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and some with the heads, feet, gizards, and intrails, no man being permitted to trench upon his companions sale, under the penalty of thirty lashes, which no priviledg can exempt them from: In the same manner, concerning hogs, some sell them alive, and by whole sale, others dead, and by retail, some make bacon of them, others sell their pigs, and some again sell nothing but the chitterlings, the sweet-breads, the blood, and the haslets; which is also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for fish, for such a one sels it fresh, that cannot sell it either salted or dried, and so of other Provisions, as flesh, fruit, fowls, venison, pulse, and other things, wherein such rigour is used, as there are chambers expresly established, whose officers have commission and power to see, that they which trade in one particular may not do it in another, if it be not for just and lawful couses, and that on pain of thirty lashes. There be others likewise that get their living by selling fish alive, which to that purpose they keep in great well-boats, and so carry them into divers countrys, where they know there is no other but salt fish. There are likewise all along this river of <hi>Batampina,</hi> whereon we went from <hi>Nanquin</hi> to <hi>Pequin,</hi> which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant one from the other one hundred and fourscore leagues, such a number of engines for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and presses for wine and oyl, made of divers sorts of pulse and fruit, as one could hardly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee any other thing on either side of the water. In many other places also there were an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite company of Houses, and Magazines full of all kinds of provision, that one could imagine, where all sorts of flesh are salted, dried, smoaked, and piled up in great high heaps, as gammons of Bacon, Pork, Lard, Geese, Ducks, Cranes, Bustards, Ostriches, Stags, Cows, Buffles, wild Goats, Rhinoceroses, Horses, Tygers, Dogs, Foxes, and almost all other creatures that one can name, so that we said many times amongst our selves, that it was not possible for all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the world to eat up all those provisions. We saw likewise upon the same river, a number of Vessels, which they call <hi>Panouras,</hi> covered from the poup to the prow with nets, in manner of a cage, three inches high, full of ducks and geese, that were carried from place to place to be sold; when the Owners of those boats would have these fowl to feed, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Land, and where there are rich medows, or marshes, they set forth Planks, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the doors of those cages, they beat three or four times upon a Drum, which they have expresly for that purpose, whereupon all these fowl, being six or seven thousand at the least, go out of the boat with a mighty noise, &amp; so fall to feeding all along the waters side; Now when the Owner perceives, that these fowl have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed sufficiently, and that it is time to return them, he beats the drum the second time, at the sound whereof they gather all together, and re-enter with the same noise, as they went out, wherein it is strange to observe, that they return all in again, not so much as one missing. That done, the Master of the boat parts from that place, and afterwards when he thinks it is time for them to lay, he repairs towards land, and where he finds the grounds dry, and good grass, he opens the doors, and beats the drum again, at which all the fowl of the boat come forth to lay, and then at such time as the Master judges that these fowl have laid, he beats his drum afresh, and suddenly in haste they all throng in to the boat, not so much as one remaining hehind; Thereupon two or three men get ashore, with baskets in their hands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into they gather up the egs, till they have gotten eleven or twelve baskets full, and so they proceed on their voyage to make sale of their war, which being almost spent, to store them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50126:69"/>
anew, they go for to buy more unto them that breed them, whose trade it is to sell them young, for they are not suffered to keep them when they are great, as the others do, by reason, as I have said before, no man may deal in any commodity for which he hath not permission from the Governors of the Towns. They that get their living by breeding of Ducks have neer to their Houses certain Ponds, where many times they keep ten or eleven thousand of these duckings, some bigger, some lesser. Now for to hatch the Eggs, they have in very long galleries twenty and thirty furnaces full of dung, wherein they bury two hundred, three hundred, and five hundred Eggs together, then stopping the mouth of each furnace that the dung may become the hotter, they leave the Eggs there till they think the young ones are disclosed, whereupon putting into every several furnace a Capon half pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the skin stript from off his brest, they leave him shut up therein for the space of two dayes, at the end whereof being all come out of the shell, they carry them into certain pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under ground made for that purpose, setting them bran soaked in liquor, and so being left there loose some ten or eleven dayes, they go afterwards of themselves into the ponds, where they feed and bring them up for to sell them unto those former Merchants, who trade with them into divers parts, it being unlawfull for one to trench upon anothers traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, as I have before related, so that in the Markets and publique places, where provisions for the mouth are sold, if any that sell Goose Eggs do chance to be taken seazed with Hens Eggs and it is suspected that they sell of them, they are presently punished with thirty lashes on the bare Buttocks, without hearing any justification they can make for themselves, being as I have said, found seazed of them, so that if they will have Hens Eggs for their own use, to avoid incurring the penalty of the Law they must be broken at one end, whereby it may appear that they keep them not to sell, but to eat. As for them that sell Fish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, if any of their Fish chance to die, they cut them in pieces, and salting them sell them at the price of salt-fish, which is lesse then that of fresh-fish, wherein they proceed so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, that no man dares passe the limits, which are prescribed and ordained by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalis</hi> of the State, upon pain of most severe punishment, for in all this Country the King is so much respected, and Justice so feared, as no kinde of person, how great soever, dares murmur, or look awry at an Officer, no not at the very <hi>Huppes,</hi> which are as the Bayliffs or Beadles amongst us.</p>

We saw many boats likewise laden with dryed orange pills, wherewith in victualing houses they boyl dogs flesh, for to take away the rank savour and humidity of it, as also to reader it more firm: In brief, we saw so many <hi>Vaucans, Lanteaas,</hi> and <hi>Barcasses,</hi> in this river, lad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now when all these vessels come to joyn together, during these Fairs, they take such order, as they make as it were a great and fair Town of them, so that sometimes you shall have of them a league in length, and three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a league in bredth, being composed of above twenty thousand vessels, besides <hi>Balons, Guedees,</hi> and <hi>Manchuas,</hi> which are small boats, whose number is infinite; For the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereof there are threescore Captains appointed, of which thirty are to see good order kept, and the other thirty are for the guard of the Merchants that come thither, to the end they may sail in safety; Moreover there is above them a <hi>Chaem,</hi> who hath abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power both in civil, and criminal causes, without any appeal or opposition whatsoever, during the fifteen days, that this Fair lasts, which is from the new to the full Moon; And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more come to see the policy, order, and beauty of this kind of Town, then otherwise; for to speak the truth, the framing of it in that manner with vessels, makes it more to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired then all the Edifices that can be seen upon the land; There are in this moving Town two thousand streets, exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Amongst the most remarkable things, we saw one street, where there were above an hundred vessels, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Idols of guilt wood, of divers fashions, which were sold for to be offered to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godes,</hi> together with a world of feet, thighs, arms, and heads, that sick folks bought to offer in devotion; There also we beheld other ships, covered with silk hangings, where Comedies, and other playes were represented to entertain the people withall, which in great numbers

flocked thither; In other places, Bils of excha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>by these Priests of the Divel promised them many merits, with great interest, affirming that without these bils they could not possibly be saved, for that God, say they, is a mortal enemy to all such as do not some good to the <hi>Pagodes,</hi> whereupon they tell them such fables and lies, as these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy wretches do often times take the very bread from their mouths to give it them; There were also other vessels all laden with dead mens skuls, which dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s men bought for to present as an offering, at the tombs of their friends, when they should happen to dye; for, say they, as the deceased is laid in the grave in the company of these skuls, so shall his soul enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, attended by those unto whom those skuls belonged, wherefore when the Porter of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise shall see such a Merchant, with many followers, he will do him honour, as to a man that in this life hath been a man of quality, for if he be poor, and without a train, the Porter will not open to him, whereas contrarily the more dead mens skuls he hath buried with him, the more happy he shall be esteemed; There were many boats likewise, where there were men that had a great many of Cages, full of live birds, who playing on divers instruments of musick, exhorted the people with a loud voice, to deliver those poor creatures of God, that were there in captivity, whereupon many came and gave them mony for the redemption of those prisoners, which presently they let out of the cages, and then as they flew away, the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them cried out to the birds, <hi>Pichau pitauel catan vacaxi,</hi> that is, <hi>Go, and tell God, how we serve him here below.</hi> In imitation of these, there are others also, who in their ships, kept a great many of little live fishes in great pots of water, and like the sellers of birds invite the people, for Gods cause to free those poor innocent fishes, that had never sinned, so that divers bought many of them, and casting them into the river, said, <hi>Get ye gone, and tell there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the good I have done you for Gods sake.</hi> To conclude all, the vessels where these things are exposed to sale, are seldom less in number then two hundred, besides thousands of others, which sell such like wares in a far greater quantity.</p>
            <p>We saw likewise many <hi>Barcasses</hi> full of men and women; that played upon divers sorts of instruments,<note place="margin">§. 2</note> and for mony gave them musick that desired it; There were other vessels laden with horns, which the Priests sold, therewith to make feasts in Heaven, for they say, that those were the horns of several beasts, which were offered in sacrifice to the Idols out of devotion, and for the performance of vows that men had made in divers kind of misfortunes, and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, wherein they had at others times been; And that as the flesh of those beasts, had been given here below for the honour of God to the poor, so the souls of them for whom those horns were offered, do in the other world eat the souls of of those beasts to whom those horns belonged, and thereunto invite the souls of their friends, as men use to invite others here on earth; Other vessels we saw covered with blacks, and full of tombs, torches, and great wax lights, as also women in them, that for money would be hired to weep and lament for the dead; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there were, called <hi>Pitaleus,</hi> that in great barques kept divers kinds of wild beasts to be shewed for mony, most dreadful to behold as Serpents, huge Adders, monstrous Lizards, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and many others such like; we saw in like sort a great number of Stationers, which sold all manner of books, that could be desired, as well concerning the creation of the world, whereof they tell a thousand lies, as touching the States, Kingdoms, Islands, and Provinces of the world, together with the Laws and Customs of Nations, but especially of the Kings of <hi>China,</hi> their number, brave acts, and of all things else that happened in each of their reigns, Moreover we saw a great many of the light, swift Foysts, wherein were men very well armed, who cried out with a loud voice, that if any one had received an affront, whereof he desired to be avenged, let him come unto them, and they would cause satisfaction to be made him; In other vessels there were old women, that served for midwives, and that would bring women speedily and easily a bed, as also a many of Nurses, ready to be entertained for to give children suck; There were barques likewise very well adorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a word, not to dwell any longer upon every particular, that was to be seen in this moving Town, for then I should never have done, it shall suffice me to say, that nothing can be desired on land, which was not to be had in their vessels, and that in greater abundance then I have delivered, wherefore I
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50126:70"/>
will passe from it to shew you that one of the principal causes why this Monarchy of <hi>China,</hi> that contains two and thirty Kingdoms, is so mighty, rich, and of so great commerce, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is exceedingly replenished with rivers, and a world of Chanals that have been anciently made by the Kings, great Lords, and people thereof, for to render all the Country navigable, and so communicate their labours with one another: The narrowest of these Chanals have brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of hewed stone over them, that are very high, long and broad, whereof some are of one stone, eighty, ninety, nay, an hundred spans long, and fifteen, or twenty broad, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse is very marvellous, for it is almost impossible to comprehend by what means so huge a masse of stone could be drawn out of the Quarry without breaking, and how it should be transported to the place where it was to be set. All the ways and passages, from Cities, Towns, and Villages, have very large causeys made of fair stone, at the ends whereof are costly pillars and arches, upon which are inscriptions with letters of gold, containing the pray sers of them that erected them; moreover there are handsome seats placed all along for poor passengers to rest themselves on: There are likewise innumerable Aqueducks and fountains every where, whose water is most wholesom and excellent to drink; And in divers parts there are certain Wenches of love, that out of charity prostitute themselves to travellers, which have no mony, and although amongst us this is held for a great abuse and abomination, yet with them it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a work of mercy, so that many on their death-beds do by their testaments bequeath great revenues, for the maintenance of this wickedness, as a thing very meritorious for the salvation of their souls; moreover many others have left lands for the erecting and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of houses, in deserts and unhabited places, where great fires are kept all the night to guide such as have strayed out of their way, as also water for men to drink, and seats to repose them in, and that there may be no default herein, there are divers persons entertained with very good means, to see these things carefully continued, according to the institution of him that founded them for the health of his soul. By these marvels which are found in the particular Towns of this Empire, may be concluded what the greatness thereof might be, were they joyned all together; but for the better satisfaction of the Reader, I dare boldly say, if my testimony may be worthy of credit, that in one and twenty years space, during which time, with a world of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, labour and pain, I traversed the greatest part of <hi>Asia</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as may appear by this my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I had seen in some countrys a wonderfull abundance of several sorts of victuals, and provisions, which we have not in our <hi>Europe,</hi> yet without speaking what each of them might have in particular, I do not think there is in all <hi>Europe</hi> so much as there is in <hi>China</hi> alone; And the same may be said of all the rest, wherewith Heaven hath favoured this clymate, as well for the temperature of the air, as for that which concerns the policy, and riches, the magnificence and greatness of their estate; Now that which gives the greatest luster unto it, is, their exact observation of justice, for there is so well ruled a Government in this Country, as it may justly be envied of all others in the world; And to speak the truth, such as want this particular, have no gloss, be they otherways never so great &amp; commendable. Verily, so often as I represent unto my self those great things which I have seen in this <hi>China,</hi> I am on the one side amazed to think how liberally it hath pleased God to heap up on this people, the goods of the earth, &amp; on the other side I am exceedingly grieved to consider how ungratefull they are in acknowledging such extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary favours; for they commit amongst themselves an infinite of most enormous sins, wherewithal they incessantly offend the Divine Goodness, as well in their bruitish and diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Idolatries, as in the abominable sin of <hi>Sodomy,</hi> which is not only permitted amongst them in publique, but is also accounted for a great vertue according to the instructions of their Priests.</p>

The Judg remained somtimes in suspence upon that we had said to him, at length he answered, that we need say no more to him, for it is sufficient that I know you are poor, to the end this affair may go another way then hitherto it hath done, neverthertheless to acquit me of my charge, I give you five days time, conformably to the Law of the third Book, that within the said term you may retain a Proctor to undertake your cause, but if you will be advised by me, you shall present your request to the <hi>Tanigores</hi> of the sacred Office, to the end that they carryed by an holy zeal of the honour of God, may out of compassion of your miseries, take upon them to defend your right.

that Country there was not one that knew our names, and that all we could in our poverty say to intreat them to think of us for Gods sake, was contained in a letter, that we had brought them from the Chamber of the Society of the house of <hi>Quiay Hinarol,</hi> in the City of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi>; whereupon <hi>Christophoro Borralho,</hi> presenting them with the letter, they received it with a new ceremony, full of all curtesie, saying, <hi>Praysed be he who hath created all things, for that he is pleased to serve himself of sinners here below, Whereby they may be recompensed at the last day of all days, by satisfying them double their labour with the riches of his holy treasures, which shall be done, as we believe in as great abundance, as the drops of rain fall from the clouds to the earth.</hi> After this, one of the four, putting up the Letter, said unto us, that as soon as the Chamber of Justice for the poor was open, they would all of them give an answer to our business, and see us furnished with all that we had need of, and so they departed from us: Three days after they returned to visit us in the prison, and in the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coming to us again, they asked us many questions answerable to a memorial which they had thereof, whereunto we replyed in every point according as we were questioned by each of them, so as they remained very well satisfied with our answers; Then calling the Register to them, who had our papers in charge, they inquired very exactly of him, touching many things that concerned us, and withall required his advice about our affair; that done, having digested all that might make for the conversation of our right into certain heads, they took our process from him, saying, they would peruse it all of them together in their Chambers of Justice with the Proctors of the house, and the next day return it him again, that he might carry it to the <hi>Chaem,</hi> as he was resolved before to do.</p>
            <p>Not to trouble my self with recounting in particular all that occurred in this affair, until such time as it was fully concluded, wherein six months and an half were imployed,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> during the which we continued stil prisoners in such misery, I will in few words relate all that befel us unto the end; when as our business was come before the twelve <hi>Conchalis</hi> of the criminal Court, the two Proctors of the house of mercy most willingly took upon them to cause the unjust sentence, which had been given against us, to be revoked; Having gotten then all the proceedings to be disannulled, they by petition remonstrated unto the <hi>Chaem,</hi> who was the President of that Court, <hi>How we could not for any cause whatsoever be condemned to death, seeing there were no witnesses of any credit that could testifie that we had robbed any man, or had ever seen us carry any offensive weapons contrary to the prohibition made against it by the Law of the first book, but that we were apprehended quite naked, like wretched men, wandering after a lamentable shipwrack, and that therefore our poverty and misery was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy rather of a pitiful compassion, then of that rigour, wherewith the first Ministers of the arm of wrath had caused us to be whipt; moreover that God alone was the Iudg of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, in whose name they required him once, twice, nay many times, to consider that he was mortal, and could not last long, for that God had given him a perishable life, at the end whereof he was to render an account of that which had been required of him, since by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn oath he was obliged to do all that should be manifest to his judgment, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of men of the world, whose custom it was to make the ballance sway down, which God would have to be upright, according to the integrity of his divine Iustice.</hi> To this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the Kings Proctor opposed himself, as he that was our adverse party, and that in certain articles, which he framed against us, set forth, how he would prove by ocular witnesses, as well of the Country, as strangers, that we were publique thieves, making a common practise of robbing, and not merchants, such as we pretended to be; whereunto he added, that if we had come to the Coast of <hi>China</hi> with a good designe, and with an intent to pay the King his due in his Custom-houses, we would have repaired to the ports, where they were establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Ordinance of the <hi>Aytan</hi> of the Government, but for a punishment, because we went from Isle to Isle, like Pirats, Almighty God, that detests sin and robber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> nevertheless for that we were strangers, and vagabonds, without either faith, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, that alone would suffice at leastwise to condemn us to have our hands and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses cut off, and so to be banished for ever into the Country of <hi>Ponxileytay,</hi> whither such peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

as we, were wont to be exiled, as might be verified by divers sentences given and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in like cases, and to that effect, he desired the admittance of his articles, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to prove within the time, that should be prescribed him. These articles were presently excepted against by the Proctor of the Court of Justice, established for the poor, who offered to make the contrary appear within a certain term, which to that end, and for many other reasons alleadged by him in our favour, was granted him, wherefore he required that the said articles might not be admitted, especially for that they were infamous, and directly contrary to the Ordinances of Justice. Whereupon the <hi>Chaem</hi> ordered, that his articles should not be admitted, unless he did prove them by evident testimonies, and such as were conformable to the Divine Law, within six days next ensuing, and that upon pain in case of contravention not to be admitted to any demand of a longer delay. The said term of six days being prescribed the Kings Proctor, he, in the mean time, producing no one proof against us, nor any person that so much as knew us, came and demanded a delay of other six days, which was flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, in regard it but too well appeared, that all he did was only to win time, and therefore he would by no means consent unto it, but contrarily he gave the Proctor for the poor five days respit to alledge all that further he could in our defence; In the mean time, the Kings Proctor declaimed against us in such foul and opprobrious terms, as the <hi>Chaem</hi> was much offended thereat, so that he condemned him to pay us twenty <hi>Taeis</hi> of silver, both for his want of charity, and for that he could not prove any one of the obligations which he had exhibited against us. Three days being spent herein, four <hi>Tanigores</hi> of the house of the poor, coming very early in the morning to the prison, sent for us into the <hi>Infirmirie,</hi> where they told us that our business went very well, and how we might hope that our sentence would have a good issue, whereupon we cast our selves at their feet, and with abundance of tears desired God to reward them for the pains they had taken in our behalf. Thereunto one of them replyed, <hi>And we also most humbly beseech him to keep you in the knowledg of his Law, wherein all the happiness of good m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A little after their departure came the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister, and shewing us the <hi>Chaems</hi> order, whereby the Kings Proctor was condemned to pay us twenty <hi>Taeis,</hi> gave us the mony, and took an acquittance under our hands for the receipt of it; For which giving him a world of thanks, we intreated him for his pains to take as much thereof as he pleased, but he would not touch a peny, saying, I will not for so small a matter lose the recompence which I hope to gain from God, for the consideration of you.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>We past nine days in great fear, still expecting to have our sentence pronounced, when as one <hi>Saturday</hi> morning two <hi>Chumbims</hi> of Justice came to the prison for us, accompanied with twenty officers, by them called <hi>Huppes,</hi> carrying Halberts, Portisans, and other arms, which made them very dreadfull to the beholders; These men tying us all nine together in a long iron chain, lead us to the <hi>Caladigan,</hi> which was the place where audience was given, and where execution was done on delinquents; Now how we got thither, to confess the truth, I am not able to relate, for we were at that instant so far besides our selves, as we knew not what we did, or which way we went, so as in that extremity all our thought was how to conform our selves to the will of God, and beg of him with tears, that for the merit of his sacred pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he would be pleased to receive the punishment, that should be inflicted on us for the satisfaction of our sins. At length after much pain, and many affronts, that were done us by many which followed after us, with loud cries, we arrived at the first Hall of the <hi>Caladigan,</hi> where were four and twenty Executioners, whom they call, <hi>The Ministers of the arm of justice,</hi> with a great many of other people, that were there about their affairs. Here we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a long time, till at length upon the ringing of a bell, other doors were opened, that stood under a great A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch of Architecture, very artificially wrought, and whereon were a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of rich figures; On the top a monstrous Lion of silver was seen, with his sore and hind feet upon a mighty great bowl, made of the same mettal, whereby the arms of the King of <hi>China</hi> are represented, which are ordinarily placed on the Fore-front of all the Sovereign Courts, where the <hi>Chaems</hi> precide, who are as Vice-roys amongst us. Those doors being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, as I said before, all that were there present entred into a very great Hall, like the Body of a Church, hung from the top to the bottom with divers pictures, wherein strange kinds

of execution done upon p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rsons of all conditions, after a most dreadful manner were constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and under every picture was this inscription, <hi>Such a one was executed with this kind of death for committing such a crime</hi>; so that in beholding the diversity of these fearful pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures one might see in it, as it were, a declaration of the kind of death that was ordained for each crime, as also the extream rigour which the Justice there observed in such executions. From this Hall we went into another room far richer, and more costly, for it was guilt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, so that one could not have a more pleasing object, at least wise, if we could have taken pleasure in any thing, considering the misery we were in. In the midst of this room there was a Tribunal, whereunto one ascended by seven steps, invironed with three rows of ballisters of iron, copper, and ebony; the tops whereof were beautified with Mother of Pearl: At the upper end of all was a cloth of State of white damask, frenged about with a deep cawl frenge of green silk and gold; Under this State sat the <hi>Chaem</hi> with a world of greatness and majesty, he was seated in a very rich Chair of silver, having before him a little table, and about him three boys on their knees, sumptuously apparelled, with chains of gold, one of the which (namely, he in the middle) served to give the <hi>Chaem</hi> the pen wherewithall he signed; The other two took the petitions that were preferred, and presented them on the Table, that they might be signed; On the right hand in another place somewhat higher, and almost equall with the <hi>Chaem,</hi> stood a boy, some ten or eleven years old, attired in a rich robe of white Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, imbroidered with roses of gold, having a chain of pearl three double about his neck, and hair as long as a womans, most neatly plaited with a fillet of gold, all enamelled with green, and powdered over with great seed pearl; In his hand he held, as a mark of that which he represented, a little branch of roses, made of silk, gold thread, and rich pearls, very curiously intermixed; And in this manner he appeared so gentile, handsome, and beauiful, as no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, how fair soever, could overmatch him; this boy leaned on his elbow upon the <hi>Chaems</hi> chair, and figured mercy. In the like manner, on the left hand was another goodly boy, richly apparelled in a Coat of carnation Satin, all set with roses of gold, having his right arm ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to the elbow, and died with a vermilion as red as blood, and in that hand holding a naked sword, which seemed also to be bloody: moreover, on his head he wore a crown, in fashion like to a Myter, hung all with little razors, like unto lancets, wherewith Chyrurgions let men blood, being thus gallantly set forth, and of most beautiful presence, yet he struck all that beheld him with fear, in regard of that he represented, which was Justice. For they say, that the Judg, which holds the place of the King, who presents God on earth, ought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to have those two qualities, <hi>Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi>; and that he which doth not use them is a Tyrant, acknowledging no Law, and usurping the power that he hath.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50126:73"/>
the <hi>Chaems</hi> table, because it was of silver, had no carpet on it, nor any thing else, but a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of cloth of gold, and a Standith; Now all these things put together, as we saw them, carried a wonderful shew of State and Majesty; But to proceed, upon the fourth ringing of a bell, one of the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

and coming neer them he prostrated himself at their feet, and said: <hi>It is now, my Lord, and holy brethren, that I have cause to rejoyce, for that it hath pleased God to permit, that you his holy servants should come unto my house, being that which I could not hope for, in regard I held my selfe unworthy of such favour.</hi> After the <hi>Tanigores</hi> had used many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements and cereremonies to him, as is usuall in that Country, they answered him thus, <hi>May God, our Soveraign Lord, the infinite source of mercy, recompence the good thou dost for the poor with blessing in this life; for believe it, dear brother, the strongest staff whereon the soul doth lean to keep her from falling so often as she happens to stumble, is the charity, which we use towards our neighbour, when as the vain glory of this world doth not blind the good zeal whereunto his holy Law doth oblige us, and that thou mayst merit the blessed felicity of beholding his face, we have brought thee here these nine</hi> Portugals, <hi>who are so poor, as none in this Kingdom are like to them; wherefore we pray thee that in the place whither thou art going now, as</hi> Monteo, <hi>thou wilt do for them all that thou thinkest will be acceptable to the Lord above, in whose behalf we crave this of thee.</hi> To this Speech the <hi>Monteo,</hi> and his wife, replyed in such courteous and remarkable terms, as we were almost besides our selves to hear in what manner they attributed the successe of their affairs, to the principal cause of all goodness, even as though they had the light of faith, or the knowledg of the Christian verity. Hereupon they withdrew into a Chamber, into which we went not, and continued there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an hour; then as they were about to take leave of one another, they commanded us to come in to them, where the <hi>Tanigores</hi> spake to them again about us, and recommending us unto them more then before, the <hi>Monteo</hi> caused our names to be written down in a book that lay before him, and said unto us, <hi>I do this, because I am not so good a man, as to give you something of mine own, nor so bad as to deprive you of the sweat of your labour, whereunto the King hath bound you, wherefore even at this instant you shall begin to get your living, although you do not serve as yet, for the desire I have that this may be accounted to me for an alms, so that now you have nothing to do, but to be merry in my house, where I will give order that you shall be provided of all that is necessary for you; Besides this, I will not promise you any thing, for the fear I am in of the shewing some vanity by my promise, and so the Divel may make use thereof as of an advantage, to lay hold on me, a matter that often arrives through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our nature; wherefore let it suffice you for the present to know, that I will be mindful of you for the love of these holy brethren here, who have spoken to me for you.</hi> The four <hi>Tani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gores</hi> thereupon taking their leave, gave us four <hi>Taeis,</hi> and said unto us, <hi>Forget not to render thanks unto God for the good success you have had in your business, for it would be a grievous sin in you not to acknowledge so great a grace.</hi> Thus were we very well entertained in the house of this Captain for the space of two months, that we remained there, at the end whereof we parted from thence, for to go to <hi>Quansy,</hi> where we were to make up our time, under the conduct of this Captain, who ever after used us very kindly, and shewed us many favours, untill that the <hi>Tartars</hi> entred into the Town, who did a world of mischief there, as I will more amply declare hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>Before I recount that which happened unto us, after we were imbarqued with those <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi> that conducted us, and that gave us great hope of setting us at liberty, I think it not amiss to make a brief relation here of the City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> which may truly be termed the capital of the Monarchy of the world, as also of some particulars I observed there, as well for its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and policy, as for that which concerns its extent, its government, the laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the admirable manner of providing for the good of the whole State, together in what sort they are paid, that serve in the time of war, according to the Ordinances of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and many other things like unto these, though I must needs confess that herein I shall want the best part, namely, wit, and capacity, to render a reason in what clymate it is scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in the heigth of how many degrees, which is a matter the learned and curious most desire to be satisfied in; But my designe having never been other (as I have said heretofore) then to leave this my book unto my children, that therein they may see the sufferings I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, it little imports me to write otherwise then I do, that is, in a gross and rude manner; for I hold it better to treat of these things in such sort as nature hath taught me, then to use Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles, and speeches from the purpose, whereby the weakness of my poor understanding may be made more evident. Howbeit since I am obliged to make mention of this matter, by the promise I have made of it heretofore, I say, that this City, which we call <hi>Pequin,</hi> and they of the Country <hi>Pequin,</hi> is scituated in the heighth of forty and one degrees of Northerly latitude;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50126:74"/>
the walls of it are in circuit (by the report of the <hi>Chineses</hi> themselves, and as I have read in a little book, treating of the greatness thereof, and intituled <hi>Aquisendan,</hi> which I brought since along with me into <hi>Portugal</hi>) thirty large leagues, namely ten long, and five broad; Some others hold, that it is fifty, namely seventeen in length, and eight in bredth: and forasmuch as they that intreat of it are of different opinions, in that the one make the extent of it thirty leagues, as I have said before, and others fifty, I will render a reason of this doubt, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to that which I have seen my self. It is true, that in the manner it is now built, it is thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leagues in circuit, as they say, for it is invironed with two rows of strong walls, where there are a number of towers and bulwarks after our fashion; But without this circuit, which is of the City it self, there is another far greater, both in length and bredth, that the <hi>Chineses</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm was anciently all inhabited, but at this present there are only some Boroughs and Villages, as also a many of fair houses, or castles about it, amongst the which there are sixteen hundred, that have great advantages over the rest, and are the houses of the Proctors of the sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cities, and most remarkable Towns of the two and thirty Kingdoms of this Monarchy, who repair unto this City at the general Assembly of the Estates, which is held every three years for the publique good. Without this great inclosure, which (as I have said) is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the City, there is in a distance of three leagues broad, and seven long, fourscore thousand Tombs of the <hi>Mandarins,</hi> which are little Chappels all guilded within, and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed about with Ballisters of iron and latin, the entries whereinto are through very rich and sumptuous arches: near to these Chappels there are also very great houses, with gardens and tufted woods of high trees, as also many inventions of ponds, fountains, and aqueducts; whereunto may be added, that the walls of the inclosure are on the inside covered with fine porcelain, and on the fanes above are many Lions pourtrayed in gold, as also in the squares of the steeples, which are likewise very high, and embellished with pictures. It hath also five hundred very great Palaces, which are called <hi>the houses of the Son of the Sun,</hi> whither all those retire, that have been hurt in the Wars for the service of the King, as also many other souldiers, who in regard of age or sickness are no longer able to bear arms, and to the end that during the rest of their days they may be exempted from incommodity, each of them receives monthly a certain pay to find himself withall, and to live upon. Now all these men of War, as we learned of the <hi>Chineses,</hi> are ordinarily an hundred thousand, there being in each of those houses two hundred men according to their report. We saw also another long street of low houses, where there were four and twenty thousand oar-men, belonging to the King <hi>Panoures</hi>; and another of the same structure a good league in length, where fourteen thousand Taverners that followed the Court dwelt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as also a third street like unto the other two, where live a great number of light women, exempted from the tribute, which they of the City pay, for that they are Curtisans, whereof the most part had quitted their husbands for to follow the wretched trade; and if for that cause they come to receive any hurt, their husbands are grievously punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, because they are there as in a place of freedom, and under the protection of the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> of the Court, Lord Steward of the Kings house. In this inclosure do likewise remain all the Landresses, by them called <hi>Maynates,</hi> which wash the linnen of the City, who as we were told, are above an hundred thousand, and live in this quarter, for that there are divers ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers there, together with a number of wells, and deep pools of water, compassed about with good walls. Within this same inclosure, as the said <hi>Aquisendan</hi> relates, there are thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred gallant and very sumptuous houses of religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s men and women, who make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the four principal Laws of those two and thirty which are in the Empire of <hi>China,</hi> and it is thought that in some of these houses there are above a thousand persons, besides the servants, that from abroad do furnish them with victuals, and other necessary provisions. We saw also a great many houses, which have fair buildings of a large extent, with spacious inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, wherein there are gardens, and very thick woods, full of any kind of game, either for hawking, or hunting, that may be desired; And these houses are as it were Inns, whither come continually in great number people of all ages, and sexe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as to see Comedies, Playes, Combates, Bul-baitings, Wrastlings, and magnificent Feasts, with the <hi>Tutons, Chaems, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chacys, Aytaos, Bracalons, Chumbims, Monteos, Lauteas, Lords, Gentlemen, Captains, Merchants,</hi> and other rich men, do make for to give content to their kindred and friends; These houses are bravely furnished with rich hangings, beds, chairs, and stools, as likewise with huge cupbards of plate, not only of silver, but of gold also; and the attendants that wait at the table, are maids ready to be married, very beautiful, and gallantly attired; howbeit all
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50126:75"/>
this is nothing in comparison of the sumptuousness, and other Magnificences that we saw there. Now the <hi>Chineses</hi> assured us, there were some feasts that lasted ten days after the <hi>Carachina,</hi> or <hi>Chinese</hi> manner, which in regard of the state, pomp, and charge thereof, as well in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of servants and wayters, as in the costly fare of all kind of flesh, fowl, fish, and all delicacies in musick, in sports of hunting, and hawking, in playes, comedies, tilts, turnayes, and in shews both of horse and foot, fighting and skirmishing together, do cost above twenty thousand <hi>Taeis.</hi> These Inns do stand in at least a million of gold, and are maintained by certain Companies of very rich Merchants, who in way of commerce and traffique employ their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny therein, where by it is thought they gain far more, then if they should venture it to sea. It is said also, that there is so good and exact an order observed there, that whensoever any one will be at a charge that way, he goes to the <hi>Xipaton</hi> of the house, who is the superintendant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and declares unto him what his designe is, whereupon he shews him a book, all divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to chapters, which treats of the ordering and sumptuousness of Feasts, as also the rates of them, and how they shall be served in, to the end, that he who will be at the charge, may chuse which he pleases; This book, called <hi>Pinetoreu,</hi> I have seen, and heard it read, so that I remember how in the three first Chapters thereof, it speaks of the feasts, whereunto God is to be invited, and of what price they are; and then it descends to the King of <hi>China,</hi> of whom it sayes, <hi>That by a speciall grace of Heaven, and right of Soveraignty, he hath the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole earth, and of all the Kings that inhabit it.</hi> After it hath done with the King of <hi>China,</hi> it speaks of the feasts of the <hi>Tutons,</hi> which are the ten Soveraign digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that command over the forty <hi>Chaems,</hi> who are as the Vice-royes of the State. These <hi>Tutons</hi> also are termed the beams of the Sun, for, say they, as the King of <hi>China</hi> is the Son of the Sun, so the <hi>Tutons,</hi> who represent him, may rightly be termed his beams, for that they proceed from him, even as the rayes do from the Sun; But setting aside the bruitishness of these <hi>Gentiles,</hi> I will only speak of the Feast, whereunto God is to be invited, which I have seen some to make with much devotion, though for want of faith, their works can do them little good.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe first thing whereof mention is made in the Preface of that Book, which treats of Feasts, as I have said before, is the Feast, that is to be made unto God here upon earth, of which it is spoken in this manner: <hi>Every Feast, how sumptuous soever it be, may be paid for with a price, more or less, conformable to the bounty of him that makes it, who for all his charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on it reaps no other recompence, then the praise of flatterers and idle persons; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O my Brother,</hi> saith the Preface of the said Book, <hi>I counsel thee to imploy thy goods in feasting of God in his poor, that is to say, secretly to supply the necessities of good folks, so that they may not perish for want of that which thou hast more then thou needest. Call to mind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the vile matter wherewith thy father ingendred thee, and that too, which is far more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, wherewith thy mother conceived thee, and so thou wilt see how much inferiour thou art, even to the bruit beasts, which without distinction of reason apply themselves to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are carried by the flesh; and seeing that in the quality of a man thou wilt invite thy friends, who possibly by to morrow may not be, to shew that thou art good and faithful, invite the poor creatures of God, of whose groans and necessities he like a pitiful Father taketh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, and promiseth to him that doth them good infinite satisfaction in the house of the Sun, where as an Article of faith we hold, that his servants shall abide for evermore in eternal happiness,</hi> After these words, and other such like, worthy to be observed, the <hi>Xipaton,</hi> who, as I told you, is the chief of them that govern this great Labyrinth, shews him all the Chapters of the Book, from one end to the other, and bids him look what manner of men, or Lords he will invite, what number of guests, and how many days he will have the feast to last; for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth he, the <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Tutons,</hi> at the feasts that are made for them, have so many Messes of meat, so many Attendants, such Furniture, such Chambers, such vessel, such plate, such sports, and so many days of hawking, and hunting, all which amounts to such a sum of mony: Then if he will not bestow so much, the <hi>Xipaton</hi> shews him in another Chapter, the feasts which

are ordinarily made for the <hi>Chaems, Ayta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it be a feast of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as it often falls out to be, then are the wayters on the table likewise women, or young D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now for a conclusion of that which I have to say of these Inns, of all the mony, which is spent upon such feasts, four in the hundred, whereof the <hi>Xipaton</hi> paies the one half, and they that make the feasts the other, is set apart for the entertainment of the table of the poor, whereunto for Gods sake all manner of people are admitted that will come to it; Moreover, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a Chamber, and a good bed but that only for the space of three days, unless they be wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with child, or sick persons, which are not able to travel; for in that case they are entertained a longer time, because regard is had unto the people according to the need they are in. We saw also in this outward inclosure, which, as I have delivered, invirons all the other City, two and thirty great Edifices, or Colledges, distant about a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light shoot the one from the other, where such, as apply themselves to the study of the two and thirty Laws, which are professed in the two and thirty Kingdoms of this Empire, do recide. Now in each of these Colledges, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we could guess by the great number of persons that we saw there, there should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ten thousand Scholers; and indeed the <hi>Aquesendoo,</hi> which is the Book that treats of these things, makes them amount in the whole to four hundred thousand: There is likewise somewhat apart from the rest, another far greater and fairer Edifice, of almost a league in circuit, where all those that have taken degrees, as well in their Theologie, as in the Laws of the government of this Monarchy, do live. In this University there is a <hi>Chaem,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands over all the Heads of the Colledges, and is called, by a title of eminent dignity, <hi>Xiley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xitapou,</hi> that is to say, Lord of all the Nobles. This <hi>Chaem,</hi> for that he is more honourable, and of an higher quality then all the rest, keeps as great a Court as any <hi>Tuton</hi>; for he hath ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily a guard of three hundred <hi>Mogores,</hi> four and twenty <hi>Loshers</hi> that go with silver Maces before him, and six and thirty women, which mounted on white ambling Nags, trapped with silk and silver, ride playing on certain very harmonious instruments of musick, and singing to the tune thereof, make a pleasing Consort after their manner. There are also led before him twenty very handsome spare horses, without any other furniture then their clothes of silver tinsel, and with headstals full of little silver bells, every horse being waited on by six Halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and four footmen very well apparelled; Before all this train goes four hundred <hi>Huppes,</hi> with a number of great long chains, which trailing on the ground, make such a dreadful ratling and noise, as does not a lit le terrifie all that are within hearing; Then next to them marches twelve men on horsback, called <hi>Peretandas,</hi> each of them carrying an Umbrello of carnation Sattin, and other twelve that follow them with banners of white damask, deeply indented, and edged about with golden frenge; Now after all this pomp comes the <hi>Chaem</hi> sitting in a triumphant Chariot, attended by threescore <hi>Conchalas, Chumbims,</hi> and <hi>Monteos,</hi> such as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us are the Chancellors, Judges, and Councellors of the Courts of Justice, and these go all on foot, carrying upon their shoulders Cymiters rightly garnished with gold. Last of all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low lesser officers, that are like unto our Registers, Examiners, Auditors, Clarks Atturneys, and Solicitors, all likewise on foot, and crying out unto the people with a loud voice for to retire themselves into their houses, and clear the streets, so as there may be nothing to hinder or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the passage of this magnificnce. But the most observable thing herein is, that close to the Person of the <hi>Chaem,</hi> march two little boyes on horsback, one on the right hand, the other on the left, richly attired, with their ensignes in their hands, signifying <hi>Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> whereof I have spoken heretofore; That on the right side representing mercy, is clothed in white, and that on the left representing justice is apparelled in red; The horses whereon these little boyes are mounted, have on them foot-clothes of the same colour their garments are, and all their furniture and trappings are of gold, with a kind of net-work over them, made of silver thread; After each of these children march six young youths, about fifteen years of age, with silver Maces in their hands, so that all these things together are so remarkable, as there is no man that beholds them, but on the one side trembles for fear, and on the other side remains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50126:76"/>
at the sight of so much greatness, and majesty. Now that I may not longer dwel on that which concerns this great inclosure, I will pass over in silence many other marvels that we saw there, consisting in rich &amp; fair buildings in magnificent <hi>Pagodes,</hi> in bridges placed upon great pillars of stone, on either side whereof are rayls or grates of iron finely wrought, and in high ways, that are straight, broad, and all very well paved, whereof I think fit not to speak, for by that which I have already said, one may easily judg of what I have omitted, in regard of the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and conformity that is between them; wherefore I will only intreat, and that as suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly as I can, of certain buildings, which I saw in this City, chiefly of four, that I observed more curiously then the rest, as also of some other particularities, that well deserve to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>This City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> whereof I have promised to speak more amply then yet I have done, is so prodigious, and the things therein remarkable, as I do almost repent me for undertaking to discourse of it, because to speak the truth, I know not where to begin, that I may be as good as my word; for one must not imagine it to be, either as the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>Sevill,</hi> or <hi>Lisbon,</hi> or that any of the Cities of <hi>Europe</hi> are comparable unto it, how famous or populous soever they be: Nay I will say further, that one must not think it to be like to Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Tauris</hi> in <hi>Persia, Amadaba</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya, Bisnagar</hi> in <hi>Narsingua, Goura</hi> in <hi>Bengala, Ava</hi> in <hi>Chaleu, Timplan</hi> in <hi>Calaminhan, Martaban</hi> and <hi>Bagou</hi> in <hi>Pegu, Guimpel</hi> and <hi>Tinlau</hi> in <hi>Siammon, Odia</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Sornau, Passarvan</hi> and <hi>Dema</hi> in the Island of <hi>Iaoa, Pangor</hi> in the Country of the <hi>Lequiens, Vsangea</hi> in the <hi>Grand Cauchin, Lancama</hi> in <hi>Tartaria,</hi> and <hi>Meaco</hi> in <hi>Iappun,</hi> all which Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are the Capitals of many great Kingdoms; for I dare well affirm, that all those same are not to be compared to the least part of the wonderful City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> much less to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and magnificence of that which is most excellent in it, whereby I understand her stately buildings, her inward riches, her excessive abundance of all that is necessary for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of life, also the world of people, the infinite number of Barques and Vessels that are there, the Commerce, the Courts of Justice, the Government and the State of the <hi>Tutons, Chaems, Anchacys, Aytaos, Puchancys,</hi> and <hi>Bracanons,</hi> who rule whole Kingdoms, and very spacious Provinces, with great pentions, and are ordinarily resident in this City, or others for them, when as by the Kings command they are sent about affairs of consequence. But setting these things aside, whereof yet I intend to speak more amply, when time shall serve, I say that this City, (according to that which is written of it, both in the <hi>Aquesendoo</hi> before mentioned, and all the Chronicles of the Kingdom of <hi>China</hi>) is thirty leagues in circuit, not comprehending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the buildings of the other inclosure that is without it, and is invironed with a double wall, made of good strong free-stone, having three hundred and threescore gates, each of which hath a small For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, composed of two high towers, with its ditches, and draw-bridges; and at every gate is a Register, &amp; four Porters with halberds in their hands, who are bound to give account of all that goes in and out. These gates by the Ordinance of the <hi>Tuton,</hi> are divided according to the three hundred and threescore dayes of the year, so that every day in his turn hath the feast of the invocation of the Idol, whereof each gate bears the name, celebrated with much solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This great City hath also within that large inclosure of her walls, as the <hi>Chineses</hi> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us, three thousand and three hundred <hi>Pagodes</hi> or Temples, wherein are continually sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a great number of birds and wild beasts, which they hold to be more agreeable unto God, then such as are kept tame in houses, whereof their Priests render divers reasons to the people, therewith perswading them to believe so great an abuse for an article of faith. The structures of these <hi>Pagodes,</hi> whereof I speak, are very sumptuous, especially those of the orders of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negrepos, Conquiays,</hi> and <hi>Talagrepos,</hi> who are the Priests of the four Sects of <hi>Xaca, Amida, Gizom,</hi> and <hi>Canom,</hi> which surpass in antipuity the other two and thirty of that Labyrinth of the Divel, who appears to them many times in divers forms, for to make them give more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to his impostures and lies. The principal streets of this City are all very long and broad, with fair houses of two or three stories high, and inclosed at both ends with ballisters of iron and lattin; the entrance into them is through lanes, that cross these great streets, at the ends where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are great arches, with strong gates, which are shut in the night, and on the top of the arches, there are watch-bels; Each of these streets hath its Captain, and officers, who walk the round in their turns, and are bound every ten dayes to make report into the Town-house of all that passeth in their quarters, to the end that the <hi>Punchacys,</hi> or <hi>Chaems</hi> of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may take such order therein, as reason requires. Moreover this great City (if credit may
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50126:76"/>
be given to that which the said book, so often before mentioned by me, records) hath an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Canals, made by the Kings and people in former times, which are three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom deep, and twelve broad, crossing through the whole length and bredth of the City, by the means of a great number of bridges, built upon arches of strong free-stone, at the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are pillars, with chains, that reach from the one to the other, and resting places for passengers to repose themselves in: It is said that the bridges of these hundred &amp; twenty Canals, or Aqueducts, are in number eighteen hundred, and that if one of them is fair and rich, the other is yet more, as well for the fashion, as for the rest of the workmanship thereof. The said Book affirms, <hi>That in this City there are sixscore Piatzues, or publique places, in each of the which is a Fair kept every month.</hi> Now during the two months time that we were at liberty in this City, we saw eleven or twelve of these Fairs, where were an infinite company of people, both on hors-back, and on foot, that out of boxes hanging about their necks sold all things that well neer can be named, as the Haberdashers of small wares do amongst us, besides the ordinary shops of rich Merchants, which were ranged very orderly in the particular streets, where was to be seen a world of silk stuffs, tinsels, cloth of gold, linnen, and cotton-cloth, sables, ermyns, musk, aloes, fine pourcelain, gold and silver plate, pearl, seed pearl, gold in powder, and lingots, and such other things of value, whereat we nine <hi>Portugals</hi> were exceedingly astonished; But if I should speak in particular of all the other commodities, that were to be sold there, as of iron, steel, lead, copper, tin, latin, corral, cornalin, crystal, quicksilver, vermillion, ivory, cloves, nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, mace, ginger, tamarinds, cinnamon, pepper, cardamone, borax, hony, wax, sanders, sugar, conserves, acates, fruit, meal, rice, flesh, venison, fish, pulse, and herbs; there was such abundance of them, as it is scarce possible to express it in words. The <hi>Chineses</hi> also assured us, that this City hath an hundred and threescore Butchers shambles, and in each of them an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred stalls, full of all kinds of flesh that the earth produceth, for that these people feed on all, as Veal, Mutton, Pork, Goat, the flesh of Horses, Buffles, Rhinocerets, Tygers, Lions, Dogs, Mules, Asses, Otters, Shamois, Bodgers, and finally of all other beasts whatsoever. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, besides the weights which are particularly in every shambles, there is not a gate in the City that hath not its scales, wherein the meat is weighed again, for to see if they have their due weight that have bought it, to the end that by this means the people may not be deceived. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those ordinary Shambles, there is not scarce a street but hath five or six Butchers shops in it, where the choicest meat is sold; there are withall many Taverns, where excellent fare is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be had, and cellers full of gammons of bacon, dried tongues, poudered geese, and other savoury viands, for to relish ones drink, all in so great abundance, that it would be very superfluous to say more of it; but what I speak is to shew how liberally God hath imparted to these miserable blinded wretches the good things which he hath created on the earth, to the end that his holy Name may therefore be blessed for evermore.</p>

            <p>DEsisting now from speaking in particular of the great number of the rich and magnificent buildings, which we saw in this City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> I will only insist on some of the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, that seemed more remarkable to me then the rest, whence it may be easie to infer, what all those might be, whereof I will not make any mention here to avoid prolixity; And of these neither would I speak, were it not that our Lord may one day permit, that the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation, full of valour, and of lofty courage, may make use of this relation for the glory of our great God, to the end that by these humane means, and the assistance of his divine favor, it may make those barbarous people understand the verity of our holy Catholique faith, from which their sins have so far esloigned them, as they mock at all that we say to them thereof: Hereunto I will adde, that they are extravagant, and senceless, as they dare boldly affirm, that only with beholding the face of the Son of the Sun, which is their King, a soul would be more happy then with all other things of the world besides, which perswades me that if God of his infinite mercy and goodness would grant, that the King of the people might become a Christian, it would be an easie matter to convert all his Subjects, whereas otherwise I hold it difficult for
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50126:77"/>
so much as one to change his belief, and all by reason of the great awe they are in of the Law, which they fear and reverence a like, and whereof it is not to be believed how much they che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the Ministers. But to return to my discourse, the first building which I saw of those that were most remarkable, was a prison, which they call <hi>Xinanguibaleu,</hi> that is to say, <hi>The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure of the Epiles</hi>; the circuit of this prison is two leagues square, or little less, both in length and bredth: It is inclosed with a very high wall without any battlements; the wall on the outside is invironed with a great deep ditch full of water, over the which are a many of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridges, that are drawn up in the night with certain iron chains, and so hang suspended on huge cast pillars; In this prison is an arch of strong hewed stone, abutting in two towers, in the tops whereof are six great sentinel bells, which are never rung but all the rest within the said inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure do answer them, which the <hi>Chineses</hi> affirm to be above an hundred, and indeed they make a most horrible din. In this place there are ordinarily three hundred thousand prisoners, between seventeen and fifty, whereat we were much amazed, and indeed we had good cause, in regard it is a thing so unusual and extraordinary. Now desiring to know of the <hi>Chineses</hi> the occasion of so marvellous a building, and of the great number of prisoners that were in it; they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered us, that after the King of <hi>China,</hi> named <hi>Crisnago Docotay,</hi> had finished a wall of three hundred leagues space betwixt this Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> and that of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared other where, he ordained by the advice of his people, (for to that effect he caused an Assembly of his Estates to be held) that all those which should be condemned to banishment, should be sent to work in the repairing of this wall, and that after they had served six years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether therein, they might freely depart, though they were sentenced to serve for a longer time, because the King pardoned them the remainder of the term by way of charity and alms; but if during those years, they should happen to perform any remarkable act, or other thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it appeared they had advantage over others, or if they were three times wounded in the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies they should make, or if they killed some of their enemies, they were then to be dispensed with for all the rest of their time, and that the <hi>Chaem</hi> should grant them a certificate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, where it should be declared why he had delivered them, and how he had thereby satisfied the Ordinances of War. Two hundred and ten thousand men are to be continually entertained in the work of the wall, by the first institution, whereof defalcation is made of a third part, for such are dead, maimed, and delivered, either for their notable actions, or for that they had accomplished their time: And likewise when as the <hi>Chaem,</hi> who is as the chief of all those, sent to the <hi>Pitaucamay,</hi> which is the highest Court of Justice, to furnish him with that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, they could not assemble them together so soon as was necessary, for that they were divided in so many several places of that Empire, which is prodigiously great, as I have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, and that withall a long time was required for the assembling them together, another King, named <hi>Gopiley Aparau,</hi> who succeeded to that <hi>Crisnago Dacotay,</hi> ordained that the great inclosure should be made in the City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> to the end that as soon as any were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the work of this wall, they should be carried to <hi>Xinanguibaleu</hi> for to be there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, by which means they might be sent away without any delay, as now is done. So soon as the Court of Justice hath committed the prisoners to this prison, whereof he that brings them hath a Certificate, they are immediately left at liberty, so that they may walk at their pleasure within this great inclosure, having nothing but a little plate of a span long, and four fingers broad, wherein these words are engraven, <hi>Such a one of such a place hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the general exile for such a cause, he entred such a day, such a month, such a year.</hi> Now the reason why they make every prisoner to carry this plate for a testimony of their evil actions, is, to manifest for what crime he was condemned, and at what time he entred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every one goes forth conformably to the length of time that shall be since he entred in. These prisoners are held for duly delivered when they are drawn out of captivity for to go and work at the wall, for they cannot upon any cause whatsoever be exempted from the prison of <hi>Xinanguibaleu,</hi> and the time they are there is counted to them for nothing, in regard they have no hope of liberty but at that instant when their turn permits them to work in the reparations, for then they may be sure to be delivered, according to the ordinance whereof I have made mention before. Having now delivered the occasion whereof so great a prison was made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave it I hold it not amiss to speak of a Fair, which we saw there, of two that are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally kept every year, which those of the Country call, <hi>Gunxinem, Apparau, Xinanguibaleu,</hi> that is to say, <hi>The rich Fair of the prison of the condemned</hi>; These Fairs are kept in the months of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and <hi>Ianuary,</hi> with very magnificent feasts, solemnized for the invocation of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50126:77"/>
their Idols; And even, there they have their plenory indulgences, by means whereof great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of gold and silver are promised them in the other world. They are both of them frank and free, so as the Merchants pay no duties, which is the cause that they flock thither in such great number, as they assured us that there were three millions of persons there; And forasmuch as I said before, that the three hundred thousand that are imprisoned there, are at liberty, as well as those that go in and out, you shall see what course they hold to keep the prisoners from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth amongst others. Every one that is free and comes in hath a mark set on the wrist of his right arm with a certain Confection made of Oyl, Bitumen, Lacre, Rubarb, and Alum, which being once dry cannot be any wayes defaced, but by the means of vinegar and salt mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether very hot; And to the end that so great a number of people may be marked, on both sides of the gates stand a many of <hi>Chainpatoens,</hi> who with stamps of lead, dipt in this Bitumen, imprints a mark on every one that presents himself unto them, and so they let him enter; which is only practised on men, not upon women, because none of that Sex are ever condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the labour of the wall. When therefore they come to go out of the gates, they must all have their arms bared where this mark is, that the said <hi>Chaintapo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns,</hi> who are the Porters and Ministers of this affair, may know them, and let them pass; and if by chance any one be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to have that mark defaced by any accident, must even have patience, and remain with the other prisoners, in regard there is no way to get him out of this place if he be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that mark. Now those <hi>Chaintapoens</hi> are so dextrous and well versed in it, that an hundred thousand men may in an hour go in and out without trouble, so that by this means the three hundred thousand prisoners continue in their captivity, and none of them can slip away amongst others to get out. There are in this prison three great inclosures like great towns, where there are a number of houses, and very long streets, without any lanes; and at the entrance into each street there are good gates, with their sentinel bells aloft, together with a <hi>Chumbim,</hi> and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men for a Guard; within a flight shoot of those inclosures are the lodgings of the <hi>Chaem,</hi> who commands all this prison, and those lodgings are composed of a number of fair houses, wherein are many out-Courts, Gardens, Ponds, Halls, and Chambers, inriched with excellent inventions, able to lodge a King at his ease, how great a Court soever he have. In the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of these Towns there are two streets, each of them about a flight shoot long, which abut upon the <hi>Chaems</hi> lodgings, arched all along with stone, and covered over head like the Hospital at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> but that they far surpass it. Here are all things to be sold that one can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, as well for victual, and other kind of provisions, as for all sorts of Merchandise, and rich wares. In those arched streets, which are very spacious and long, are these two Fairs kept every year, whither such an infinite multitude of people resort, as I have declared before. Moreover with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the inclosure of this prison are divers woods of tall and high trees, with many small streams, and ponds of clear sweet water for the use of the prisoners, and to wash their linnen, as also sundry Hermitages, and Hospitals, together with twelve very sumptuous and rich Monasteries, so that whatsoever is to be had in a great Town, may in great abundance be found within the inclosure, and with advantage in many things, because the most part of these prisoners have their wives and children there, to whom the King gives a lodging answerable to the houshold, or family, which each one hath.</p>
            <p>The second of those things, which I have undertaken to relate, is another inclosure we saw almost as big as the former, compassed about with strong walls, and great ditches.<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> This place is called <hi>Muxiparan,</hi> which signifies <hi>The treasure of the dead,</hi> where are many towers of hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed carved stone, and steeples diversly painted. The walls on the top are in stead of battlements invironed with iron grates, where there are a number of idols of different figures, as of Men, Serpents, Horses, Oxen, Elephants, Fishes, Adders, and many other monstrous forms of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were never seen, some of Brass, and Iron, and others of Tin, and Copper; so that this infinite company of several figures joyned together is one of the most remarkable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santest things that can be imagined. Having past over the bridge of the ditch we arrived at a great Court that was at the first entrance, inclosed round about with huge gates, and paved all over with white and black stones in checquer work, so polished and bright, as one might see himself in them as in a looking glass; In the midst of this Court was a pillar of Jasper six and thirty spans high, and as it seemed all of one piece, on the top whereof was an idol of silver in the figure of a woman, which with her hands strangled a Serpent, that was excellently ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lled with black and green. A little further at the entrance of another gate, which stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two very high towers, and accompanied with four and twenty pillars of huge great
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50126:78"/>
stone, there were two figures of men, each of them with an iron club in his hand, as if they had served to guard that passage, being an hundred and forty spans high, with such hideous and ugly visages, as makes them even to tremble that behold them; The <hi>Chineses</hi> called them <hi>Xixipatau Xalican,</hi> that is to say, <hi>The blowers of the house of smoak.</hi> At the entring into this gate there were twelve men with halberds, and two Registers, set at a table, who e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rolled all that entred t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere, unto whom every one paid a matter of a groat: when we were entred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this gate, we met with a very large street, closed on both sides with goodly arches, as well in regard of the workmanship, as the rest, round about the which hung an infinite company of little bells of lattin by chains of the same mettal, that moved by the air, made such a noise as one could with much ado hear one another: This street might be about half a league long, and within these arches, on both sides of the way, were two rows of low houses, like unto great Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, with steeples all guilt, and divers inventions of painting: Of these houses the <hi>Chineses</hi> assured us there was in that place three thousand, all which from the very top to the bottom were full of dead m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns skuls, a thing so strange, that in every mans judgment a thousand great shops could hardly contain them. Behind these houses, both on the one side and the other, were two great Mounts of dead mens bones, reaching far above the ridges of the houses, full as long as the street, and of a mighty bredth. These bones were ordered and disposed one upon another so curiously and aptly, that they seemed to grow there; Having demanded of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi> whether any register was kept of these bones, they answered, there was, for the <hi>Tala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grepos,</hi> unto whose charge the administration of these three thousond houses was commited, enrolled them all; and that none of these houses yield<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d less then two thousand <hi>Taeis</hi> reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue out of such lands, as the owners of these bones had bequeathed to them for their souls health; and that the rent of all these three thousand houses together amounted unto five milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of gold yearly, whereof the King had four, and the <hi>Talagrepos</hi> the other for to defray the expences of this Fabrick; and that the four appertained to the King, as their Support, who dispenced them in the maintenance of the three hundred thousand prisoners of <hi>Xinanguibaleu.</hi> Being amazed at this marvel, we began to go along this street, in the midst whereof we found a great <hi>Piazza,</hi> compassed about with two huge grates of lattin, and within it was an Adder of brass infolded into I know not how many boughts, and so big that it contained thirty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom in circuit, being withall so ugly and dreadful, as no words are able to describe it. Some of us would estimate the weight of it, and the least opinions reached to a thousand quintals, were it hollow within, as I believe it was. Now although it was of an unmeasurable great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet was it in every part so well proportioned, as nothing can be amended, whereunto also the workmanship thereof is so correspondent, that all the perfection which can be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from a good workman is observed in it. This monstrous Serpent, which the <hi>Chinese</hi> call, <hi>The gluttonous Serpent of the house of smoak,</hi> had on the top of his head a bowl of iron, two and fifty foot in circumference, as if it had been thrown at him from some other place; Twenty paces further was the figure of a man of the same brass in the form of a Gyant, in like manner very strange and extraordinary, as well for the greatness of the body, as the hugeness of the limbs: This Monster held an iron bowl just as big as the other aloft in both his hands, and beholding the Serpent with a frowning and angry countenance, he seemed as though he would throw this bowl at him. Round about this figure was a number of little idols all guilt on their knees, with their hands lifted up to him, as if they would adore him. All this great edifice was consecrated to the honour of this Idol, called <hi>Mucluparon,</hi> whom the <hi>Chineses</hi> affirmed to be the treasurer of all the dead mens bones, and that when the gluttonous Serpent before mentioned came to steal them away, he made at him with that bowl which he held in his hands, whereupon the Serpent in great fear fled immediately away to the bottom of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found house of smoak, whither God had precipitated him for his great wickedness; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he had maintained a combate with him three thousand years already, and was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the same three thousand years more, so that from three thousand to three thousand years he was to imploy five bowls, wherewith he was to make an end of killing him; H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reunto they added, that as soon as this Serpent should be dead, the bones that were there assembled, would return into the bodies, to which they appertained formerly, and so should go and remain for ever in the house of the Moon; To these brutish opinions they joyn many others such like, unto which they give so much faith, that nothing can be able to remove them from it, for it is the doctrine that is preached unto them by their <hi>Bonzes,</hi> who also tell them that the true way to make a soul happy, is to gather these bones together into this place, by means whereof there
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50126:78"/>
is not a day passes but that a thousand or two of these wretches bones are brought thither. Now if some for their far distance cannot bring all the bones whole thither, they will at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise bring a tooth or two, and so they say that by way of an alms they make as good sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as if they brought all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he rest; which is the reason that in all these chunel houses there is such an infinite multitude of these teeth, that one might lade many ships with them.</p>
            <p>We saw in a great Plain without the walls of this City another building,<note place="margin">§. 3</note> very sumptuous and rich, which they call <hi>Nacapirau,</hi> that is to say, the Queen of Heaven, for it is the opinion of these blinded wretches, that our Lord above is married like the Kings here below, and that the children which he hath had by the <hi>Nacapirau,</hi> are the Stars we see twinkling in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament by night, and that when any exhalation comes to dissolve in the air, they say that it is one of his children that is dead, whereof his other brothers are so grieved, that they shed such abundance of tears, as the earth is watered therewith, by which means God provides us of our living, as it were in manner of alms bestowed for the souls of the deceased. But letting pass these and other such like fooleries, I will only intreat of such particulars, as we observed in this great Edifice, whereof the first was one hundred and forty Convents of this accursed Religion, both of men and women, in each of which there are four hundred persons, amounting in all to six and fifty thousand, besides an infinite number of religious servants, that are not obliged to their vow of profession that are within, who for a mark of their Priestly dignity are clothed in violet, with green stars on them, having their head, beard, and eye-brows shaven, and wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beads about their necks to pray with, but for all that they crave no alms, by reason they have revenue enough to live on. The next was an inclosure within this huge building, a league in circuit, the walls whereof were built upon arches, vaults, of strong hewed stone, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them were Galleries, invironed all about with ballisters of lattin; within this inclosure at a gate, through which we past, we saw under most deformed figures the two porters of hell, at least they believe so, calling the one <hi>Bacharon,</hi> and the other <hi>Quagifau,</hi> both of them with iron clubs in their hands, and so hideous and horrible to see to, that it is impossible to behold them without fear. Having past this gate under a chain, that went a cross from the brest of one of these divels to the other, we entred into a very fair street, both for bredth and length, inclosed at either end with many arches, diversly painted, on the top whereof were all along two rows of idols to the number of five thousand; Now we could not well judg of what matter these idols were made, howsoever they were guilt all over, and upon their heads they wore myters of sundry inventions. At the end of this street was a great square place, paved with black and white stone, and compassed about with four rows of gyants in brass, each of them fifteen foot high, with halberds in their hands, and their hair and beards all guilt, which was not only a very pleasing object to the eye, but also represented a kind of majestical great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. At the end of this place was <hi>Quiay Huyan,</hi> the god of rain, which idol was so huge, that with his head he touched the battlements of the tower, being above twelve fathom high; he was likewise of brass, and both from his mouth, head, and brest, at six and twenty several places came out streams of water: Having past between his legs, which stood stradling at a great distance, one from another, we entred into a large room, as long as a Church, where there were three ships set upon very big and high pillars of Jasper; all along the walls thereof on both sides were a many of idols, great and little in divers forms all guilt, fitted and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in such order, as they took up all the bredth and length of the walls, and seemed at first sight to be all gold: At the end of this room or temple upon a round Tribunal, whereunto one as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended by fifteen winding stairs, was an altar, proportionable to the same Tribunal, whereon stood the image of <hi>Nacapirau,</hi> in the likeness of a very fair woman, with her hair hanging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her shoulders, and her hands lifted up to Heaven. Now for that she was guilt all over with fine gold, and that with a great deal of art and care, she glistered in that manner as it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to continue looking on her, so dazled were a mans eyes with the rayes that darted from her. Round about this Tribunal on the first four stairs were the Statues of twelve Kings of <hi>China</hi> in silver, with crowns on their heads, and maces on their shoulders; a little lower were three rows of idols guilt, kneeling on their knees, and holding up their hands, and all about hung a number of silver candlesticks with seven branches apiece. When we were out of this, we went through another street all arched like that by which we entred in, and from this we p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XXXVI. Of an Edifice, scituated in the midst of the river, wherein were the hundred and thirteen Chappels of the Kings of <hi>China</hi>; with the publique Granaries established for the relief of the poor.</head>
            <p>TO give an end to the matter, whereof I intreat, which would be infinite if I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count every thing in particular, amongst the great number of marvellous buildings, which we saw, the most remarkable to my seeming was an inclosure, seated in the midst of the river of <hi>Batampina,</hi> containing some league in circuit in an Island, and invironed with fair hewed stone, which on the out-side was about eight and thirty foot high above the water, and on the in-side even with the ground, being encompassed with two rows of ballisters of lattin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the outermost were but six foot high, for the commoditie of such as would rest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves there, and the innermost were nine foot high, having six Lyons of silver standing upon huge bowls, which are the arms of the King of <hi>China,</hi> as I have said elsewhere. Within the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure of these ballisters stood in very goodly order an hundred and thirteen Chappels after the fashion of Bulwarks all round, in each of which was a rich Tomb of Alabaster, placed with much art upon the heads of two silver Serpents, which in regard of the many boughts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were entertained seemed to be snakes, though they had the vis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ges of women, and three horns on their heads, the explication whereof we could not possibly learn. In each of these Chappels were thirteen branched Candlesticks with seven great lights a piece in them, so that to compute the whole, the candlesticks of these hundred and thirteen Chappels amount to a thousand, four hundred, thirty and nine. In the midst of a great place, invironed round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with three rows of winding stairs, and two ranks of idols, was a very high tower, with five steeples diversly painted, and silver Lions on the top of all: Here the <hi>Chineses</hi> told us were the bones of those hundred and thirteen Kings, that had been transported thither from these Chappels below: And it is the opinion of these brutish people, that these bones, which they hold for great reliques, do feast one another at every new Moon; in regard whereof these <hi>Barbarians</hi> use on that day to offer unto them a great Charger full of all kind of fowl, as also Rice, Beef, Pork, Sugar, Hony, and all other sorts of victual that one can name; wherein their blindness is such, as in recompence of these meats, which the Priests take unto themselves, they imagine that all their sins are forgiven them, by way as it were of a plenory indulgence. In this tower likewise we saw an exceeding rich Chamber, covered on the inside all over from the top to the bottom with plates of silver. In this Chamber were the Statues of those hundred and thirteen Kings of <hi>China</hi> all of silver, where in each of them were the bones of each several King inclosed; Now they hold, according as they are made to believe by their priests, that these Kings thus assembled together converse every night one with another, and pass away the time in sundry sports, which none is worthy to see, but certain <hi>Bonzes,</hi> whom they term <hi>Cabizun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> a title amongst them of the most eminent dignity, such it may be as the Cardinals of <hi>Rome.</hi> To this beastly ignorance the wretches adde many other blind tales, which they are assuredly perswaded are very clear and manifest truths: Within this great inclosure we counted in seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen places three hundred and forty bells of cast mettal, namely twenty in each place, which are all rung together on those days of the Moon, wherein they say these Kings do visit and feast one another. Near to this tower in a very rich Chappel, built upon seven and thirty pillars of fair hewed stone, was the image of the goddess <hi>Amida,</hi> made of silver, having her hair of gold, and seated upon a Tribunal fourteen steps high, that was all overlaid with fine gold; Her face was very beautiful, and her hands were heaved up towards Heaven, at her armpits hung a many of little idols not above half a finger long filed together, whereupon demanding of the <hi>Chineses</hi> what those meant, they answered us, <hi>That after the waters of Heaven had overflowed the earth, so that all mankind was drowned by an universal Deluge, God seeing that the world would be desolate, and no body to inhabit it, he sent the goddess</hi> Amida, <hi>the chief Lady of honour to his wife</hi> Nacapirau <hi>from the Heaven of the Moon, that she might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the loss of drowned mankind, and that then the goddess having set her feet on a Land, from which the waters were withdrawn, called</hi> Calemphuy, (which was the same Island, whereof I have spoken heretofore, in the streight of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> whereof <hi>Antonio de Faria</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:50126:79"/>
went on land) <hi>she was changed all into gold, and in that manner standing upright with her face looking up unto Heaven, she sweat out at her armpits a great number of children, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly males out of the right, and females out of the left, having no other place about her body whence she might bring them forth, as other women of the world have, who have sinned, and that for a chastisement of their sin, God by the order of nature hath subjected them to a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full of corruption and filthiness, for to shew how odious unto him the sin was that had been committed against him. The goddess</hi> Amida <hi>having thus brought forth these creatures, which they affirm were thirty three thousand, three hundred, thirty and three, two parts of them females, and the other males, for so say they the world was to be repaired, she remained so feeble and faint with this delivery, having no body to assist her at her need, that she fell down dead in the place, for which cause the Moon at that time in memory of this death of hers, whereat she was infinitely grieved, put her self into mourning, which mourning they affirm to be those black spots we ordinarily behold in her face, occasioned indeed by the shadow of the earth, and that when there shall be so many years ran out, as the goddess</hi> Amida <hi>brought forth children, which were, as I have delivered, thirty three thousand, three hundred, thirty and three, then the Moon will put off her mourning, and afterwards be as clear as the day.</hi> With these and such like fopperies did the <hi>Chineses</hi> so turmoil us, as we could not chuse but grieve to consider how much those people, which otherwise are quick of apprehension, and of good understanding, are abused in matter of Religion with such evident and manifest untruths. After we were come out of this great place, where we saw all these things, we went unto another Temple of religious Votaries, very sumptuous and rich, where they told us the Mother of the then reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King, named <hi>Nhay Camisama,</hi> did abide, but thereunto we were not permitted to enter, because we were strangers; From this place through a street, arched all along, we arrived at a Key, called <hi>Hichario Topileu,</hi> where lay a great number of vessels, full of pilgrims from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Kingdoms, which came incessantly on pilgrimage to this Temple, for to gain, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, plenary indulgences, which the King of <hi>China,</hi> and the <hi>Chaems</hi> of the Government, do grant unto them, besides many priviledges and franchises throughout the whole Country, where victuals are given them abundantly, and for nothing. I will not speak of many other Temples, or <hi>Pagodes,</hi> which we saw in this City whilest we were at liberty, for I should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done to make report of them all, howbeit I may not omit some other particulars, that I hold very fit to be related before I break off this discourse; whereof the first were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain houses, in several parts of this City, called <hi>Laginampurs,</hi> that is to say, <hi>The School of the poor,</hi> wherein fatherless and motherles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> children, that are found in the streets, are taught to write and read, as also some trade, whereby they may get their living, and of these houses, or schools, there are about some five hundred in this City; Now if it happen that any of them through some defect of nature cannot learn a trade, then have they recourse to some means for to make them get their living according to each ones incommodity; As for example, if they be blind they make them labour in turning of handmils; if they be lame of their feet, they cause them to make laces, riband, and such like manufactures; if they be lame of their hands, then they make them earn their living by carrying of burdens; but if they be lame both of feet and hands, so that nature hath wholly deprived them of means to get their living, then they shut them up in great Convents, where there are a number of persons that pray for the dead, amongst whom they place them, and so they have their share of half the offerings that are made there, the Priests having the other half; if they be dumb, then they are shut up in a great house, where they are maintained with the amerciaments that the common sort of women, as oyster-wives, and such like, are condemned in for their scolding and fighting one with another; As for old queans, that are past the trade, and such of the younger sort as by the lewd exercise thereof are becom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> diseased with the pox, or other filthy sickness, they are put into other houses, where they are very well looked unto, and furnished abundantly with all things necessary, at the charge of the other women that are of the same trade, who thereunto pay a certain sum monthly, and that not unwillingly, because they know that they shall come to be so provided for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lves by others, and for the collecting of this mony there are Commissioners expresly depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in several parts of the City. There are also other houses, much like unto Monasteries, where a great many of young maids, that are Orp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Other places there are also, where decayed old people are kept

at the charge of Lawyers, that plead unjust causes, where the parties have no right; and of Judges, that for favoring one more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 2</note>In the prosecution of my discourse it will not be amiss here to deliver the marvellous order and policy, which the Kings of <hi>China</hi> observe in furnishing their States abundantly with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and victuals, for the relief of the poor people, which may very well serve for an example of charity, and good government, to Christian Kingdoms and Commonwealths. Their Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles report, that a certain King, great Grandfather to him that then raigned in <hi>China,</hi> named <hi>Chausi-Zarao Panagor,</hi> very much beloved of his people for his good disposition and vertues, having lost his sight by an accident of sickness, resolved to do some pious work, that might be acceptable to God, to which effect he assembled his Estates, where he ordained, that for the relief of the poor there should be Granaries established in all the Towns of his Kingdom for wheat and rice, that in the time of dearth (which many times happened) the people might have wherewithall to nourish themselves that year, and to that purpose he gave the tenth part of the Duties of his Kingdom by a Grant under his hand, which when he came to signe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly with a golden stamp, that he ordinarily used because he was blind, it pleased God to restore him perfectly to his sight again, which he enjoyed still as long as he lived; By this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if it were true, it seemed that our Lord Jesus Christ would demonstrate, how acceptable the charity that good men exercise towards the poor is to him, even though they be <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and without the knowledge of the true Religion; Ever since there have been always a great many of Granaries in this Monarchy, and that to the number of an hundred and fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. As for the order which the Magistrates observe in furnishing them continually with corn, is such as followeth; A little before reaping time all the old corn is distributed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orth to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, as it were by way of love, and that for the term of two months, after this time is expired, they unto whom the old corn was lent, return in as much new, and withall six in the hundred over and above for waste, to the end that this store may never fail: But when it falls out to be a dear year, in that case the corn is distributed to the people without taking any gain or interest for it, and that which is given to the poorer sort, who are not able to repay what hath been lent to them, is made good out of the Rents, which the Countries pay to the King, as an alms bestowed on them by his special grace. Touching the Kings Revenues, which are paid in silver <hi>Picos,</hi> they are divided into three parts, whereof the first is for the maintenance of the King, and his State, the second for the defence of the Provinces, as also for the provisions of Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines, and Armies, and the third to be laid up and reserved in a Treasury, that is in this City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> which the King himself may not touch, unless it be upon occasion for defence of the Kingdom, and to oppose the <hi>Tartars, Cauchins,</hi> and other Neighbouring Princes, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times make grievous war upon him. This Treasure is by them called <hi>Chidampur,</hi> that is to say, <hi>The wall of the Kingdom,</hi> for they say, that by means of this treasure, being well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and carefully managed, the King needs lay no impositions upon the people, so that they shall not be any ways vexed and oppressed, as it happens in other Kingdoms for want of this providence. Now by this that I have related one may see, how in all the great Monarchy the Government is so excellent, the Laws so exactly observed, and every one so ready and careful to put the Princes Ordinances in execution, that Father <hi>Navier,</hi> having well noted it, was wont to say, that if ever God would grant him the grace to return into <hi>Portugal,</hi> he would become a Suter to the King for to peruse over the rules and ordinances of those people, and the manner how they govern both in time of war and peace; adding withall that he did not think the <hi>Romans</hi> ever ruled so wisely in all the time of their greatest prosperity, and that in matter of policy the <hi>Chineses</hi> surpassed all other Nations of whom the Ancients have written.</p>

them in question, and not to give occasion also unto detractors, who judging of things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the little world they have seen, may hold those truths for fables, which mine own eyes have beheld, I will forbear the delivery of many matters, that possibly might bring much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to more worthy spirits, who not judging of the riches and prosperity of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres by the poverty and misery of their own, would be well pleased with the relation thereof. Howbeit on the other side I have no great cause to blame those, who shall not give credit to that which I say, or make any doubt of it, because I must acknowledge, that many times when I call to mind the things that mine eyes have seen, I remain confounded therewith, whither it be the Grandeurs of this City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> or the magnificence wherewith this <hi>Gentile</hi> King is served, or the pomp of the <hi>Chaems,</hi> and <hi>Anchacys</hi> of the Government, or the dread and awe wherein all men are of these Ministers, or the sumptuousness of their Temples and <hi>Pagodes,</hi> together with all the rest that may be there, for within the only inclosure of the Kings Pallace there are above a thousand Eunuchs, three thousand women, and 12 thousand men of his Guard, unto whom the King gives great entertainment and pentions: also twelve <hi>Tutons,</hi> dignities that are Soveraign above all others, whom, as I have already declared, the vulgar call, <hi>The beams of the Sun</hi>; Under these twelve <hi>Tutons,</hi> there are forty <hi>Chaems,</hi> or Vice-roys, besides many other inferiour dignities, as Judges, Majors, Governours, Treasurers, Admirals, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, which they term, <hi>Anchacys, Aytaos, Ponchacy, Lauteas,</hi> and <hi>Chumbims,</hi> whereof there are above five hundred always residing at the Court, each of them having at the least two hundred men in his train, which for the most part to strike the greater terror are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Nations, namely, <hi>Megores, Persians, Curazens, Moems, Calaminhams, Tartars, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins,</hi> and some <hi>Braamas</hi> of <hi>Chaleu,</hi> and <hi>Tanguu</hi>; for in regard of valour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Natives, who are of a weak and effeminate complection, though otherwise I must confess they are exceeding able and ingenious in whatsoever concerneth Mechanick Trades Tillage, and Husband<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng in all kind of good things, as I cannot sufficiently express it, &amp; such is their blindness as they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all those blessings to the only merit of their King, and not to the Divine Providence, and to the goodness of that Soveraign Lord, who hath created all things. From this blindness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity of these people are these great abuses, and confused superstitions derived, which are ordinary amongst them, and wherein they observe a world of diabolical ceremonies; For they are so brutish and wicked as to sacrifice humane blood, offering it up with divers sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, and sweet savors; Moreover they present their Priests with many gifts, upon assurance from these profane wretches, of great blessings in this life, and infinite riches and treasure in the other; To which effects the same Priests grant them I know not what Certificates, as it were Bills of Exchange, which the common people call <hi>Couchinnoces,</hi> that after their death they may serve above in Heaven to procure for them a recompence of an hundred for one; wherein these miserable creatures are so blinded, that they save the very meat &amp; drink from their own mouths to furnish those accursed priests of Satan with all things necessary, believing that these goodly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ills they have from them, will assuredly return them that benefit. There are also Priests of another Sect, called <hi>Naustolins,</hi> who contrary to those others preach, and affirm with great oaths, that reasonable creatures live and die like beasts, &amp; therfore that they are to make merry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; spend their goods jovially whiles life shall last, there being no other after this, as all but fools &amp; ignorants are to believe. There is another Sect, named <hi>Trimechau,</hi> who are of opinion that so long time as a man shall live in this world, so long shall he remain under ground, until at length by the prayers of their priests his soul shall reassume the body of a child of seven days old, wherein he shall live again till he shall grow so strong, as to re-enter into the old body, which he hed left in the grave, and so be transported into the Heaven of the Moon, where they say he shal live many years, &amp; in the end be converted into a star, which shall remain fixed above in the Firmament for ever. Another Sect there is called <hi>Gyson,</hi> who believe that only the beasts in regard of their sufferings, and the labour which they endure in this life, shall possess Heaven after their death, &amp; not man, that leadeth his life according to the lusts of the flesh, robbing, killing, and committing a world of other offences, by reason whereof, say they, it is not possible for him to be saved, unless at the hour of death he leave all his estate to the <hi>Pagodes,</hi> and to the Priests, that they may pray for him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one may see that all the intentions of their diabolical Sects is not founded but upon a very tyranny, and upon the interests of the <hi>Bonzes,</hi> who are they that preach this pernicions doctrine

to the people, and perswaded them with many fables to believe it; In the mean time these things seem so true to these wretches that hear them, as they very willingly give them all their goods, imagining that thereby only they can be saved, and freed from those punishments and fears, wherewithall they threaten them if they do otherwise. I have spoken here of no more then these three Sects, omitting the rest of the two and thirty, which are followed in this great Empire of <hi>China,</hi> as well because I should never have done (as I have said heretofore) if I would relate them all at large, as for that by these it may be known what the others are, which are nothing better, but in a manner even the very same; wherefore leaving the remedy of such evils, and great blindness to the mercy and providence of God, unto whom only it appertains; I will pass on to the declarations of the miseries we indured during our exille in the Town of <hi>Quancy,</hi> until such time as we were made slaves by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the year, 1544.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>We had been now two months and an half in this City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> when as on <hi>Saturday,</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1554. we were carried away to the Town of <hi>Quansy,</hi> there to serve all the time that we were condemned unto: Now as soon as we arrived there, the <hi>Chaem</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed us to be brought before him, and after he had asked us some questions, he appointed us to be of the number of fourscore Halberdiers, which the King assigned him for his Guard; This we took as a special favour from God, both in regard this imployment was not very painful, as also because the entertainment was good, and the pay of it better, being assured besides that at the time we should recover our liberty. Thus lived we almost a month very peaceably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and well contented for that we met with a better fortune then we expected, when as the divel, seeing how well all we nine agreed together (for all that we had was in common amongst us, and whatsoever misery any one had we shared it with him like true brothers,) he so wrought that two of our company tell into a quarrel, which proved very prejudicial to us all; This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision sprung from a certain vanity too familiar with the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation, whereof I can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no other reason, but that they are naturally sensible of any thing that touches upon honour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This while our business was brought before the Kings Atturny, who having seen our accusations, and that one of the articles made faith, that there were sixteen witnesses against us, he stuck not to say, <hi>That we were people without the fear or knowledge of God, who did not confess him otherwise with our mouths, then as any wild beast might do if he could speak; that these things presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it was to be believed, that we were men of blood, of a Language, of a Law, of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of a Country, and of a Kingdom, the inhabitants whereof wounded and killed one another most cruelly, without any reason or cause, and therefore no other judgment could be made of us, but that we were the servants of the most gluttenous Serpent of the profound pit of smoak, as appeared by our worke, since they were no better then such as that accursed Serpent had accustomed to do, so that according to the Law of the third Book of the will of the Son of the Sun, called</hi> Mileterau, <hi>we were to be condemned to a banishment from all commerce of people, as a venemous and contagious plague; so that we deserved to be confined to the Mountains of</hi> Chabaguay, Sumbor, <hi>or</hi> Lamau, <hi>whither such as we were use to be exiled, to the end they might in that place hear the wild beasts howl in the night, which were of as vile a breed and nature as we.</hi> From this prison we were one morning led to a place, called by them <hi>Pitau Calidan,</hi> whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

there each of us had thirty lashes a piece more given us, and then by publique sentence we were removed to another prison, where we were in better case yet then in that out of which we came, howbeit for all that we did not a little detest amongst our selves both the <hi>Fonsecas,</hi> and the <hi>Madureyras,</hi> but much more the divel, that wrought us this mischief. In this prison we continued almost two months, during which time our stripes were throughly healed, howbeit we were exceedingly afflicted with hunger, and thirst. At length it pleased God that the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em</hi> took compassion of us; for on a certain day, wherein they use to do works of charity for the dead, coming to review our sentence he ordained, <hi>That in regard we were strangers, and of a Country so far distant from theirs, as no man had any knowledge of us, nor that there was any book, or writing which made mention of our name, and that none understood our language; as also that we were accustomed, and even hardned to misery and poverty, which many times puts the best and most peaceable persons into disorder, and therefore might well trouble such, as made no profession of patience in their adversities, whence it followed, that our discord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded rather from the effects of our misery, then from any inclination unto mutiny and tumult, wherewith the Kings Atturny charged us; and furthermore representing unto himself what great need there was of men for the ordinary service of the State, and of the Officers of Iustice, for which provision necessarily was to be made, he thought fit, that the punishment for the crimes we had committed, should in the way of an alms bestowed in the Kings name be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and reduced to the whipping which we had twice already had, upon condition neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less that we should be detained there as slaves for ever, unless it should please the</hi> Tuton <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to ordain of us.</hi> This sentence was pronounced against us, and though we shed a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of tears to see our selves reduced unto this miserable condition, wherein we were, yet this seemed not so bad unto us as the former. After the publication of this Decree we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently drawn out of prison, and tied three and three together, then led to certain iron Forges, where we past six whole months in strange labours, and great necessities, being in a manner quite naked, without any bed to lie on, and almost <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At last after the enduring of so many evils, we fell sick of a Lethargy, which was the cause, in regard it was a contagious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, that they turned us out of doors for to go and seek our living, until we became well again. Being thus set at liberty we continued four months sick, and begging the alms of good people from door to door, which was given us but sparingly, by reason of the great dearth that then reigned over all the Country, so as we were constrained to agree better together, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise one another by a solemn oath, that we took, to live lovingly for the future, as good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should do, and that every month one should be chosen from amongst us to be as it were a kind of Chief, whom, by the oath we had taken, all the rest of us were to obey, as their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, so that none of us was to dispose of himself, nor do any thing, without his command, or appointment; and those rules were put into writing by us, that they might be the better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; As indeed God gave us the grace to live ever afterward in good peace and concord, though it were in great pain, and extream necessity of all things.</p>
            <p>We had continued a good while living in peace and tranquility, according to our fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned agreement, when as he, whose lot it was to be our Chief that month,<note place="margin">§. 3</note> named <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vano Boralho,</hi> considering how necessary it was to seek out some relief for our miseries by all the ways that possibly we could, appointed us to serve weekly two and two together, some in begging up and down the Town, some in getting water and dressing our meat, and others in fetching wood from the Forrest, both for our own use, &amp; to sell. Now one day my self &amp; one <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spar de Meyrelez</hi> being enjoyned to go to the Forrest, we rose betimes in the morning, &amp; went forth to perform our charge; And because this <hi>Gaspar de Meyrelez</hi> was a pretty Musician, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well on a Cittern, whereunto he accorded his voice, which was not bad, being parts that are very agreeable to those people, in regard they imploy the most part of their times in the delights of the flesh, they took great pleasure in hearing of him, so as for that purpose they invited him very often to their sports, from whence he never returned without some reward, wherewith we were not a little assisted: As he and I then were going to the wood, and before we were out of the Town, we met by fortune in one of the streets with a great many of people, who full of jollity were carrying a dead corps to the grave with divers banners, and other funeral pomp, in the midst whereof was a Consort of musick and voices; Now he, that had the chief ordering of the Funeral, knowing <hi>Gaspar de Meyrelez,</hi> made him stay, and putting a Cittern into his hands, he said unto him, <hi>Oblige me, I pray thee, by singing as loud as thou canst, so as thou mayst be heard by this dead man whom we are carrying to burial, for I swear unto thee, that he went away very sad for that he was separated from his wife and children, whom he

Gaspar de Meyrelez</hi> would fain have excused himself, alledging many reasons thereupon to that end, but so far was the Governour of the <hi>Funeral</hi> from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting them, that contrarily he answered him very angerly. <hi>Truly, if thou wilt not deign to benefit this defun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After we had spent the remainder of the day in entertaining one another with our passed adventures, we went to the City, where having shewed me his house, he desired me that I would instantly go and fetch the rest of my fellows, which accordingly I did, and found them all together in the poor lodging where we lay, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50126:82"/>
having declared unto them what had befallen me, they were much abashed at it, as indeed they had cause, considering the stratagems of the accident, so they went presently along with me to <hi>Vasco Calvo's</hi> house, who waiting for us, gave us such hearty welcome, as we could not chuse but weep for joy; Then he carried us into a Chamber where was his wife, with two little boys, and two girls of his; she entertained us very kindly, and with as much demonstration of love, as if she had been the mother or daughter to either of us; After this we sat down at the table, which he had caused to be covered, and made a very good meal of many several dishes provided for us: Supper done, his wife arose very courteously from the table, and taking a key which hung at her girdle, she opened the door of an Oratory, where there was an altar, with a silver cross, as also two candlesticks, and a lamp of the same, and then she and her four chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren falling down on their knees, with their hands lift up to Heaven, began to pronounce these words very distinctly in the <hi>Portugal</hi> tongue: <hi>O thou true God, we wretched sinners do confess before thy Cross, like good Christians, as we are, the most sacred Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons, and one God; and also we promise to live and dye in thy most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholique Faith, like good and true Christians, confessing and believing so much of thy holy truth, as is held and believed by thy Church; In like manner we offer up unto thee our souls, which thou hast redeemed with thy most precious bloud, for to be wholly imployed in thy service all the time of our lives, and then to be yielded unto thee at the hour of our death, as to our Lord and God, unto whom we acknowledge they appertain both by Creation and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> After this Confession <hi>they said the Lords Prayer, and the Creed,</hi> which they pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced very distinctly, whereat we could not chuse but shed a world of tears to see these inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, born in a Country, so far remote from ours, and where there was no knowledge of the true God, thus to confess his Law in such religious terms. This being done, we returned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was three of the clock in the morning to our lodging, exceedingly astonished at that we had seen, as at a thing which we had great reason to admire.</p>

            <p>WE had been now eight months and an half in this captivity,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> wherein we endured much misery, and many incommodities, for that we had nothing to live upon but what we got by begging up and down the Town, when as one <hi>Wednesday,</hi> the third of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the year 1544. a little after midnight there was such a hurly burly amongst the people, that to hear the noise and cries which was made in every part, one would have thought the earth would have come over and over, which caused us to go in haste to <hi>Vasco Calvo</hi> his house, of whom we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the occasion of so great a tumult, whereunto with tears in his eyes he answered us, that certain news were come how the King of <hi>Tartary</hi> was fallen upon the City of <hi>Pequin</hi> with so great an Army, as the like had never been seen since <hi>Adams</hi> time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this army, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to report, were seven and twenty Kings, under whom marched eighteen hundred thousand men, whereof six hundred thousand were horse, which were come by land from the Cities of <hi>Luançama, Famstir,</hi> and <hi>Mecuy,</hi> with fourscore thousand <hi>Rhinocerots,</hi> that draw the waggons, wherein was all the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gage of the Army; as for the other twelve hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, which were foot, it was said that they arrived by Sea in seventeen thousand vessels, down through the river of <hi>Batampina</hi>; By reason whereof the King of <hi>China</hi> finding himself too weak for the resisting of such great forces, had with a few retired himself to the City of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin.</hi> And that also it was reported for a certain, that a <hi>Nauticor,</hi> one of the chiefest <hi>Tartar</hi> Commanders, was come to the Forrest of <hi>Malincataran,</hi> not above a league and an half from <hi>Quinçay,</hi> with an Army of threescore and two thousand Horse, wherewith he marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Town, that in all likelihood he would be there within two hours at the furthest. These news so troubled us, that we did nothing but look one upon another, without being able to speak a word to any purpose, howbeit desiring to save our selves, we prayed <hi>Vasco Calvo</hi> to shew us what means he thought we might use to effect it, who sad and full of grief thus answered us; O that we were in our Country between <hi>Laura</hi> and <hi>Carncha,</hi> where I have often been, and should be there now in safety, but since it cannot be so, all that we can do for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50126:83"/>
the present, is to recommend our selves to God, and to pray unto him to assist us; for I assure you that an hour ago I would have given a thousand <hi>Taeis</hi> in silver to any one, that could have got me from hence, and saved me with my wife and children, but there was no possibility for it, because the gates were then all shut up, and the walls round about invironed with armed men, which the <hi>Chaem</hi> hath placed there to withstand the enemy. So my fellows and I, that were nine in number, past the rest of the night there in much affliction and unquietness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any means of counselling one another, or resolving on what we were to do, continually weeping for the extream fear we were in of what should become of us. The next morning a little before Sun-rising the enemy appeared in a most dreadful manner, they were divided into seven very great Battalions, having their Ensignes quartered with green and white, which are the colours of the King of <hi>Tartaria</hi>; marching in this order to the sound of their Trumpets, they arrived at a <hi>Pagode,</hi> called <hi>Petilau Nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In their Vantguard they had a number of Light-horse, who ran confusedly up and down with their Lances in their Rests.

               </gap>g with them, they assaulted the Town on every side with a most invincible courage. Now though the besieged at the beginning made some resistance, yet was it not able to hinder the enemy from effecting his designe, for by the means of certain iron rams broking up the four principal gates, they rendred themselves Masters of the Town after they had slain the <hi>Chaem,</hi> together with a great number of <hi>Mandarins,</hi> and Gentlemen, that were run thither to keep them from entring; Thus did these <hi>Barbarians</hi> possess themselves of this miserable Town, whereof they put all the inhabitants they could meet withall to the sword, without sparing any; and it was said that the number of the slain amounted to threescore thousand persons, amongst whom were many women and maids of very great beauty, which appertained to the chiefest Lords of the place. After the bloody Massacre of so much people, and that the Town was fired, the principal hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses overthrown, and the most sumptuous Temples laid level with the ground, nothing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on foot during the disorder, the <hi>Tartars</hi> continued there seven days, at the end whereof they returned towards <hi>Pequin,</hi> where their King was, and from whence he had sent them to this execution, carrying with them a world of gold and silver only, having burnt all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise they found there, as well because they knew not how to transport it away, as for that the <hi>Chineses</hi> should not make any benefit of it: Two days after their departure they arrived at a Castle, named <hi>Nixianicoo,</hi> where the <hi>Nauticor</hi> of <hi>Luançama,</hi> their General, pitched his Camp, and intrenched himself on all sides with an intention to take it by assault the next day to be revenged on the <hi>Chineses</hi> there, for that upon his passing by them towards <hi>Quinçay,</hi> they had cut off an hundred of his men by an Ambuscado.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 2</note>After the Army was encamped, and intrenched, and that the General had placed sure Guards and Sentinels in all places, he retired to his Tent, whither he sent for the seventy Captains that commanded his Army, unto whom upon their arrival he discovered his resolution, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well approved of they fell into deliberation in what manner the Castle should be assaulted the day following, which concluded on, the next morning as soon as it was light the souldiers began to march towards the Castle, divided into fourteen Bataillions; being come within a flight shoot of it with the sound of trumpets, and most hideous cries, they reared up their Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders against the walls, and couragiously mounted up; but in the heat of this assault, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one shewed his valour, the one in bravely attempting, and the other in well defending, the <hi>Tartar</hi> in less then two hours lost above three thousand of his men, which made him found a retreat in great disorder, and he past the rest of that day in burying the dead, and curing of the wounded, whereof, there being a great number, the most part died not long after, for that the arrows wherewith they were hurt had been smeared by the <hi>Chineses</hi> with so strange and deadly poison, as there was no remedy to be found for it. In the mean time the <hi>Tartar</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders seeing the ill success of this assault, and fearing the King would be offended at so great a loss for so small an occasion, perswaded the General to call another Councel, wherein it might be considered, whether it would be most expedient for the Kings honour to persist in the Siege of that place, or to give it over, whereupon this affair coming accordingly into delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was a long time debated with such diversity of opinions, as they were not able to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50126:83"/>
conclude upon any thing, so that it was thought fit, in regard it was then late to put off the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly till the next day; This resolution taken, every man retired to his quarter. Now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led away amidst a great many of other slaves, with whom we had escaped out of the fire of the Town, it fell out, whether for our good, or for our greater misfortune, we could not then tell, that we were under the Guard, as prisoners of war, of one of that Assembly, a rich and honourable man, who returning to his tent with three other persons, of like quality to himself, whom he had invited to Supper, it chanced after they were risen from table that one of them espied us, where we stood chained in a corner of the tent, and perceiving us to weep was so moved, that he demanded of us what people we were? what the name of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was? and how we came to be slaves to the <hi>Chineses?</hi> whereunto we gave such an answer, as the <hi>Tartar</hi> ingaging himself further in this discourse, enquired of us whether our King was inclined to the wars, and whether we did use to fight in our Country? to whom one of our companions, named <hi>Iorge Mendez,</hi> replyed that we did, and that we had been trained up from our infancy in a military course of life; which so pleased the <hi>Tartar,</hi> that calling his two friends unto him, Come hither, said he, and have the patience to hear what these prisoners can say; for believe me they seem to be men of understanding; whereupon the other two came near, and hearing us relate some part of our misfortunes, it begat a desire in them to ask us other questions, wherein having satisfied them the best that we could, one of them that seemed more curious then the rest, addressing himself to <hi>Iorge Mendez,</hi> spake thus; <hi>Since you have seen so much of the world, as you say, if there were ere a one amongst you that could find out any device, or stratagem of war, whereby the</hi> Mitaquer (<hi>for so was the</hi> Nauticor <hi>called) might take this Castle, I vow to you that he would become your prisoner, whereas you are his.</hi> Then <hi>Iorge Mendez,</hi> never considering with what imprudence he spake, nor understanding what he said, nor into what danger he was putting himself, boldly answered him; <hi>If my Lord</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taquer <hi>will in the name of the King g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The same of the three <hi>Tartar</hi> Commanders,<note place="margin">&amp; sect;. 1.</note> which I said before was so esteemed of by the <hi>Mitaquer,</hi> had no sooner learnt of <hi>Iorge Mendez,</hi> that he could tell how to take the Castle of <hi>Nixiamcoo,</hi> but that he went presently to acquaint the General with it, and making the matter greater then it was, he told him, that he could do no less then send for him to hear his reasons, which peradventure would perswade him to give credit unto him, and in case it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not so, yet was there nothing lost thereby. The <hi>Mitaquer</hi> being well pleased with this advice, sent incontinently a Command to <hi>Tileymay,</hi> which was the Captain under whose

Being then arrived, chained as we were, at the <hi>Mitaquers</hi> Tent, we found him set in Councel with the seventy Commanders of the Army about two hours after midnight; At our coming he received us with an affable countenance, yet grave and severe, and causing us to approach nearer unto him, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of our chains to be undone, then asked us if we would eat, whereunto we answered most willingly, for that in three days together we had not so much as tasted a bit of any thing, whereat the <hi>Mitaquer</hi> was very much offended, and sharply reproving the <hi>Tileymay</hi> for it, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led two great platters of sodden rice, and Ducks cut in small pieces to be set before us, whereto we fell with such an appetite, like men that were almost famished, as those of the company, who took great pleasure to see us feed so, said to the <hi>Mitaquer, When as you had nothing else, my Lord, but cause these to come before you for to flack their hunger, verily you had done very much for them, by saving them from a languishing death, which otherwise they could not have avoided, and so you might have lost these slaves, of whom the service or sale might have been some way profitable unto you, for if you will not make use of them at</hi> Lancama, <hi>you may sell them for a thousand</hi> Taeis <hi>at least.</hi> Hereat some began to laugh, but the <hi>Mitaquer</hi> commanded more rice to be given us, together with some apples, and other things, conjuring us again to eat, as a thing which he took pleasure to see us do, wherein we most willingly gave him satisfaction. After we had fed well, he began to talk with <hi>Iorge Mendez</hi> about that which had been told him of him, and of the means that were to be used for taking the Castle, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him many great promises of honours, pentions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour with the King, and liberty for all the rest of his fellows, with other such offers, as passed all measure: For he swore unto him that if by his means God should give him the victory, whereby he sought nothing but to be revenged on his enemies for the blood which they had shed of his men, he should every way be like unto himself, or at least to any of his children which soever; Herewith <hi>Iorge Mendez</hi> found himself somewhat perplexed, because he held it almost impossible for him to bring it to effect, howsoever he told him, that not to hold him longer in hand, he did not think but if he might view the Castle with his own eys, he might then peradventure let him know how it might be taken, wherefore if his Lordship pleased, he would the next morning consider it all about, and thereupon render him an account what course was to be taken therein. The <hi>Mitaquer,</hi> &amp; all the rest, allowed very well of his answer, and greatly commending him for it sent us to be lodged in a Tent not far from his, where we spent the rest of the night under a sure Guard; you may judg now in what fear we were, knowing that if the business did not succeed according to the desire of these <hi>Barbarians,</hi> they would cut us all in pieces, for that they were a people which for never so small a matter would not stick to kill twenty or thirty men, without any regard either of God, or any thing else. The next morning about eight of the clock, <hi>Iorge Mendez,</hi> and two of us, that were appointed to accompany him, went to survey the place with thirty horse for our safe-Guard; when as <hi>Iorge Mendez</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d well observed the scituation thereof, as also that part whereby it might most commodiously be assaulted, he returned to the <hi>Mitaquer,</hi> that expected him with impatience, to whom he gave an acount of what he had seen, and facilitated the taking of the Castle with little hazard, whereat the <hi>Mitaquer</hi> was so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, that he presently caused the rest of our irons, and the chains, wherewith we were faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the neck and feet to be taken off, swearing to us by the rice he did eat, that as soon as he came to <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That done, he sent for us to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and would needs have us to sit with him at table, doing us many other honours accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their manner, which greatly contented us, but on the other side we were in no little fear, least this affair should not for our sins have a success answerable to that hope the <hi>Mita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi> had already conceived of it. The rest of this day the Commanders spent in resolving up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the order that was to be observed for assaulting the Castle, wherein <hi>Iorge Mendez</hi> was the sole Director: First of all then an infinite company of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50126:84"/>
In the mean time <hi>Iorge Mendez</hi> rode always by the <hi>Mitaquers</hi> side, who shewed him many great favours, which we perceived had begotten in him a stately carriage, far different from that he was wont to have, whereat we wondring, some of us (who envious of anothers good fortune, and out of an ill nature) could not chuse but murmur, saying one to another, as it were in disdain, and in a kind of jeering, <hi>What think you of this dog? verily he will be the cause that either to morrow morning we shall be all cut in pieces, or if the business he hath undertaken succeed as we desire, it is probable that he will be in such credit with these</hi> Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>that we shall account it for a happiness to be his servants</hi>; and this was the talk which we had amongst us. The next day all the Army was put into order, and divided into twelve Battalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereof they made twelve Files, and one Counterfile in the Vantguard, that incompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the whole Camp in manner of an half moon: upon the wings were the foremost with all that Mass of Bavins, Ladders, Baskets, Mattocks, Spades, and other materials to fill up the ditch, and make it equal with the rest of the ground. Marching in this manner they arrived at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, which they found strongly mann'd, and with a number of Flags and Streamers waving upon the Battlements. The first Salutation between the besiegers and the besieged was with arrows, darts, stones, and pots of wild-fire, which continued about half an hour, then the <hi>Tartars</hi> presently filled the ditch with bavins and earth, and so reared up their ladders against the wall, that now by reason of the filling up of the ditch was not very high; The first that mounted up was <hi>Iorge Mendez,</hi> accompanied with two of ours, who as men resolved had set up their rest, either to die there, or to render their valour remarkable by some memorable act, as in effect it pleased our Lord that their resolution had a good success, for they not only entred fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That done the gates being opened, the <hi>Mitaquer</hi> with great acclamations of joy entred, and causing the <hi>Chineses</hi> colours to be taken down, and his own to be advanced in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he with a new ceremony of rejoycing at the sound of many instruments of war after the the manner of the <hi>Tartars</hi> gave rewards to the wounded, and made divers of the most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of his followers Knights, by putting bracelets of gold about their right arms; and then about noon he with the chief Commanders of his Army, for the greater triumph dined in the Castle, where he also bestowed bracelets of gold upon <hi>Iorge Mendez,</hi> and the other <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi> whom he made to sit down at table with him; After the cloth was taken away, he went out of the Castle with all his company, and then causing all the walls of it to be dismantelled, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Being arrived at his tent, which was richly hung, he sent <hi>Iorge Mendez</hi> a thousand <hi>Taeis</hi> for a reward, and to us but an hundred a piece, whereat some of us, that thought themselves to be better qualified, were very much discontented, for that he was more respected then they, by whose means, as well as his, the enterprise had been so happily atchieved, though by the good success thereof we had all obtained honour and liberty.</p>

            <p>THe next day the <hi>Mitaquer</hi> having nothing more to do where he was, resolved to take his way towards the City of <hi>Pequin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 1</note> before which the King lay, as I have delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; To this effect having put his Army into battel aray, he departed from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nce at eight of the clock in the morning, and marching leasurely to the sound of his warlike instruments, he made his first station about noon upon the bank of a river, whose scituation was very pleasant, being all about invironed with a world of fruit trees, and a many goodly houses, but wholly deserted, and bereaved of all things which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> might any way have made booty of. Having past the greatest heat of the day there, he arose and marched on until about an hour in the night that he took up his lodging at a prety good Town, called <hi>Lantimay,</hi> which likewise we found deserted, for all this whole Country was quite dispeopled for fear of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who spared no kind of person, but wheresoever they came put all to fire and sword, as the next day they did by this place, and many other along this river, which they burnt down to the ground; and that which yet was more lamentable, they set on fire, and clean consumed to ashes a great large plain, being above six leagues about, and full of corn ready to be reaped. This cruelty executed, the Army began again to move, composed as it was of some threescore and five thousand horse, (for as touching the rest they were all slain, as well at the taking of <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çay,</hi> as in that of the Castle of <hi>Nixiamcoo,</hi>) and went on to a mountain, named <hi>Pommitay,</hi> where they remained that night; The next morning dislodging from thence, they marched on somewhat faster then before, that they might arrive by day at the City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> which was distant about seven leagues from that mountain: At three of the clock in the afternoon we came to the river of <hi>Palamxitan,</hi> where a <hi>Tartar</hi> Captain, accompanied with an hundred horse, came to receive us, having waited there two days for that purpose; The first thing that he did, was the delivering of a letter from the King to our General, who received it with a great deal of ceremony; From this river to the Kings quarter, which might be some two leagues, the Army marched without order, as being unable to do otherwise, partly as well in regard of the great concourse of people, wherewith the ways were full incoming to see the Generals ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, as for the great train which the Lords brought along with them, that over-spread all the fields; In this order, or rather disorder, we arrived at the Castle of <hi>Lautir,</hi> which was the first Fort of, nine that the Camp had for the retreat of the Spies, there we found a young Prince, whom the <hi>Tartar</hi> had sent thither to accompany the General, who alighting from his horse, took his Scymitar from his side, and on his knees offered it unto him, after he had kissed the ground five times, being the ceremony or compliment ordinarily used amongst them; The Prince was exceedingly pleased with this honour done unto him, which with a smiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and much acknowledgment of words he testified unto him; This past, the Prince with a new ceremony stept two or three paces back, and lifting up his voice with more gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then before, as he that represented the Person of the King, in whose name he came, said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>He, the border of whose rich vesture my mouth kisseth, and that out of an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble greatness mastereth the Scepters of the earth, and of the Isles of the Sea, sends thee word by me, who am his slave, that thy honourable arrival is no less agreeable unto him, then the Summers sweet morning is to the ground, when as the dew doth comfort and refresh our bodies, and therefore would have thee without further delay to come and hear his voice mounted on his horse, whose trappings are garnished with jewels taken out of his Treasury, to the end, that riding by my side, thou mayest be made equal in honour to the greatest of his Court, and that they which behold thee marching in this sort, may acknowledge that the right hand of him is mighty and valiant unto whom the labours of war giveth this recompence.</hi> Hereupon the Mitaquer prostrating himself on the earth, with his hands lifted up, answered him thus, <hi>Let my head be an hundred times trampled on by the sole of his feet, that all those of my race may be sensible of so great a favour, and that my eldest Son may ever carry it for a mark of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> Then mounting on the horse, which the Prince had given him, trapped with gold and precious stones, being one of those that the King used to ride on himself, they marched on with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50126:85"/>
a great deal of State and Majesty. In this pomp were many spare horses led richly harnessed; there were also a number of Ushers, carrying silver Maces on their shoulders, and six hundred Halberdiers on horsback, together with fifteen Chariots, full of silver Cymbals, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill tuned barbarous instruments, that made so great a din, as it was not possible to hear one another. Moreover in all this distance of way, which was a league and an half, there were so many men on horsback, as one could hardly pass through the croud in any part thereof. The <hi>Mitaquer</hi> being thus in triumph arrived at the first trenches of the Camp, he sent us by one of his Servants to his quarter, where we were very well received, and abundantly furnished with all things necessary for us.</p>
            <p>Fourteen days after we arrived at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his Camp, the <hi>Mitaquer,</hi> our General,<note place="margin">§. 2</note> sent for us to his Tent, where in the presence of some of his Gentlemen, he said unto us; <hi>To morrow morning about this time be you ready, that I may make good my word unto you, which is to let you see the face of him, whom we hold for our Soveraign Lord, a grace that is done you out of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular respect to me; And this his Majesty doth not only grant unto you, but your liberty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, which I have obtained of him for you, and which in truth I am no less glad of, then of the taking of</hi> Mixiancoo, <hi>the particulars whereof you may relate unto him, if you come to be so happy as to be questioned by him about it. Withall I assure you that I shall take it for a great satisfaction, if when you shall return into your Country, you will remember that I have kept my word with you, and that therein I have shewed my self so punctual, as it may be I would not for that consideration demand of the King some other thing more profitable for me, that you may know this was that which I only desired: Also the King hath done me the honour to grant it me presently, and that with such exceeding demonstration of favour, as I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I am thereby more obliged unto you, then you are to me.</hi> Having spoken thus unto as we prostrated our selves upon the ground, and in this sort answered him. <hi>My Lord, the good which you have pleased to do us is so great, that to go about to thank you with words (as the world useth to do) in the state we now are in, would rather be an ingratitude, then a true and due acknowledgment; so that we think it better to pass it by in silence within the secret of that soul which God hath put into us; And therefore since our tongues are of no use to us herein, and that they cannot frame words, capable to satisfie so great an obligation, as this is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all of us stand for ever so infinitely ingaged unto you, we must with continual tears and sighs beg of the Lord which made Heaven and earth, that he will reward you for it; for it is he that out of his infinite mercy and goodness, hath taken upon him to pay that for the poor, which they of themselves are not able to discharge; It is he then, that will throughly recompence you and your children for this good office you have done us, and whereby you merit to have a share in his promises, and to live long and happily in this world.</hi> Amongst those which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the <hi>Mitaquer</hi> at that time, there was one named <hi>Bonquinuda,</hi> a man in years, and of the principalest Lords of the Kingdom, who in this Army commanded over the strangers and <hi>Rhinocerots,</hi> that served for the Guard of the Camp; This same, unto whom more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect was born then to all the rest that were present, had no sooner heard our answer, but lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his eyes to Heaven he said, <hi>O! who could be so happy, as to be able to ask of God the explication of so high a secret, whereunto the weakness of our poor understanding cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive; for I would fain know from whence it comes, that he permits people so for esloigned from the knowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon all that were about him answered, <hi>Your Greatness hath so much reason for it, that we were obliged to behold it as an Article of our faith, wherefore we think it were fit, that these strangers should not be suffered to go out of our Country, where, as our Masters and Doctors, they might teach us such things they know of the world. That which you advise, replyed the</hi> Mitaquer, <hi>is not much amiss, and yet the King would never permit it for all the treasures of</hi> China, <hi>because if he should, he would then violate the truth of his word, and so lose all the reputation of his greatness, wherefore you must excuse me if I do not propound things unto him that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be</hi>; whereupon turning himself towards us, <hi>Go, get you gone,</hi> said he unto us, <hi>and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row morning fail not to be ready for to come again when I shall send for you.</hi> These words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly contented us, as there was great cause they should; and accordingly the next day he sent us nine horses very well furnished, upon which we mounted, and so went to his Tent; He

in the mean time had put himself into a <hi>Piambre</hi> (that is somewhat like to a Litter) drawn with two horses richly harnessed; round about him for his Guard marched threescore Halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, six pages apparelled in his Livery mounted on white Curtals, and we nine on horsback a little more behind.

In this Tent was a low Throne in the form of an Altar, garnished with branched work of fine gold, and over it was a cloth of State, set thick with silver Stars; where also the Sun and Moon were to be seen, as also certain clouds, some of them white, and others of the colour of which appear in the time of rain, all enammelled so to the life, and with such art, that they beguiled all those that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A little more on the one side were two and thirty very fair women, who playing upon divers instruments of musick, made a wonderful sweet Consort. The King was set on his Throne under a rich Cloth of State, and had about him twelve young b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This same was the sister of the <hi>Mitaquer</hi> our General, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beloved of the King, for whose sake therefore it was that he was in such credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation throughout the whole Army: The King was much about forty years of age, full sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, somewhat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Thereupon one of ours speaking for all the rest, answered; That our Country was called <hi>Portugal,</hi> that the King thereof was exceeding rich and mighty, and that from thence to the City of <hi>Pequin</hi> was at the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then he asked why we came not rather by Land, then by Sea, where so
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50126:87"/>
many labours and dangers were to be undergon? Thereunto he replyed, that there was too great an extent of land, through which we were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eeds be so, for men, said he, who have recourse unto their industry and invention to run over the Sea for to get that which God hath not given them, are necessarily carried thereunto, either by extream poverty, or by an excess of blindness and vanity, derived from much covetousness, which is the cause why they renounce God, and those that brought them into the world. This reply of the old man was seconded with many jeering words by the other Courtiers, who made great sport upon this occasion, that very much pleased the King, in the mean time the women fell to their musick again, and so continued, till the King withdrew into another Chamber in the company of these fair Musicians, and that young Lady which fanned him, not so much as one of those great Personages, daring to enter besides: Not long after one of those twelve boys, that carried the Scepters before mentioned, came to the <hi>Mitaquer,</hi> and told him from his sister, that the King commanded him not to depart away, which he held for a singular favour, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son this message was delivered to him in the presence of those Kings and Lords that were in the room, so that he stirred not, but sent us word, that we should go unto out tent with this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that he would take care the Son of the Sun should be mindful of us.</p>

The next morning we parted from this Town, and that night lay at another more nobler, named <hi>Euxcau:</hi> Five days after we continued our voyage down this river, and then we arrived at a great Temple, called <hi>Singuafatur,</hi> where we saw an inclosure of above a league in circuit, in which were builded an hundred, threescore, and four houses, very long and broad, after the fashion of Arcenals, all full up to the very tyles of dead mens heads, whereof there was so great a number, that I am afraid to speak it, for that it will hardly be credited. Without each of these houses were also great piles of the bones of these heads, which were three fathom higher then the ridges of them, so that the house seemed to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no other part of them appearing but the frontispiece where the gate stood; not far from thence upon a little hill on the South-side of them was a kind of a platform, whereunto one went up by certain winding-stairs of iron, and through four several doors; Upon this platform was the tallest, the most deformed, and dreadful Monster that possibly can be imagined, standing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his feet, and leaning against a mighty tower of hewed stone; he was made of cast iron, and of so great and prodigious a stature, that by guess he seemed to be above thirty fathom high, and more then six broad, notwithstanding the which deformity he was exceedingly well proportioned in all his limbs, only his head was somewhat too little for so great a body. This monster held in both his hands a bowl of the same iron, being six and thirty spans about. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding so strange and monstrous a thing, we demanded of the <hi>Tartar</hi> Ambassadour the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereof, who willing to satisfie our curiosity, <hi>If you knew,</hi> answered he, <hi>what the power of this God is, and how needful it is for you to have him to friend, certainly you would think it well imployed if you presented him with all your means, how great soever they might be, and give them to him rather then to your own children; for you must know that this great Saint, which you see there, is the Treasurer of the bones of all those that are born into the world, to the end that at the last day, when men come to be born again he may give to every one the same bones which he had upon earth, for he knows them all, and can tell in particular to what body each of those bones belong: whereupon you are further to understand, that he, who in this life shall be so unadvised as not to honour him, nor present him with something, will be but in an ill case in the other world, for this Saint will then give him some of the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenest bones he can meet withal, and one or two less then he should have, by means whereof he will become deformed, lame, or crooked, and therefore if you will follow my counsel, you shall make your selves of his fraternity, by offering something unto him, and you will find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the good that will redound to you thereof hereafter.</hi> We desired also to know of him what the bowle which this Monster held in his hand, signified, whereunto he answered us, <hi>That he held it to fling it at the head of the gluttonous Serpent, that lived in the profound Obism of the house of smoak, when he should come thither to steal away any of those bones.</hi> After this we enquired of him how this Monster was called, and he told us that his name was, <hi>Pachinavau du beculem Prinaufaque,</hi> and that it was threescore and fourteen thousand years since he was begotten on a Tortois, called <hi>Migama,</hi> by a Sea-horse, that was an hundred and thirty fathom long, named <hi>Tybrem vucam,</hi> who had been King of the Giants of <hi>Fanius</hi>; he

told us likewise many other brutish fooleries and absurdities, which those of that Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as their Creed, and wherewith the Divel precipitates them all into hell; Moreover this Ambassadour assured us, that the gifts which were presented to this Idol, amounted to above two hundred thousand <hi>Taeis</hi> of yearly rent, without comprising therein what came from Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, and other foundations of obits from the principal Lords of the Country, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue whereof was far greater then that of the gifts; For a conclusion he told us, that this same Idol had ordinarily twelve thousand priests attending on his service, who were maintained with m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Continuing our voyage from this <hi>Pagode,</hi> or Monastery of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whereof we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the next day we arrived at a very fair Town, called <hi>Quanginau,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 3</note> which stands on the bank of the river; In this place the Ambassadours stayed three whole dayes for to furnish themselves with certain things they wanted, as also for to see the feastings and joy that was made at that time upon the entry of the <hi>Tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>picor</hi> of <hi>Echuna,</hi> which is their Pope, who was going then unto the King for to comfort him about the ill success he had in <hi>China.</hi> Amongst other graces, which this <hi>Tolapicor</hi> bestowed on the inhabitants of this Town, in recompence of the charge they had been at for his reception, he granted unto them, that they might be all Priests, and administer their sacrifices in what places soever they were, and likewise that they might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore receive the same entertainment and gifts, that were accustomed to be given unto our Priests, without any difference between them and those that upon examination had been promoted to that dignity; Moreover he gave them power to grant Bills of Exchange for Heaven unto all such as should do them good here b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low. To the Ambassador of <hi>Cauchinchina</hi> he granted as a most singular favor, that he might legitimate any that would pay him for it, &amp; also confer on the Lords of the Court titles, and marks of honour, as far forth as if he had been King, whereof the foolish Ambassador was so proud, as setting aside covetousnesse, though it were a vice he was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined unto, he imployed all that ever he had there in gifts upon those Priests, and besides not contented therewith, he for that end borrowed of us the two thousand <hi>Taeis</hi> the King had given us, which aferwards he paid us again with interest after fifteen in the hundred. After these matters the two Ambassadors resolved to continue their voyage, but before their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they went to visit the <hi>Talapicor</hi> in a <hi>Pagode</hi> where he was lodged, for in regard of his greatness, and that he was held for a Saint, he might not abide with any man, but with the King only. Now as soon as he understood of the Ambassadors coming to him he sent them word not to go away that day, because he was to preach at the Church of certain religious women of the Invocation of <hi>Pontimaqueu</hi>; this they took for a great honour, and inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently went to the <hi>Pagode,</hi> where the Sermon was to be: At their arrival they found such a concourse of people, that they were constrained to remove the Pulpit to another very great place, which in less then an hour was invironed with Scaffolds, hung about with silk stuff, whereon the one side were the Ladies, richly apparelled, and on the other the Princess, called <hi>Vanguenarau,</hi> with all the <hi>Menigregues,</hi> or religious women of the <hi>Pagode,</hi> being in number above three hundred. After the <hi>Talapicor</hi> was gone up into the Pulpit, and that he had made an exterior shew of much holiness, ever and anon lifting up his hands and eyes to Heaven, he began his Sermon in this manner, <hi>Like as it is the property of water to clense all things, and of the Sun to warm all creatures, so it is the property of God through a coelestial and divine nature to do good unto all; wherefore we are all bound, as well in general and particular, to imitate this our Lord, who hath created, and doth nourish us, by doing that unto those, who stand in need of the good of this world, as we would that they should do unto us, for that by this work we are more pleasing unto him, then by any other whatsoever. For as the good Father of a Family rejoyceth to see his children made much of, and presents given to them, so our Heavenly Lord, who is the true Father of us all, rejoyceth at such time as with a zeal of charity we communicate one with another; whereby it is evident, that the covetous man,

who shuts his hand, when the poor ask something of him which they want, constrained thereunto by necessity, and that turns him another way without assisting them, shall be treated in the same manner by a just judgment of God, and driven down into the bottom of the sink of the night, where like a frog he shal croke without ceasing, being tormented by the hunger of his covetousness: This being so, I do advise and enjoyn you all, since you have ears to hear me, that you do that which the Law of the Lord obligeth you to do, which is, that you give of that whereof you have too much, to the poor, who have not wherewith to feed themselves, to the end God may not be wanting to you when you shall be at the last gasp of your life: Go to then, let this charity be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and universal in you, that the very fowls of the air may taste of your liberality; And this you ought to do to keep the poor, having need of what you possess in excess, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced by their necessity to rob other men of their goods, whereof you would be no less bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meable, then if you killed an infant in the cradle; I commend also unto your remembrance that which is written in the Book of our truth, touching the good you are bound to do unto the Priests, that pray for you, to the end they may not perish for want of the good you ought to do unto them, which would be as great a sin before God, as if you should cut the throat of a little white heifer when she is sucking of her Dam, by the death of whom a thousand souls would die, which are buried in her as in a golden Tomb, in expectation of the day, which is to accomplish the promise, that was made unto them, wherein they shall be transformed into white pearls for to dance in Heaven, like unto the moats which are in the beams of the Sun.</hi> Having uttered these things, he added many others thereunto, and delivering a world of extravagancies and fooleries, he bestirred himself in such manner, as was a wonder to behold, so that we eight <hi>Portugals</hi> were exceedingly amazed at the extream devotion of these people, and how that in lifting up their hands to Hands to Heaven, they ever and anon repeated this word <hi>Taiximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> that is to say, <hi>So we believe</hi>; In the mean time one of our fellows, named <hi>Vincent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosa,</hi> hearing the auditors so often use that word <hi>Taiximida,</hi> said in imitation of them, <hi>Such may thy life be</hi>; and that with such a grace, and so setled a countenance, not seeming any way to jeer him, that not one in the Assembly could forbear laughing: He in the mean while conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued still firm, and more and more confirmed, seeming even to weep out of an excess of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Now his eyes being always fixed on the <hi>Talapicor,</hi> he whensoever he chanced to look on him could not chuse but do as the rest did, so that upon the conclusion of his Sermon all that heard him fell to laughing out-right: The Prioress her self, and all the <hi>Menigregues</hi> of her Monastery could not contain themselves in their serious humour, imagining that the faces which the <hi>Portugal</hi> made, and his actions, were so many effects of his devotion, and good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; For if one had thought it to be otherwise, and that he had not done it out of derision, no question but he had been so chastised, as he should never have been able to mock again. When the Sermon was ended, the <hi>Talapicor</hi> returned to the <hi>Pagod</hi> where he lodged, being accompanied with the most honourable of all the Assembly, together with the Ambassadours, unto whom all the way as he went he ceased not to commend the devotion of the <hi>Portugal, Look,</hi> said he, <hi>there is not so much as these people, who live like beasts, and without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our truth, but see well enough that there is nothing but what is godly in that I have preached</hi>; whereunto all answered that it was as he said.</p>

which they presently entred; the Prince marched fore-most with the Ambassador of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> whom de held by the hand, and a little behind them went the other belonging to the King, with the Captain of the Guard, then followed all the company by three and three. Having gone through that room, where there was none but certain of the Guard on their knees with Halberds in their hands, we went into another room far more spacious and fair then the former, in the which we saw threescore and four Statues of brass, and nineteen of silver, all tied by the neck with iron chains; At so extraordinary a thing as this being much abashed, we demanded of one of their <hi>Grepes,</hi> or priests, the reason of it, who answered us. That the Statues which we beheld there were the fourscore and three gods of the <hi>Tinocouhos,</hi> whom the King in the late war had taken from them out of a Temple, where they were placed; for, added he, there is nothing in the world held in more esteem, or for a greater honour by the King, then to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the gods of his enemies, which he hath led away captive in despight of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereupon enquiring further of him, why they were set there, he replyed, that it was to have them in a readiness against the time that the King should make his entry in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After we were at the end of this room, where the Idols were, we entred into another very great one, where we saw a number of very fair women, who were set all along, some imployed in curious needle-works, and others singing and playing upon certain instruments of musick, very pleasing to hear. Passing on we arrived at the door of the Kings Chamber, where we found six women, which were as it were porters there, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried silver Maces; In this room was the King, in the company of a few ancient men, and a great number of young women, to the tune of whose musick certain little girls sung very harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously: The King was set on a Throne of eight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>teps high in the manner of an Altar, over the which was a cloth of State supported by pillars, all covered over with gold engraven; near to him were six little children upon their knees with Scepters in their hands, and a little further off stood a woman reasonably well in years, which fanned him ever and anon, and had a great Garland about her neck. This Prince was about some five and thirty years of age, and of a goodly presence: He had full eyes, auborn hair and beard, a grave look, and in all points the countenance of a generous King. As soon as the Ambassadors came into the room they prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves three times on the ground, and at the third time the <hi>Kings</hi> lay still flat all along, whilest the <hi>Tartar</hi> passed on; who being come near to the first step of the Throne where the King sate, he said unto him with so loud a voice as all there present might hear him, <hi>O thou the Prop of all the Forces of the Earth, and the breath of the High God which hath created all things, may the Majestical Being of thy greatness prosper for ever and ever, so that thy Sandals may serve for hairs to the heads of Kings, making thee like to the bones and flesh of the great Prince of the silver mountains, by whose commandment I come to visit thee, as thou mayst perceive by this his Letter sealed with his Royal arms.</hi> When he had made an end of speaking thus, the <hi>Cauchin</hi> beholding him with a smiling countenance, <hi>May the Sun,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered he, <hi>put a conformity between the desires of the King thy Master, and mine, and that by the sweet heat of his amorous rayes, to the end that the great amity, which is betwixt us, may endure and continue firm till the last noise the Sea shall make, that so the Lord may be eternally praised in his peace.</hi> At these words all the Lords that were in the room answered with one voice, <hi>So grant it may be O Lord Almighty, that givest a being to the night and the day.</hi> Then the same women, which played before, beginning their musick again, the King used no further speech, but only in kindly entertaining the Ambassador, <hi>I will,</hi> said he, <hi>read my brother</hi> Xinarau's <hi>Letter, and return an answer thereunto according to thy desire, to the end thou mayst go from me contented.</hi> The Ambassador made him no reply, but prostrated himself again at the foot of the Royal Throne, laying his head three times on the upp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With this good news the Ambassador acquainted us
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50126:92"/>
at his return, and demanded of us for this good office he had done us, that we would write him out some of those prayers which we made to our God, whose slave, he said, he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the King was departed from the City of <hi>Fanaugrem,</hi> he proceeded on in his journy tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling but only six leagues a day, by reason of the great number of persons that he carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him; The first day he dined at a little Town, called <hi>Benau,</hi> where he stayed until the evening, and then went to lodge at a Monastery, named <hi>Pamgatur</hi>; The next morning he departed from thence, and so with not above three thousand horse in his Train, he prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his journy for nine dayes together, passing by many goodly Towns, at least they seemed to be so, without permitting any reception to be made him by any of them; In this manner he arrived at the City of <hi>Lingator,</hi> sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed on a river of fresh water, which for the bredth and deepness of it is frequented with much shipping; There he abode five days, for that he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self somewhat indisposod with the tediousness of the journy: From this place he departed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day, taking no greater company with him then thirty horse, and so withdrawing himself from the communication of so much people, as continually importuned him, he spent most part of the time as he went by the way in hawking and hunting; those of the Countryes by which he past providing game always ready for him. In this sort going on he slept most commonly amidst very thick woods in Tents pitched for him to that purpose. Being arrived at the river of <hi>Baguetor,</hi> he passed down the same in certain vessels, called <hi>Laulees</hi> and <hi>Iangoas,</hi> which were there ready for him, till he came to a Town, named <hi>Natibasoy,</hi> where about evening he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any kind of pomp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The rest of his journy he made by land, so that at the end of thirteen dayes he arrived at <hi>Vzamguee,</hi> where he had a most magnificent reception. At his entry thereinto there marched before him, as it were in triumph, all the spoyls which he had taken in the wars, whereof the principal, and those which he made most reckoning of, were twelve Chariots laden with the Idols, of whom I have spoken heretofore, and whereof the forms were different, as they use to have them in their <hi>Pagod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uch, as to triumph over those idols, that so they may say, <hi>That in despight of their enemies he had made their gods his slaves</hi>; Round about these twelve Chariots went divers Priests by three and three weeping, and bound with iron chains; After them followed forty other Chariots, each of them being drawn by two Rhinocerots, and full from the bottom to the top of an infinite company of Arms, and trayled Colours; In the tayl of them there were twenty more, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each of them a very great Chest, barr'd with iron, and wherein, as we were told, was the treasure of the <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After we had been a full month in this City, during which time we had seen a world of stately shews, sports, and several sorts of rejoycings, accompanied with most costly feasts and banquets, set forth and made not onely by the greater persons, but by the common people also, the <hi>Tartar</hi> Ambassadour, that had brought us thither, moved the King again about our voyage, whereunto he gave us so gracious an ear, that he presently commanded we should be furnished with a Vessel for to carry us to the Coast of <hi>China,</hi> where we hoped to mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>UPon the twelfth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> we departed from the City of <hi>Vzamguee,</hi> exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing at our escape from so many labours and crosses,<note place="margin">§. 1</note> which we before had sustained, and imbarqued our selves upon a river, that was above a league broad, down the which we went seven dayes together, beholding in the mean time on either side thereof many fair Towns, and goodly Boroughs, which by the outward appearance we believed were inhabited by very rich people, in regard of the sumptuousness of the buildings, not only of particular houses, but much more of the Temples, whose steeples were all covered over with gold, as likewise in reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this ill equipage wherein we were we continued our course for three dayes together, at the end whereof we were invironed by so great and impetuous a Tempest, that the same night in which it seized us we lost the Coast, and because the violence of the Storm would never suffer us after to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it again, we were forced to make with full Sail towards the Islands of the <hi>Lequios,</hi> where the Pirate, with whom we went, was well known, both to the King, and those of the Country; with this resolution we set our selves to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This saying of the Pirate seemed so reasonable to the <hi>Nautaquim,</hi> that he presently came abord of us, and because those of his Train were very many, he commanded that none but such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

That done he took his leave of us, and the <hi>Necoda,</hi> little regarding the rest, saying, <hi>Come and see me at my house to morrow, and for a present bring me an ample relation of the strange things of that great world through which you have travelled, as also of the Countries that you have seen, and withall remember to tell me how they are called, for I swear unto you that I would far more willingly buy this commodity then any that you can sell me.</hi> This said, he returned to Land, and the next morning as soon as it was day he sent us to our Junck a great <hi>Parao,</hi> full of divers sorts of refreshments, as Reasons, Pears, Melons, and other kinds of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he <hi>Necoda</hi> having agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a price for his commodities, it was resolved that the next day they should be transported from the Junck unto a certain house, which was appointed for the <hi>Necoda</hi> and his people to remain in till such time as he should set sail for <hi>China:</hi> After all this was concluded, the <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taquim</hi> fell again to questioning of us about many several matters, whereunto we rendred him such answers as might rather fit his humour, then agree with the truth indeed, which yet we did not observe but in some certain demands that he made us, where we thought it necessary to make use of certain particulars altogether fained by us, that so we might not derogate from the great opinion he had conceived of our Country. The first thing he propounded was, how he had learned from the <hi>Chineses</hi> and <hi>Lequios,</hi> that <hi>Portugal</hi> was far richer, and of a larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, then the whole Empire of <hi>China,</hi> which we confirmed unto him. The second, how he had likewise been assured, that our King had upon the Sea conquered the greatest part of the world, which also we averred to be so; The third, that our King was so rich in gold and silver, as it was held for most certain, that he had above two thouand houses full of it even to the very tops; but thereunto we answered, that we could not truly say the number of the houses, because the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> was so spacious, so abounding with treasure, and so populous, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it was impossible to specifie the same. So after the <hi>Nautaquim</hi> had entertained us above two hours with such and the like discourse, he turned him to those of his Train, and said, <hi>Assuredly not one of those Kings, which at this present we know to be on the earth, is to be esteemed happy, if he be not the vassal of so great a Monarch as the Emperour of this people here.</hi> Whereupon having dismissed the <hi>Necoda</hi> and his Company, he intreated us to passe that night on shore with him, for to satisfie the extream desire that he had to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from us of many things of the world, whereunto he was exceedingly carried by his own inclination; withall he told us, that the next day he would assigne us a lodging next to his own Pallace, which wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There we left the vessel in which we came, and so went by land directly to the City, where being arrived about noon, the <hi>Fingeandono,</hi> because it was not a time fit to wait upon the King, went to his own house. After dinner having rested a little, and shifted himself into a better habit, he mounted on horsback, and with certain of his friends rode to the Court, carrying me along with him, where the King was no sooner advertised of his coming, but he sent a Son of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine or ten years of age to receive him, who accompanied with a number of Noble-men, richly apparelled, and his Ushers with their Maces going before him, took the <hi>Fingeandono</hi> by the hand, and beholding him with a smiling countenance; <hi>May thy entrance,</hi> said he unto him, <hi>into this house of the King my Lord, bring thee as much content and honour as thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren deserve, and are worthy, being thine, to sit at table with me in the solemn Feasts.</hi> At these words the <hi>Fingeandono</hi> prostrating himself on the ground; <hi>My Lord,</hi> answered he, <hi>I most humbly beseech them that are in Heaven above, which have taught thee to be so cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and so good, either to answer for me, or to give me a tongue so voluble, as may express my thankfulness in terms agreeable to thy ears for the great honour thou art pleased to do me at this present, for in doing otherwise I should offend no less, then those ingratefull wretches, which inhabit the lowest pit of the profound and obscure house of smoak:</hi> This said, he offered to kiss the Curtelass which the young Prince wore by his side, which he would by no means permit, but taking him by the hand, he led him to the King his Father, unto whom, lying sick in his bed, he delivered a letter from the <hi>Nautaquim,</hi> which after he had read, he commanded him to call me in from the next room where I staid attending, which instantly he did, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented me to the King, who entertaining me very graciously. <hi>Thy arrival,</hi> said he unto me, <hi>in this my Country is no less pleasing to me, then the rain which falls from Heaven is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our fields that are sowed with Rice.</hi> Finding my self somewhat perplexed with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of these terms, and this manner of salutation, I made him no answer for the instant, which made the King say to the Lords that were about him, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All the Assistants made such account of this mad answer of mine, as clapping their hands by way of astonishment, they said unto the King, Mark I beseech your Highness how he speaks to purpose; verily it seems that this man is not a Merchant, which meddles with base things as buying and selling, but rather a <hi>Bonzo,</hi> that offers sacrifices for the people, or if not so, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is some great Captain that hath a long time scoured the Seas. Truly, said the King, I am of the same opinion, now that I see him so resolute; but let every man be silent, because I purpose that none shall speak to him but my self alone, for I assure you that I take so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in hearing him talk, that at this instant I feel no pain.

               <hi>I pree thee,</hi> said he unto me, <hi>be not unwilling to stay here by me, for it does me much good to look on thee, and talk with thee; thou shalt also oblige me to let me know whether in thy Country, which is at the further end of the world, thou hast not learn'd any remedy for this disease wherewith I am tormented, or for the lack of appetite, which hath continued with me now almost these two months without eating any thing to speak of.</hi> Hereunto I answered, that I made no profession of physick, for that I had never learnt that art, but that in the Junck, wherein I came from <hi>China,</hi> there was a certain wood, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused in water healed far greater sicknesses then that whereof he complained, and that if he took of it, it would assuredly help him; To hear of this he was very glad, insomuch that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with an extream desire to be healed, he sent away for it in all haste to <hi>Tanixumaa,</hi> where the Junck lay, and having used of it thirty dayes together, he perfectly recovered of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, which had held him so for two years together, as he was not able to stir from one place to another. Now during the time that I remained with much content in this City of <hi>Fuchea,</hi> being some twenty dayes, I wanted not occasions to entertain my self withall; for sometimes I was imployed in answering the questions, which the King, Queen, Princes, and Lords asked of me, wherein I easily satisfied them, for that the matters they demanded of me, were of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little consequence. Other-whiles I bestowed my selfe in beholding their Solemnities, the Temples, where they offered up their prayers, their warlike Exercises, their naval Fleets, as also their fishing and hunting, wherein they greatly delight, especially in the high flying of Falcons, and Vultures. Oftentimes I past away the time with my <hi>Harquebuse</hi> in killing of Turtles, and Quailes, whereof there is great abundance in the Country. In the mean season this new manner of shooting seemed no less marvellous and strange to the inhabitants of this Land, then to them of <hi>Tanixumaa,</hi> so that beholding a thing which they had n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now because he was that day to dine with his Father, the matter was referred to the afternoon, howbeit then too there was nothing done, for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the King: The next day this young Prince came with only two young Gentlemen waiting on him to my lodging, where finding me asleep on a Mat, and my <hi>Harquebuse</hi> hanging on a hook by, he would not wake me till he had shot off a couple of charges, intending, as he told me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ving then commanded one of the young Gentlemen, that attended him, to go softly and kindle the Match, he took down the <hi>Harquebuse</hi> from the place where it hung, and going to charge it, as he had seen me do, not knowing how much powder he should put in, he charged the Piece almost two spans deep, then putting in the bullet, he set himself with it to shoot at an Orange tree that was not far off, but fire being given, it was his ill hap that the <hi>Harquebuse</hi> brake into three pieces, and gave him two hurts, by one of the which his right hand thumb was in a manner lost, instantly whereupon the Prince fell down as one dead, which the two Gentlemen perceiving, they ran away towards the Court, crying along in the streets that the strangers <hi>Harquebuse</hi> had killed the Prince; At these sad news the people flocked in all haste with weapons and great cries to the house where I was; Now God knows whether I was not a little amazed when coming to awake I saw this tumult, as also the young Prince lying along upon the floor by me weltring in his own blood without stirring either hand or foot; All that I could do then was to imbrace him in my arms, so besides my self, as I knew not where I was. In the mean time, behold the King comes in a Chair carried upon four mens shoulders, and so sad and pale, as he seemed more dead then alive; after him followed the Queen on foot leaning upon two Ladies, with her two daughters, and a many of women all weeping. As soon as they were entred into the Chamber, and beheld the young Prince extended on the ground, as if he had been dead, imbraced in my arms, and both of us wallowing in blood, they all concluded that I had killed him, so that two of the Company drawing out their Scymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, would have slain me; which the King perceiving, <hi>Stay, stay,</hi> cried he, <hi>let us know first how the matter goes, for I fear it comes further off, and that this fellow here hath been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by some of those Traitors kinred, whom I caused to be last executed.</hi> Thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the two young Gentlemen to be called which had accompanied the Prince, his Son, thither, he questioned them very exactly; Their answer was, that my <hi>Harquebuse</hi> with the inchantments in it had killed him: This deposition served but to incense the Assistants the more, who in a rage addressing themselves to the King; What need, Sir, have you to hear more, cried they? here is but too much, let him be put to a cruel death: Therewith they sent in all hast for the <hi>Iarabuca,</hi> who was my Interpreter, to them; now for that upon the arrival of this disaster he was out of extream fear fled away, they brought him straightly bound to the King, but before they fell to examining of him, they mightily threatned him, in case he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the truth; whereunto he answered trembling, and with tears in his eyes, that he would reveal all that he knew. In the mean time being on my knees, with my hands bound, a <hi>Bonzo,</hi> that was President of their Justice, having his arms bared up to his shoulders, and a Poynard in his hand dipped in the blood of the young Prince, said thus unto me, <hi>I conjure thee, thou Son of some Divel, and culpable of the same crime, for which they are damned that inhabit in the house of smoak, where they lye buried in the obscure and deep pit of the Center of the earth, that thou confess unto me with a voice so loud, that every one may hear thee, for what cause thou hast with these sorceries and inchantments killed this young innocent, whom we hold for the hairs, and principal ornament of our heads.</hi> To this demand I knew not what to answer upon the suddain, for that I was so far besides my self, as if one had taken away my life, I believe I should not have felt it; which the President perceiving, and beholding me with a terrible countenance, <hi>Seest thou not,</hi> continued he, <hi>that if thou doest not answer to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions I ask thee, that thou mayst hold thy self for condemned to a death of blood, of fire, of water, and of the blasts of the wind; for thou shalt be dismembred into the air, like the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of dead fowl, which the wind carries from one place to another, separated from the body with which they were joyned whilest they lived.</hi> This said, he gave me a great kick with his foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To these speeches of the <hi>Bonzoes</hi> the King replyed, that he thought they had reason for that they said, and therefore he desired them to let him know how he should govern himself in this extremity; You must, said they, stay the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Bonzo Teix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This counsel being approved of the King, he came again to me, and making very much of me, he promised me mighty matters if I could recover his Son; I answered him with tears in my eyes, that by the help of God I would do it, and that he himself should be witness of my care therein: So recommending my self to God, and taking a good heart unto me, for I saw there was no other way to save my life, but that, I prepared all things necessary to perform the cure. Now because the hurt of the right hand thumb was most dangerous, I begun with that, and give it seven stitches, whereas peradventure if a Chirurgion had drest him, he would have given it fewer; as for that of the forehead, I gave it but four, in regard it was much slighter then the other; that done, I applyed to them tow wet in the whites of eggs, and so bound them up very close, as I had seen others done in the <hi>Indiaes:</hi> Five days after I cut the stitches, and continued dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him as before, until that at the end of twenty days it plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

After things were past in this manner, being advertised by letters from my two Companions at <hi>Tanixumaa,</hi> that the <hi>Chinese</hi> Pirate, with whom we came thither, was preparing for his return to <hi>China,</hi> I besought the King of <hi>Bungo</hi> to give me leave to go back, which he readily granted me, and with much acknowledgement of the curing of his Son he willed a Funce to be made ready for me, furnished with all things necessary, wherein commanded a man of quality, that was attended by twenty of the Kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, with whom I departed one <hi>Saturday</hi> morning from the City of <hi>Fucheo,</hi> and the <hi>Friday</hi> following about Sun-set I arrived at <hi>Tanixumaa,</hi> where I found my two Comrades, who received me with much joy. Here we continued fifteen days longer, till such time as the Junck was quite ready, and then we set Sail for <hi>Liampoo,</hi> which is a Sea-port of the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> whereof I have spoken at large heretofore, and where at that time the <hi>Portugals</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Having continued our voyage with a prosperous wind, it pleased God that we arrived safe at our desired Port, where it is not to be believed how much we were welcome by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the place. Now because it seemed strange unto them, that we had voluntarily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted our selves in that sort to the bad faith of the <hi>Chineses,</hi> they asked of us from what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try we came, and where it was that we imbarqued our selves with them? whereupon we freely declared unto them the truth of all, and gave them an account of our Voyage, as also of the new Land of <hi>Iapon</hi> that we had discovered, the great abundance of silver that was there, and the exceeding profit that might be made by carrying the commodities of <hi>China</hi> thither; wherewith they were wonderfully contented, and instantly ordained a general Procession to be made by way of thanksgiving unto God for so great a blessing: But withall covetousness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in such sort to seize upon the hearts of most of the Inhabitants, every one striving to be the foremost in this voyage, as they came to divide themselves into troops, and to make several parties, so that even with weapons in their hands they went thronging to buy up the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of that Country, which made the <hi>Chinese</hi> Merchants, upon the sight of our unruly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, set so high a price upon their wares, that whereas a <hi>Pico</hi> of silk was at first not worth forty <hi>Taeis,</hi> it rose before the end of eight dayes to an hundred and threescore, at which rate too the Merchants seemed to part with it very willingly. Thus by the means of this unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble desire of gain nine Juncks, which were then in the Port, were in fifteen days ready to set Sail, though to say the truth they were all in such disorder, and so unprovided, that some amongst them had no other Pilots then the Masters themselves, who had but little underst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this bad order they departed all in company together one <hi>Sunday</hi> morning, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that they had the wind, the season, the sea, and all things else contrary, not suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves to be guided by reason, or the consideration of the dangers which they are subject unto that commit themselves to this Element; For they were so obstinate and so blinded as they would not represent any inconvenience to themselves, and I my self was so infortunate,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50126:98"/>
that I went along with them in one of their Vessels. In this manner they sailed all that same day as it were groping between the Islands and the firm Land, but about midnight there arose in the dark so mighty a Storm, accompanied with such horrible rain, that suffering themselves to be carried at the mercy of the wind, they ran upon the Sands of <hi>Gotom,</hi> whereof the nine Juncks two only, as it were by miracle, were saved, so that the other seven were lost out of which not so much as one man escaped. This loss was thought to amount unto above three hundred thousand Crowns in commodities, besides the greater, which was of six hundred persons that left their lives there, whereof there were an hundred and forty <hi>Portugals,</hi> all rich men, and of quality. As for the other two Juncks in one of the which by good hap I was, joyning in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>all overwhelmed fourteen persons, whereof five were <hi>Portugals,</hi> which were all crushed in pieces, a spectacle so lamentable to behold that it exceedingly grieved every mans heart. Now forasmuch as the Storm increased more and more, we were constrained to let our selves be carried at the mercy of the Sea even until Sun-set, at which time the Junck made an end of splitting quite asunder, whereupon our Captain and every one of us, seeing the deplorable estate whereunto our sins had reduced us, fell to preparing our selves for our last end.

The next day the King was advertised, as well of our imprisonment, as of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we continued very near two months with much pain, never hearing in all that time so much as any word spoken of that first proceeding against us.

Howbeit though this was closely carried, yet was it our good fortune to be advertised of it the day before his coming to us, so that we had time enough to arm our selves outwardly with all the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of misery and affliction we could possibly devise, and counterfeit; which expedient next to Gods assistance stood us in more stead then any other we could have thought upon. This man then came one morning well accompanied to the prison, and after he had viewed us all one after another, he called to him the <hi>Iurabaca,</hi> who served to interpret for him; <hi>Ask these men,</hi> said he, <hi>what is the cause that the mighty hand of God hath so abandoned them, as to permit their lives through an effect of his Divine Iustice to be subjected to the judgement of men, without having so much remorse of conscience, as to set before their eyes the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his bounty wherein all our hope was placed, to the end he would be pleased to inspire the Kings heart with a will to do as justice according to our works, for that we were poor stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers destitute of all favour, a thing whereof men make most account in this wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To these, and other like questions, which this Spie asked of us, we returned him such answers, as was most behoofull for us to give him, wherewith he was so contented, that making us many offers, he promised to move the King for our deliverance. In the mean time he spake not a word to us of the occasion for which he was sent, but still fained himself to be a stranger, and a Merchant like one of us. Howbeit when he went away, he carefully recommended us to the Jaylour, and willed him not to let us want any thing, promising to satisfie him for it to his content; In acknowledgment whereof we gave him many humble thanks with tears in our eyes, whereby he was greatly moved to compassion, so that he gave us a Bracelet of gold, that weighed thirty Duckats, and also six sacks of Rice, and withall desired us to excuse h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m for the smalness of the present he had given us. After this he returned back to the King, unto whom he rendred an account of all that had past with us, assuring him that we were not such as the <hi>Chineses</hi> had made him to believe, and offered for proof thereof to pawn his life an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, if need were, which was the cause that the King abated much of the suspicion wherewithall they had inveighed him about our manner of lying. But as he was resolving to give order for our enlargement, as well upon the report of this man, as in regard of the letter which the <hi>Broquen</hi> had written him, there arrived at the Port a <hi>Chinese</hi> Pyrat with four Juncks, unto whom the King gave his Country for a place of Retreat, upon condition that he should share with him the moity of the booty which he should take, by means whereof he was in great favour with the King, and all them of the Country. Now forasmuch as our sins would have it, that this Pyrate was one of the greatest enemies the <hi>Portugals</hi> had at that time, by reason of a fight that we had had with him a little before in the Port of <hi>Lamau,</hi> where <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Madam,</hi> answered she, <hi>that which your Majesty sayes, is very true, and I assure my self that it will seem no less strange in your ears, then it was to me to see my Neece arrive here lately with so much sorrow and grief, that I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to express it in words.</hi> The Queen having then commanded her to call her in, she presently fetched her; The first thing that this young Gentlewoman did, was to prostrate her self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Queen, who was in her bed, and so told her weeping the occasion that brought her thither, and therewithall presented her with the letter, which the Queen commanded her to read, as accordingly she did; and it is said the Queen was so moved with compassion at it, that not induring to have her make an end of reading it, she said many times unto her with tears in her eyes; <hi>Enough, enough, I will hear no more of it at this time, and since the business stands in the terms you speak of, God, and the Soul of the King my Husband, for whose sake all these Ladies beg this boon of me, forbid, that these poor wretches should lose their lives so unjustly: The false reports which the</hi> Chineses <hi>have made of them, together with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series they have indured at Sea, may serve them in stead of great punishments; Wherefore rely upon me for your request, and in the mean space withdraw your selves til to morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betimes, when we will go all three to the King my Son before it be day, and then you shall read this letter to him, as you have read it to me, that being incited to pity he may make no difficulty to grant us that which we demand of him with so much reason.</hi> This resolution taken, the Queen was no sooner up the next day, but carrying along with her only her chief Lady, and the Gentlewoman her Neece, she past through a Gallery to the Chamber of the King her Son, whom she found still in bed, and having rendred him an account of the occasion of her coming, she commanded the Gentlewoman to read the letter, as also to tell by word of mouth all that had happened in that affair, which the Gentlewoman performed very exactly, but not without mingling her tears with those of her Aunts, as we knew afterwards: In the mean time the King looking on his Mother, <hi>Madam,</hi> answered he unto her, <hi>I must needs confess, that I dream'd this night how I saw my self before a very angry Iudge, who carying his hand three times to his face, as if he had threatned me, I promise thee, said he unto me, that if the blood of these strangers doth cry unto me for vengeance, thou and thine shall satisfie my justice, which makes me believe, that assuredly this vision comes from God, for whose sake I will do this alms to his praise, giving them both life and liberty, that so they may go where they will, and moreover I will cause a vessel to be provided for them, furnished with all things they shall need, all at mine own charge.</hi> The Queen gave th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All which things have at first sight seemed unto me most worthy to be punished in justice according to the Laws of my Kingdom; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I sent their Proces to the principal officers of my Crown, who all with one common consent swore unto me that these strangers deserved not only one, but many death<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this manner we departed from <hi>Pungor</hi> the capital City of the Island of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quios,</hi> of which I will here make a brief relation, to the end that if it shall one day please God to inspire the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation, principally for the exaltation and increase of the Catholick faith, and next for the great benefit that may redound thereof, to undertake the Conquest of this Island, they may know where first to begin, as also the commodities of it, and the easiness of this Conquest. We must understand then that this Island of <hi>Lequios,</hi> scituated in nine and twenty degrees, is two hundred leagues in circuit, threescore in length, and thirty in bredth. The Country is almost like that of <hi>Iapon,</hi> saving that it is a little more mountainous in certain parts, but in the middle it is plainer and more fertile. It is rendred very agreeable by many large Plains, that are watred with divers rivers of fresh water, and from whence are gathered great provisions, especially of Rice and Wheat. It hath Mountains out of which is drawn such quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of copper, as in regard of the abundance thereof it is so common among those people, that whole Ships are laden with it from thence in way of traffique to all the Ports of <hi>China, Lamau, Sumbor, Chabaquea, Tosa, Miacoo,</hi> and <hi>Iapon,</hi> as likewise to all the other Islands on the South-side thereof, as those of <hi>Sesirau, Goto, Fucanxi,</hi> and <hi>Pollem:</hi> Moreover in all this Country of the <hi>Lequios,</hi> there is also great store of iron, steel, lead, tin, allum, salt-peeter, brimstone, hony, wax, sugar, and ginger, far better then that which comes from the <hi>Indiaes.</hi> It hath withall a world of Angelin-wood, Chestnuts, Trees, Oak, and Cedar, wherewith thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Ships may be made. On the East-side it hath five very great Islands, where many Mynes of Silver are found, as also Pearls, Amber, Frankincense, Silk, Ebony, Brasil, and a great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of a certain wood fit for Carpentry, called <hi>Poytan</hi>; It is true that there is not such store of Silk there, as in <hi>China.</hi> The Inhabitants of all this Country do as the <hi>Chineses</hi> cloth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, with Linnen, Cotten, Silk, and a kind of Damask-stuff, which comes to them from <hi>Nanquin</hi>; They are great eaters, very much addicted to the delights of the flesh, little inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to arms, and altogether unfurnished of them; which induceth me to believe that they might be easily conquered, and the rather for that in the year, a thousand, five hundred, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A little further to the Northward of this Island of <hi>Lequio,</hi> there is a great Archipelago of small I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slands, from whence is drawn a great quantity of silver, which in my opinion, &amp; by what I gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of a petition which <hi>Ray Lopez de Vilhalobos</hi> General of the <hi>Castillians</hi> presented to <hi>Iorge de Castro,</hi> at that time Captain of <hi>Ternate,</hi> should be those whereof the Inhabitants

had some knowledge, and which they called the Islands of Silver; and yet I cannot see with what reason that may be, because both by what I have observed, and read, as well in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> as other Geographers, not any one of them hath pierced into the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> and the Island of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> only our Cosmographers, since the time of <hi>Alphonso d' Albuquerque</hi> have passed a little further, and treated of the <hi>Selebres, Pasuaas, Mindanaus, Champas,</hi> as also of <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>Iapon,</hi> but not of the <hi>Lequios,</hi> or other <hi>Archipelagoes,</hi> which are to be discovered within the vast extent of that Sea. From this brief relation which I have made of the Island of <hi>Lequios,</hi> may be inferred, both out of what I have heard and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will not speak further of other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities of this Island, which I might here insert, for that I hold this sufficient to awaken the courages of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and incite them to an Enterprise, of so much service for our King, and profit for themselves.</p>

In the third place he sent me upon another important occasion, namely to give advice to the Ships of <hi>Bengala,</hi> that they should come all carefully in consort together, left their negligence in their Navigation should be the cause of some distaster. This voyage then I undertook very unwillingly, and parted from <hi>Malaca</hi> upon a <hi>Wednesday,</hi> the ninth day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the year, one thousand, five hundred, forty and five; being under Sail I continued my course with a good wind to <hi>Pullo Pracelar,</hi> where the Pilot was a little retarded by means of the Shelves, which cross all that Channel of the firm Land, even unto the Island of <hi>Sume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>; When we were got forth with much labour we passed on to the Islands of <hi>Pullo Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billam,</hi> where I put my self into a <hi>Manchua,</hi> which I had very well equipped, and sayling in it the space of twelve days, I observed, according to the order <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> had given me for it, all the Coast of that Country of <hi>Malaya,</hi> which unto <hi>Iuncalan</hi> contains an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty leagues, entring by all the Rivers of <hi>Bartuhaas, Salangor, Panaagim, Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But so dreadful to behold, in this place we found above a dozen bodies of men digged out of the earth, and some nine or ten others half eaten. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing much amazed at this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, we withdrew a little aside by reason of the great stanch, which proceeded from these dead bodies. Hereupon the <hi>Sarrazin</hi> told me, that he thought we should do well to advertise his father of this, to the end we might instantly surround this Island all about for to see whether we could discover any vessels with Pirats; for, said he, there may be some lye hidden behind yonder poynt, whereby we may very well run the hazard of our lives, as it hath often befallen other ships, where m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This advice of the <hi>Sarrazin</hi> seemed so good unto me, that we presently returned back unto the Rode, where he gave an account to his father of that we had seen. Now for that the <hi>Necoda</hi> was a very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man, and scalded (as one may say) with the like inconveniences, he straight way gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to have the Island surrounded, then causing the women, children, and linnen, although it were but half washed, to be imbarqued, he himself being followed by forty men, armed with Harquebuses and Lances, went directly to the place where we had discovered those bodies, and viewing them one after another, with stopping our noses by reason of the st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nch, which was insupportable, he was so moved to compassion, that he commanded the Marriners to dig a great pit for to bury them in; But as they were about to render them this last duty, and looking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them again, there was found upon some of them little daggers garnished with gold, and on others bracelets: Whereupon the <hi>Necoda,</hi> understanding well this mystery, wished me with all speed to dispatch away the roving vessel that I had to the Captain of <hi>Malaca,</hi> for that, as he assured me, those dead men, which they saw there, were <hi>Achems,</hi> who had been defeated near to <hi>Tanauçarim,</hi> whither their Armies ordinarily retired because of the war which they had with the King of <hi>Siam.</hi> The reason he alledged to us for this was, that those which we saw there lying dead, having golden bracelets about them, were Captains of <hi>Achem,</hi> who had caused themselves to be buried without permitting them to be taken away, and that he would lose his head if it were not so. For a greater proof whereof, he further added, that he would make some more of them to be dis-enterred, as incontinently he did, and having digged some seven and thirty of them out of the earth, there was found about them sixteen bracelets of gold, twelve very rich daggers, and many jewels, so that thinking of no other but hunting, we got a booty worth above a thousand Duckats, which the <hi>Necoda</hi> had, besides what was concealed; but the truth is, this was not altogether to our advantage, for the most part of our men became sick with the extream stench of those bodies. At the very instant I dispatched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the towing vessel that we had to <hi>Malaca,</hi> and advertised <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> of the whole success of our voyage; Withall I certified him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what course we had held, as also into what Ports, and into what Rivers we had entred, without hearing any other news of his enemies, then that it was suspected they had been at <hi>Tanauçarim,</hi> where by the appearances of those dead bodies, it was to be believed that they had been defeated, whereunto I added for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, that if I could light on any more assured news concerning them, I would presently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with it, in what part soever I were.</p>

Whereupon the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coda</hi> prayed me to come up, which incontinently I did, though at that time I was shut up in my Cabbin below somewhat indisposed in my health; when I was on the deck I called to them that were in the <hi>Parao,</hi> who had no sooner seen me, and known me to be a <hi>Portugal,</hi> but they gave a great shout, and clapping their hands for joy they came abord our Junck. Then one of them, who by his countenance seemed to have more Authority then the rest, began to say unto me; <hi>Signior, Before I crave leave of thee to speak, I desire thee to read this Letter, to the end it may induce thee the more readily to believe that which I am to say unto thee.</hi> Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of an old filthy clout he took a Letter, wherein after I had opened it, I found this written: <hi>Signiors Portugals, which are true Christians, this honourable man, that shall shew you this Letter, is King of this Island, newly converted to the Faith, and called</hi> Dom Lancerote; <hi>He hath rendred many good Offices, not only to them, who have subscribed this writing, but to us also that have navigated on these Coasts: For he hath given us very important adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements of the treasons, which the</hi> Achems <hi>and</hi> Turks <hi>have plotted against us, so that by the means of this honest man we have discovered all their designes: withall God hath made use of him for to give us not long since a great victory against them, wherein we have taken from them one Gally, four Galliots, and five Foists, with the death of above a thousand</hi> Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razins. <hi>Wherefore we intreat you, by the wounds of our Lord Iesus Christ, and by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his holy passion, not only to keep him from all wrong, but to assist him with all your power, as the manner is of all good</hi> Portugals, <hi>that it may serve for an example to those which shall know this, to do the like in imitation of you; And so we kiss your hands this thirteenth day of</hi> November, 1544.

As soon as we had discovered them we gave fire to the Faulcon and Bases, discharging withall twenty Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuses, whereupon the Theeves betook themselves presently to flight, being in great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and most of them hurt; We pursued them then so close, that we overtook them on the top of a little hill, where they were defeated in the space of two <hi>credoes,</hi> not one of them escaping with life save only three, whom we spared for that they said they were Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. That done, we went to a Village, where there were not above twenty poor low Cabbins, covered with straw, in it we found some threescore and four women, with a many of little children, who no sooner perceived us, but all of them with tears fell a cryed out, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, Christian, Iesus, Iesus.</hi> At these words being fully perswaded that they were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, I desired the <hi>Necoda</hi> that he would cause his son to retire, and not suffer any of them to be killed because they were not Gentiles, which he presently yielded unto, and yet for all that he could not keep the Cabbins from sacking, though in them all there was not found the value of five Duckets. For the people of this Island are so poor, that scarce one of them is worth a groat; they feed on nothing but a little fish, which they take with angling, and eat it broiled on the coals without salt, yet are they so vain and presumptuous, that not one almost amongst them but terms himself a King of some vile piece of ground, whereon there is little more then one poor Cabbin; besides, neither the men nor the women have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to cover their nakedness. After the slaughter of the rebellious <hi>Sarrazin</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and the re-establishment of the poor Christian King, putting him in possession of his wife and children, whom his Enemy had made slaves, together with above threescore and three Christian Souls, we ordeined a kind of Church amongst them, for the instruction of those that were newly converted; And then returning to our Junck, we presently set sail, and continued our course towards <hi>Tanauçarim,</hi> where I was perswaded I should find <hi>Lancerote Guerreyra,</hi> and his companions, for to treat with them about the business, whereof I have formerly spoken: But for as much as in the Letter, which the petty King shewed me, the <hi>Portugals</hi> made mention of a Victory which God had given them against the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Achems</hi> of this Coast, I hold it not amiss to relate here how that hapned, as well for the content the Reader may take therein, as to shew that there is no enterprize which valiant Soldiers at a need may not bring to pass, in regard whereof it imports much to cherish, and make esteem of them. For eight months and more our hundred <hi>Portugals</hi> had scoured up and down this Coast in four well rig'd Foists, wherewith they had taken three and twenty rich Ships, and many other lesser Vessels, so that they which used to sail in those parts were so terrified with the sole name of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> as they quitted their
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50126:104"/>
Commerce without making any further use of their shipping: By this surcease of Trade the Custom-houses of the Ports of <hi>Tanauçarim, Iunçalan, Merguim, Vagaruu,</hi> and <hi>Tavay,</hi> fell much in their Revenue, in so much that those people were constrained to give notice of it to the Emperor of <hi>Sornan,</hi> King of <hi>Siam,</hi> and soveraign Lord of all that Country, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to give a remedy to this mischief, whereof every one complained. Instantly whereupon, being then at the City of <hi>Odiaa,</hi> he sent with all speed to the Frontire of <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now for that the King held this <hi>Turk</hi> for invincible, and made more account of him then of all others, he commanded him from the place where he was, with three hundred <hi>Ianizaries</hi> that he had with him, and giving him a great sum of mony he made him General of all the Coast of this Sea, to the end he might free those people from our incursions, withall he promised to make him Duke of <hi>Banchaa,</hi> which is an estate of great extent, if he could bring him the heads of four <hi>Portugal</hi> Captains. This proud <hi>Turk,</hi> becomming more insolent by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and promises which the King made him posted presently away to <hi>Tanauçarim,</hi> where being arrived he rigged forth a Fleet of ten Sails for to fight with us, being so confident of vanquishing us, as in answer of certain Letters, which the <hi>Sornau</hi> had written unto him from <hi>Odiaa,</hi> these words was found in one of them. <hi>From the time that my head was esloigned from the feet of your Highness for to execute this small enterprize, wherein it seems you are pleased I should serve you, I continued my Voyage till at the end of nine days I arrived at</hi> Tanaucarim, <hi>where I presently provided my self of such Vessels as were necessary for me, and indeed would have had but only two, for I hold it most infallible that those would suffice to chase away these petty Thieves; howbeit not to disobey the Commission, which</hi> Combracalon <hi>the Governor of the Empire hath given me under your great Seal, I have made ready the great Gally, as also the four little ones, and the five Foists, with which I purpose to set forth with all speed; For I fear left these Dogs should have news of my coming, and that for my sins God should be so much their friend, as to give them leasure to fly, which would be so great a grief unto me, that the very imagination thereof might be my death, or through an excess of despair render me like unto them; but I hope that the Prophet</hi> Mahomet, <hi>of whose Law I have made profession from mine infancy, will not permit that it should so happen for my sins.</hi> This <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin Mahomet</hi> being arrived at <hi>Tanauçarim,</hi> as I have delivered before, presently made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy his Fleet, which was composed of five Foists, four Galliots, and one Gally Royal: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these Vessels he imbarqued eight hundred <hi>Mahometans,</hi> men of combat (besides the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners.) amongst the which were three hundred <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> as for the rest they were <hi>Turks, Greeks, Malabares, Achems,</hi> and <hi>Mogores,</hi> all choyce men, and so disciplined, that their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain held the Victory already for most assured; Assisted with these Forces he parted from the Port of <hi>Tanauçarim</hi> for to go in the quest of our men, who at that time were in this Island of <hi>Pul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now during those levies of men of War, this petty King going to the Town for to sell some dryed fish there, as soon as he perceived what was intended against us, he left all his Commodities behind him, and in all haste returned to this Island of his; where finding our men in great security, as little dreaming of that which was in hand against us, he related it all unto them, whereat they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained so much amazed, as the importance of the matter did require; In so much that the same night and the next day having well caulked their Vessels which they had drawn ashore, they lanched them into the Sea, after they had imbarqued their provisions, their water, their artillery, and ammunition. So falling to their oars, with a purpose (as I have heard them say since) to get to <hi>Bengala,</hi> or to <hi>Racan,</hi> for that they durst not withstand so great an Army; but as they were unresolved thereupon, and divided in opinion, behold they saw all the ten Sails appearing together, and behind them five great Ships of <hi>Guzarates,</hi> whose Masters had given <hi>Heredrin Mahomet</hi> thirty thousand Duckets for to secure them against our <hi>Portugals.</hi> The sight of these fifteen Sails put our men into a very great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and because they were not able at that time to make to Sea for that the wind was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they put themselves into a Creek, which was on the South side of the Island, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronned
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50126:105"/>
by a Down, or Hill, where they resolved to attend what God would send them: In the mean time the five <hi>Guzarat</hi> Ships shewed themselves with full sails at Sea, and the ten Sails<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with oars went directly to the Island, where they arrived about Sun-set. Presently thereupon the <hi>Turkish</hi> Captain sent out Spies to the Ports, where he was advertised that they had been, and entered by little and little into the mouth of the Haven, that so he might render himself more assured of the prize which he pretended to make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with hope that as soon as it was day he should take them all, and so bound hand and foot present them to the <hi>Sornau</hi> of <hi>Siam,</hi> who in recompence thereof had promised him the State of <hi>Banchaa,</hi> as I have said before. The <hi>Manchua,</hi> which had been at the Port to spy them out, returned to the Fleet about two hours within night, and told <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheless being come again to himself he gave order, like a good Captain, to all that was necessary. First of all then he sent the four Galliots in quest of them to an Island, called <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>basoy,</hi> distant from that of <hi>Pulho Hinhor</hi> about seven leagues, for he was perswaded that our men were retired thither, because this was a better Harbor then that of the Island from whence they were gone. As for the five Foists he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them into three, whereof he sent two to another Island, named <hi>Sambilan,</hi> and other two to those which were nearest to the firm Land, for that all these places were very proper to shelter one in; As for the filth Foist, in regard she was fleeter then the rest, he sent her along with the four Galliots, that she might before it was day bring him news of that which should happen, with promise of great reward for the same; but during these things our men, who had always a watchful eye, seeing the <hi>Turk</hi> had rid himself of his greatest Forces, and that there was no more remaining with him but the Gally wherein he was, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to fight with him, and so sallying out of the Creek, where they had shrouded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they rowed directly to her. Now in regard it was past midnight, and that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had but weak Sentinels, for that they thought themselves most secure, and never dreamt of any body lying in wait to attaque them there, our four Foists had the opportunity to board her all together, and threescore of their lustiest men leaping suddenly into her, in less then a quarter of an hour, and before the Enemies knew where they were for to make use of their Arms, they killed above fourscore <hi>Turks,</hi> as for the rest they cast themselves all into the Sea, not one man remaining alive: The dog <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They assured me since, that in this Gally in so short a time, what by water, and the sword, above three hundred <hi>Mahometans</hi> lost their lives, whereof the most part were <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi> of the Gold Chain, which among the <hi>Turks</hi> is a mark of honor. Our <hi>Portugals</hi> having past the rest of the night with much contentment, and always keeping good watch, it pleased God that the next morning the two Foists arrived from the Island whither they had been sent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who altogether ignorant of that which had past, came carelesly doubling the point of the Haven, where the Gally lay, so that the four Foists made themselves Masters of them in a little space, and with the loss of but a few men. After so good a success they fell diligently to work in fortifying the Gally and the two Foists, which they had taken, and then flanked the South-side of the Island with five great Pieces of Ordnance to defend the entry into the Haven. Now about evening the other two Foists arrived, making to Land with the same indiscretion as the others, and although they had much ado to reach them, yet were they constrained at length to render themselves, with the loss only of two <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals.</hi> Hereupon our men resolved to attend the four Galliots that remained, and which had been sent to the next Island, but the next day so great a wind arose from the North, that two of them were cast away upon the Coast, not one that was in them escaping. As for the other two about evening they discovered them very much in disorder, destitute of oars, and separated above three leagues the one from the other; But at last about Sun-set one of them came to the Port, and ran the same fortune as the former, without saving any one of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razins</hi> lives. The next morning an hour before day, the wind being very calm, our men discovered the other Galliot, which for want of oars was not able to recover the Port, in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50126:105"/>
regard whereof our men resolved to go and fetch her in, as accordingly they did, and coming somewhat near her with two Cannon shot, they killed the most part of them that were in her, and so bording her took her very easily; Now because all her men were either slain, or hurt, they drew her to land by force of other Boats; so that of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>en Sail of this Fleet, our men had the Gally, two Galliots, and four Foysts; as for the other two Galliots, they were cast away on the Isle of <hi>Taubasoy,</hi> as I have delivered before, and touching the fift Foyst, no news could be heard of her, which made it credible that she also suffered shipwrack, or that the wind had cast her upon some of the other Islands. This glorious victory, which it pleased God to give us, was obtained in the month of <hi>September,</hi> one thousand, five hundred, forty and four, on <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Eve, which rendred the name of the <hi>Portugals</hi> so famous through all those Coasts, that for three years after there was nothing else spoken of, so that the <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bainhaa,</hi> King of <hi>Martabano</hi> hearing of it, sent presently to seek them out, and promised them great advantages if they would succour him against the King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> who at that time was making preparation in his City of <hi>Pegu,</hi> for to go and besiege <hi>Martabano,</hi> with an Army of seven hundred thousand men.</p>

This counsel seeming good unto me, I went presently to land with the <hi>Portugals</hi> to wait on <hi>Ioano Cayeyro,</hi> to whom I was exceeding w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then I shewed <hi>Ioano Cayeyro</hi> my Letters, and the Order that <hi>Pedro de Faria</hi> had given me; Moreover I treated with him about the affair that led me thither: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I observed that he was very instant with the Captains, to whom I was addrest, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him that they were ready to serve the King in all occasions that should be presented, howbeit since the Letter of <hi>Pedro de Faria,</hi> Governour of <hi>Malaca,</hi> was grounded on the fear that he was in of the Army of the <hi>Achems,</hi> composed of an hundred and thirty Sayl, whereof <hi>Bijaya Sora</hi> King of <hi>Pedir,</hi> was General, and it having fallen out, that his Admiral had been defeated at <hi>Tarnasery</hi> by those of the Country, with the loss of seventy <hi>Lanchares,</hi> and six thousand men, it was not needful they should stir for that occasion; for according to what they had seen with their own eyes, the Forces of that enemy were so mightily weakned, as they did not think he could in ten years space recover again the loss he had sustained. To this they added many other reasons, which made them all to agree, that it was not necessary they should go to <hi>Malaca.</hi> After these things I desired <hi>Ioano Cayeyro</hi> to make me a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With this resolution I stayed there with <hi>Ioano Cayeyro,</hi> in

continual expectation to be gone when the Season should serve for the Junck to depart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with him at this Siege the space of six and forty days, which was the chief time of the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> his abode there, of whom I will say something here in a few words, because I conceive the curious would be well content to know what success the <hi>Chaubainhaa,</hi> King of <hi>Martabano,</hi> had in this war. This Siege had lasted now six months and thirteen dayes, in which space the City had been assaulted five times in plain-day, but the besieged defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves always very valiantly, and like men of great courage: Howbeit in regard they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly consumed with length of time, and the success of war, and that no succour came to them from any part, their enemies were without comparison far more in number then they, in such sort as the <hi>Chaubainhaa</hi> found himself so destitute of men, as it was thought he had not above five thousand souldiers left in the City, the hundred and thirty thousand which were said to be there at the beginning of the Siege, being consumed by Famine, or the Sword, by reason whereof the Councel assembling for to deliberate what was to be done thereupon, it was resolved that the King should sound his enemy by his Interest, which he presently put in execution: For that effect he sent to tell him, that if he would raise the Siege he would give him thirty thousand Bisses of silver, which is in value a million of gold, and would become his Tributary at threescore thousand Duckets by the year. The answer made by the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> hereunto was, that he could accept of no conditions from him, if he did not first yield himself to his mercy. The second time he propounded unto him, that if he would suffer him to depart away with two ships, in one of the which should be his Treasure, and in the other his Wife and Children, that then he would deliver him the City, and all that was in it. But the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> would hearken no more to that then the former. The third Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he made him was this, That he should retire with his Army to <hi>Tagalaa,</hi> some six leagues off, that so he might have liberty to go away freely with all his, and thereupon he would deliver him the City, and the Kingdom, together with all the Treasure belonging to the King his Predecessour, or that in lieu thereof he would give him three millions of gold: But he also refused this last offer, insomuch that the <hi>Chaubainhaa</hi> utterly dispairing of ever making his peace with so cruel an enemy, began to meditate with himself what means he might use to save himself from him; Having long thought upon it he found no better an expedient then therein to serve himself of the succour of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> for he was perswaded that by their means he might escape the present danger. He sent then secretly to tell <hi>Ioano Cayeyro,</hi> that if he would imbarque himself in the night in his four ships, and take him in, with his wife, and children, and so save them, he would give him half his treasure. In this affair he very closely imployed a certain <hi>Portugal,</hi> named <hi>Paulo de Seixas,</hi> born in the Town of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidos,</hi> who at that time was with him in the City; This same having disguised himself in a <hi>Pegu</hi> habit, that he might not be known, stole one night to <hi>Cayeyro's</hi> Tent, and delivered him a Letter from the <hi>Chaubainhaa,</hi> wherein this was contained: <hi>Valiant and faithful Commander of the</hi> Portugals, <hi>through the Grace of the great King of the other end of the world, the strong and mighty Lion, dreadfully roaring, with a Crown of Majesty in the House of the Sun, I the unhappy</hi> Chaubainhaa, <hi>heretofore a Prince, but now no longer so, finding my self besieged in this wretched and infortunate City, do give thee to understand by the words pronounced out of my mouth, with an assurance no less faithful then true, that I now render my self the Vassel of the great King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>Soveraign Lord of me, and my children, with an acknowledgement of homage, and such tribute as he at his pleasure shall impose on me: wherefore I require thee on his behalf, that as soon as</hi> Paulo Seixas <hi>shall present this my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto thee, thou come speedily with thy Ships to the Bulwark of the</hi> Chappel-key, <hi>where thou shalt find me ready attending thee, and then without taking further counsel, I will deliver my self up to thy mercy, with all the treasures that I have in gold, and precious stones, whereof I will most willingly give the one half to the King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>upon condition that he shall permit me with the remainder to leavy in his Kingdom, or in the Fortresses which he hath in the</hi> Indiaes, <hi>two thousand</hi> Portugals, <hi>to whom I will give extraordinary great pay that by their means I may be re-established in this State, which now I am constrained to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon; since my ill fortune will have it so. As for that which concerns thee, and thy men, I do promise them by the faith of my verity, that in case they do help to save me, I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide my treasure so liberally among them, that all of them shall be very well satisfied and contented; And for that, time will not suffer me to enlarge any further</hi>; Paulo de Seixas, <hi>by whom I send this unto thee, shall assure thee both of that which he hath seen, and of the rest

which I have communicated unto him. Ioano Cayeyro</hi> had no sooner received this Letter, but he presently caused the chief of his followers secretly to assemble together in Councel. Having shewed them the Letter, he represented unto them how important and profitable it would be for the service of God and the King to accept of the offer, which the <hi>Chaubain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haa</hi> had made them; Whereupon causing an Oath to be given to <hi>Paulo de Seixas,</hi> he willed him freely to declare all his knowledg of the matter, and whether it were true that the <hi>Chaubainhaa</hi> his Treasure was so great, as it was reported to be. Thereunto he answered by the Oath that he had taken, That he knew not certainly how great his Treasure was, but that he was well assured how he had often seen with his own eyes, an house in form of a Church, and of a reasonable bigness, all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ull up to the very tyles of bars and wedges of Gold, which might very well lade two great Ships: He further said, That he had moreover seen six and twenty Chests bound about with strong cords, wherein according to the <hi>Chaubain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haa</hi> his own report was the Treasure of the deceased <hi>Bresaguean</hi> King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> which said Treasure containing an hundred and thirty thousand Bisses, and every Biss in value five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Duckets, made up all together the sum of threescore Millions of Gold: He said also, That he knew not certainly the number of the wedges of Gold which he had seen in the Temple of the God of Thunder, but he was most assured notwithstanding that they would fully lade four good Vessels: And for a conclusion he told them, That the same <hi>Chaubain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haa</hi> had shewed him the golden Image of <hi>Quiay Frigau,</hi> which was taken at <hi>Degum,</hi> all full of such rich and resplendent stones, as it was thought the like again were not in the whole world; So that this Declaration which this man made upon Oath astonished them so that heard it, as they could not possibly beleeve it to be true. Howbeit after they had sent him out of the Tent, they entered into consultation about this affair, wherein nothing was resolved, of which I verily beleeve our sins were the cause, for there were in this Assembly as many different opinions, as <hi>Babel</hi> had diversities of Languages, which proceeded especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the envy of six or seven men there present, who would needs perswade the rest, that if this affair should happen to have such success, as was hoped for, <hi>Ioano Cayeyro</hi> (unto whom they all bore no good will) would go then into <hi>Portugal</hi> with so much honor and reputation, as it would be a small matter for the King to make him an Earl, or a Marquis, or at least recompence him with the Government of the <hi>Indiaes</hi>; so that after these Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Devil had alledged many reasons wherefore it might not be done, which I think was but the mask of their weakness and ill nature, though it may be they did it out of the fear they were in of losing both their goods and lives if this matter should come to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi>; howsoever they would not agree to accept of this offer, but contrariwise they threatened <hi>Ioano Cayeyro,</hi> that if he desisted not from his purpose, which was to comply with the <hi>Chaubainhaa,</hi> they would disclose it to the <hi>Bramaa,</hi> so that <hi>Cayeyro</hi> was constrained to abandon this business, lest if he should persist therein the <hi>Portugals</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves would discover him, as they threatened to do, without either fear of God, or regard of men.</p>

And would it had pleased him, who raigns in the beauty of these stars, that you had merited before him the doing me this good office, which only for my sins you have refused me, for in so doing you had by my means augmented his Law, and I been saved in the promises of his truth.</hi> Thereupon sending away <hi>Paulo de Seixas,</hi> with a

            <p>ABout one of the clock in the afternoon a Cannon was shot off, which was the Signal for the instant opening of the gates of the City,<note place="margin">§. 1</note> whereupon first of all issued out the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whom the King had sent thither for the guard of it, being four thousand <hi>Siams</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maas,</hi> all Harquebusiers, Halberdiers, and Pikemen, with above three hundred armed Elephants; all which were commanded by a <hi>Bramaa,</hi> Uncle to the King, named <hi>Monpocasser, Bainba</hi> of the City of <hi>Melietay</hi>; Ten or eleven paces after this Guard of Elephants marched divers Princes, and great Lords, whom the King had sent to receive the <hi>Chaubainhaa,</hi> all mounted on Elephants, richly harnessed, with Chairs upon their backs, plated over with gold, and Collars of precious stones about their necks; Then followed at some eight or nine paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance the <hi>Rolim</hi> of <hi>Monnay,</hi> Soveraign <hi>Talapoy</hi> of all the Priests of the Kingdom, and held in the reputation of a Saint, who went alone with the <hi>Chaubainhaa,</hi> as a Mediatour between the King and him; immediately after them came in a close Chair, carried upon mens shoulders, <hi>Nhay Canatoo,</hi> the daughter of the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> from whom this <hi>Bramaa</hi> had taken his Kingdom, and wife to the <hi>Chaubainhaa,</hi> having with her four small children, namely, two boyes, and two girls, whereof the eldest was not seven years old; round about her and them went some thirty or forty young women of noble extraction, and wonderful fair, with cast down looks, and tears in their eyes, leaning upon other women: After them marched in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der certain <hi>Talagrepos,</hi> which are amongst them as the <hi>Capuchins</hi> with us, who bare-foot and bare-headed went along praying, holding beads in their hands, and ever and anon comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Ladies the best they could, and casting water in their faces for to bring them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves again, when as they fainted, which they did very often; A spectacle so lamentable, as it was not possible to behold it without shedding of tears: This desolate Company was attended by another Guard of Foot, and five hundred <hi>Bramaas</hi> on Horse-back. The <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bainhaa</hi> was mounted on a little Elephant, in signe of poverty and contempt of the world, conformable to the Religion which he intended to enter into, being simply apparelled in a long Cassock of black velvet, as a mark of his mourning, having his beard, head, and eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows shaven, with an old cord about his neck, so to render himself to the King; In this Equipage he appeared so sad and afflicted, that one could not forbear weeping to behold him; As for his age, he was about some threescore and two yeers old, tall of Stature, with a grave and severe look, and the countenance of a generous Prince. As soon as he was arrived at a place, which was near to the gate of the City, where a great throng of women, children, and old men waited for him, when they saw him in so deplorable an estate, they all made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times one after another so loud and dreadful a cry, as if Heaven and earth would have come together. Now these lamentations and complaints were presently seconded with such terrible blows, that they gave themselves without pity on their faces with stones, as they were most of them all of a gore blood; In the mean time things so horrible to behold, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to hear, so much afflicted all the Assistants, that the very <hi>Bramaas</hi> of the Guard, though men of war, and consequently but little inclined to compassion, being also enemies to the <hi>Chaubainhaa,</hi> could not forbear weeping. It was likewise in this place, where <hi>Nhay Caua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too,</hi> and all the other Ladies that attended on her, fainted twice, by reason whereof they were fain to let the <hi>Chaubainhaa</hi> alight from his Elephant for to go and comfort her; whereupon seeing her lying upon the ground in a swoon with her four children in her arms, he kneeled down on both his knees, and looking up to Heaven with his eyes full of tears. <hi>O mighty Power of God,</hi> cryed he, <hi>who is able to comprehend the righteous judgements of thy divine Iustice, in that thou, having no regard to the innocency of these little creatures, givest way to thy wrath, which passeth far beyond the reach of our weak capacities! but remember; O Lord, who thou art, and not what I am:</hi> This said, he fell with his face on the ground, near to the Queen his wife, which caused all the Assembly, who were without number, to make another such loud and horrible cry, as my words are not able to express it; The <hi>Chaubainhaa</hi> then took water in his mouth, and spurted it on his wife, by which means he brought her to her self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so taking her up in his arms, he fell a comforting her with speeches so full of zeal and devotion, as any one that heard him would have taken him rather for a Christian, then a

               <hi>Gentile.</hi> After he had employed about half an hours time therein, and that they had remounted him on his Elephant, they proceeded on their way in the same orderas they held before, and as soon as the <hi>Chaubainhaa</hi> was out of the City gate, and came to the streets which was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the several Companies of the strangers, ranked in two Files, he by chance cast his eye on that side, where the seven hundred <hi>Portugals</hi> were, all of them in their best clothes, with their buffe-coats, great feathers in their Caps, and their Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> you gone,</hi> said he, <hi>and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, for such wicked men as you are do not deserve to stand on any ground that bears fruit, and I pray God to pardon him which hath put it in the Kings head that you can be any ways profitable unto him; It were fitter for you therefore to shave away your beards that you may not deceive the world as you do, and we will have women in your places that shall serve us for our money.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Bramaas</hi> of the Guard, being incensed against us, drove us away from thence with a great deal of shame and contumely. And truly, not to lye, never was I so sensible of any thing as this in respect of the honour of my Country-men. After this, the <hi>Chaubainhaa</hi> went on till he came to the Tent of the King, who attended him with a Royal Pomp: for he was accompanied with a great number of Lords, amongst the which there were fifteen <hi>Bainhaas,</hi> who are as Dukes with us, and of six or seven others, that were of greater dignity then they: As soon as the <hi>Chaubainhaa</hi> came near him, he threw himself at his feet, and so prostrated on the ground he lay there a good while, as it were in a swoon, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

spoil of it; howbeit he took not that care, and used such diligence for the consideration he sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke of, but onely that he might preserve the <hi>Chaubainhaas</hi> treasure, to which effect he spent two whole days in conveighing it away, it being so great that a thousand men were for that space altogether imployed therein; At the end of these two days the King went very early in the morning to an hill, called <hi>Beidao,</hi> distant from his quarters some two or three flight shoot, and then caused the Captains that were at the Guard of the gates to leave them, and retire away; whereupon the miserable City of <hi>Martabono</hi> was delivered to the mercy of the Souldiers, who at the shooting off of a Cannon, which was the signal thereof, entred presently into it pell-mell, and so thronging together, that at the entring into the gates, it is said above three hundred were stifled, for as there was there an infinite company of men of War of different Nations, the most of them without King, without Law, and without the fear and knowledge of God, they went all to the Spoile with closed eyes, and therein shewed themselves so cruel minded, that the thing they made least reckoning of was to kill an hundred men for a crown; And truly the disorder was such in the City, as the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was fain to go thither six or seven times in Person for to appease it. The Sack of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty endured three days and an half, with so much avarice and cruelty of these barbarous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it was wholly pillaged, without any thing left that might give an eye-cause to covet it. That done, the King with a new ceremony of Proclamations caused the <hi>Chaubainhaas</hi> Pallaces, together with thirty or forty very fair rich Houses of his principal Lords, and all the <hi>Pagods</hi> and Temples of the City to be demolished, so that according to the opinion of many, it was thought that the loss of those magnificent Edifices amounted to above ten millions of gold: wherewith not yet contented he commanded all the buildings of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that were still a foot, to be set on fire, which by the violence of the wind kindled in such manner, as in that onely night there remained nothing unburnt, yea the very Walls, Towers, and Bulwarks were consumed even to the foundations. The number of them that were killed in this Sack was threescore thousand persons, nor was that of the prisoners much less. There were an hundred and forty thousand houses, and seventeen hundred Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples burnt, wherein also were consumed threescore thousand Statues, or Idols of divers mettals, during this Siege they of the City had eaten three thousand Elephants. There was found in this City six thousand pieces of Artillery, what of brass and iron, an hundred thousand Quintals of Pepper, and as much of Sanders, Benjamin, Lacre, Lignum Aloes, Camphire, Silk, and many other kinds of rich Merchandise, but above all an infinite number of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which were come thither from the <hi>Indiaes</hi> in above an hundred vessels of <hi>Cambaya, Achem, Melinda, Ceilam,</hi> and of all the Streight of <hi>Mecqua,</hi> of the <hi>Lequios,</hi> and of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> As for the gold, silver, precious stones, and jewels, that were found there, one knows not truly what they were, for those things are ordinarily concealed; wherefore it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice me to say, that so much as the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> had for certain of the <hi>Chaubainhaas</hi> Treasure, amounted to an hundred Millions of gold, whereof, as I have said before, our King lost the Moitie, as well for our sins, as through the malice and envy of wicked dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions. The next day after the City was pillaged, demolished, and burnt, there was seen in the morning upon the hill where the King was, one and twenty pair of Gallows, twenty of the which were of an equal height, and the other a little lower erected on pillars of stone, and guarded by an hundred <hi>Bramaa</hi> Horsmen; There were also round about the place very large Trenches, where a great many Banners spotted with drops of bloods were planted. As this Novelty promised somewhat which no man had heard of before, six of us <hi>Portugals</hi> ran thither to learn what the matter might be, and as we were going along we heard a great noise made by the men of War from the Camp, whereupon we saw come out of the Kings Quarter a number of Horsmen, who with Lances in their hands prepared a great Street, and cried out aloud; <hi>Let no man upon pain of death appear in Armes, nor utter that with his mouth which he thinks in his heart.</hi> A pretty way off from these Horse was the <hi>Xemimbrum,</hi> with an hundred armed Elephants, and a good many Foot; after them went fifteen hundred <hi>Bramaas</hi> on Horsback, cast into four Orders of Files, each of them six in a rank, whereof the <hi>Talanagybras,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Tangu,</hi> was Commander: Then marched the <hi>Chauseroo Siam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> with three thousand <hi>Siammes,</hi> armed with Harquebuses and Lances, all in one Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: In the midst of these was an hundred and twenty women tyed and bound four and four together, and accompanied with <hi>Talagrepos,</hi> men of great Austerity, and are such as the <hi>Capachins</hi> amongst us, who laboured all they might to comfort them in this last act of life;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50126:110"/>
Behind them were twelve Ushers with Maces, that went before <hi>Nhay Canatoo,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> from whom this <hi>Bramaa</hi> Tyrant had usurped his Kingdom, and wife to the <hi>Chaubainhaa,</hi> with four children of hers, which were carried by so many Horsmen: all these sufferers were the wives or daughters of the principal Commanders that the <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bainhaa</hi> had with him in the City, upon whom in the way of a strange revenge this <hi>Bramaa</hi> Tyrant desired to wreak his spight, and the hatred that he had alwayes born unto women. The most of these poor wretches were between seventeen and five and twenty years of age, all of them very white and fair, with bright auborn hair, but so weak in body, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they fell down in a swoon, out of which certain women upon whom they leaned, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured still to bring them again, presenting them Comfits, and other such things fit for that purpose, but they would take none of them, for that they were, as I have said, so feeble and benummed, as they could scarce hear what the <hi>Talegr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pes</hi> spake unto them, only they now and then lifted up their hands to Heaven. After this Princess marched threescore <hi>Grepos,</hi> in two Files, praying with their looks fixed on the ground, and their eyes watered with tears, saying ever and anon in a doleful tone; <hi>Thou which holdest thy Being of none but thy self, so justifie our works, that they may be agreeable to thy Iustice.</hi> Whereunto others an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered weeping; <hi>Grant, Lord, that it may be so, that through our fault we lose not the rich gifts of thy promises.</hi> After these <hi>Grepos</hi> followed a procession of three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred little children, quite naked from the Girdle-sted downwards, having in their hands great white wax lights, and cords about their necks; These, like the others, with a sad and lamentable voice, which moved every one to compassion, uttered these words: <hi>We most humbly beseech thee, O Lord, to give ear unto our cries and groans, and shew mercy to these thy Captives, that with a full rejoycing they may have a part of the graces and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of thy rich treasures</hi>; and much more they said to that purpose in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>avour of these poor sufferers: Behind this Procession was another Guard of Footmen, all <hi>Bramaas,</hi> and armed with Lances, Arrows, and some Harquebuses. As for the Rear-ward, it consisted of an hundred Elephants, like to them that marched first of all, so that the number of the men of War that assisted at this Execution, as well for the Guard, as for the Pomp thereof, was ten thousand Foot, and two thousand Horse, besides the two hundred Elephants, and a world of other people, both Strangers and Natives, that came thither to behold the end of so mournful and lamentable and action.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THese poor sufferers having been led in the order before mentioned clean through the Camp, they came at last to the place of Execution,<note place="margin">§ 1.</note> where the six Ushers with a loud voyce made this Proclamation: <hi>Let all manner of people see and observe the bloody justice, which is here to be done by the living God, Lord of all truth, and our King the Soveraign of our Heads, who of his absolute power doth command that these hundred and forty Women be put to death, and thrown into the ayr, for that by their counsel and incitement their Fathers and Husbands stood out against us in this City, and at times killed twelve thousand</hi> Bramaas <hi>of the Kingdom of</hi> Tangu. Then at the ringing of a Bell all the Officers and Ministers of Justice pel-mell together with the guards, made such a cry, as was most dreadful to hear; wherupon the cruel Hangmen being ready to put the sentence of Death in execution, those poor wretches embraced one another, and shedding abundance of tears they addressed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to <hi>Nhay Canatoo,</hi> who lay at that time almost dead in the lap of an old Lady, and with their last complements one of them spake for all the rest unto her in this manner; <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lady, that art as a crown of Roses upon our Heads, now that we thy humble servants are entering into those mournful Mansions where Death doth reside, comfort us we beseech thee with thy dear sight, that so we may with less grief quit these bodies full of anguish for to present our selves before that Almighty just Iudg, of whom we will for ever implore his justice for a perpetual vengeance of the wrong that is done us.</hi> Then <hi>Nhay Canatoo</hi> beholding them with a countenance more dead then alive, answered them with a feeble voyce, that could scarce be heard, <hi>Go not away so soon, my Sisters, but help me to sustain these little children.</hi> That said, she leaned down again on the bosom of that Lady, without speaking a word more, whereupon the Ministers of the Arm of Vengeance, so they term the Hangmen, layd hold on those poor women, and hanged them up all by the feet, with their heads down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, upon twenty Gibbets, namely seven on each one: now so painful a death as this was, made them give strange and fearful groanes and sobs, until at length the blood stifled them all in less then an hour. In the mean time <hi>Nhay Canatoo</hi> was conducted by the four women, upon whom she leaned, directly to the Gallows whereon she and her four chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were to be hanged, and there the <hi>Rolim</hi> of <hi>Mounay,</hi> who was held amongst them for a holy man, used some speeches unto her for to encourage her the better to suffer death, whereupon she desired them to give her a little water, which being brought unto her, she filled he mouth with it, and so spurted it upon her four children, whom she held in her arms; then having kissed them many times, she said unto them weeping, <hi>O my Children, my Children, whom I have conceived anew within the interior of my Soul, how happy would I think my self if I might redeem your lives with the loss of mine own a thousand times over if it were possible! for in regard of the fear and anguish wherein I see you at this present, and wherein every one sees me also, I should receive Death with as good an heart from the hand of this cruel Enemy, as I willingly desire to see my self in the presence of the Soveraign Lord of all things, within the repose of his celestial Habitation.</hi> Then turning her to the Hangman, who was going to bind her two little boys, <hi>Good Friend,</hi> said she, <hi>be not I pray thee so voyd of pity, as to make me see my children dye, for in so doing thou wouldst com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a great sin; wherefore put me first to death, and refuse me not this boon which I crave of thee for Gods sake.</hi> After she had thus spoken she took her children again in her arms, and kissing them over and over in giving them her last farewell, she yielded up the ghost in the Ladies lap upon whom she leaned, not so much as once stirring ever after, which the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man perceiving, ran presently unto her and hanged her as he had done the rest, together with her four little children, two of each side of her, and she in the middle. At this cruel and pitiful spectacle there arose from amongst all this people so great and hideous a cry, that the Earth seemed to tremble under the feet of them that stood upon it, and withall there followed such a Mutiny throughout the whole Camp, as the King was constrained to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50126:111"/>
fortifie himself in his quarter with six thousand <hi>Bramaa</hi> Horse, and thirty thousand Foot, and yet for all that be thought not himself secure enough from it, had not the night come, which onely was able to calm the furious motions of these men of war; For of seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand which were in the Camp, six hundred thousand were by Nation <hi>Pegu's,</hi> whose King was the Father of this Queen, that was thus put to death; but this Tyrant of <hi>Bramaa</hi> had so disarmed and subjected them, as they durst not so much as quich upon any occasion. Behold in what an infamous manner <hi>Nhay Canatoo</hi> finished her days, a Princess every way accomplished, wife to the <hi>Chaubainhaa</hi> King of <hi>Martabano,</hi> and the daughter of the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> Emperor of nine Kingdoms, whose yearly Revenue amounted unto three millions of Gold. As for the infortunate King her Husband, he was the same night cast into the River with a great stone tyed about his neck, together with fifty or threescore of his chiefest Lords, who were either the Fathers, Husbands or Brothers of those hundred and forty Ladies, that were most unjustly put to such an ignominious death, amongst the which there were three, whom this King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> had demanded in marriage at such time as he was but a simple Earl, but not one of their Fathers would condescend unto it, whereby one may see how great the revolutions of time and fortune are.</p>

As for the rest, they were put into a

Now because for the most part I knew not what I spake, but talked like a desperate man, I happened three or four times to say, that for to rob me of my goods I had all these false accusations put upon me, but that Captain <hi>Ioano Cayeyro,</hi> who was at <hi>Pegu,</hi> would ere it were long acquaint the King with this cruel usage of me, which was the cause of saving my life; for even as this wicked Governor was going to have the sentence executed, which was given against me, some of his friends counselled him to forbear, saying, that if he put me to death, no doubt but that all the <hi>Portugals,</hi> which were at <hi>Pegu,</hi> would complain of him to the King, and tell him, that for to rob me of an hundred thousand duckets, which I had there in Commodities, appertaining to the Captain of <hi>Malaca,</hi> he had most unjustly taken away my life: And that this being so, the King would demand an account of him of all those Commodities, or of the Mony for them, and that if he rendered him even all that he had taken from me, yet would not that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him, imagining still there was somewhat more, whereby he would so put himself out of the good grace of the King, as he would never recover it again, which would be the cause of the utter overthrown both of himself and his children, besides the dishonor that would redound to him over and above. This dog the Governor <hi>Bainbaa Chaque,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lest that should come to pass which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now seeing that hitherto I have discoursed of the success of my Voyage to <hi>Martabano,</hi> and of the benefit that redounded to me by my going thither for the service of the King, which was no other then the loss of my goods, and the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment of my person; before I engage my self further in these relations, I am resolved to intreat of the divers Fortunes, which I ran in that Kingdom for the space of two years and an half that I travelled therein, being the time of my Captivity, as also of the several Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

this King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> was departed from the City of <hi>Martabano,</hi> as I have related before, he journeyed so long that at length he came to <hi>Pegu,</hi> where, before he dismissed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, he caused a Muster to be made of his Army, and found that of seven hundred thousand men, which he had carryed along with him to the besieging of the <hi>Chaubainhaa,</hi> there was fourscore and six thousand of them wanting: And for as much as he had about that time some inckling how the King of <hi>Avaa,</hi> confederated with the <hi>Savadis</hi> and <hi>Chaleus,</hi> would give entry unto the <hi>Sianmon</hi> (whose Country borders on the West and Northwest side on the <hi>Calaminban,</hi> Emperor of the indomptable Forces of the Elephants of the Earth, as I will shew hereafter when I speak of him) to the end he might win from this <hi>Bramaa</hi> the chiefest strengths of his Kingdom, he like a good Captain as he was, and very cunning in matter of War, before he passed on further, caused men to be levyed, with whom, as also with all other necessary things he furnished those principal Fortresses from whence his greatest fear proceeded. Then having resolved to go and besiege the City of <hi>Prom,</hi> he retained the Army, which he had already a foot, and made new and great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations throughout the Kingdom, using such diligence therein, as in six months time he had got together the number of nine hundred thousand men, whom he imba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From this place following on their way through a great River of fresh water, called <hi>Picau Malacou,</hi> which was above a league broad, at length upon the thirteenth of <hi>April</hi> they came within view of <hi>Prom.</hi> There, by some whom they took that night, they learned, that the King was dead, and how he had left for his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor to the Kingdom a son of his of thirteen years of age, whom the King his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed had marryed to his wives sister, the Aunt of the said young Prince, and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King of <hi>Avaa.</hi> This young King was no sooner advertised of the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> his coming to besiege him in his City of <hi>Prom,</hi> but he sent presently away to the King his Father-in-law for succor, which he instantly granted, and to that end speedily raised an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of 30000 <hi>Mons, Tarces,</hi> and <hi>Chalems,</hi> choyce men and trained up in the Wars, of whom he made a son of his, and brother to the Queen, General.

To which purpose, having landed his Army in a plain, called <hi>Mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavotau,</hi> some two leagues below the City, he continued there five days in making ready such preparations as were needful; Having given order for all things, he caused his Army to march one morning before day directly to the City, with the sound of Drums, Fifes, and other such instruments of War; where being arrived about noon without any oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he began presently to settle his Camp, so that before it was night, the whole City was environed with Trenches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and very great Ditches, as also with six rows of Cannons, and other Pieces of Ordnance.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 1.</note> when as the Queen that governed the State in the place of her Husband, seeing her self thus besieged, sent to visit this her enemy with a rich jewel of precious stones, which was presented unto him by a <hi>Talagrepo,</hi> or religious man, of above an hundred years old, who was held amongst them for a Saint, together with a Letter, wherein this was written; <hi>Great and mighty Lord, more favoured in the House of fortune then all the Kings of the earth, the force of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream power, an increasing of the Salt-seas, whereinto all lesser rivers do render themselvos a Shield full of very fair devices, Processor of the greatest States, upon the Throne whereof thy feet do repose with a marvellous Majesty: I</hi> Nhay Nivolau, <hi>a poor woman, Governess, and Tutress of my Son, an Orphan, do prostrate my self before thee with tears in mine eyes, and with the respect which ought to be rendred unto thee; I beseech thee not to draw thy Sword against my weakness, for thou knowest that I am but a silly woman, which can but only cry unto God for the wrong that it done me, whose property also it is to succour with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to chastice with justice the States of the world be they never so great, trampling them under his feet with so redoubted a power, that the very Inhabitants of the profound house of smoak do fear and tremble before this Almighty Lord: I pray and conjure thee not to take from me that which is mine, seeing it is so small a thing, as thou shalt not be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for it when thou hast it, nor yet the less if thou hast it not; whereas contrarily, if thou, my Lord, wilt shew thy self pitiful to me, that act of clemency will bring thee such reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the very Infants themselves will cease from sucking the white breasts of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for to praise thee with the pure lips of their innocency, and likewise all they of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Strangers will ever remember such thy charity towards me, and I my self will cause it to be graven on the Tombs of the dead, that both they and the living may give thee thanks for a thing, which I do beg of thee with so much instance from the bottom of my heart. This holy man,</hi> Avenlachim, <hi>from whom thou shalt receive this Letter, written with mine own hand, hath Power and Authority to treat with thee in the Name of my Fatherless Son, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that shall be judged reasonable touching the tribute and homage which thou shalt think fit to have rendred unto thee, upon condition that thou wilt be pleased to let us enjoy our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so that under a true assurance thereof we may bring up our children, and gather the fruit of our labours for the nourishment of the poor Inhabitants of this paltry Town, who will all serve thee, and I to with a most humble respect in all things, wherein thou shalt think good to imploy us at thy pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bramaa</hi> received this Letter and Ambassage with a great deal of authority, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Religious man, that delivered it to him, with much honour, as well in reguard of his age, as for that he was held as a Saint amongst th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon the <hi>Rolim,</hi> who brought this Letter, relying no longer on the false promises of this Tyrant, and discontented with the little respect he used towards him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded leave of him to return to the City, which the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amaa</hi> gave him, together with this answer; That if the Queen would deliver up her self, her Treasure, her Kingdom, and her Vassals to him, he would recompence her another way for the loss of her State: but withall that she was to return him a peremptory answer to this proposition of his the very same day,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50126:113"/>
which was all the time I could give her, that so he might upon the knowledge of her resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion determine upon what he had to do. The <hi>Rolim</hi> went herewith back to the City, where he gave the Queen an account of all things, saying, That this Tyrant was a man without faith, and replete with damnable intentions, for proof whereof he represented unto her the Siege of <hi>Martabano,</hi> the usage of the <hi>Chaubainhaa</hi> after he rendred himself unto him upon his word, and how he had put him, his wife, his children, and the chiefest Nobility of his Kingdom to a most shamefull death. These things considered it was instantly concluded, as well by the Queen, as by all those of her Councel, that she should defend the City, till such time as succour came from her Father, which would be within fifteen days at the furthest: This resolution taken, she being of a great courage without further delay took order for all things, that were thought necessary for the defence of the City, animating to that end her people with great prudence, and a man-like Spirit, though she was but a woman; Moreover, as she liberally imparted to them of her Treasure, so she promised every one throughly to acknowledg their services with all manner of recompences and honours, whereby they were mightily encouraged to fight: In the mean space the King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> seeing that the <hi>Rolim</hi> returned him no answer within the time prefixt, began the next day to fortifie all the Quarters of his Camp with double rows of Cannon, for to batter the City on every side; and for assaulting of the walls he caused a great number of Ladders to be made, publishing withall throughout his whole Army, that all Souldiers upon pain of death should be ready within three days to go to the Assault; The time then being come, which was the third of <hi>May,</hi> 1545. About an hour before day the King went out of his Quarter, where he was at anchor upon the river with two thousand vessels of choice men, and giving the Signal to the Commanders which were on Land, to prepare themselves, they altogether in one Body assailed the walls, with so great a cry, as if Heaven and earth would have come together, so that both sides falling to encounter pell-mell with one another, there was such a conflict betwixt them, as within a little while the air was seen all on fire, and the earth all bloody, whereunto being added the clashing of weapons, and noise of guns, it was a spectacle so dreadful, that we few <hi>Portugals,</hi> who beheld these things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained astonished, and almost besides our selves: This fight indured full five hours, at the end whereof the Tyrant of <hi>Bramaa</hi> seeing those within defend themselves so valiantly, and the most part of his Forces to grow faint, he went to land with ten or eleven thousand of his best men, and with all diligence re-inforcing the Companies, that were fighting, the Bickering re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing in such sort, as one would have said it did but then begin, so great was the fury of it. The second trial continued till night, yet would not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng desist from the fight, what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel soever was given him to retire, but contrarily he swore not to give over the Enterprise begun, and that he would lie that night within the inclosure of the City walls, or cut off the heads of all those Commanders that were not wounded at their coming off; In the mean time this obstinacy was very pejudicial to him, for continuing the Assault till the Moon was gone down, which was two hours past midnight, he was then forced to sound a Retreat, after he had lost in this Assault, as was the next day found upon a Muster, fourscore thousand of his men, besides those which were hurt, which were thirty thousand at the least, whereof many died for want of dressing, whence issued such a plague in the Camp, as well through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the air, as the water of the river, that was all tainted with blood and dead bodies, that thereby about fourscore thousand more perished, amongst whom were five hundred <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi> having no other buriall then the bellies of Vultures, Crows, and such like birds of prey, which devoured them all along the Coast where they lay.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> having considered that this first Assault having cost him so dear, would no more haza<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d his men in that manner,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> but he caused a great Terrace to be made with Bavins, and above ten thousand Date-trees, which he commanded to be cut down, and on that he raised up a platform so high, as it over-topped the walls of the City two fathom, and more, where he placed fourscore pieces of Ordnance, and with them continually battering the City for the space of nine dayes together, it was for the most part demolished with the death of fourteen thousand persons, which quite abated the poor Queens courage, especially when she came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that she had but six thousand fighting men left, all the rest, which consisted of women, chidren, &amp; old men, being unfit and unable to bear Arms. The miserable besieged seeing themselves reduced to such extreamity, assembled together in Councel, and there by the advice of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of them, it was concluded, That all in general should anoint themselves with the Oile of the Lamps of the Chappel of <hi>Quiay Nivandel,</hi> God of Battail of the field <hi>Vitan,</hi> and so
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50126:113"/>
offering themselves up in sacrifice to him, set upon the platform, with a determination either to dye, or to vanquish, in vowing themselves all for the defence of their young King, to whom they had so lately done homage, and sworn to be true and faithful Subjects. This resolution taken, which the Queen and all her Nobility approved of for the best and most assured, in a time wherein all things were wanting to them for the longer defending themselves, they promised to accomplish it in the manner aforesaid by a solemn O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, which they all took; Now there being no further question but to see how they should carry themselves in this affair, they first of all made an Uncle of the Queens the Captains of this resolute Band, who assembling these six thousand together, the same night, about the first quarter of the watch, made a sally out of the two gates that were neerest to the Terrace and platform, and so taking courage from their despair, and resolution to dye, they fought so valiantly, that in less then half an hour the whole Camp was put in disorder, the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race gained, the fourscore pieces of Cannon taken, the King himself hurt, the Pallisado burnt, the Trenches broken, and the <hi>Xenimbrum,</hi> General of the Army, slain, with above fifteen thousand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After this they retreated an hour before day, and upon a review they found, that of six thousand which they were, there was but seven hundred slain.

This adventure rendred things quiet for the space of twelve days, during which the besieged stirred not; in the mean time one of the four principal Captain of the City, named <hi>Xemim Meleytay,</hi> fearing that which all others in general misdoubted, namely, that they could not escape from falling into the hands of so cruel an Enemy, treated secretly with the Tyrant, and upon condition that he would continue him in his charge, not meddle with any of the houses of his friends, and make him <hi>Xemin</hi> of <hi>Ansedaa</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu,</hi> with all the Revenue which the <hi>Bainhaa</hi> of <hi>Malacou</hi> had there, being thirty thousand Duckats a year, he would deliver him up the City by giving him entrance into it through the gate which he commanded: The King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> accepted hereof, and for a gage of performance on his part, he sent him a rich Ring from off his finger. This Treason so concluded, was effected on the three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>August,</hi> in the year 1545. wherein this Tyrant of <hi>Bramaa</hi> carryed himself with all the barbarousness and cruelty that he used to practise in the like cases. And for as much as I conceive that I should never have done, if I should recount here at large how this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair past, I will say no more, but that the gate was opened, the City delivered up, the Inhabitants all cut in pieces, without so much as sparing one; the King and Queen made prisoners, their Treasurers taken, the Buildings and Temples demolished, and many other inhumanities exercised with such outragiousness, the belief whereof is beyond the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and thought of man, and truly I never represent unto my self in what manner it was done, as having seen it with mine own eyes, but that I remain as it were astonished and besides my self at it. For as this Tyrant was touched to the quick with the affront he had lately received, so he executed all the cruelties he could imagine against thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>minate disposition, though he was nevertheless an Enemy to women, albeit there were in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in all the others whereof he was Lord, those that were very white and fair. After the bloody ruine of that wretched City, the Tyrant entred into it in great pomp, and and as it were in triumph, through a breach that was made of purpose in the wall, and by his express commandment. When he was arrived at the young Kings pallace, he caused himself to be crowned King of <hi>Prom,</hi> and during the Ceremony of this Coronation, he made that poor Prince, whom he had deprived of his Kingdom, to continue kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, with his hands held up, as if he adored some God, and ever and anon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained him to stoup down and kiss the Tyrants feet, who in the mean time made shew as
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50126:114"/>
if he were not pleased therewith. This done, he went into a Balcone, which looked on a great Market place, whither he commanded all the dead children, that lay up and down the streets, to be brought, and then causing them to be hacked very small, he gave them, mingled with Bran, Rice, and Herbs, to his Elephants to eat. Afterward, with a strange kind of ceremony, at the sound of Trumpets, Drums, and other such like Instruments, there was above an hundred Horses led in, loaden with the quarters of men and women, which also he commanded to be cut small, and then cast into a great fire, kindled expresly for it. These things so done, the Queen was brought before him, that was wife to the poor little King, who, as I said before, was but thirteen years of age, and she thirty and six, a woman ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry white, and well-favored, Aunt to her own Husband, Sister to his Mother, and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King of <hi>Avaa,</hi> which is the Country from whence the Rubies, Saphirs, and Emeralds do come to <hi>Pegu</hi>; and it was the same Lady, whom this <hi>Bramaa</hi> had sent to demand in marriage of her Father, as it was then spoken, but that he refused him, saying to his Embassador for an answer, That the thoughts of his Daughter soared a pitch higher then to be the wife of the <hi>Xemim</hi> of <hi>Tanguu,</hi> which was the family whence this Tyrant was issued: But now that she was fallen into his hands as his slave, whether he used her so, either out of a revenge of that affront, or out of scorn and contempt, so it was that he made her to be publiquely stript stark naked, and to be torn and mangled with whipping, and then in that manner to be led up and down all the City, where amidst the cries and hooting of the people, he exposed her to other cruel torments, wherewith she was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured till she gave up the ghost; When she was dead, he made her to be bound to the little King her Husband, who was yet living, and having commanded a great stone to be tyed about their necks, they were cast into the River, which was a kind of cruelty very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all that beheld it. To these barbarous parts he added many others so inhumane, as it is not likely that any other but he could imagine the like; And for a conclusion of his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, the next day he caused all the Gentlemen that were taken alive, being some three hundred, to be impaled, and so spitted like rosted Pigs, to be also thrown into the River, whereby may be seen how great and unheard of the injustice of this Tyrant was, which he exercised on these miserable wretches.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 1.</note>FOurteen days were past since the doing of these things, during the which the Tyrant employed himself in fortifying the City with a great deal of diligence and care, when as his spies, whom he had sent out, brought him word, that from the City of <hi>Avaa</hi> a Fleet of four hundred rowing Vessels was come down the River of <hi>Queitor,</hi> wherein there were thirty thousand <hi>Siamon</hi> Soldiers, besides the Mariners, of which the King of <hi>Avaas</hi> son, and brother to the poor Queen, was General; for this Prince having received adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement of the taking of the City of <hi>Prom,</hi> and of the death of his sister and brother-in-law, went and lodged in the Fortress of <hi>Meleytay,</hi> which was some twelve leagues up the River from <hi>Prom.</hi> This news much troubled the Tyrant, howbeit he resolved to go him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in person against his Enemies before that other succors came to joyn with them, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the report went, that fourscore thousand, all <hi>Mons</hi> by Nation, and led by the King of <hi>Avaa,</hi> were on their way thither: With this resolution the Tyrant of <hi>Bramaa</hi> set forth towards <hi>Meleytay</hi> with an Army of three hundred thousand men, namely two hundred thousand by Land alongst the Rivers side, whereof the <hi>Chaumigrem</hi> his Foster-brother was Commander in chief, and the other hundred thousand under his own conduct, being all choyce men, and imbarqued in two thousand <hi>Seroos</hi>; Being come within sight of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leytay,</hi> the <hi>Avaas</hi> desiring to shew that the resolution wherewith they were come thither, was of far more power with them, then any fear they could have, and that also their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might not receive any benefit by their Fleet which lay on the River, and do them an affront besides by taking of it, they set all the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50126:114"/>
the field, and ranged themselves into four Battalions, in three of which, whereof each one made ten thousand men, were the thirty thousand <hi>Mons</hi>; and in the the other, that were somewhat bigger, were all the Mariners of the four hundred Vessels they had burnt: These same they placed in the Vaunt-guard, with an intention that they should weary the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with whom they made a cruel fight, which lasted about half an hour, wherein all these Mariners were cut in pieces; presently after them the thirty thousand <hi>Mons,</hi> close compacted together in three Battalions, presented themselves, and with wonderful vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence set upon their Enemies, between whom and them followed so extraordinary and cruel a battel, as not longer to insist upon it, nor to recount in particular how things past, which also I cannot well do, it shall suffice me to say, that of the thirty thousand <hi>Mons,</hi> eight hundred only escaped out of it, who being routed, made their retreat into the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress of <hi>Meleytay</hi>; but that which was most memorable herein was that of the King of <hi>Bramaas</hi> two hundred thousand men, an hundred and fifteen thousand lay dead in field, and all the rest for the most part were wounded. In the mean time the Tyrant, which came along on the River in the two thousand <hi>Seroos,</hi> arrived at the place of Battel, where beholding the strange massacre which the <hi>Mons</hi> had made of his people, he became so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at it, that dis-imbarquing his Forces, he instantly layd siege unto the Fortress, with a purpose, as he said, to take all those eight hundred that were in it alive. This siege con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued seven whole days together, during the which those without gave five assaults to it, and the besieged defended themselves always very valiantly, howbeit seeing that the last hour of their life was come, and that they could no longer hold that place for their King, as they had hoped they might, by reason of the fresh Forces which the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> had landed, like couragious men as they were they resolved to dye in the field, as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions had done, and valiantly revenge their deaths with that of their Enemies, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they were the more willingly carryed, because they perceived well that if they continued still in the place, they should never make use of their valor, as they desired to do, for that the Tyrants Ordnance would by little and little consume them: This resolution taken, they under the favor of a very dark and rainy night sallyed forth, and first of all fell upon the two first Courts of guard that were on the Lands side, cutting all in pieces that they met withall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then following their design they passed on like desperate men, and whether they did it, either to shew that they regarded not death which threatened them, or for the desire they had to gain honor, so it was that they behaved themselves so couragiously, and press<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Tyrant so neer, as they forced him to leap into the River, and swim for his life, in so much that all the Camp was in disorder, and broken through in I know not how many places, with the death of above twelve thousand men, amongst whom were fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Bramaas,</hi> two thousand strangers of divers Nations, and all the rest <hi>Pegu's.</hi> This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon the Tyrant of <hi>Bramaa</hi> seeing the fight ended, and all things quiet, went and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assembled his Forces together, and so entered into the Fortress of <hi>Meleytay,</hi> where he presently commanded the <hi>Xemims</hi> head to be cut off, saying, that he was the sole cause of that disaster, and that he who had been a Traytor to his King, could not be faithful unto him: behold the recompence which this Tyrant made him for delivering up the City of <hi>Prom</hi> unto him, howsoever it justly belonged unto him for a punishment of his perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that carryed him to betray his King and his own Country into the power of his Enemies: After this they fell to dressing of the hurt men, which were in very great number.</p>

In this Voyage his intention was to go in his own person, for to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Kingdom of <hi>Avaa,</hi> and to see the City himself, the better to consider the strength of it, and thereby judg what Forces he should bring for to take it; So he proceeded still on for the space of eight and twenty days, and during that time passed by many goodly places, which within the Kingdom of <hi>Chaleu</hi> and <hi>Iacuçalaon</hi> were upon the bank of the River: At length he arrived at the City of <hi>Avaa</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>October</hi> the same year, a thousand five hundred forty and five; Being come to the Port, he remained there thirteen days, and that while burned between two and three thousand Vessels that he found there; Moreover he set fire on many Villages thereabout, which cost him not so little but that he lost in all these degasts eight thousand of his men, amongst the which were threescore and two <hi>Portugals.</hi> Now whereas this City was very strong, as well in regard of the scituation of it, as of the Fortifications which were newly made there, it had besides with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it twenty thousand <hi>Mons,</hi> who it was said were come thither some five days before from the Mountains of <hi>Pondal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Tyrant having intelligence thereof, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that this, above all other things he could fear, might be the cause of his ruine, he gave present order for the fortifying of <hi>Prom</hi> with much more care and diligence then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: howbeit before his departure from this River where he lay at anchor, being about some le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The subject of this Embassage was to make him his Brother in Arms by a League and Contract of new amity, offering for that effect to give him a certain quantity of Gold and precious stones, as also to render unto him certain Frontier Lands of his Kingdom, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that the Spring following he should keep the <hi>Siamon</hi> in war for to divert him from succoring the King of <hi>Avaa,</hi> and thereby give him means the more easily to take his City from him, without fear of that assistance which that King hoped should serve for an obstacle to his design. This Embassador departed then after he had imbarqued himself in a <hi>Laulea,</hi> that was attended on by twelve <hi>Seroos,</hi> wherein there were three hundred men of service, and his guard, besides the Watermen and Mariners, whose number was little less. The Presents which he carryed to the <hi>Calaminhan</hi> were very great, and consisted in divers rich pieces, as well of Gold as of precious stones, but above all in the Harness of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, which according to reports was worth above six hundred thousand Duckets, and it was thought that all the Presents put together amounted to a Million of Gold. At his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, amongst other favors, which the King his Master conferred on him, this same was not the least for us, that he gave us eight unto him for to be his perpetual slaves; Having clothed us then very well, and furnished us abundantly with all things necessary, he seemed to be exceedingly contented with having us along with him in this Voyage, and ever after he made more account of us, then of all the rest that followed him.</p>

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50126:116"/>
many very goodly places, whereof the most were fair Towns, and the rest stately high Trees, delicate Gardens, and great Plains full of Corn, as also much Cattel, red Deer, Shamoises, and Rhinocerots, under the keeping of certain men on horsback who looked to them whilest they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On the river there were a great number of vessels, where in much abundance was all things to be sold which the earth produceth, wherewith it hath pleased God to enrich these Countries more then any other in the world. Now forasmuch as the Ambassadour fell sick here of an Impostume in his stomack, he was councelled to proceed no further till he was healed, so that he resolved to go with some of his Train for to be cured to a famous Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, some twelve Leagues from thence, in a <hi>Pagode,</hi> named <hi>Tinagoogoo,</hi> which signifies <hi>the God of thousand Gods,</hi> and so departing at the same instant he arrived there on <hi>Saturday</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout night.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>The Ambassadour being set on shore was the next day led to an Hospital, called <hi>Chipano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> whither the greatest Lords used to repair when they were sick, and where there were two and forty several Lodgings very neat and convenient, in one of the which he was placed by the express command of the <hi>Puitaleu,</hi> who was as it were Governour of the Hospital: There care was taken that he wanted for nothing, but was furnished in abundance with all that was necessary for him: I will omit the odours, the neatness, the care of attendance, the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, the robes, the exquisite meats, the delicacies, and all the delights that may be imagined, which were to be had there with as much perfection and curiosity, as more cannot be desired. Thither likewise came twice a day to him exceeding fair women, who sung to the Tune of Instruments of Musick, and at certain hours represented Playes, or Comedies before him, that were very pleasant, and finely set forth. Now that I may not trouble my self in recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here at length the infinite number of things, which I could speak of concerning this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I will pass over many of them in silence, whereof, other persons that could better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them then my self, would peradventure make great esteem. After we had been eight and twenty days there, by which time the Ambassador was perfectly cured, we departed from thence for to go to a Town, named <hi>Meidur,</hi> twelve leagues further up the river of <hi>Angeguma</hi>; But that I may not be blamed for failing in the promise which I made heretofore of speaking of this <hi>Pagods</hi> of <hi>Tinagoogoo,</hi> I will here leave the Ambassadour to his Voyage, and return me to the <hi>Pagode,</hi> that of so many things which we saw there I may deliver some one, for to shew how little we Christians do to save our souls, in comparison of that much these wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do to lose theirs. During the eight and twenty dayes which the Ambassadour imployed in recovering his health, we nine <hi>Portugals</hi> that waited on him not knowing what to do, or how to bestow our time in the mean while, no more then the rest, we past it away in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things, according to each ones fancy and delight, for to that purpose we wanted no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. Thus some applied themselves to the hunting of Stags and Wild-boars, whereof there is great store in that Country; Some to the pursuing of Tygers, Rhinocerots, Ounces, Zeores, Lions, Buffles, Wild-bulls, and of many other such kind of beasts which we have not heard spoken of in our <hi>Europe</hi>; some to shooting at Wild-ducks, Geese, and such like Water-fowl; some to hawking with Vultures and Faulcons; and some to fishing for Trowts, Mackarels, Chevins, Mullets, Soles, and many other sorts of fish, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is great abundance in all the rivers of this Empire. In this manner we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed our time, now in one thing, and then in another, but that which we gave our selves most unto was to hear, and see, as also to enquire after the Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the <hi>Pagodes,</hi> and Sacrifices which we beheld there with much terrour and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Howbeit I purpose not to make any relation here more then of a few of them, which I conceive may suffice to draw out the consequences of those that I shall not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of. I say then that one of those sacrifices was made on the day of the new Moon of <hi>December,</hi> namely on the ninth of that Month, which is a time wherein these blinded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are accustomed to celebrate a Feast, called by those of the Country <hi>Massunterivoo</hi>; by those of <hi>Iappon, Ferioo</hi>; by the <hi>Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50126:116"/>
the chiefest cause of their repair thither in such numbers, is a Fair, which is kept all the time of the Feast, being fifteen dayes, namely from the new to the full Moon. In this Fair are all things to be sold, which Nature hath created on the earth, or in the Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that in so high a degree of abundance, as there is not any one kind of thing, whereof there are not whole Streets of Houses, Cabbins, or Tents, so long that one can hardly see from one end to the other. All these streets are replenished with very rich Merchants, besides an infinite company of other people, who are lodged all along the River, which is above two Leagues broad, and planted about with several sorts of Trees, as Walnuts, Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, Cocos, and Dates, whereof every one takes what he pleaseth, because it doth all belong to the <hi>Pagode.</hi> The Temple of this Idol is a very sumptuous Edifice, scituated in the midst of a Plain upon a little round hill, more then half a league in circuit: It is built all slope fifteen fathom high, and from thence upward it hath a wall of free-stone of some three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, with its Bulwarks, and Towers, after the fashion of ours. Within the inclosure of this wall there is a platform made level with Battlements, a stones cast in bredth, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the wall extends round about the hill, so that at first sight one would take it for a Gallery. There are likewise all along an hundred and threescore Hospitals, in each whereof are above an hundred houses, which are low, but very neat and convenient, where the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes, <hi>Fucatous,</hi> and <hi>Daroezes</hi> are entertained, which come thither in troops, like the Gipsies in our <hi>Europe,</hi> with their Captains, each company of them having two or three thousand persons, some more, some less, according as the Kingdoms from whence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort are nearer or further off; now it is known of what Country they are by the devices which they carry in their Banners. From the top to the bottom it is all invironed with Cypress-trees, and Cedars, where many fountains of most excellent water do continually flow forth, and on the highest part of this hill, almost a quarter of a league in circuit, there are four Convents, and in them very sumptuous and rich Temples, namely two of men, and as many of women, in each of which, as we were assured, were very near five hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. In the midst of these four Monasteries there is a Garden, compassed about with three inclosures of Ballisters of Lattin, having very fair Arches, of curious Masons-work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Steeples guilt all over, with a number of little silver bels in them, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Chappel of the Idol <hi>Tinagoogoo</hi> is of a round form, all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid on the in-side with plates of silver wrought in flowers, and garnished with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Branches for lights of the same mettal. This Monster, of whom we could not judge, whether he were gold, wood, or copper guilt, stood upright on his feet, with his hands lifted up to Heaven, and a rich Crown on his head; round about him were many other lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Idols on their knees, and beholding him as it were amazed: Below were two men made of brass, in the fashion of Gyants, seven and thirty spans high, and very ugly and deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whom they held for the Gods of the twelve months of the year. Without this place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so there were an hundred and forty Gyants, who ranked in two Files inclosed it round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and were made of cast iron, holding Halberds in their hands, as if they had been the Guard of it; so that all the Marvels of this Edifice put together made it appear so stately, that looking upon it one could not sufficiently esteem the riches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">§. 1.</note>WHilest this Feast of these <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as also the Fair, which was kept all the time thereof, endured for the space of fifteen days, with an infinite concourse of Merchants and Pilgrims, that came flocking thither from all parts, as I have declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there were many Sacrifices made there with different ceremonies, not a day passing without some new thing or other. For amongst many of great charge, and very worthy of observation, one of the chiefest was a <hi>Iubile</hi> after their manner, which was published the fifth day of the Moon, together with a Procession, that was above three leagues in length, as we could guess; It was the common opinion of all, that in this Procession there were forty thousand Priests of the four and twenty Sects, which are in this Empire, most of them were of different dignities, and called <hi>Grepos, Talagrepos, Roolims, Neepois, Bicos, Sacareus,</hi> and <hi>Chanfarauhos</hi>; Now by the ornaments they wear, as also by the devices and ensigns which they carry in their hands, they may be distinguished, and so every of them is respected according to his dignity; Howbeit these went not on foot as the other ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Priests, for that they were as this day forbidden upon pain of great sin to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>read upon the ground, so that they caused themselves to be born in <hi>Pallaquins,</hi> or Arm-chairs, upon the shoulders of other Priests their inferiors, apparelled in green Sattin, with their Stoles of Carnation Damask. In the midst of the ranks of this Proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssion were all the inventions of their Sacrifices to be seen, as also the rich Custodes of their Idols, for the which each of them had a particular Devotion; They that carryed them were clothed in yellow, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving each of them a big wax candle in his hand, and between every fifteen of those Custodes went a triumphant Charet, all which Charets put together were in number an hundred twenty and six: All these Charets were four, and some five stories high, with as many wheels on either side; In each of them there were at the least two hundred persons, what with the Priests and the Guards, and on the top of all an Idol of Silver, with a Miter of Gold on its head, and all of them had rich chains of Pearl and precious stones about their necks; round about every Charet went little Boys, carrying Silver Maces on their shoulders, and behind them were a many of Caskets full of exquisite perfumes, as also divers persons with Censors in their hands, who ever and anon censed the Idol to the tune of certain Instruments of Musick, saying three times with a lamentable voyce, <hi>Lord, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage the pains of the dead, to the end they may praise thee peaceably</hi>; whereunto all the people answered with a strange noise, <hi>Such may thy pleasure be, and so may it come to pass every day wherein thou shewest us the Sun.</hi> Each of these Charets was drawn by above three thousand persons, who for that purpose made use of very long coards, covered with silk, and thereby gained to themselves plenary remission of their sins, without restitution to be made of any thing at all: Now that many might participate of this absolution by drawing the coard, they set their hands to it one after and close to another, continuing doing so to the very end, in such sort that the whole coard was covered with hands, and nothing else to be seen; but that they also which were without might gain this indulgence, they helped those that had their hands on the coard by pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngth of the coard there were six or seven Ranks or Files, and in each of them above five hundred persons. This Procession was envi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oned with a great number of Horsemen, that carryed staves with pikes at both ends, who riding all about, went crying to the people, which were infinite in number, that they should make way, and not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Priests in their prayers: Many times also they struck those so rudely whom they first met withall, as they brat down three or four together, or hurt them grievously, no man daring to find fault with, or so much as speak a word against it. In this order this mervelous Procession passed through above an hundred streets, which to that end were all adorned with boughs of Palms and Myrtle, amongst the which were many Standarts and Banners of Silk planted; There were also many Tables set up in divers places, where all that desired it for Gods sake were admitted to eat of free cost, yea and in other parts they had clothes
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50126:117"/>
and mony given them; There likewise Enemies reconciled themselves one to another, and the rich men forgave them their debts which were not able to pay. In a word, so many good works were done there, more proper for Cristians, then for Gentiles, as I must needs conclude, that if they had been done with Faith and Baptism for the love of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and without any mixture of the things of this world, assuredly they would have been acceptable to him. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the best was wanting to them, and that both for theirs and our sins. Whilest this Procession, together with the Charets wherein the Idols were, passed along in this manner, and that with a dreadful noise of Drums, and other such instruments, behold where out of certain wooden Sheds made expresly for that purpose, six, seven, eight, or ten men, all besmeared with odors, and wrapped up in silk, wearing Gold Bracelets about their wrists, start forth all at once, and room being instantly made them by the people, after they had saluted the Idol which was on the top of the Charet, they went and layd themselves down athwart on the ground, so that the wheels coming to go over them crush'd them all to pieces, which the assistants beholding, cryed out aloud together, <hi>My Soul be with thine:</hi> Presently whereupon nine or ten of the Priests descending from the Charet took up these blessed, or rather accursed, creatures, that sacrificed themselves in this sort, and putting the head, bowels, and all the other members so crushed in pieces into great bowls made for that purpose, they shewed them to the people from the highest part of the Charet where the Idol stood, saying with a pitiful voyce, <hi>Miserable sinners, fall ye to praying, that God may make you worthy to be a Saint, as this here is, who hath now offered himself up as a sweet smelling Sacrifice.</hi> Whereunto all the people prostrated on the ground answered with a fearful noise, <hi>We hope that the God of a thousand Gods will permit to be so.</hi> In this manner many other of these wretches sacrificed themselves, to the number, as we were told by certain Merchants worthy of credit, of six hundred and more. After these followed other Martyrs of the Devil, whom they called <hi>Xixaporaus,</hi> which sacrificed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before the said Charets, by most mercilesly sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>shing themselves with sharp Rasors, that to behold them how they did it, one could not think but that they were altogether insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; for they cut off great gobbets of their flesh, and holding them on high at the end of Arrows, as if they would shoot them up to Heaven, they said, <hi>That they made a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thereof to God for the Souls of their Fathers, of their Wives, of their Children, or of such a one, for whose sake they did this wicked work.</hi> Now wheresoever this gobbet of flesh chanced to fall, there ran so much people to catch it up, as oftentimes many were stifled in the press, for they held it as a very great relique. In this sort these miserable wretches stood upon their feet, all bathed in their own blood, without Noses, without Ears, and without any resemblance at all of man, until at length they fell down stark dead on the Earth, then came the <hi>Grepos</hi> in all haste down from the top of the Charet, and cutting off their heads, shewed them to all the people, who kneeling on the ground, and lifting up their hands to Heaven cryed out with a loud voyce, <hi>Let us, O Lord, live to that time, wherein for thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice we may do as this same here hath done.</hi> There were others also whom the Devil drew thither after another manner; Those same craving an Alms, said, <hi>Give me an Alms for Gods sake, or if thou dost it not, I will kill my self.</hi> So that if they were not presently contented, they would instantly cut their own throats with Rasors which they held in their hands, or stab themselves in to the belly, and so drop down stark dead; whereupon the <hi>Grepos</hi> ran suddenly to them, and having cut off their heads, shewed them, as before, to the people, who reverenced them prostrated on the ground. We likewise saw some, named <hi>Nucara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> men of a very ill look, clothed with Tygers skins, and carrying in their hands certain pots of Copper full of excrements, and filthy corrupted urine, the stench whereof was so horrible and insupportable, as it was not possible for any nostril to endure it; These cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Alms of the people, said; <hi>Give me an Alms, and that instantly, otherwise I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50126:118"/>
this holy man had eaten of that beastly filth which the Devil feeds upon, and therefore was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come stinking before God, so that he could neither go into Paradise, nor live amongst men.</hi> Behold how strange the blindness of this people is, who otherwise have judgment and wit enough. I will pass by much other beastliness committed by them, which is so far esloign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all reason, as they serve for a great motive unto us, to render thanks without ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God for the infinite mercy and goodness that he shews us, in giving us the light of true Faith for the saving of our Souls.</p>

Now this noise endured from one of the clock in the afternoon till the next morning, and it is not to be believed what a world of lights and Torches were spent that night, besides the infinite number of fires that were kindled every where; the reason hereof was, as they said, <hi>For that</hi> Tinagoogoo, <hi>the God of thousand Gods, was gone in quest of the gluttonous Serpent, for to kill him with a Sword which had been given him from Heaven.</hi> After the night had been past thus amidst this infernal noise and tumult, as soon as it was day the whole Hill, whereon the Temple was built, appeared full of white Banners, which the people beholding, they fell straight to giving thanks unto God, and to that end they prostrated themselves on the ground with great demonstrations of joy, and then began to send presents one to another for the good news they received from the Priests by the shew of those white Banners, an assured sign that the gluttonous Serpent was killed. So all the people, transported with incredible glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, fell to going up the hill, whereon the Temple stood, by four and twenty several ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses that there were unto it, for to give thanks unto the Idol, and chaunt his praises for the victory he had the night past obtained over the gluttonous Serpent, and cutting off his head: This throng of people continued three days, and three nights, so that during that time it was not possible to break through the press on the way, but with much pain. Now we <hi>Portugals</hi> having little to do, resolved to go thither also for to see those abuses, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we went to ask leave of the Embassador, but he denyed us for the present, willing us to stay till the next day, and that then we should wait on him thither, for in his last sickness he had vowed to visit it; hereat we were very glad, because we thought that by this means we should the more easily see all that we desired: The morrow after, which was the third day of this Assembly, the greatest croud being over, we went along with him to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Tinagoogoo,</hi> and at length arrived, though with much ado, at the Hill whereon it was built. There we saw six very fair long streets, all full of Scales hanging on great Rods of Brass; In these Scales a number of people weighed themselves, as well for the accomplishment of the vows they had made in their adversities and sickness, as for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of all the sins they had committed till that present, and the weight which each of them layd in the other Scale was answerable to the quality of the fault they had done: So they that found themselves culpable of gluttony, and had not all that year used any absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, weighed themselves with Hony, Sugar, Eggs, and Butter, which were things not displeasing to the Priests, from whom they were to receive absolution; They that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to sensuality weighed themselves with Cotton wool, Feathers, Cloth, Apparel, Wine, and sweet Odors, because, say they, those things incite a man to that sin: They that were uncharitable to the poor weighed themselves with Coyn of Copper, Tin, and Silver, or with pieces of Gold; The slothful with Wood, Rice, Coals, Pork, and Fruit; and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, because they reap no benefit by their maligning the prosperity of others, expiated their sin by confessing it publiquely, and suffering a dozen boxes on the ear to be given them in the memory and praise of the twelve Moons of the year: As for the sin of pride, it was satisfied with dryed fish, Brooms, and Cow-dung, as being the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est of things; And touching them that had spoken ill of their Neighbors, without asking them forgiveness, they put for that a Cow into the Scale, or else an Hog, a Sheep, or a Stag: so that infinite was the number of those which weighed themselves in the Scales that were in those six

streets, from whom the Priests received so much Alms, as there were great piles of all sorts of things made up all along. Now for the poor that had nothing to give for the remission of their sins, they offered their own hair, which was presently cut off by above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Priests, who for that effect sat in order one by another on low stools, with Sizzars in their hands; There also we saw great heaps of that hair, whereof other <hi>Grepos,</hi> which were a thousand at least, and ranked also in order, made Wreathes, Tresses, Rings, and Bracelets, which one or another bought for to carry home to their houses, even as our Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims use to do, that come from <hi>Santiago de Compostella,</hi> or other such places. Our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, being amazed at the sight of these things, enquired further of the Priests concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, who besides other particulars told him, that all those alms, and other offerings which were given there during the fifteen days of this Assembly, amounted to a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and that even of the hair of the poor alone there was raised every year above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pardanis of Gold, which are fourscore and ten thousand Duckets of our Mony, whereby one may judg what a world of wealth was made of all the rest. After that the Embassador had stay'd sometime in the streets of the Scales, he passed on through all the other quarters, where were Comedies, dancing, wrastling, and excellent consorts of all kinds of musick, till at length we arrived at <hi>Tinagoogoo,</hi> but with much labor and pain, because the throng was so great, as one could hardly break through it. This Temple had but one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sle, that was very long and spacious, and full of great wax lights, each of them having ten or eleven wieks in it, set up all about in Silver Candlesticks; there was also great store of perfumes of Aloes and Benjamin: As for the Image of <hi>Tinagoogoo,</hi> it was placed in the midst of the Temple upon a stately Tribunal in the form of an Altar, environed with a number of Silver Candlesticks, and a many of Children attired in purple, which did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but cense it at the sound of Instruments of musick, whereon the Priests played rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable well: Before this Idol danced, to the tune of the said Instrument, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>n layd them before the Tribunal of the Idol with a great deal of ceremony and complement, ever and anon prostrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the ground. The Status of this Monster was seven and twenty spans high, having the face of a Gyant, the hair of a Negro, wide distorted nostrils, mighty great lips, and a very sowre and ill-favored countenance; He had in his hand an Hatchet in the form of a Coopers Addis, but with a far longer handle: With this Addis, as the Priests made the people believe, <hi>this Monster the night before killed the gluttonous Serpent of the House of Smoke, for that he would have stoln away the ashes of those that sacrificed themselves.</hi> There also we saw the Serpent amidst the place before the Tribunal in the form of an Adder, more horrible to behold then the wit of man can imagine, and done so to the life, as all that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on it trembled for fear; It was layd all along, with the head cut off, being eight fathom long, and the neck of it as thick as a Bushel, so lively represented, that though we knew it to be an artificial thing, yet could we not chuse but be afraid of it. In the mean time all the assistants ran thronging about it, some pricking it with the points of their Halberds, and some with their Daggers, every one with railing speeches cursing, and calling it, <hi>Proud, presumptuous, accursed, infernal Mannor, Pool of Damnation, envious of Gods goodness, hunger-starved Dragon, in the midst of the night,</hi> and many other names, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in such extraordinary terms, and so fitted to the effects of this <hi>Serpent,</hi> as we could not but admire them. That done, they put into Basins which stood at the foot of the Idols Tribunal a world of alms, of Gold, Silver, Jewels, pieces of Silk, fine Callicoes, Mony, and hundred other things in very great abundance. After we had seen all these things, we continued following the Embassador, who went to see the Grots of the Hermits or Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, which were at the utmost end of the Wood, all cut out of the hard Rock, and in such order, as one would have thought that Nature, rather then the hand of man, had labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. There were an hundred forty and two of them, in some of the which remained divers men, whom they held for Saints, and that did very great and austere pennance; They in the first Grots wore long Robes like the <hi>Bonzes</hi> of <hi>Iapan,</hi> and followed the Law of an Idol, that had sometimes been a man, called <hi>Situmpor michay,</hi> who during his life enjoyned those of his Sect to lead their lives in great austerity, assuring them that the only and true way to gain Heaven, was to subdue the flesh, and that the more they labored to afflict themselves, the more liberally God would grant them all they could demand of him. They which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed

We likewise saw others of a Sect al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will pass by them of the Sect of <hi>Godomem,</hi> who spend their whole life in crying day and night on those mountains, <hi>Godomem, Godomem,</hi> and desist not from it until they fall down stark dead to the ground for want of breath: Neither will I speak of them which they call <hi>Taxilacons,</hi> who dye more brutishly then the rest, for they shut themselves up in certain Grots made of purposefor it, that are very little and close, stopped on all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </head>
            <p>AFter we had seen all these things with wonder enough,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> we departed from this <hi>Pagod</hi> of <hi>Tinagoogoo,</hi> and continued on our way for thirteen days together, at the end whereof we arrived at two great Towns, scituated on the Bank of the river, just opposite the one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other, about the distance of a stones cast, one of the which was called <hi>Manavedéa,</hi> and the other <hi>Singilapau</hi>; in the midst of this same river, which was there somewhat nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, there was an Island by nature formed round, and in it a rock six and thirty fathom high, and a Cros-bow shoot broad; upon this rock was a Fort built, with nine Bulwarks and five Towers; without the rampire of the wall it was invironed with two rows of great iron gates, and from the Bulwarks to the other side of the river ran a huge Chain of iron, to keep vessels from passing along, so that nothing could possibly enter there: At one of these two Towns, which was called <hi>Singilapau,</hi> the Ambassadour landed, where he was exceedingly well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the <hi>Xemimbrum,</hi> or Governour of it, who likewise furnished all his Train with great store of refreshments. The next morning we left this place, accompanied with twenty <hi>Laulês,</hi> wherein there were a thousand men and better, and about evening we arrived at the Custom-houses of the Kingdom, which are two strong places, and from the one to the other run five mighty great chains of Latten all atwart the whole bredth of the river, so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can pass in and out without leave; Hither came a man in a swift <hi>Seroo</hi> to the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour, and told him that he was to go ashore at <hi>Campalagro,</hi> which was one of the two Castles on the South-side, for to shew the Letter which this King had sent by him to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laminham,</hi> to see if it were written in the form that was required in speaking to him, as was usually observed. The Ambassadour presently obeyed, and being come to land he was led into a great Hall, where were three men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a table, with a great many Gentlemen, who gave him good entertainment, and demanded of him the occasion of his coming thither, as they that knew nothing of it; Whereunto the Ambassadour answered; <hi>That he came thither from the King of</hi> Bramaa, <hi>Lord of</hi> Tanguu, <hi>and that he had a message to deliver unto the holy</hi> Calaminham <hi>concerning matters greatly importing his Estate.</hi> Then having made further answer to other questions, which were put to him in a way of ceremony by the three principal persons that were at the Table, he shewed them the letter, wherein they corrected some words, which were not of the style wherewith they were accustomed to speak to the <hi>Calaminham</hi>; together with this letter the Ambassadour shewed them the present which he had brought for him, whereat they very much wondred, especially when they saw the Chair for an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant of gold and precious stones, which in the judgments of divers Lapidaries was worth above six hundred thousand Duckets, besides the other rich pieces that he carried him also, as I have before related. After we had our dispatch from this first Custom-house, we went to the other, where we found more venerable men then the former, who with another new Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony looked likewise on the Letter, and the present, and put to all the several parcels of it strings of wreathed carnation silk, with three Seals in Lacre, which was as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the receiving of the Ambassy by the <hi>Calaminham.</hi> The same day there came a man from the next Town of <hi>Questor,</hi> sent by the Governour of the Kingdom to visit the Ambassadour with a present of refreshments of flesh, fruit, and other such things after their manner. During nine dayes that the Ambassadour stayed in this place he was abundantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with all things necessary, both for his own Person, and his Train, and withall was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with sundry sports of hunting and fishing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as also with Feasts, accompaied with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick and Comedies represented by very beautiful women, and richly attired: In the mean time we <hi>Portugals</hi> went with the permission of the Ambassadour to see certain things, which they of the Country had much commended un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50126:120"/>
each side, which made in all two thousand, eight hundred, and fourscore, all full of pilgrims, who the whole year throughout came thither in pilgrimage from divers Countries; for, as they hold, this pilgrimage ought to be of far greater merit then all others, because that these Idols imprisoned by strangers have need of company. All these pilgrims, which, as they of the Country say, are all the year long without discontinuing above six thousand, have meat given them the whole time of their abode there, at the charge, and out of the revenue of the house: They are served by four thousand Priests of <hi>Manicafaran,</hi> who with many others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side within the same inclosure in sixscore religious houses, where there are also as many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that serve in the like manner. The Temple of this Hospital was very great, with three Isles after the fashion of ours, in the midst whereof was a remarkable Chappel built round, and invironed with three very big Ballist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs of Latten; within it there were fourscore Idols of men and women, besides many other little gods, that lay prostrated on the ground, for the fourscore great Idols only stood upright, and were all tied together with chains of iron; As for the little ones, they were, as I said, laid along on the pavement, as the children of these greater, and tied six to six by the middle with other slighter chains: Moreover without the Ballisters in two Files there stood two hundred, forty and four Giants of brass, six and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty spans high, with their Halberds and Clubs upon their shoulders, as if they had been set there for the Guard of the captive Gods. There was over-head upon iron rods, that traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Isles of the Temple, great store of Lamps hanging, having seven or eight Matches apiece in them, in the fashion of Candlesticks, like to them of the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> all varnished with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as also the walls were, and every thing else that we saw there, in token of mourning, by reason of the captivity of these Gods. Being amazed as well at that which I have recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as at many other things which I pass over in silence, and not able to comprehend what they meant by the imprisonment of these gods, we demanded the signification of it of the Priests, whereunto one amongst them, that seemed of more authority then the rest, made us this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; <hi>Since I see that being Strangers, you desire to learn of me that which I know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, and which you have never heard spoken, nor read of in your Books, I will declare the matter unto you as it past, according as it is truly delivered by our Histories. Know then, that it now seven thousand, three hundred, and twenty Moons, which make six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten years after the supputation of other Nations, since the time that an holy</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laminham, <hi>named</hi> Xixivarem Melentay, <hi>commanding over the Monarchy of the six and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Kingdoms of this Crown, waged wars with the</hi> Siamon, <hi>Emperour of the Mountains of the Earth, insomuch that there assembled what on the one part and the other threescore and two Kings, who putting themselves into the Field, fought so cruel and bloody a battail, as it endured from an hour before day till night, and there was slain on both sides sixteen</hi> Laque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saas <hi>of men, each of which makes an hundred thousand; At length the victory remaining to our</hi> Calaminham, <hi>without any more resting alive of his Forces then two hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand, he ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ned in four months space all the enemies Countries, with such a destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of people, as if credit may be given to our Histories, or to what any other besides have assured, there died fifty</hi> Laquesaas <hi>of persons. This battail was fought in the first of the said seven thousand, three hundred, and twenty Moons, in the renowned Field</hi> Vitau, <hi>where</hi> Quiay Nivandel <hi>appeared to the</hi> Calaminham, <hi>sitting in a Chair of wood, who acquired unto himself in this place a greater and more famous Title of honour, then all the other Gods of the</hi> Mons <hi>and</hi> Siammes, <hi>in regard whereof so often as they that inhabit the earth desire to make oath of things which pass the belief of men, they use for the more authorizing thereof to swear by the holy</hi> Quiay Nivandel <hi>God of Battails of the field</hi> Vitau. <hi>Now in a great City named</hi> Sarocatam, <hi>where five hundred thousand persons were slain, all these Gods, which here you see before you, were made prisoners in despight of the Kings that believed in them, and the Priests that served them with perfumes in their sacrifices. Thus by reason of so glorious a victory all those people became subject to us, and tributaries to the Crown of the</hi> Calaminham, <hi>who at this day holds the Scepter of this Monarchy, whereunto he was not raised but with much labour, and the shedding of a world of blood, during the threescore and four rebellions made by the said people since that time until this present; who not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the captivity of their gods, for that, to say the truth, it is a mighty affront unto them, they do still in memory of so unhappy a success continue making great demonstrations of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for it, renewing every year the vow they have made not to celebrate any Feast, nor to rejoyce in any kind of sort whatsoever, until they have provided for the deliverance of these
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50126:120"/>
prisoners; which also is the cause that no Lamps are seen in their Temples, and that they are resolved to light up none during the captivity of their Idols.</hi> Some of us seeming to doubt the verity hereof, because it seemed strange unto them, the <hi>Grepo</hi> swore that it was most true, and that also there had been killed at sundry times about the deliverance of these Gods, whom there we saw captive, above three millions of men, besides those that fell in precedent Battails; whereby one may clearly see in what a strange manner the Devil keeps these poor blinded wretches subjected unto him, and with how much abuse and extravagancy he precipitates them into hell. When we had well observed all the singularities of this Temple, we went to see another, called <hi>Vrpanesendoo,</hi> to speak of which I desire to be excused, that I may not be forced to treat of infamous and abominable matters, wherefore omitting the great abundance of riches, and other things which we saw there; it shall suffice me to say, that this Temple is served by none but women, who are all of them the daughters of Princes, and of the principal Lords of the Kingdom, which dedicates them from their infancy to offer up their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in sacrifice there; Now this filthy and sensual sacrifice is performed with so great charge, that many of them bestow above ten thousand Duckets in it, besides the offerings which are made to this Idol <hi>Vrpanesendoo,</hi> to whom they sacrifice their honour. This Idol is in a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel that is round, and guilt all over; it is made of silver, and set upon a Tribunal in form of an Altar, invironed over-head with a great number of Candlesticks, which are all of silver like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, every light in them having six wieks: Round about this Tribunal are many other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols guilded over, of very comely and well-favoured women, who with their knees on the ground, and hands lifted up, adore this Idol; These same, as the Priests told us, are the holy souls of certain young Ladies, which finished their dayes there to the great honour of their parents, who made more esteem of that then of all the King could give them. They assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us that the Revenue belonging to the Idol, was three hundred thousand Duckets by the year, besides the offerings and rich ornaments of their abominable sacrifices, which was yet worth more. In this Diabolical Temple were shut up within many religious houses that we saw above five thousand women, being all of them old, and for the most part exceeding rich, so that coming to dy, they make a donation of all their wealth to the <hi>Pagode,</hi> wherefore it is no marvel, if it have the revenue I spoke of. From this place we went to see the companies of the strangers, which came thither in pilgrimage in the manner that I have declared. These Companies were forty and six in number, every one of an hundred, two hundred, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, four hundred, or five hundred persons; nay, some of them were more, and were all lodged along by the river, as if it had been a Camp. Amidst these troops of strangers we met by chance with a <hi>Portugal</hi> woman, whereat we wondred more then at all we had seen before, so that desiring to know of her the reason of so strange an accident, she told us with tears, who she was, what occasion had brought her thither, and how she was at that instant the wife of one of those Pilgrims, to whom she had been married three or four and twenty years; whereunto she further added, that not daring to go and live amongst Christians because of her sin, she continued still in her wickedness, but that she hoped God would at length be pleased to bring her into some Country, where before she ended her dayes, she might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent her of her life past; and that although we found her in the company of people devoted to the service of the Devil, yet she left not for all that to be still a true Christian: we remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much amazed at so strange a relation, and not a little sorrowful also to see and understand to what a point of misfortune this poor woman was reduced, so that we told her our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and what we thought was fit for her to do, whereupon she concluded to go along with us to <hi>Timplam,</hi> and so to <hi>Pegu,</hi> and from thence to set sail for <hi>Coromandel,</hi> there to finish her days in the Island of <hi>St Thomé.</hi> Having vowed unto us to do thus we quitted her, not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that she would lose so good an opportunity to retire her self out of the errors wherein she was, and to restore her self to an estate wherein she might be saved, since it had pleased God to permit her to meet with us in a Country so far distant from that which she could hope for: Howbeit she performed nothing, for we could never see nor hear of her afterwards, which made us to believe, that either some thing was befallen her that kept her from coming to us, or that through the obstinacy of her sins, she deserved not to make her profit of the grace which our Lord had offered to her out of his infinite goodness and mercy.</p>

               </gap>, Cymbals, Drums, and Sea-corners, that the din thereof coming to joyn with the noise, which the Rowers made, terrified all those that heard it; and indeed one would have thought it at first to be some inchantment, or to say better, a musick of hell, if there be any there. Amidst this stir we drew near to the City, where we arrived about noon; Being come to the first Key, that was named <hi>Campalarraia,</hi> we saw a great many men, both Horse and Foot, all richly accoutred, as also a number of fighting Elephants, very well harnessed, having their chairs and for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>-head pieces garnished with silver, and their warlike <hi>Panores</hi> fastened to their teeth, which rendred them very terrible. The Ambassadour was no sooner come on shore, but the <hi>Campanogrem</hi> took him by the hand, and falling on his knees, presented him to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great man that attended for him at the Key in great pomp; This same was called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedacan,</hi> one of the chiefest of the Kingdom, as we were told; After he had with a new complement of courtesie received the Ambassadour, he offered him an Elephant furnished with a Chair and harness of gold, but whatsoever the <hi>Mandarin</hi> could do to make the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour accept of it, he could by no means draw him thereunto, whereupon he caused ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther almost as well furnished to be brought, and gave it to him. As for us nine <hi>Portugals,</hi> and fifty or threescore <hi>Bramaas</hi> they provided Horses, on which we mounted: In this manner we departed from that place, having his Chariots before us full of men, that amidst the acclamations of the people played upon divers kinds of instruments; namely on silver Cymbals, Bells, and Drums; Thus we were conducted through many long Streets, whereof nine were invironed with Ballisters of Lattin, and at the entrance into them, there were Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches very richly wrought, as also many Chapters of pillars guilt, and great Bells, which like unto clocks struck the hours, nay the quarters of the hour of the day, whereby the people were ordinarily directed. After that with much ado, by reason of the great press of people that was in the streets, we were come to the outward Court of the <hi>Calaminham's</hi> Pallace, which was as long, or little less, as a Faulcons shot, and broad proportionable thereunto, we saw in it above six thousand Horses, all trapped with silver and silk, and those that were moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on them were armed with Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> were a great Company of Halberdiers, and many other shews of Greatness and Majesty, which made us believe that this Prince was one of the mightiest of the Country. When we were come to a great Gate, that stood between two high Towers, two hundred men which guarded it no sooner saw the <hi>Quietor,</hi> but they all fell down on their knees. Through this Gate, we entred into another very long outward Court, where the Kings second Guard was, composed of a thousand men,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50126:121"/>
who were all in guilt Arms, their Swords by their sides, and on their heads Helmets wrought with gold and silver, wherein stuck gallant plums of several colours. After we had past through the middle of all this Guard we arrived at a great Hall, where there was a <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,</hi> Uncle to the King, called the <hi>Monvagaruu,</hi> a man of above seventy years of age, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a great number of Nobity, as also with many Captains and Officers of the Kingdom; About him were twelve little boyes richly clad, with great Chains of gold three or four times double about their necks, and each of them a silver Mace upon his shoulder: As soon as the Ambassadour was come near him, he touched him on the head with a <hi>Ventiloo</hi> that he held in his hand, and beholding him, <hi>May thy entrance,</hi> said he, <hi>into this Palace of the Lord of the world, be as agreeable to his eyes, as the rain is to our fields of Rice, for so shall he grant thee all that thy King demands of him.</hi> From thence we went up an high pair of stairs, and entred into a very long room, wherein there were many great Lords, who seeing the <hi>Monvagaruu</hi> stood up on their feet, as acknowledging him for their Superiour; Out of this room we entred into another, where there were four Altars, very well accommodated with Idols of silver; upon one of these Altars we saw the Statue of a woman as big as a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, being eighteen spans high, and with her arms all abroad looking up to Heaven: This Idol was of silver, and her hair of gold, which was very long, and spread over her shoulders; There also we saw a great Throne, incompassed round about with thirty Giants of brass, who had guilded Clubs upon their shoulders, and faces as deformed as those they paint for the Divel. From this room we past into a manner of a Gallery, adorned from the top to the bottom with a number of little Tables of Ebony, inlayed with Ivory, and full of mens heads, under every one of the which the name of him to whom it belonged was written in letters of gold; At the end of this Gallery there were a dozen of iron Rods guilt, whereon hung a great many sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Candlesticks of great value, and a number of persuming Pans, from whence breathed forth a most excellent odour of Amber, and Calambuco, or Lignum Aloes, but such as we have none in <hi>Christendom.</hi> There on an Altar invironed all about with three rows of Ballisters of silver, we saw thirteen Kings vissages of the same mettal, with golden Mitars upon their heads, and under each of them a dead mans head, and below many Candlesticks of silver, with great white wax lights in them, which were stuffed ever and anon by little boys, who accorded their voyces to those of the <hi>Grepos</hi> that sung in form of a Letany, answering one another. The <hi>Grepos</hi> told us that those thirteen dead mens heads which were under the vissages were the skulls of thirteen <hi>Calaminhams,</hi> which in times past gained this Empire from certain strangers, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Roparons,</hi> who by Arms had usurped the same upon them of the Country: As for the other dead mens heads which we saw there, they were the sk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls of such Commanders, as by their Heroick deeds had honourably ended their dayes in helping to recover this Empire, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof it was most reasonable, that though death had deprived them of the recompence which they had merited by their action, yet their memory should not be abolished out of the world. When we were gone out of this Gallery, we proceeded on upon a great Bridg, that was in the form of a Street, rayled on either side with Ballisters of Lattin, and beautified with a many of Arches curiously wrought, upon which were Scutchions of Arms, charged with several devices in gold, and the Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ts over them were silver Globes, five spans in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferences, all very stately and majestical to behold. At the end of this bridge was another building, the doors whereof we found shut, whereupon we knocked four times, they within not deigning to answer us, which is a ceremony observed by them in such occasions; At the length after we had rung a bell four times more as it were in haste, out comes a woman of about fifty years of age, accompanied with six little girls, richly attired, and Scymitars upon their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders garnished with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt woman having demanded of the <hi>Monvagaruu</hi> why he had rung the bell, and what he would have, he answered her with a great deal of respect, <hi>That he had there an Ambassadour from the King of</hi> Bramaa, <hi>the Lord of</hi> Tanguu, <hi>who was come thither to treat at the feet of the</hi> Calaminham <hi>about certain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters much importing his service.</hi> By reason of the great authority which this woman was in she seemed little to regard this answer, whereat we wondred much, because he that spake to her was one of the chiefest Lords of the Kingdom, and Uncle to the <hi>Calaminham,</hi> as it was said; Nevertheless one of the six girls that accompanied her, spake thus in her behalf to the <hi>Monvagaruu, My Lord, may it please your Greatness to have a little patience till we may know whether, the time be fit for the kissing of the foot of the Throne of this Lord of the World, and advertising him of the coming of this stranger, and so according to the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50126:122"/>
grace which our Lord will shew him therein, his heart may rejoyce, and we with him.</hi> That said, the door was shut again for the space of three or four Credoes, and then the six Girls came and opened it, but the anciant woman that at first came along with them, we saw no more, howbeit in stead of her there came a Boy of about nine years of age, richly apparelled, and having on his head an <hi>hurfangua</hi> of Gold, which is a kind of Myter, but that it is somewhat more closed all about, and without any overture, he had also a Mace of Gold, much like a Scepter, which he carryed upon his shoulder: this same, without making much reckoning of the <hi>Monvagaruu,</hi> or of any of the other Lords there present, took the Embassador by the hand, and said unto him, <hi>The news of thy arrival is come unto the feet of</hi> Binaigaa <hi>the</hi> Calaminhan, <hi>and Scepter of the Kings that govern the Earth, and is so agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his ears, that with a smiling look he now sends for thee to give thee audience concerning that which is desired of him by thy King, whom he newly receives into the number of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, with a love of the son of his entrals, that so he may remain powerful and victorious over his Enemies</hi>: Thereupon he caused him, together with the Kings Uncle, and the other Governors that accompanyed him, to come in, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aving all the rest without; the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor then seeing none of his Train follow him, looked three or four times back, seeming by his countenance to be somewhat discontented, which the <hi>Monvagaruu</hi> perceiving, spake to the <hi>Queitor,</hi> who was a little behind, that he should cause the strangers to be let in, and none else; the doors being then opened again, we <hi>Portugals</hi> began to go in with the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maas,</hi> but such a number of others came thrusting in amongst us, as the Gentlemen Ushers, who were above twenty, had much ado to keep the doors, striking many with Battouns which they had in their hands, and of those some that were persons of quality, and yet could they not therewith, neither with their cries, nor menaces, stop them all from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Thus being come in, we past along through the midst of a great garden, made with such art, and where appeared so many goodly things, so divers, and so pleasing to the eye, as words are not able to express them: For there were there many Alleys environed with Ballisters of Silver, and many Arbors of extraordinary scent, which we were told had so much sympathy with the Moons of the year, that in all seasons whatsoever they bare flowers and fruits; withall there was such abundance and variety of Roses and other flowers, as almost passeth belief. In the midst of this Garden we saw a great many young women, very fair, and well clad, whereof some past away their time in dancing, and others in playing on sundry sorts of Instruments much after our manner, which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with so much harmony, as we were not a little delighted therewith: some also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed themselves in making of curious Needle-works and Gold-strings, some in other things, whilest their companions gathered fruit to eat; and all this was done so quietly, and with such order and good behavior, as made us admire it. At our going out of this Garden, where the <hi>Monvagaruu</hi> would needs have the Embassador to stay awhile, that he might there observe something worthy to entertain his King with at his return to <hi>Pegu,</hi> we went into a very great Antichamber, where many Commanders and Lords were sitting, as also some great Princes, who received the Embassador with new ceremonies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, and yet not one of them stirred from his place; Through this Antichamber we came to a door, where there were six Gentlemen Ushers with Silver Maces, by which we entered into another room very richly furnished: in this was the <hi>Calaminhan</hi> seated on a most majestical Throne, encompassed with three rows of Ballisters of Silver; At the foot of the degrees of his Throne sat twelve women that were exceeding beautiful, and most richly apparelled, playing on divers sorts of Instruments, whereunto they accorded their voyces; On the top of the Throne, and not far from his person, were twelve young Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels about nine or ten years old, all of them on their knees round about him, and carrying Maces of Gold in the fashion of Scepters; amongst them there was also another that stood on her feet, and fanned him. Below, all along the whole length of the room, were a great many of old men, wearing Myters of Gold on their heads, and long Robes of Sattin and Damask, curiously embroidered, every one having Silver Maces on their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ranked in order on either side against the walls: Over all the rest of the room were sitting, upon rich <hi>Persian</hi> Carpets, about two hundred young Ladies, as we could guess, that were wonderful fair, and exceeding well favored. Thus did this room, both for the marvelous structure of it, and for the excellent order that was observed therein, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present so great and extraordinary a Majesty, as we heard the Embassador say afterwards
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50126:122"/>
talking of it, that if God would grant him the grace to return to <hi>Pegu,</hi> he would never speak of it to the King, as well for fear of grieving him, as of being taken for a man that reports things which seem altogether incredible.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Embassador was ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereunto the <hi>Calaminhan</hi> made him this answer following, and that with a grave and severe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; <hi>For my part I accept of this new amity, thereby to give full satisfaction to thy King, as to a son newly born of my intrals.</hi> Then began the women to play on Instruments of Musick, and six of them danced with little children for the space of three or four credo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s; After that, other six little girls danced with six of the oldest men that were in the room, which seemed to us a very pretty fantasticalness. This dance ended, there was a very fine Comedy represented by twelve Ladies, exceeding beautiful, and gorgeously attired, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appeared on the Stage a great Sea-monster, holding in his mouth the daughter of a King, whom the fish swallowed up before them all, which the twelve Ladies seeing, went in all haste weeping to an Hermitage, that was at the foot of a Mountain, from whence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with an Hermit, who made earnest supplications to <hi>Quiay Patureu,</hi> God of the Sea, that he would bring this Monster to the shore, so as they might come to bury the Damsel according to her quality; The Hermit was answered by <hi>Quiay Patureu,</hi> That the twelve Ladies should change their lamentations and complaints into so many consorts of musick, that were agreeable to his ears, and he would then command the Sea to cast the fish upon the strand to be done withall as they thought good; whereupon comes on the Stage six little Boys with wings and crowns of Gold upon their heads, in the same manner as we use to paint Angels, and naked all over, who falling on their knees before the Ladies, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented them with three Harps and three Viols, saying, that <hi>Quiay Patureu</hi> s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt them these Instruments from the Heaven of the Moon, therewith to cast the Monster of the Sea into a sleep, that so they might have their desire on him, whereupon the twelve Ladies took them out of the hands of the little Boys, and began to play upon them, tuning them unto their voyces with so lamentable and sad a tone, and such abundance of tears, that it drew some from the eyes of divers Lords that were in the room; Having continued their musick about half a quarter of an hour, they saw the Monster coming out of the Sea, and by little and little as it were astonished, making to the shore where these fair Musicians were; all which was performed so properly, and to the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, that the Assistants could hardly imagine it to be a Fable, and a matter devised for pleasure, but a very truth, besides the Scean was set forth with a world of state and riches. Then one of the twelve Ladies drawing out a Poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, all set with precious stones, which she wore by her side, ripped up the fish, and out of the belly of it drew the Infanta alive, which presently went and danced to the tune of their Instruments, and so went and kissed the <hi>Calaminhans</hi> hand, who received her very graciously, and made her sit down by him; It was said, that this young Lady was his Niepce, the Daughter of a Brother of his; as for the other twelve, they were all the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Princes, and of the greatest Lords of the Country, whose Fathers and Brothers were there present. There were also three or four Comedies more like this, acted by other young Ladies of great quality, and set forth with so much pomp and magnificence, as more could not be desired. About evening the <hi>Calaminhan</hi> retired into another room, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with women onely, for all the rest they went along with the <hi>Monvagaruu,</hi> who
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50126:123"/>
took the Embassador by the hand, and led him back to the outermost room of all, where with many complements after their manner, he took his leave of him, and so committed him to the <hi>Queitor,</hi> who straightway ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But before I intreat of the way which we held from this place till we came to <hi>Pegu,</hi> where the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> was, I think it convenient and necessary to make a relation here of certain things which we saw in this country, wherein I will acquit my self as succinctly as I can, as I have done in all other matters whereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This Monarchy was in times past one sole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which now it is not, but is divided into thirteen estates of Soveraignes, who made themselves masters of it by poysoning their King in a banquet which they made him in the City of <hi>Chaleu,</hi> as their histories relate: of these thirteen estates, there are eleven that are commanded by other Nations, who by a tract of another great country are joyned to all the bounds of the <hi>Bramaas,</hi> where two great Emperors abide, of which the one is called the <hi>Siamon,</hi> and the other the <hi>Calaminham,</hi> who is the same I purpose only to treat of. According to report, the Empire of the Prince is above three hundred leagues bredth, and as much in length, and it is said that antiently it contained seven and twenty Kingdomes, the inhabitants whereof spake all one language: within this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire we saw many goodly Cities, exceedingly well peopled, and abounding with all provisions necessary for mans life, as flesh, fresh water, fish, corn, pulse, rice, past<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on having made a gathering for him, they got together above two hundred lingots of silver, which they gave him, and untill the time that we departed he was continually visited by the inhabitants, whereof many presented him with rich pieces of silk, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gifts, as if they had made an offering to some Saint upon a solemn day of his invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

Whereupon the King sent presently away a Fleet of sixscore <hi>Ceroos,</hi> with a number of choice men, amongst which were an hundred <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> in quest of this Pyrat. This Fleet having by good fortune discovered him, found that he had put on shore his thirty <hi>Ceroos,</hi> wherewith he had assailed us, and was with all his forces retired into a fortress, which was full of divers prizes that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in severall parts thereabout; our men immediately attacqued the place, and carried it easily at the very first assault, only with the loss of some few <hi>Bramaas</hi> and one <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> howbeit many were hurt with arrows, but they recovered in a short time without the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

by <hi>Antonio Ferreira,</hi> born in <hi>Braguenca,</hi> a man of great understanding, and to whom this King gave twelve thousand duckats a year pension, besides the Presents which he bestowed on him in particular, that came to little less. Hereupon the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> seeing that by this new league God had contented his desire, he resolved to shew himself thankfull for so great a favour, wherefore he caused great feasts to be made amongst these people, and a number of Sacrifices to be offered in their Temples, where there was no spare of perfumes, and wherein it was thought there were killed above a thousand, stags, cows, and hogs, which were bestowed for an alms among the poor, besides many other works of charity, as the cloathing of five thousand poor folks, and imploying great sums of money in the releasing of a thousand prisoners which were detained for debt. After that these feasts had continued seven whole days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a most ardent zeal, and at the incredible charge of the King, Lords, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, news came to the City of the death of the <hi>Aixquendoo, Roolim</hi> of <hi>Mounay,</hi> who was as it were their Soveraign Bishop, which caused all rejoycings to cease in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and every one to fall into mourning, with great expressions of sorrow: The King himself retired, the fairs were given over, the windows, doors, and shops were shut up, so that no living thing was seen to stir in the City, withall their Temples and Pagods were full of penitents of all sorts, who with incessant shedding of tears, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised such an excesse of repentance, as some of them died therewith. In the mean time the King departed away the same night for to go to <hi>Mounay,</hi> which was some twenty leagues from thence, for that he was necessarily to be assistant at this funerall pomp, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the antient custom of the Kings of <hi>Pegu</hi>; he arrived there the next day some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what late, and then gave order for all that was necessary for his funerals, so that the next day every thing being in a readiness; the body of the deceased was about evening brought from the place where he died, and laid on a Scaffold that was erected in the midst of a great place, hung all about with white velvet, and covered over head with three cloths of Estate of gold and silver tinsell: in the middle of it was a Throne of twelve steps ascent unto it, and an hearse almost like unto ours, set forth with divers rich works of gold and pretious stones; round about hung a number of silver candlesticks, and perfuming pots, wherein great quantities of sweet odours were burnt, by reason of the corruption of the body, which already began to have an ill savour. In this manner they kept it all that night, during the which was no little ado, and such a tumult of cries and lamentations made by the people, as words are not able to express; for the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly number of the <hi>Bicos; Grepos, Menigrepos, Talagrepos, Guimons,</hi> and <hi>Roolims,</hi> who are the chiefest of their Priests, amounted to above thirty thousand, that were assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether there, besides a world of others which came thither every hour. When divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of sorrow, that were well accommodated to the subject of this mourning, had been shown, there came some two hours after midnight out of a Temple, called <hi>Quiay Figrau,</hi> god of the Motes of the Sun, a procession, wherein were seen five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred little boys stark naked, and bound about the neck and the middle with cords, and chains of iron; upon their heads they carried bundles of wood, and in their hands knives, singing in two Quires with a tone, so lamentable and sad, as few that heard them could hardly forbear crying: In the mean time one amongst them went, saying in this manner, <hi>Thou that art going to enjoy the contentments of heaven, leave us not prisoners in this exile</hi>; whereunto another Quire answered, <hi>To the end we may rejoyce with thee in the blessings of the Lord</hi>: then continuing their song in manner of a Letany, they said many otherthings with the same tone. After that, when they were all fallen on their knees before the Scaffold where the body lay, a <hi>Grepo</hi> above an hundred years old, prostrated on the ground with his hands lifted up on high, made a speech to him in the name of these lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereunto another <hi>Grepo,</hi> who was neer the hearse, as if he had spoken in the person of the deceased, came to answer thus, <hi>Since it hath pleased God by his holy will to form me of earth, it hath pleased him also to resolve me into earth, I recommend unto you, my children, the fear of that hour, wherein the hand of the Lord shall put us into the balance of his justice</hi>; whereupon all the rest with a great cry replied in this sort, <hi>May it please the most Almighty high Lord that raigns in the Sun, to have no regard to our works, that so we may be delivered from the pains of death</hi>: These little boys being retired, there came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers about the age of ten or eleven years, apparrelled in white Sattin robes, with chains

of gold on their feet, and about their necks many rich jewels and pearls: After they had with much ceremony done a great deal of reverence to the dead body, they went and florished naked scymitars which they had in their hands all about the hearse, as if they would chace away the divell, saying aloud, <hi>Get thee gone, accursed as thou art, into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the house of smoke, where dying with a perpetuall pain, without making an end of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou shalt pay, without making an end also of paying the rigorous justice of the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</hi> This said, they withdrew, as if they would shew that by this action they had left the body of the deceased exempt from the power of the divell, which besieged it before; In the place of these same came in six and twenty of their principall <hi>Talagrepos,</hi> being fourscore years old and upwards, apparrelled in robes of violet coloured damask, and carrying silver censors in their hands, before whom for the greater gracing of them marched twelve gentlemen Ushers with Maces of the same metall; as soon as these Priests had censed the hearse four severall times with many ceremonies, they all prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves with their faces on the ground, and then one of them began to say, as if he had spoken to the dead man, <hi>If the clouds of heaven were able to tell our grief unto the beasts of the fiel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

During this and many other ceremonies there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, six young gentlemen <hi>Grepos</hi> sacrificed themselves, by drinking out of a golden cup a certain yellow liquor, so venemous, that before they had made an end of their draught, they fell down stark dead on the ground; this action of theirs brought these Martyrs of the divell into the number of their Saints, so as they were envied by every one for it, and presently their bodies were carried with a solemn procession to be burnt in a great fire, that was made of Sanders, Aloes, and Benjamin, where they were quickly reduced unto ashes. The next morning the Scaffold was disgarnished of all the richest pieces about it, and the hearse, but the cloths of estate, the hangings and banners, as also many other moveables of great worth were not stirred, and so with divers cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, fearfull cries and lamentations, and a strange noyse of severall sorts of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they set fire on the Scaffold, and all that was upon it, anoynting it often with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriferous liquors, and confections of great price.

Being arrived at the place where the <hi>Roolim</hi> had been burnt, after some ceremonies performed, as is usuall with them, according to the time and sence that every one had of it, a <hi>Talagrepo</hi> of the <hi>Bramaa</hi> Nation, and Uncle to the King, as Brother to his Father, whom the people held for the ablest of them all, having been chosen to preach that day, went up into the Pulpit for that effect: The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Sermon was an Elegy touching the defunct, whose life he commended with many speeches that made for his purpose, wherein he grew so earnest and hot, as turning himself to the King with tears in his eys, and lifting up his voice somewhat louder, to the end he might hear him the better, he said unto him, <hi>If the Kings in these times wherein we live do consider how little a time they have to live, and with what rigour of justice they shall be chastised by the Almighty hand of the most high God for the crimes of their tyrannicall lives, possibly it would be better for them to feed in the open fields like bruit beasts, then to be so absolute in their will, and to use it with so little reason, even as to be cruel to the good, and slack in punishing the wicked, whom by their soveraign power they have put into greatnesse and authority; and truly they are much to be lamented, whose good fortune hath raised them up to an estate so dangerous, as is that of Kings at this day, by reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence and liberty wherein they continually live, without so much as the least apprehe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Sermon being finished, the ashes of the defunct, which had been gathered up, was distributed as a relique into fourteen golden basons, whereof the King himself took up one on his head, and the <hi>Grepos</hi> of chiefest quality carried the rest; so the Procession going from thence in the same order as it came thither, those ashes were conveyed into a very rich Temple, which might be some flight shot from that place, and named <hi>Quiay D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This grave then was invironed about with three iron grates, and with two of silver, and one of latten, and upon three iron rods that crossed the whole bredth of the chappell, hung seventy and two lamps of silver, namely four and twenty on each of them, all of great value, and fastened together with great silver chains. Furthermore, there were placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the steps, whereby one descended into the grave, thirty and six little perfuming pots, with Benjamin, Aloes, and other confections, wherein was great store of Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greece, all which was not finished till it was almost night, by reason of the many cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies used in this funerall; all that day long they freed an infinite number of birds which had been brought thither in above an hundred cages, these Gentiles being of the opinion that they were so many souls of deceased persons, which before times had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of this life, and that were deposited as it were in the bodies of those birds, till the day of their deliverance should come, at which time they were in all liberty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the soul of the defunct: The like they did with a great many of little fishes which had been transported thither also in certain vessells full of water, so that to set them at liberty, they cast them into the river with another new ceremony, to the end they might serve the soul of him whose ashes were then buried: There was also brought thither all kind of venison and foul, which was distributed as an alms to all the poore that were present there, whereof the number was almost infinite. These ceremonies, and other such like which were performed in this action being finished, the King in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it was neer night retired into his quarter, where he had caused tents to be pitched for to lodge in, and that in sign of mourning, the like did all the great ones, so that all the Assembly by little and little withdrew. The next morning as soon as it was day, the King made it to be proclaimed, that all persons of what condition soever they were, should upon pain of death dislodge speedily out of the Island, and that they which were Priests should return to the attendance of their cures, with this penalty, in care of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travention to be degraded from their dignity.

These same then assembled in the house of <hi>Gangsparo</hi> to acquit themselves of their charge, and for that in the two first daies, which was the term limited to make this election, it could not succeed by reason of the diversity of opinions, and great contrariety that was found amongst them, which were to give their votes; the King thought fit, that out of those deputed ninety, there should nine be chosen, who alone should make the election. This resolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, these nine continued five daies, and as many nights together in continuall prayer; in the mean time a world of offerings were made, and alms given; a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of poor people were also cloathed, and tables prepared, where all men that would might eat of free cost, and all this was accompanied with processions in every quarter. At last these nine being agreed in conformity of votes, elected for <hi>Roolim</hi> one <hi>Manichae Mouchan,</hi> who at that time was a <hi>Capizondo,</hi> or Prelate in the town of <hi>Digum</hi> of a <hi>Pagode,</hi> called <hi>Quiay Figrau,</hi> that is to say, <hi>god of the atomes of the Sun,</hi> of whom I have oftentimes spoken; he was a man of about threescore and eight years of age, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted amongst them for an holy personage, very knowing in the customes and lawes of those Sects of the Gentiles, and above all exceeding charitable to the poor: With this election the King and all the great ones of the Court remained very well satisfied: The King then speedily dispatched away the <hi>Chaumigrem</hi> his foster-brother, to whom he gave thereupon the title of <hi>Coutalanhaa,</hi> which signifies, the Kings brother, to the end he might be the more honorably qualified with an hundred <hi>Lauleas,</hi> wherein was the Flower of all the <hi>Brama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he was come in this equipage where the new <hi>Roolim</hi> vvas, he prostrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self before him, and kissing the ground three times, <hi>O thou holy pearl,</hi> said he unto him, <hi>which art in the midst of the Sun, breath forth upon me by an agreeable inspiration of the Lord of uncreated power, that I may not dread upon earth the insupportable yoke of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>: At these vvords the nevv <hi>Roolim</hi> putting forth his hand to raise him from the ground, spake thus unto him, <hi>Labour my Son that thy works may be pleasing to God, and I will pray for thee without ceasing.</hi> Hereupon the King rising up, the <hi>Roolim</hi> made him sit dovvn by him, and stroked him three times vvith his hand on the head, vvhich the King took for the greatest honor he could do him; then having said something unto him vvhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some of our company observed, that one of their songs said thus; <hi>Children of a pure heart, praise this admirable and divine Lord, for as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This done, they said certain prayers after their manner, weeping, which very much moved the King; and then all the throng of people that made a strange noyse, being commanded to silence, they gave three toles with a great bell, for a sign to all the rest of the bells in the City to answer them, as they did with so horrible and dreadfull a din, that the earth even trembled therewith: After the ceasing of this noyse, two <hi>Talagrepos,</hi> men of great reputation amongst them, and very well versed in their Laws, went up into two Pulpits, prepared expresly for them, and that were hung with rich Turky Carpets, where they entertained their Auditors with the subject of this ceremony, and gave them the explication of every thing, making an ample relation unto them of the life and death of the deceased <hi>Roolim,</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:50126:129"/>
and of the election of this same, together with the excellent qualities with which he was indued for to be raised to so high a charge whereunto he was called by a particular grace of God; to this they added many other things wherewith the people were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly satisfied and contented; then the same bell having tolled three times more, the two Priests descended from their Pulpits, which together with all their furniture were presently burned with another new kind of ceremony, whereof I will forbear here making a relation, because it seems unnecessary to me to lose time in these super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, having said but too much already thereof. After all things were peaceable and quiet, and that for the space of five or six Credoes nothing had been spoken, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared coming from the next Temple, which was about a flight shot off, a very rich and sumptuous Procession of little children, attired all in white taffets, for a mark of their innocency and purenesse; they had about their necks a number of jewells, chains of gold upon their legs in form of bracelets, white wax lights in their hands, and upon their heads bonnets imbroydered with silk and gold, and set with Pearls, Rubies, and Saphirs; in the middle of this Procession was a rich Canopy of cloth of gold, which twelve of those little children carried, invironed round about with perfuming pans and censors of silver, from whence breathed forth excellent odors most pleasing to the sent. These little children played on divers instruments of musick, and went on singing praises to God, and praying him to resuscitate this defunct to a new life. When they were arrived at the place where the <hi>Roolim</hi> lay, they drew to the shrine, and taking away the cloth wherewith it was covered, there came out of it a little child, which could not be above three or four years old, and although he was naked, yet was not his nakednesse seen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was all covered over with gold and pretious stones, and appeared in the same fashion as we are accustomed to paint Angells; he had also golden wings, and a very rich Crown upon his head: Whenas he was come from out the shrine, the Assistants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prostrated on the ground, fell to saying aloud with a voice that made those to tremble which heard them, <hi>Thou Angel of God, sent from heaven for our salvation, pray for us when thou returnest thither again.</hi> The King went instantly to this child, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken him in his arms with a great deal of respect, and a strange ceremony, as if he would shew that he was not worthy to touch him, in regard he was an Angell sent from heaven, he set him on the brink of the grave, where after the child had taken away the cloth of black Velvet that covered him, whilest all were on their knees, with their hands and eys lift up to heaven, he said aloud, as if he had spoken to him, <hi>Thou which hast been conceived in sin, amidst the misery and filthiness of the flesh, God commands thee by me, who am the least of his servants, that thou do resuscitate to a new life which may be agreeable unto him, alwayes dreading the chastisement of his mighty hand, to the end that as the last gasp of thy life thou mayest not stumble like the children of the world; and that from this place where thou art extended stark dead, thou do rise up presently, because it hath been so decreed by the greatest of the greatest in the Temple of the earth, and come after me, and come after me, and come after me.</hi> The King thereupon took this child again in his arms, and then the <hi>Roolim</hi> rising up in the grave where he was, as it were amazed with this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, fell on his knees before the child whom the King held, and said, <hi>I accept of this new grace from the hand of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now he was scarce come forth, whenas they gave five toles with a Bell, which was a sign for all the people to prostrate themselves on the ground the second time, saying, <hi>Blessed be thou, O Lord, for so great a grace</hi>; whereupon all the bells in the City began to ring, and all the Ordnance that were on the land to shoot of, as also those of above two thousand vessells that rode at Anchor in the Port, from whence proceeded so strange a noyse, as was most insupportable to the ears of them that heard it.</p>

               </gap>, and Inhabitants; In two of those feasts the King himself was present in person, with a most sumptuous entertainment, which I shall not describe, because to say the truth I do not know how it did passe. The day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived, wherein the new <hi>Roolim,</hi> who is (as I have already declared) their Soveraign High Priest, was to make his entry into the Isle of <hi>Mounay,</hi> the whole Fleet of <hi>Seroos, Iangoas, Lauleas,</hi> and such other vessells of divers sorts which were upon the river, to the number of two thousand and better, were ranked in two files, some a league and half in length, being the space between the City &amp; the Island; so that of all those vessels joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together was formed a street, the fairest that possibly could be seen, for every vessell was covered with boughs full of several dainty fruits, together with all kind of flowers, Tangets, Standards, and banners of silk, each one striving in emulation of another to gain their pretended Jubilee, and a plenary indulgence and absolution of all the robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they had formerly committed, without being subject to the restitution of any thing whatsoever. This they did also to be absolved from an infinite of other abuses of their abhominable lives, which I passe by in silence, as a matter unfit for devout ears, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to their diabolicall Sects, and the damnable intentions of those which have instituted them, for their whole manner of living is nothing but dissolution and excesse in the lasciviousnesse of the flesh, as in like manner are all other infidells, and arch-here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques. In the <hi>Roolims</hi> company there were not above thirty <hi>Lauleas</hi>; who were reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with a great number of the Nobility; as for him he was in a rich <hi>Seroo,</hi> seated in a Throne of silver, under a cloth of State of cloth of gold, and the King at his feet, as not being worthy to sit in a more eminent place; round about him were thirty children on their knees attired in Crimson Sattin, with silver Maces on their shoulders, and twelve standing on their feet cloathed with white Damask, having censors in their hands, from whence breathed forth most delicate perfumes. In the rest of the shipping followed two hundred of the most honorable <hi>Talagrepos,</hi> such as Archbishops and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prelates may be amongst us, in the number of whom were also six or seven young Princes, all the Sons of Kings, comprehended. Now because these Vessells were so full of people as one could not row, they had fifteen <hi>Lauleas,</hi> or little <hi>Skiffes,</hi> wherein the Supreme religious men of those nine Sects did row, to bring them the sooner to land. In this equipage, and in this order the new <hi>Roolim</hi> parted from the City of <hi>Martabano</hi> two hours before day, and continued his course amidst these Vessell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As soon as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to set forth, a Canon was shot off three times, at which sign there was such a noyse of Bells, and great Ordnance, as also of divers sorts of very strange Instruments intermingled with the cries and acclamations of the people, as one would have thought that heaven and earth would have come together. When he was arrived at the <hi>Kay,</hi> where he was to land, he was received with a solemn Procession by certain religious men that live in solitary places, and are called <hi>Menigr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. LXIII. That which the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> did after his arrivall at the City of <hi>Pegu,</hi> together with his besieging of <hi>Savady.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TWo and twenty daies after the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> arrived at the City of <hi>Pegu,</hi> he perceived by the Letter which his Ambassador brought him from the <hi>Calaminham,</hi> that he had concluded the League with him against the <hi>Siamon,</hi> yet in regard the season was not fit for him, either to commence that war, or to assail the Kingdome of <hi>Avaa,</hi> as he desired, he resolved to send his Foster-brother, unto whom, as I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, he had given the title of lawfull Brother, to the siege of <hi>Savady,</hi> which was some hundred and thirty Leagues from thence to the North-East. Having assembled an Army then of an hundred and fifty thousand men, amongst whom were thirty thousand strangers of divers Nations, and five thousand fighting Elephants, besides three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand others that carried the baggage, and the victualls, the <hi>Chaumigrem</hi> departed from <hi>Pegu</hi> with a Fleet of thirteen hundred rowing Vessells, the fifteenth of the moneth of <hi>March.</hi> Fourteen daies after he arrived in the sight of <hi>Savady,</hi> and having cast Anchor neer to a great Plain, called <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50126:131"/>
people were at in planting their ladders against the walls, by reason of their bad scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which was all of Slate; whereupon consulting with his Commanders about what he should do, they were all of opinion to have it battered with the Canon on the weakest side, untill that by the overthrow of some part of the wall, a breach might be made, whereby they might enter with more ease and lesse danger. This resolution was as soon executed as taken, so that the Ingineers fell to making of two manner of bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works on the outside upon a great Platform, composed of great beams and bavins, which in five daies they raised up to such an height, as it surpassed the wall two fathom at the least. This done, they planted on each bulwark twenty great pieces of Ordnance, wherewith they began to batter the Town so violently, that in a little time they beat down a pane of the wall; and besides those pieces of battery, there were above three hundred Falcons that shot incessantly, with an intention only to kill those that were in the streets, as indeed they made a great havock, which was the cause that seeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so ill-intreated, and their people slain in that manner, they resolved, like valiant men as they were, to sell their lives as dearly as they could, so that one morning having sallied forth by the same breach of the wall which the Canon had made, they gave so valiantly upon those of the Camp, that in lesse then an hour they almost routed the <hi>Bramaas</hi> whole Army. Now because it began to be day, the <hi>Savadis</hi> thought it fit to re-enter into the Town, leaving eight thousand of their enemies dead on the place. After this they repaired the breach in a very little time by the means of a rampire of earth, which they made up with bavins and other materialls, that was strong enough to resist the Canon. Hereupon the <hi>Chaumigrem</hi> seeing the bad successe he had had, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to make war, both upon the places neer about, as also upon the frontiers that were furthest off from the Town, for which purpose he sent <hi>Diosa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neverthelesse it pleased our Lord that amidst this defeat we saved our selves by the favour of the night, and without knowing whither we went, we took the way of a very craggy mountain, where we marched in exceeding great pain three daies and an half, at the end whereof we entred into certain Moorish Plains, where we could meet with no path or way, nor having other company then Tygers, Serpents, and other savage beasts, which put us into a mighty fear. But as our God, whom incessantly we invoked with tears in our eys is the true guide of travellers, he out of his infinite mercy permitted, that at length we perceived one evening a certain fire towards the East, so that continuing our course towards that place where we saw this light, we found our selves the next morning neer to a great Lake, where there were some Cottages, which in all likelyhood were inhabited by very poor people; howbeit not daring to discover our selves as yet, we hid us all that day in certain hanging pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices that were very boggy, and full of Horsle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At last with much pain we got to another Lake, that was far greater then the former, upon the bank whereof was a little Temple in the form of an Hermitage, and there we found an old Hermite, who gave us the best entertainment that possibly he could: This old man permitted us to repose our selves two daies with him, during which time we demanded many things of him that made for our purpose; whereunto he alwaies answered according to the truth, and told us, that we were still within the Territories of the King of <hi>Savady,</hi> that this Lake was called <hi>Oreg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King apprehending the event of this threatning, caused all these children, being fourscore and five thousand in number, to be brought all into one place, and so upon a day that was kept very solemn amongst them, he made them to be put most inhumanely to the edge of the sword, with an intent to have them burned the next morning in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; but the night following there came a great earthquake, and such lightning and fire fell from heaven upon the Town, as within lesse then half an hour it was quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished, and all that was in it reduced to nothing, so that by this just judgement of God, the King, together with all his were strucken dead, not so much as one escaping, and besides them thirty thousand Priests in like manner, who ever since during all the New Moons are heard to cry and roar so dreadfully, that all the inhabitants therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts were ready to go besides themselves with fear, by reason whereof the Country was utterly depopulated, no other habitation remaining therein, save only fourscore and five Hermitages, which were erected in memory of the fourscore and five thousand children, whom the King had caused to be butchered through the evill counsell of his Priests.</p>

In this manner we marched still along by this river, which we kept for a guide of our voyage, because we judged that how long soever it were, yet would it at last ingulfe it self in the Sea, where we hoped that our Lord would raise us up some remedy for our miseries. The day ensuing we arrived at a village called <hi>Pommiseray,</hi> where we hid our selves in a very thick wood from being descried by passengers, and two hours within night we continued our design in following the current of this river, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to take our death in good part, if it should please God to send it us, for to put an end to so many sufferings as we had undergone day and night; and without lying, the apprehension and visions of this last end troubled us more then death it self, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we imagined our selves to be already ensnared. At the end of seventeen daies, that this painfull and sad voyage had lasted, God shewed us so much grace, that during the obscurity of a very rainy night, we discovered a certain light little more then a Faulcon shot before us, the fear we were in at the first that we were neer some Town, made us to stand still for a good space, without knowing what to resolve upon, untill we observed that this light seemed to move, whereby we conjectured that it was some Vessell which went from one port to another; as indeed half an hour after we percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one, wherein there were nine persons, who approaching to the bank of the river, neer to the place where we were, landed all in a Creek that was there in the form of an Haven, and presently making a fire, they began to prepare their supper, which was no sooner ready, but they fell to eating with great demonstrations of mirth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they bestowed a pretty good time. At length when they were well replenished with meat and drink, it happened that all nine of them, amongst whom there were three women, fell fast asleep; whereupon seeing that we could not find a more favourable occasion to make our benefit of this adventure, we went all eight of us very softly into the barque, that stuck half in the Ouze, and was tyed fast to a great stake, which push<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth with our shoulders we set aflote, and then imbarquing our selves in it with all speed, we began to row down the river with as little noyse as possibly we could make.

Having questioned them about many things vvhich served for our purpose, they could give us no pertinent ansvver thereunto, alledging still, that they vvere but poor vvomen, vvho upon a solemn vovv had renounced all things in the vvorld, and confined themselves into this inclosure, vvhere they bestovved all their time in continuall prayer to <hi>Quiay Ponuedea,</hi> vvhich moves the clouds of heaven, that he vvould be pleased to give them rain, vvhereby their grounds might be made fruitfull to produce them abandance of Rice. In this place vve spent all the day in caulking our barque, and furnishing our selves at these religious vvomens cost, vvith Rice, Sugar, French Beans, Onyons, and some smoak-dried flesh, vvherevvith they vvere sufficiently provided.

                  </gap>da,</hi> that was also his Vassall as well as all the rest of that Monarchy, for to tell him that he was within the term of six weeks to be in person at the town of <hi>Iapara,</hi> where he was then making preparation to invade the Kingdome of <hi>Passaruan.</hi> When this woman arrived in this Port, the King went in person to the Vessell where she was, from whence he carried her to his Palace with great pomp, and put her into the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his wife for her better entertainment, whilest he himself retired to another lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther off to do her the more honor. Now that one may know the reason wherefore this ambassage was executed rather by a woman then a man, you must note, that it hath alwayes been the custome of the Kings of this Kingdome to treat of the most important matters of their State by the mediation of women, especially when it concernes peace, which they observe not only in particular messages that are sent by the Lords to their Vassalls, such as this was, but also in matter of publique and generall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which is performed by ambassage from one King to another, and all the reason they give for it, is; <hi>That God hath given more gentlenesse and inclination to courtesie, yea and more authority to women then to men, who are severe, as they say, and by consequent lesse agreeable to those unto whom they are sent.</hi> Now it is their opinion, that every one of those women which the Kings are accustomed to send about affaires of importance, ought to have certain qualities for well executing of an ambassage, and worthily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the Commission which is granted to them: for first of all, they say, <hi>That she must not be a Maid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for fear she chance to lose her honor in going out of her house, because that even as with her beauty she contents every one, so by the same reason she may be a motive of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and unquietnesse in matters where unity is required, rather then an accesse to concord, and the peace which is pretended unto.</hi> To this they adde, <hi>that she must be married, or at leastwise a widdow after a lawfull marriage; that if she have had children, she must have a Certificate how she hath given them all suck with her own breasts, alledging thereupon, that she who hath borne children, and doth not nourish them if she can, is rather a carnall, voluptuous, corrupted, and dishonest woman, then a true mother.</hi> And this custome is observed so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly over all this country, principally amongst persons of quality, that if a mother hath a child which she cannot give suck unto for some valuable consideration, she must make an attestation thereof, as of a thing very serious, and much importing her honor. That if being young too she happens to lose her husband, and becomes a widdow, she must for the better testifying of her vertue enter into Religion, to the end she may thereby shew, that she did not formerly marry for the pleasure which she expected from her marriage, but to have children, according to the pure and honest intention, wherewith
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50126:133"/>
God joyned together the first married couple in the terrestiall Paradise. Furthermore, that there might be nothing to be found fault with in the purity of their marriage, and that it might be altogether conformable to the Law of God, they say, that after a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is with-child, she ought no longer to have the company of her husband, because the same could not then be but dishonest and sensuall. To these conditions they add many others which I will passe over in silence, for that I think it unreasonable to use prolixity in matters that I hold worthy of excuse, if I do not relate them at length.

when he was a Christian, I am contented to passe it over in silence for the honor of his Family, being indeed of no mean extraction. In the mean time the besieged ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken notice how ill-advised they had been in suffering the enemies to labour two whole daies together peaceably in fortifying of their Camp, without any impeachment of theirs; and taking the same for a great affront, they desired their King to permit them to fal upon them the night following, alledging how it was probable that men vvearied vvith labour could not make any great use of their arms, nor be able to resist this first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuosity. The King, who at that time commanded the Kingdom of <hi>Passaruan,</hi> was young, &amp; indued with many excellent qualities vvhich made him to be exeeedingly beloved of all his subjects, for as it was reported of him, he was very liberal, no manner of Tyrant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly affable to the common people, a friend to the poor, and so charitable towards Widovvs, that if they acquainted him vvith their necessities, he relieved them instantly, and did them more good then they asked of him.

            <p>Whereas the joy,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> which this designed sally brought to all the inhabitants of the Town was generall, they never stayed till they were called, but two hours after midnight, and before the time which the King had appointed, they assembled all in a great place, which was not far from the Royall Palace, and where they of the country had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to keep their Fairs and to solemnize their most remarkable feasts on those prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall dayes which were destined to the invocation of their <hi>Pagod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

one called <hi>Panbacaluio</hi>; all of them good Commanders, very valiant, and exceeding expert in matters of war. When they were all ready, the King made them a Speech, whereby he succinctly represented unto them the confidence which he had in them touching this enterprise. After which, the better to incourage them, and assure them of his love, he took a cup of gold and drunk to them all, causing the chiefest of them to pledge him, and craving pardon of the rest, for that the time would not permit them to do the like. This gracious carriage of his so incouraged the souldiers, that without further delay the most part of them went and annoynted themselves with <hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>acos.</hi> The hour being come wherein this sally was to be made, four of twelve gates that were in the Town were opened, thorough each of the which sallied forth one of the four Captaines with his company, having first sent out for Spies into the Camp six <hi>Orobalons,</hi> of the most valiant that were about the King, whom he had honored with new titles, and with such speciall favours, as use to give courage to them that want it, and to increase it in them that are indued with some resolution. The four Captains marched a little after the six Spies, and went and joyned all together in a certain place, where they were to fight with the enemies: whereupon falling into the midst of them with a marvellous impetuosity, they fought so valiantly, that in lesse then an houres time, which the fight indured, the twelve thousand <hi>Passaru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> left above thirty thousand enemies upon the place, besides those that were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which were in a far greater number, and whereof many died afterwards. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more they took prisoner three Kings, and eight <hi>Pates,</hi> which are as the Dukes amongst us, the King of <hi>Zunda</hi> too, with whom we forty <hi>Portugalls</hi> were, could not so save himselfe, but that he was hurt with a Lance in three places, a number being killed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending him. Thus was the Camp put in so great disorder, as it was almost destroyed, the <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gueyran</hi> himself being wounded with a dart, and constrained to leap into the water, where little lacked but that he had been drowned. Whereby one may see what the force of a number of resolute and fearlesse men is against such as are surprised when least they think of it; for before that the enemies could know what they did, or the Commanders could put their souldiers into order, they were twice routed. The next morning, as soon as the day gave them leave to know the truth of the businesse, the <hi>Passeruans</hi> retired into the Towne, where they found that they had not lost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove nine hundred of their men, nor more then two or three thousand hurt.</p>
            <p>It is scarcely to be believed how much the King of <hi>Demaa</hi> was grieved with the disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the former day,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> as wel for the affront which he received from those within by the losse of his people, as for the bad successe of the beginning of this siege, whereof he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in some sort to impute the fault unto our King of <hi>Zunda,</hi> saying that this fortune had happened by the bad directions he had given to the Centinells. Now after he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the wounded should be drest, and the dead buried, he called to Councell all the Kings, Princes, and Captains of the forces that he had, both by Land and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unto whom he said, <hi>That he had made a solemn vow, and oath upon the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st contradict his will, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily they infinitely approved and commended it. He used then all kind of diligence for the new fortifying of the Camp with good ditches, strong Pallisadoes, &amp; divers Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works made of stone and timber, garnished on the inside with their Platformes, where he caused a great many of Canons to be planted, so that by this meanes the Camp was stronger then the Towne it selfe, in regard whereof the besieged did often times jeere the Centinells without, telling them, <hi>That it must needs be concluded they were notorious cowards, since instead of besieging their enemies like valiant men, they besieged themselves like feeble women, wherefore they bid them return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50126:134"/>
put upon the besiegers, who vvere greatly offended vvith them. This Tovvne had been almost three moneths besieged, and yet had the enemies advanced but little, for during all that time, vvherein there had been five batteries, and three assaults given to it, with above a thousand ladders planted against the vvalls, the besieged defended themselves still like valiant and couragious men, fortifying them selves vvith counter-mires which they opposed to the breaches, vvhich they made vvith pieces of timber taken from the houses; so that all the power of the <hi>Pangueyran,</hi> which (as I have declared) was about eight hundred thousand men, whereof the number was much diminished, was not able to give him entrance into it. Hereupon the principall Ingineer of the Camp, who was a Renegado of <hi>Maillorque,</hi> seeing that this affair had not a successe answerable to what he had promised the King, he resolved to take another far different course. To that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, with a great amasse of earth and bavins he framed a kind of a Platform, which he fortified with six rows of beames, and wrought so, that in nine dayes he raised it a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom higher then the wall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that done, he planted forty great pieces of Canon upon it, together with a number of Bases and Faulconets, wherewith he fell to battering the Town in such sort, as the besieged were therewith mightily damnified, so that the King perceiving that this invention of the enemy was the only thing in the world that could most incommodate him in the Towne, he resolved by the meanes of ten thousand Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers, who had offered themselves unto him for that purpose, and to whom for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> mark of honor he gave the title of <hi>Tygers of the world,</hi> to attacque this Fort, and they that were upon it; this matter was no sooner resolved upon, but was presently put in execution, and for the better incouragement of them, the King himselfe would be their Captaine, albeit this whole enterprise was governed by the four <hi>Panari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ons,</hi> which had formerly commanded in the first sally. Having put themselves into the field then with the rising of the Sun, they fought so valiantly without any fear at all of the dreadfull Ordnance; which were planted on the Platform, as in lesse then two <hi>Credoes</hi> they got to the top of it, and there setting on the enemies, who were thirty thousand in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they defeated them all in a very short time. The <hi>Pangueyran</hi> of <hi>Pate</hi> seeing his forces thus routed, ran thither in person with twenty thousand choice souldiers, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to beat the <hi>Passeruans</hi> from the place which they had gained, but they defended it so couragiously, as is not possible to expresse it in words. This bloudy battell having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured till evening, the <hi>Passeruan,</hi> who had lost the most part of his men, made his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat into the Towne by the gate that was next to the Platforme, whereunto having first set fire in six or seven places, it took hold of some barrells of powder, whereof there was great store there, which inflamed it so terribly in severall parts, as it was not possible to approach unto it by the space of a flight shoot; this accident was very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the besieged, because the enemies were thereby kept from joyning together, and so the Towne was for this time preserved from the great danger wherewithall it was threatned; howbeit the <hi>Passeruans</hi> scap't not so scot-free, but that of the ten thousand Volunteers imployed in this service, six thousand remained dead on the top of the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. True it is, that in the <hi>Pangueyran</hi> part there vvas above forty thousand killed, amongst the vvhhich vvere three thousand strangers of divers Nations, the most part <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Malabares,</hi> as also twelve <hi>Pates,</hi> or Dukes, five Kings, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commanders, and men of quality.</p>
            <p>All this night was spent on both sides in lamentations and complaints, as also in dressing the vvounded, and casting the dead into the river.<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> The next morning as soone as it was day the <hi>Pangueyran</hi> of <hi>Pata</hi> seeing the bad successe which his enterprise had had untill that present, could not for all that be dravvn to desist from it, so that he caused all his souldiers to prepare themselves for a nevv assaulting of the Tovvne, being persvvaded that the besieged had no great force lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XLV. The death of the King of <hi>Demaa</hi> by a very strange accident, and that which arrived thereupon.</head>
            <p>TO come again now to our history, you are to understand, that the <hi>Pangueyran</hi> of <hi>Pata,</hi> King of <hi>Demaa,</hi> being certified by some of the enemies,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> whom his men had taken prisoners, of the piteous estate whereunto the besieged were reduced, the most part of them dead, their ammunition failing, and their King dangerously hurt; all these things together carried him more ardently then ever to the assault, which he had purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with himself to give to the besieged Town. He resolved then to scale it in plain day, and to assault it with more violence then before, so that instantly great preparations were made over all the Camp, where divers Serjeants at Armes, on horseback, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Maces on their shoulders, went proclaiming aloud after the men of war had been made to assemble together with the sound of trumpets, <hi>The</hi> Pangueyran <hi>of</hi> Pata <hi>by the power of him who hath created all things, Lord of the Lands which inviron the Seas, being willing to discover unto all in generall the secret of his soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth let you know, that nine daies hence he will have you be in a readiness, to the end that with the courages of Tygers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled forces, you assist him in the assault which he intends to give unto the Town, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence whereof he liberally promiseth to do great favours, as well in money, as in honorable and remarkable titles, those to the five souldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereas contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, they which do not carry themselves valiantly in this enterprise, conformably to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, shall be executed by the way of justice, without any regard had to their condition.</hi> This Ordinance of the Kings, full of menaces, being published over every part of the Camp, put them into such an alarm, as the Commanders began incontinently to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ready, and to provide all things necessary for this assault, without scarce taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rest either day or night, making withall so great a noyse, by intermingling their hues and cries with the sounds of drums, and other instruments of war, as it could not be heard without much terror. In the mean time, whereas of the nine daies, destined for the purpose aforesaid, seven were already p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, so as there rested no more but two, at the end whereof an assault was to be given to the Towne, one morning as the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueyran</hi> sate in Councell, to resolve of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffairs of this siege with the principall Lords of his Army, as also of the means, of the time, and places, whereby they were to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault the Town, and of other necessary things, it was said, that from the diversity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, which the one and the other had, there arose so great a contention amongst them, as the King was constrained to take every ones advice in writing. During this time, whereas he had alwayes neer about him a young Page, who carried <hi>Bethel,</hi> an herb whose leaves are like unto Plantain, which these Pagans are accustomed to chaw, because it makes them have a sweet breath, and also purges the humours of the stomack; he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Page then for some of it, who at first seemed not to hear him, being much about twelve or thirteen years old, for I hold it fit to make mention of his age, in regard of that I am to say of him hereafter. Now to return to the <hi>Pangueyran,</hi> as he vvas conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing his discourse vvith his Councell of War; thorough much speaking, and somevvhat in choler, his mouth became dry, so that he asked the Page again for some <hi>Bethel,</hi> which he ordinarily carried in a little box of gold, but he heard him no more this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, then he had done the first; insomuch as the King having asked him for some the third time, one of the Lords that vvas neere to the Page pulled him by the sleeve, and bid him <hi>give the King some Bethel,</hi> vvhich immediately he did, and falling on his knees he presented him vvith the box vvhich he had in his hands; the King then took tvvo or three leaves of it, as he used to do, and vvithout being othervvise angry, giving him a light touch vvith his hand on the head, <hi>art thou deaf,</hi> said he unto him, <hi>that thou couldst not hear me?</hi> and thereupon re-entred into discourse vvith them of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. Novv because these <hi>Iaoas</hi> are the most punctillious and perfidious Nation of the vvorld, and that vvithall they of this country hold it for the greatest affront that can be done thena, vvhen one gives them a touch on the head, this young Page imagining that the King had touched him so out of a mark of so great a contempt, as he should thereby be made infamous for ever, though indeed none of the company took notice of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50126:136"/>
it, he went aside weeping and sobbing by himself, and in the end resolved to revenge the injury which the King had done him, so that drawing out a little knife which he wore at his girdle, he stabbed the King with it into the midst of the left pap, and so because the blow was mortall, the King fell instantly down on the ground, not able to say any more then these two or three words, <hi>I am dead:</hi> wherewithall those of the Councell were so frighted, as it is not possible to expresse it. After that this emotion was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle calmed, they fell first unto looking to the King, to see if some remedy might not be applied to his wound; but because he was hurt just in the heart there was no hope of recovery, so that he died within a very short time after: Presently they seized on the Page, whom they put to torture, by reason of some suspitions which they had upon this accident, but he never confessed any thing, and said nought els, save<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That he had done it of his own free will, and to be revenged of the blow which the King had given him on his head by way of contempt, as if he had struck some dog that was barking up and down the streets in the night, without considering that he was the son of the</hi> Pate Pondan, <hi>Lord of</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayaa. The Page then was impaled alive, with a good big stake, which was thrust in at his Fundament, and came out at the nape of his neck. As much was done to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to three of his brothers, and to threescore and twelve of his kinsmen, so that his whole Race was exterminated, upon which so cruell and rigorous an execution, many great troubles ensued afterwards in all the country of <hi>Iaoa,</hi> and in all the Islands of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After the end of this execution, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was made what should be done with the Kings body, whereupon there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different opinions amongst them, for some said, that to bury him in that place was as much as to leave him in the power of the <hi>Passeruans</hi>; and others, that if he were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported to <hi>Demaa,</hi> where his Tomb was, it was not possible but that it would be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted before it arrived there; whereunto was added, that if they interred him so putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and corrupted, his soul could not be received into <hi>Paradis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> according to the Law of the country, which is that of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> wherein he died. After many contestations thereupon, in the end they followed the counsell which one of our <hi>Portugals</hi> gave them, that was so profitable to him afterwards, as it was worth him above ten thousand duckats, wherewith the Lords rewarded him as it were in vye of one another for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the good service which he did then to the deceased. This counsell was, that they should put the body into a Coffin full of Lime and Camphire, and so bury it in a Junck also full of earth; so that albeit the thing was not so marvellous of it self, yet left it not to be very profitable to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> because they all found it very good, and well invented, as indeed the successe of it was such, as by means thereof the Kings body was carried to <hi>Demaa,</hi> without any kind of corruption or ill savour.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Kings body was put into the <hi>Iunck</hi> appointed for it, the King of <hi>Zun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> Generall of the Army, caused the great Ordinance and the ammunition to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued, and with the least noyse that might be, committed to safe custody the most precious things the King had, together with all the treasures of the Tents. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever care and silence was used therein, the enemy could not be kept from having some inkling of it, and from understanding how things went in the Camp, so that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly the King marched out of the Town in person, with only three thousand soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the past confederacy, who by a solemn vow caused themselves to be annoynted with the oyle which they call <hi>Minhamundi,</hi> as men resolved, and that had vowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to death. Thus fully determined as they vvere, they went and fell upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whom finding busie in trussing up their baggage, they intreated so ill, as in lesse then half an hours space, for no longer lasted the heat of the fight, they cut twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of them in pieces. Withall they took two Kings, and five <hi>Pates,</hi> or <hi>Dukes</hi> prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, together with above three hundred <hi>Turks, Abyssines,</hi> and <hi>Achems,</hi> yea and their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

There vvere also four hundred ships burnt, vvherein vvere the hurt men, so that by this means all the Camp vvas neer lost. After this the King retreated into the Tovvn vvith his men, vvhereof he lost but four hundred. In the mean time the King of <hi>Zunda</hi> having caused the remainder of the Army to be re-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued vvith all speed the same day, being the nineth of <hi>March,</hi> they set saile
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50126:136"/>
directly for the City of <hi>Demaa,</hi> bringing along with them the body of the <hi>Pangueyran,</hi> vvhich upon the arrivall thereof vvas received by the people vvith great cries, and strange demonstrations of a universall mourning. The day after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vievv vvas taken of all the men of vvar, for to knovv hovv many vvere dead, and there vvas found missing an hundred and thirty thousand; vvhereas the <hi>Passeruans,</hi> according to report, had lost but five and tvventy thousand; but be it as it vvill, and let fortune make the best market that she can of these things, yet they never arrive, but the field is died vvith the bloud of the vanquishers, and by a stronger reason vvith that of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, to vvhom these events do alvvayes cost far dearer, then to the others. The same day there vvas question of creating a nevv <hi>Pangueyran,</hi> vvho, as I have said heretofore, is Emperor over all the <hi>Pates</hi> and Kings of that great Archipelago, vvhich the <hi>Chineses, Tartar, Iapon,</hi> and <hi>Lequio,</hi> Historians are vvont to call <hi>Raterra Vendau,</hi> that is to say, <hi>the eye-lid of the world,</hi> as one may see in the Card, if the elevation of the heights prove true. Novv because that after the death of the <hi>Pangueyran,</hi> there vvas not a lavvfull suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor to be found that might inherit this Crovvn, it vvas resolved that one should be made by election; for vvhich effect by the common consent of all, eight men vvere cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, as heads of all the people, to create a <hi>Pangueyran.</hi> These same assembled then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a house, and after order had been taken for the pacifying of all things in the City, they continued seven vvhole daies together vvithout being able to come to any agreement about this election; for vvhereas there vvere eight pretendents of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Lords of the Kingdome, there vvere found amongst these Electors many different opinions, vvhich proceeded from this, that the most part, or all of them, vvere meerly allied to these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ight, or to their kinsmen, so that each one laboured to make him <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueyran,</hi> vvhich vvas most to his mind. Whereupon the inhabitants of the City, and the souldiers of the Army, making use of this delay to their advantage, as men vvho imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that this affair vvould never be terminated, and that there vvould be no chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them, they began shamelessly to break out into all kind of actions full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency and malice. And forasmuch as there vvas a great number of Merchants Ships in the Port, they got aboard them, and fell pell-mell to rifling both of strangers, and those of the country, vvith so much licentiousnesse, as it vvas said, that in four daies they took an hundred Juncks, vvherein they killed above six thousand men; vvhereof notice being given to the King of <hi>Panaruca,</hi> Prince of <hi>Balambuam,</hi> and Admirall of the Sea of this Empire, he ran thither with all speed, and of the number of those which were convicted of manifest robbery, he caused fourscore to be hanged all along the shore, to the terror of those that should behold them. After this action, <hi>Quiay Ansedeaa, Pate</hi> or Duke of <hi>Cherbom,</hi> who was Governor of the Towne, and greatly in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, taking this which the King of <hi>Panaruca</hi> had done for a manifest contempt, because he had, said he, little respected his charge of Governor, was so mightily offended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For whereas these two heads were great Lords, one Admirall of the Fleet, the other Governor of the Town, and both of them allied to the principall families of the Country, the devill sowed so great a division amongst them, as if night had not separated the fight, it is credible that not one of them had escaped; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the difference went yet much farther, and ended not so; for the men of war, who were at that time above six hundred thousand in number, coming to consider the great affront which <hi>Quiay Ansedeaa,</hi> Governor of the Town, had done to their Admirall, they to be revenged thereof went all ashore the same night, the <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus all of them animated and transported with wrath, and a desire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, went and set upon <hi>Quiay Ansedeaas</hi> house, where they slew him, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men; wherewith not contented, they assaulted the Town in ten or eleven places, and fell to killing and plundering all that ever they met with, so that they carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

therein with so much violence, as in three daies alone, which was as long as the siege of this Town last<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There was withall so great a confusion of howling, weeping, and heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, as all that heard it could think no other but that the earth was going to turn topsie turvy. In a word, and not to lose time in aggravating this with superfluous speeches, the Town was all on fire, which burnt to the very foundations, so that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to report there were above an hundred thousand houses consumed, above three hundred thousand persons cut in pieces, and almost as many made prisoners, which were led away slaves, and sold in divers countries. Besides, there was an infinite of riches stollen, whereof the value, as it was said, only in silver and gold, amounted even to forty millions, and all put together, to an hundred millions of gold. As for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of prisoners, and of such as were slain, it was neer five hundred thousand persons; and all these things arrived by the evill counsell of a young King, bred up amongst young people like himself, who did every thing at his own pleasure, without any body contradicting him.</p>

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse driving along we got to the Isle of <hi>Lingua,</hi> where a tempest surprised us at <hi>West</hi> and <hi>South-West,</hi> with so impetuous a wind, as strugling against the billow, it kept us from making use of our sails: so that being in fear of rocks and shelves of sand, which were on the Prow side, we steered the other way, untill that after some time the Forekeel of our Poup opened within nine hand-bredths of the water, which was the cause, seeing our selves so neer unto death, that we were inforced to cut down our two masts, and to cast all our Merchandises into the Sea, whereby our Ship was somwhat eased. This done, vvhereas vve had left our ship the rest of the day, and a good part of the night to the mercy of the Sea, it pleased our Lord out of an effect of his divine justice, that without knowing how, or without seeing any thing, our ship ran her self against a rock, with the death of seventy and tvvo persons. This miserable successe so deprived us of all our understanding and forces, that not so much as one of us ever thought of any way saving himself, as the <hi>Chineses,</hi> whom we had for Mariners in our Junck had done, for they had so bestirred themselves all the night long, that before it was day they had made a raft of such planks and beams as came to their hands, tying them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in such sort with the cordage of their sails, that forty persons might abide upon it with ease. Now whereas we were all in an imminent danger, and in a time wherein (as they say) the father does nothing for the son, nor the son for the father, no man took care but for himselfe alone, whereof we had a fair example in our <hi>Chinese</hi>-Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whom we accounted but as our slaves; for <hi>Martin Esteuez,</hi> the Captain and Master of the Junck, having intreated his own servants, vvho vvere upon the raft, to receive him amongst them, they ansvvered him, that they could not do it at any hand, vvhich

In the mean time, as it is the property of the divine mercy never to forsake the poore sufferers that are upon the earth, it permitted us to see coming along in a channell of fresh water, that ran ingulphing it selfe into the Sea, a little barque, laden with timber and other wood, wherein were nine <hi>Negroes, Iaoas,</hi> and <hi>Papua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now whereas these <hi>Iaoas</hi> are naturally inclined to avarice, when they heard us talk of their interest, they began to be more tractable, and gave us better words, with hope of doing that which we desired of them, but these courtesies lasted no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but till such time as they could get again into their barque, which they had quitted; for as soon as they saw themselves aboard her, they put off from the land, and making as though they would part without taking us in, they told us, that to be assured of what we had said to them, they would have us before they proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further, to yeeld up our armes to them, whereas otherwise they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take us in, no not though they saw us eaten up with Lions. Seeing our selves thus constrained by necessity, and by a certain dispair of finding any other remedy to our present extremity, we were inforced to do all that these men required of us; so that having brought their barque a little neerer, they bid us swim to them, because they had never a boat to fetch us from the shore, which we presently resolved to do.

There he abode above seven daies to attend four thousand Elephants which came to him by Land. During that time, he was certified that the Town was greatly prest, both on the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers side, which the enemies had seized upon with two thousand Vessels, as also towards the Land, where there were so many men, as the number of them was not truly known, but as it was judged by conjecture, they might be some three hundred thousand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of forty thousand were horse, but no Elephants at all. This news made the King h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With this Army he parted from <hi>Suropisem,</hi> and drew towards <hi>Quitiruan,</hi> marching not above four or five leagues a day. At the end of the the third, then he arrived at a valley called <hi>Siputay,</hi> a league and an half from the place where the enemies lay.

As soon as they discovered him, they presently advanced, and with their vant-guard, which were the said forty thousand horse, they so charged the King of <hi>Siams</hi> rearward, composed of threescore thousand foot, as they defeated them in lesse then a quarter of an hour, with the losse of three Princes that were slaine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place. The King of <hi>Siam</hi> seeing his men thus routed, resolved not to follow the order which he had formerly appointed, but to fall on with the whole body of his Army, and the four thousand Elephants joyned together. With these forces he gave upon the battalion of the enemies with so much impetuosity, as at this first shock they were wholly discomfited, from whence ensued the death of an infinite company of men; for whereas their prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In the meane time the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the honor of the victory, pursued them to the rivers side, which the enemies perceiving, they formed a new Squadron of all those that remained of them, wherein there were above an hundred thousand men, as well sound as hurt, and so past all the same day there, joyned together in one entire body of an Army, the King not daring to fight with them, by reason he saw them fortified with two thousand ships, wherein there were great numbers of men. Neverthelesse as soon as it was dark night the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies began to march away with all speed all along by the river, wherewith the King was nothing displeased, because the most part of his souldiers being hurt, they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to be drest, as indeed that was presently executed, and the most part of the day and the night following imployed therein.</p>
            <p>After the King of <hi>Siam</hi> had obtained so happy a victory,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> the first thing that he did was to provide with all diligence for the fortifications of the town, and whatsoever els he thought to be necessary for the security thereof. After that he commanded a generall muster to be made of all his men of war, that he might know how many he had lost in this battell; whereupon he found that some fifty thousand were wanting, all men of little reckoning, whom the rigor of the Kings Edict had compelled to serve in this war, ill provided, and without defensive arms: As for the enemies, it was known the next day that an hundred and thirty thousand of them had been slain. As soon as the hurt men were recovered, the King, having put into the principall places of this frontier such guards as seemed requisite to him, was counselled by his Lords to make war upon the Kingdom of <hi>Guibem,</hi> which was not above fifteen leagues from thence on the North side, to be revenged on the Queen of <hi>Guibem,</hi> for having given free passage tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough her dominions to those of <hi>Chiammay,</hi> in regard whereof he attributed to her the losse of <hi>Oyaa Capimper,</hi> and the thirty thousand men that had been killed with him. The King approving of this advice, parted from this town with an army of foure hundred thousand men, and went and fell upon one of this Queens towns, called <hi>Fumbacor,</hi> which was easily taken, and all the inhabitants put to the sword, not one excepted. This done, he continued his voyage till he came to <hi>Guitor,</hi> the capitall town of the Kingdom of <hi>Guibem,</hi> where the Queen then was, who being a widdow governed the State under the title of Regent, during the minority of her son, that was about the age of nine years: At his arrivall he laid siege to the Town, and forasmuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Queen found not her self strong enough to resist the King of <hi>Siams</hi> power, she fell to accord with him to pay him an annuall tribute of five thousand <hi>Turmes</hi> of silver, which are threescore thousand Duckats of our money, whereof she paid him five years advance in hand. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, the young Prince her son did him homage as his vassall, and the King led him away with him to <hi>Siam.</hi> Hereupon he raised his siege from before the Town, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on towards the North-East to the Town of <hi>Taysiran,</hi> where he had news that the King of <hi>Chiammay</hi> was fallen off from the league aforesaid. In the mean time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he had been six daies march in the enemies territories, he sacked as many places as he met withall, not permitting the life of any male whatsoever to be saved. So proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onward, he arrived at the Lake of <hi>Singipamor,</hi> which ordinarily is called <hi>Chiammay,</hi> where he stayed six and twenty daies, during the which he took twelve goodly places, invironed with ditches and bullworks after our fashion, all of brick and mortar, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any stone or lime in them, because in the country it is not the custome to build so;
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50126:140"/>
but they had no other Artillery then some Faulconets, and certain muskets of brasse. Now forasmuch as winter began to approach, and that it was very rainy weather, the King too feeling himself not very well, he retired back again to the Town of <hi>Quiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruan,</hi> where he tarried three and twenty daies and better, in which space he made an end of fortifying it with walls, and many broad and deep ditches, so that having put this Town into an estate of being able to defend it self against any attempt, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued his Army in the three thousand vessells which brought him thither, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned towards <hi>Siam.</hi> Nine daies after he arrived at <hi>Odiaa,</hi> the chiefe City of his whole Kingdome, where for the most part he kept his Court.

Now forasmuch as this Prince had lived in the reputation of being charitable to the poor, liberall in his benefits and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences, pitifull and gentle toward every one, and above all incorrupt in doing of justice, and chastising the wicked; his subjects spake so amply thereof in their lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if all that they said of it was true, we are to believe, that there was never a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter King then he, either amongst these Pagans, or in all the countries of the world.

               </hi> the <hi>Iohn,</hi> the third of glorious memory wrote him a letter, whereby above all things he recommended unto him his using all possible means for the redeeming of a certain <hi>Domingos de Seixas,</hi> who for the space of three and twenty years had been a slave in the Kingdome of <hi>Siam,</hi> adding that the doing thereof would be very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant for Gods service and his, in regard he was informed, that from him, rather then from any other he might be certified of the great things which were recounted to him of this Kingdome; and in case he could redeem this Christian, that he should send him incontinently to <hi>Don Garcia,</hi> the Vice-Roy of the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> to whom he had also writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that he should imbarque him in the ship which was to part that year for to returne into <hi>Portugal. Pedro de Faria</hi> had no sooner received this letter, but seeing with how much care the King his Master recommended this affair unto him, he sent us his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to <hi>Siam</hi> one <hi>Francisco de Crasto,</hi> a noble and very rich man, to the end he should treat about the ransome of this <hi>Domingos de Seixas,</hi> and other sixteen <hi>Portugals,</hi> which were also slaves there as well as he. According to this Commission <hi>Francisco de Castro</hi> came to the City of <hi>Odiaa,</hi> whilest I was there, where he delivered his letter to the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> who gave him a very good reception, and after he had read it, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned him concerning many new and curious things, he answered him presently, which was a thing he did not usually do to any Ambassador, his answer contained this much, <hi>As for</hi> Domingos de Seixas, <hi>whom the Captain of</hi> Malaca <hi>sends to me for, adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

me that I shall do the King of</hi> Portugal <hi>a great pleasure in releasing him, I do most willingly grant to do it, as also to deliver all the rest that are with him.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco de Crasto,</hi> having had this dispatch from the King, gave him most humble thanks for it, and prostrated himself three severall times before him, with his head bowed down to the ground, as the custome was to do unto this King, in regard he was more absolute then others. Whenas then the season permitted <hi>Francisco de Castro</hi> to return to <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> the King sent to fetch <hi>Domingos de Seixas</hi> from the Town of <hi>Goutaleu,</hi> where he was at that time Generall of the Frontire, having under his charge thirty thousand foot, five thousand horse, and eighteen thousand duckats pension by the year: With him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so he caused to be brought the other sixteen <hi>Portugals,</hi> and consigned them all into the hands of <hi>Francisco de Castro,</hi> who gave him thanks again for the grace which he did him. A little after, whenas <hi>Domingos de Seixas</hi> and his companions went to take their leave of this King, he caused a thousand turmes of silver to be given to them, which are in value twelve thousand duckats of our money, and desired them to pardon him for giving them so little.

Now whereas there is no place where money is not powerfull enough to overthrow all things, and from which a man can hardly defend himself, the Colonel <hi>Raudiuaa</hi> suffered himself to be overcome with such a masse of coyn as these men presented him with, and consented that they should not budge from their homes.

As for those effeminate men, who to be exempted from going to the war had given the five thousand <hi>Turmes</hi> to the Colonell, he commanded them to be attired like women, and so banished them into an Island called <hi>Pulho Caton</hi>; wherewith yet not contented, he confiscated all their estates, which he ordered should be bestowed on such as behaved themselves best in the war.

Things past thus for the space of four moneths and an half, during the which there was no manner of disorder, but all was peaceable in the Kingdome; howbeit at the end of that time, the Queen coming to be delivered of a Son which she had had by her Purveyor, being displeased with the bad report that went of her, she resolved with her self to satisfie her desire, which was to marry with the Father of this new Son, for that she was desperately in love with him: And further, she wickedly enterprised to make away the new King, her lawfull child, to the end that by this means the Crown might passe to the bastard by right of inheritance. Now to execute this horrible design of hers, she made shew that the excesse of her affection to the young King her Son, kept her always in fear, left some attempt should be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his life; so that one day having caused all the Councell of the State to be assembled, the represented unto them, that having but this only pearl enchaced in her heart, she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to keep it from being plucked from thence by some disaster; for which effect she thought it requisite, as well to secure her from her apprehensions, as to prevent the great mischiefs which carelessenesse is wont to bring in such like cases, that there should be a guard set about the Palace, and the person of the King. This affair was immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in the Councell, and accorded to the Queen, in regard the matter seemed good of it self. The Queen seeing then that her design had succeeded so well, took instantly for the guard of the Palace, and the person of her Son, such as she judged were proper for the executing of her damnable enterprise, and in whom she most confided. She or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a guard then of two thousand foot, and five hundred horse, besides the ordinary guard of her house, which were six hundred <hi>Cauehins</hi> and <hi>Lequios,</hi> and thereof she made Captain one called <hi>Tileubacus,</hi> the cozen of the same Purveyor, by whom she had had a child, to the end that by this mans favour she might dispose of things as she pleased, and the more easily bring to passe her pernicious design. Whereupon relying on the great forces which she had already on her party, she began to revenge her self upon some of the great ones of the Kingdome, because she knew they despised her, and held her not in that esteem she desired, The two first whom she caused to be laid hands on were two Deputies of the Government, making use of this pretext, that they held secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with the King of <hi>Chiamway,</hi> and were to give him an entry into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome thorough their lands, so that under colour of justice she caused them to be both executed, and confiscated their estates, whereof she gave the one to her Favorite, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50126:143"/>
the other to a brother-in-law of his, who (it was said) had been a Smith: But in regard this execution had been done precipitously, and without any proof, the greatest part of the Lords of the Kingdom murmured against the Queen for it, representing unto her the merit of them whom she had put to death, the services they had rendred to the Crown, the qualitie of the persons, and the nobility and antiquity of their extractions, as being of the bloud royall, and lineally descended from the Kings of <hi>Siam,</hi> howbeit she made no reckoning thereof, but contrarily a little after making show as if she had not been well, she in a full Councill renounced her regency, and conferred it on <hi>Vquumcheuiraa,</hi> her Favorite, to the end that by this means bearing rule over all others, he might dispose of the affairs of the kingdom at his pleasure, and give the most important charges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to such as would be of his party, which he thought to be the most assured way for him to usurp this Crown, and make himself absolute Lord of the Empire of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With all these inventions this Queen used so great diligence for the contenting of the desire which she had to raise her Favorite to the Royalty, to marry her self to him, and to make the illegitimate son, which she had bad by him, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor of the Crown, as within the space of eight moneths, fortune favouring her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, and hoping more fully to execute her wicked plot, shee caused most of the great men of the kingdom to be put to death, and confiscated all their lands, goods and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which she distributed amongst such of her creatures as she daily drew to her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now forasmuch as the young King her son served for the principall obstacle to her intentions, this young Prince could not escape her abominable fury, for she her self poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned him even as she had poysoned the King his father. That done, she married with <hi>Vquumcheniraa,</hi> who had been one of the Purveyors of her house, and caused him to be crowned King in the city of <hi>Odiaa,</hi> the eleventh of November in the yeare one thousand five hundred forty five. But whereas Heaven never leaves wicked actions unpunished, the year after, one thousand five hundred forty and six, and on the fifteenth day of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, they were both of them slain by <hi>Oyaa Passilico,</hi> and the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain banquet which these Princes made in a Temple, that was called <hi>Quiay Figrau,</hi> that is to say, <hi>the god of the atoms of the Sun,</hi> whose solemnity was that day celebrated: So that, as well by the death of these two persons, as of all the rest of their party, whom these Princes also killed with them, all things became very peaceable, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prejudice to the people of the kingdom; onely it is true, that it was despoyled of the most part of the Nobility, which formerly it had, by the wicked inventions, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious practices, whereof I have spoken before.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>During the first five daies that the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> had been before the City of <hi>Odiaa,</hi> he had bestowed labour and pains enough, as well in making of trenches and Pallisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, as in providing all things necessary for this siege, in all which time the besieged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offered to stir, whereof <hi>Diego Suarez,</hi> the Marshall of the Camp being aware, as also of the little reckoning which the <hi>Siamites</hi> made of so great a power as was there assembled, and not knowing whereunto he should attribute the cause of it, he resolved to execute the design for which he came, to which effect, of the most part of the men which he had under his command, he made two separated Squadrons, in each of which there were six battalions of six thousand a piece. After this manner he marched in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell array, at the sound of many instruments, towards the two points which the City made on the South-side, because the entrance there seemed more facile to him then any other where. So upon the nineteenth day of <hi>Iune,</hi> in the year one thousand five hundred forty and eight, an hour before day, all these men of war, having set up above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand ladders against the walls, endeavoured to mount up on them; but the besieged op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed them so valiantly, that in lesse then half an hour there remained dead on the place above ten thousand on either part. In the mean time the King, who incouraged his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, seeing the ill successe of this fight, commanded these to retreat, and then made the wall to be assaulted afresh, making use for that effect of five thousand Elephants of war which he had brought thither, and divided into twenty troops, of two hundred and fifty apiece, upon whom there were twenty thousand <hi>Moe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For whereas all the Elephants carried wooden Castles on their backs, from whence they shot with muskets, brasse cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verins, and a great number of harquzes a crock, each of them ten or twelve spans long, these guns made such an havock of the besieged, that in lesse then a quarter of an hour the most of them were beaten down; the Elephants withall setting their trunks to the target fences, which served as battlements, and wherewith they within defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, tore them down in such sort, as not one of them remained entire, so that by this means the wall was abandoned of all defence, no man daring to shew himself above. In this sort was the entry into the City very easie to the Assailants, who being invited by so good successe to make their profit of so favourable an occasion, set up their ladders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain which they had quitted, and mounting up by them to the top of the wall, with a world of cries and acclamations, they planted thereon in sign of victory a number of Banners and Ensigns. Now because the <hi>Turks</hi> desired to have therein a better share then the rest, they besought the King to do them so much favour as to give them the vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, which the King easily granted them, and that by the counsell of <hi>Diego Suarez,</hi> who desired nothing more then to see their number lessened, always gave them the most dangerous imployments. They in the mean time extraordinarily contented, and proud to see themselves preferred before so many other Nations as were in the Camp, resolved to come off with honor from this service which they had undertaken. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

having formed a Squadron of twelve hundred men, wherein some <hi>Abyssius</hi> and <hi>Ianizaries</hi> were comprised, they mounted with great cries by those ladders up to the top of the wall, which as I have declared, was at that time in the power of the King of <hi>Bramaaes</hi> people.

These <hi>Turks</hi> being gotten down, as I have said, laboured to break open a gate with two rammes which they had brought with them for that purpose; but as they were occupied about it, upon a confidence that they alone should gain the thousand bisses of gold, which the King had promised to whomsoever should open him the gates, they saw themselves suddainly charged by three thousand <hi>Ia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>The King being retired to his quarter, found himself wounded with the shot of an arrow which he received in that daies conflict, and which he felt not untill then, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the heat of the fight. This accident hindered the executing of the resolution he had taken to give another assault to the City the next day; for he was constrained to keep his bed twelve daies together, but at seventeen days end, when he was fully cured of his hurt, he undertook again the prosecution of his design, and to effect that which he had so resolved upon, namely, not to raise his siege from before the City untill he had made himself Master of it, though it cost him both his life and his whole State. He gave then a second assault unto the City, which proved like unto the former, for he lost a vvorld of men in it, so that he was forced to retreat; but his wilfullnesse was such, as nothing daunted with the great slaughter of his men, he gave five assaults more to it in the open day, wherein he made use of many warlike stratagems, which a <hi>Greek</hi> Ingineer daily invented for him; but whatsoever he could do, he was always fain to retire with losse, whereat he was greatly troubled. In the mean time, whereas the siege of this City had already indured four moneths and an half, he commanded a generall muster of his souldiers to be made, and he found that an hundred and forty thousand of them were wanting. Whereupon seeing to what estate he was reduced, for the putting of an end to the business, he resolved to assault the City again with another nevv invention, and this assault was the eighth he had already given to it, during the siege, which he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised by the Councell of war, and that under the favour of the night; for they alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, that darknesse would make the assault less dangerous, and the scaling of the walls more facile. This resolution taken, he instantly commanded all preparations necessary for this design to be made, so that in seventeen days they built up six and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Castles of strong pieces of timber, whereof each one was set upon six and twenty wheels of iron, which facilitated the motion of so great a frame. Every Castle was fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foot broad, threescore and five long, and five and twenty high, and all of them were reinforced with double beams, covered over with sheets of lead: Moreover each of them was full of wood, and had fastned to them before great iron chains, and that were very long in regard of the fire. Things thus prepared, one Friday about midnight, being very dark and rainy, the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> caused three times one after another all the great Ordnance of the Camp to be discharged, which, as I remember, I have already said, consisted of an hundred and threescore great pieces, vvhereof the most part shot i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron bullets, besides a many of Falconets, bases, and muskets, to the number of fifteen hundred, so that from all these guns shot off together three times one after another, proceeded so horrible and dreadfull a noyse, as I cannot think that any vvhere but in hell the like could be; for on whatsoever the imagination can be fixt, it cannot meet with any thing that may be rightly compared thereunto. At this time, it was not only the great pieces of Ordnance, whereof I have spoken before, and the small ones too, which were shot off, but the like was done by all the guns which were both within the City, and without in the Camp, of what bigness soever they vvere, being at least an hundred thousand in all, for whereas there were, as I have already said, threescore thousand Harquebuziers in the King of <hi>Bramaaes</hi> Army, there vvere thirty thousand also in the City, besides seven or eight thousand Falconets and Bases; so that to hear all these shot off continually for the space of three hours together, and intermingled with thunder, lightning, and the tempest of the night, was, to say the truth, a thing which was never seen, read of, or imagined, and such indeed as put every one almost besides himself; for some fell flat on the ground, some crept behind walls, and others got into walls. During the greatest violence of this horrible and furious tempest, they set fire on the six and twenty Castles which they had before brought close to the walls, so that by the force of the wind, which vvas at that time very great, and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50126:145"/>
by the means of barrels of pitch that had been put into them, they fel a flaming in such a strange manner, as there was anew to be seen so dreadfull a picture of hell (for it is the only name that can be given it, because there is nothing upon earth that may rightly he resembled unto it) that if even those which were without trembled at it, I leave you to think vvith hovv much more reason vvere they to fear it vvhom necessity constrained to abide the violence of it. Hereupon began a most bloudy conflict on either part, they without falling to scale the walls, and the besieged, who took no less care for all things then they, valiantly to defend themselves, so that no advantage was to be found on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, but rather both of them were in a condition to be utterly destroyed; for whereas the one and other reinforced themselves continually with fresh supplies, and that the King of <hi>Bramaaes</hi> obstinacy vvas such, as he went himself in person amongst his souldiers, incouraging them with his speeches, and the great promises that he made them, the fight proceeded so far, and increased so mightily, as being unable to deliver the least part of that which passed therein, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> leave it to the understanding of every one to imagine what it might be. Four hours after midnight, the six and tvventy Castles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite burned to the ground, with so terrible a blaze, as no man durst come within a stones cast of it, the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> caused a retreat to be sounded, at the request of the Captains of the strangers, for there vvere so many hurt men amongst them, as all the day, and most part of the night following was imployed in dressing of them.</p>

This news ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much perplexed the King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> so that he fell to thinking with himself what course he should take for the remedying of so great a mischief as he was threatned with: In the end he resolved to tarry a while at <hi>Martabano,</hi> to attend some of his forces that were still behind, and then to go and fight a battell with his enemy; but it was his ill luck, that in the space of fourteen days only which he abode there, of four hundred thousand men which he had, fifty thousand quitted him: For whereas they were all <hi>Peg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time the King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lest the defection of his souldiers should daily more and more increase, was advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by his Councell to stay no longer there, in regard the longer he should tarry, the more his forces would diminish, for that a great part of his Army was <hi>Pegues,</hi> which were not likely to be very faithful unto him. This counsell was approved of by the King, who presently marched away towards <hi>Pegu,</hi> neer unto which he was no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er arrived, but he was certified that the <hi>Zemindoo,</hi> being advertised of his coming, was attending ready to receive him. So these two Kings being in the view of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, incamped in a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next day these two Armies being put into battell array, came to joyn together one Friday the sixteenth of <hi>November,</hi> the same year, a thousand five hundred forty and eight. It was about six of the clock in the morning when first they began their incounter, vvhich vvas performed vvith so much violence, as a generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat ensued thereupon, yet fought they with an invincible courage on either part; but the <hi>Zemindoo</hi> had the worse, for in lesse then three hours his whole Army was rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the slaughter of three hundred thousand of his men, so that in this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity he vvas forced to save himself only with six horse in a fortress, called <hi>Battelor,</hi> where he stayed but one hour, during the vvhich, he furnished himself with a little Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, wherein he fled the night ensuing up the river to <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

charge. This kingdom, as may be seen in the Map, is seven hundred leagues in length, and a hundred and threescore in bredth; the most part of it consists in great plaines, where are a world of corn grounds, and rivers of fresh water, by reason whereof the Country is exceeding fertile, and abundantly stored with cattell and victualls. In the most eminent parts of it are thick Forests of <hi>Angelin</hi> wood, whereof thousands of ships might be made; there are also many mines of Silver, Iron, Steel, Lead, Tin, Saltpetre, and Brimstone; likewise great abundance of Silk, Aloes, Benjamin, Lacre, Indico, Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton wooll, Rubies, Saphires, Ivory and gold; There is moreover in the woods marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous store of Brasill and Ebony, wherewith an hundred Juncks are every year laden, to be transported to <hi>China, Hainan,</hi> the <hi>Lequios, Camboya</hi> and <hi>Camp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Kings yearly revenue is ordinarily twelve millions of gold, over and above the presents which the great Lords make him, that comes to a great matter. In the jurisdiction of his territories there are six and twenty hundred populations, which they call <hi>Prodou,</hi> as cities and towns amongst us, besides villages and small hamlets, whereof I have no reckoning. The most part of those populations have no other fortifications or walls, then palisadoes of wood, so that it would be easie for any that should attaque them to make themselves masters thereof; the rather for that the inhabitants of those places are naturally effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and destitute of arms offensive and defensive. This coast of this kingdom joyns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the two North and South Seas; on that of the <hi>Indiaes</hi> by <hi>Iunçalo</hi> and <hi>Tanauçarius,</hi> and on that of <hi>China</hi> by <hi>Monpolocata, Cuy, Lugor, Chintabu,</hi> and <hi>Berdio.</hi> The capitall City of all this Empire is <hi>Odiaa,</hi> whereof I have spoken heretofore; it is fortified with walls of brick and mortar, and contains, according to some, foure hundred thousand fires, whereof an hundred thousand are strangers of divers countries of the world: for whereas the country is very rich of it self, and of great traffick, there passes not a yeare whereunto from the Provinces and Islands of <hi>Iaoa, Bale, Madoura, Augenio, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King naturally is no way given to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. The customs of all the Kingdome are charitably destinated for the maintenance of certain <hi>Pagodes,</hi> where the duties that are paid are very easie; for whereas the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men are forbidden to trade with money, they take no more of Merchants then what they will give them out of almes. There are in this Country twelve Sects of Gentiles, as in the Kingdome of <hi>Pegu</hi>; and the King for a soveraigne title causeth himself to be called <hi>Prechau Saliu,</hi> which in our tongue signifies, <hi>A holy member of God.</hi> He shewes not himself to the people save only twice in the year, but then with so much riches and majesty, as he hath power and greatnesse, and yet for all this that I say, he less not to acknowledge himself the vassall and tributarie to the King of <hi>China,</hi> to the end that by means thereof his subjects Juncks may be admitted into the port of <hi>Combay,</hi> where or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily they exercise their commerce. There is also in this Kingdome a great quantity of Pepper, Ginger, Cinamon, Camphire, Allume, Cassia, Tamarinds and Cardamon; so as one may truly affirm that, which I have often heard say in those parts, namely, that this Kingdom is one of the best countries in the world, and easier to be subdued then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Province, how little soever, I could here report likewise many more particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of things which I have seen only in the city of <hi>Odiaa,</hi> but I am not minded to make mention of them, that I may not beget in them that shall read this the same grief which I have for the losse which we made of it through our sins, and the gain we might make in conquering this Kingdom.</p>

            <head>CHAP. LXXI. A continuation of that which happened in the Kingdome of <hi>Pegu,</hi> as well during the life, as after the death of the King of <hi>Bramaa.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TO return now unto the history which heretofore I have left, you must know, that after the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> had obtained that memorable victory neer to <hi>Pegu,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 1.</note> as I have declared heretofore, by means whereof he remained peaceable possessor of the whole Kingdom, the first thing he imployed himself in was to punish the offendors, which had formerly rebelled; for which effect he cut off the heads of a great many of the Nobility, and Commanders, all whose estates were confiscated to the Crown, which (according to report) amounted unto ten millions of gold, besides plate and jewells, whereby that common Proverb, which was common in the mouths of all, was verified, namely, <hi>That one mans offence cost many men very deare.</hi> Whilest the King continued more and more in his cruelties, and injustice, which he executed against divers persons during the space of two moneths and a half, certain newes came to him, that the city of <hi>Martabano</hi> was revolted, with the death of two thousand <hi>Bramaas,</hi> and that the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logomin,</hi> Governour of the same city, had declared himself for the <hi>Xemindoo.</hi> But that the cause of this revolt may be the better understood by such as are curious, I will (before I proceed any further) succinctly relate, how this <hi>Xemindoo</hi> had been of a religious order in <hi>Pegu,</hi> a man of noble extraction, and (as some affirmed) neer of kin to the precedent King, whom this <hi>Bramaa</hi> had put to death twelve years before, as I have already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This <hi>Xemindoo</hi> had formerly to name <hi>Xoripam Xay,</hi> a man of about forty five years of age, of a great understanding, and held by every one for a Saint: he was withall very wel verst in the Laws of their Sects &amp; false Religion, and had many excellent parts, which rendered him so agreeable unto all that heard him preach, as he was no sooner in the Pulpit, but all the assistants prostrated themselves on the ground, saying at every word that he uttered, <hi>Assuredly God speaks in thee.</hi> This <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> seeing himself then in such great credit with the people, spurred on by the generosity of his nature, and the occasion which was then so favourable unto him, resolved to try his fortune, and see to what degree it might arrive. To this end, at such time as the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon the kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> and had laid siege to the city of <hi>Odiaa,</hi> the <hi>Xemindoo</hi> preaching in the temple of <hi>Conquiay</hi> at <hi>Pegu,</hi> which is as it were the Cathedrall of all the rest, where there was a very great assembly of people, he discoursed at large of the losse of this Kingdom, of the death of their lawfull King, as also of the great extortions, cruell punishments, and many other mischiefs which the <hi>Bramaas</hi> had done to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; with so many insolencies, and with so many offences against God, as even the very houses which had been founded by the charity of good people, to serve for Temples wherein the Divine Word might be preached, were all desolated and demolished; or if any were found still standing, they were made use of, either for stables, lay-stalls, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such places accustomed to lay filth or dung in. These, and many other such like things, which the <hi>X<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mindoo</hi> delivered, accompanied with many sighs and tears, made so great an impression in the minds of the people, as from thenceforward they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him for their lawfull King, and swore allegeance unto him; so that instead of calling him, as they did before, <hi>Xoripam Xay,</hi> they named him <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> as a soveraigne title which they gave him above all others. Seeing himself raised then to the dignity of King, the first thing during the heat and fury of this people, was to go to the King of <hi>Bramaas</hi> palace, where having found five thousand <hi>Bramaas,</hi> he cut them all in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not sparing the life of one of them; the like did he afterwards to all the rest of them that were abiding in the most important places of the State, and withall he seized on the Kings treasure, which was not small. In this manner he slew all the <hi>Bramaas</hi> that were in the Kingdom, which were fifteen thousand, besides the women of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what age soever, and seized on the places where they resided, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly demolished; so that in the space of three and twenty dayes onely he became ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute possessor of the Kingdom, and prepared a great Army to fight with the King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> if he should chance to return upon the bruit of this rebellion, as indeed he
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50126:147"/>
fought with him to his great damage, being defeated by him, as I have heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. And thus having methinks said enough for the intelligence of that which I am to recount, I will come again to my first discourse. This King of <hi>Bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aa</hi> being advertised of the revolt of the Town of <hi>Martabano,</hi> and of the death of those two thousand <hi>Bramaaes,</hi> gave order immediately to all the Lords of the Kingdome for their repair unto him with as many men as they could levy, and that within the te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m of fifteen daies at the furthest, in regard the present necessity would not indure a longer delay. This done, he parted the day following with a small train from the City of <hi>Pegu,</hi> to give example to others to do the like, and wept and lodged at a Town called <hi>Mouchan,</hi> with an intention to tarry there those fifteen days he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited the Lords to come unto him. Now whenas six or seven of them were already past, he was advertised that <hi>Xemin de Satan,</hi> Governor of a Town so named, had secretly sent a great sum of gold to the <hi>Zemindoo,</hi> and had withall done him homage for the same Town where he commanded. This news somewhat troubled the King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> who devising with himself of the means which he might use to meet with the mischief that threatned him, he sent for <hi>Xemin de Satan,</hi> who was then in the said Town of his Government, with a purpose to cut off his head; but he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking himself to his bed, and making shew of being sick, answered, that he would wait upon the King as soon as he was able to rise. Now in regard he found himself to be guilty, and misdoubting the cause wherefore he was sent for, he communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this affair to a dozen of his kinsmen that were there present with him, who all of them concluded together, how since there was no better way to save himself then in killing the King, that without further delay it was to be put in execution, so that all of them offering secretly to assist him in this enterprise, they speedily assembled all their Confidents, without declaring unto them at first the occasion wherefore they did it; and withall, drawing others unto them with many fair promises, they made up of all being joyned together a company of six hundred men. Whereupon being informed that the King was lodged in a certain <hi>Pagode,</hi> they fell upon it with great violence, and fortune was so favourable unto them that finding him almost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in his chamber, they slew him without incurring any danger. That done, they retired into an outward Court, where the Kings Guard having had some notice of this treason, set upon them, and the conflict was so hot between them, that in half an hours space, or thereabout, eight hundred men lay dead in the place, whereof the most part were <hi>Bramaaes.</hi> After this <hi>Xemin de Satan</hi> making away with four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of his followers, went to a place of a large extent, called <hi>Poutel,</hi> whither all those of the country round about resorted unto him, who being advertised of the death of the King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> whom they mortally hated, made up a body of five thousand men, and went to seek out the three thousand <hi>Bramaaes</hi> which the King had brought thither vvith him: And forasmuch as these same vvere dispersed in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places, they vvere all of them easily slain, not scarce so much as one escaping. With them also vvere killed fourscore of three hundred <hi>Portugals</hi> that <hi>Diego Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> had with him, vvho, together vvith all the rest vvhich remained vvith their lives saved, rendred themselves upon composition, and vvere received to mercy, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that for the future they should faithfully serve <hi>Xemin de Satan,</hi> as their proper King, vvhich they easily promised to do. Nine days after this mutiny, the Rebell see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself favoured by fortune, and such a multitude of people at his devotion, which were come to him out of this Province, to the number of thirty thousand men, caused himself to be declared King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> promising great recompences to such as should follow and accompany him, untill he had wholly gained the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and driven the <hi>Bramaaes</hi> out of the country. With this design he retired to a fortresse called <hi>Tagalaa,</hi> and resolved to fortifie himself there out of the feare he was in of the forces vvhich vvere to come to the succour of the deceased King, thinking to find him alive, having been advertised that many vvere already set forth from the City of <hi>Pegu</hi> for that purpose. Now of those <hi>Bramaaes</hi> which <hi>Xemin de Satan</hi> had slain, one by chance escaped, and cast himself all wounde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now though this news greatly troubled the <hi>Chaumigrem,</hi> yet he dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled it for the present with so much courage and prudence, as not one of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers perceived any alteration in him: But contrarily, putting on a rich habit of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Sattin, imbroidered with gold, and a chain of precious stones about his neck, he caused all the Lords and Commanders of his Army to assemble before him, and then speaking to them with the semblance of a joyfull man, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> said he, <hi>this fellow which you saw come to me but now in such hast, hath brought me this Letter, which I have here in my hand, from the King, my Lord and yours; and although by the contents thereof he seemeth to blame us for our careless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Chaumigrem,</hi> by means of this so cunning and well dissembled a sleight, rid himself in lesse then three hours of all the hundred and fifty thousand <hi>Pegues,</hi> who he knew, if once they came to hear of the Kings death, would fall upon the thirty thousand <hi>Bramaaes</hi> that he had there with him, and not leave one of them alive. This done, as soon as it was night, turning back to the City, which was not above a league from thence, he seized with all speed on the deceased Kings Treasure, which amounted, according to report, unto above thirty millions of gold, besides jewells that were not to be estimated; and withall, he saved all the <hi>Bramaa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After this, he set fire on all that was in the Magazines, caused all the lesser Ordnance to be rived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, and the greater, which he could not use so, to be cloyed. Furthermore, he made seven thousand Elephants that were in the country to be killed, reserving only two thousand for the carriage of his treasure, ammunition, and baggage. As for all the rest, it was consumed with fire, so that neither in the Palace, where were cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers all seeked with gold, nor in the Magazines and Arsenalls, nor on the river, where were two thousand rowing Vessells, remained ought that was not reduced to ashes. After this execution, he departed in all hast, an hour before day, and drew di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards <hi>Tanguu,</hi> which was his own country, from whence he came some fourteen years before to the conquest of the Kingdome of <hi>Pegu,</hi> which in the heart of the country was distant from thence about an hundred and threescore leagues. Now whereas fear commonly adds wings to the feet, it made him march with such

In the mean time, whereas the <hi>Chaumigrem</hi> had cunningly sent away the hundred and fifty thousand <hi>Pegues,</hi> as I have declared already, it happened that two days after they understood how the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> was dead: Now in regard they vvere mortall enemies of that Nation, sixscore thousand of them in one great body turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back in hast for to go in quest of the thirty thousand <hi>Bramaaes,</hi> but when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the City, they found that they were gone from thence three days before; this making them to follow in pursuit of them with all the speed that possibly they could, they came to a place, called <hi>Guinacoutel,</hi> some forty leagues from the City whence they came; there they were informed, that it was five days since they passed by, so that dispairing of being able to execute the design which they had of cutting them in pieces, they returned back to the place from whence they were parted, where they consulted amongst themselves about that which they were to do and resolved in the end, since they had no lawfull King, and that the Land was quite freed of the <hi>Bramaaes,</hi> to go to <hi>Xemin de Satan,</hi> as incontinently they did, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, not only with a great deal of joy and good entertainment, but promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them mighty matters, and much honor, by raising them to the principall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Kingdome, as soon as time should serve, and that he was more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably setled.

               </hi>; and the recompence which the world is accustomed to make at last unto all such as serve and trust in it, under the semblance of a good countenance which she shews them at first. The matter past in this sort; There was in this city of <hi>Pegu</hi> a Merchant, called <hi>Manbagoaa,</hi> a rich man, and that of good reputation in the country: This same resolved to marry a daughter of his to a young man, the son of a worshipfull and very rich Merchant also, named <hi>Manicaniandarim,</hi> about that time that <hi>Diego Suarez</hi> was in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est height of his fortune, and termed the Kings brother, and in dignity above all the Princes and Lords of the Kingdom. So the fathers of these young couple being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on this marriage, and of the dowry that was to be given, which by report was three hundred thousand duckats; when as the day was come wherein the nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls were celebrated with a great deal of state and magnificence, and honoured with the presence of most of the gentlemen of chiefest quality in the city, it happened
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:50126:149"/>
that <hi>Diego Suarez,</hi> being come a little before Sun-set from the royall palace, with a great train both of horse and foot, as his manner was to be alwayes well accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, passed by <hi>Mambogoaas</hi> door, where hearing the musick and rejoycing that was in the house, asked what the matter was, whereunto answer being made him, that <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogoaa</hi> had married his daughter, and that the wedding was kept there, he presently caused the Elephant on which he was mounted to stay, and sent one to tell the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the bride, that he congratulated with him for this marriage, and wished a long and happy life to the new married couple; to these words he added many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by way of complement, yea and made him many offers if he would make use of him; wherewith the old father of the bride finding himself so exceedingly honored, as not knowing how to acknowledge it, in regard the person who did him so much honor, was no lesse then the King himself in greatnesse and dignity, the desire which he had to satisfie this obligation in part, if he could not wholly do it, made him go and take his daughter by the hand, accompanied with many Ladies of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and so leading her to the street door, where <hi>Diego Suarez</hi> was, he prostrated himself on the ground with a great deal of respect, and with many complements af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his manner, thanked him for the favour and honor that he had done him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the new married bride, having taken from off her finger a rich ring, presented it on her knees by her fathers expresse commandement, to <hi>Diego Suarez</hi>; but he that naturally was sensuall and lascivious, instead of using civility, whereunto the Laws of generosity and friendship obliged him, having taken the ring which the maid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto him, he reached out his hand, and plucked her to him by force, saying, <hi>God forbid that so fair a maid as you should fall into any other hands but mine</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the poor old man seeing <hi>Diego Suarez</hi> hale his daughter so rudely, lifting up both his hands to heaven, with his knees on the ground, and tears in his eys, <hi>My Lord,</hi> said he unto him <hi>I humbly beseech thee for the love and respect of the great God, whom thou adorest, and which was conceived without any spot of sin in the Virgins womb, as I confesse and believe, according to that which I have heard thereof, that thou wilt not forcibly take away my daughter; for if thou doest so, I shall assuredly die with griefe and displeasure at it; but if thou desire of me that I should give thee her dowry, together with all that is in my house, and that I deliver up my self unto thee for thy slave, I will instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it, provided thou wilt permit that her husband may possesse her, for I have no other good in the world but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e, nor will I have any other as long as I live.</hi> Whereupon offering to lay hold on his daughter, <hi>Diego Suarez</hi> making no answer to him, turned himself about to the Captain of his guard, who was a Turk by Nation, and said unto him, <hi>kill this dog</hi> The Turk presently drew out his Scymitar to kill the poor old man, but he suddainly fled away, leaving his daughter with her hair all about her ears in <hi>Diego Suarez</hi> his hands. In the mean time the Bridegroom came running to this tumult, with his cheeks all bedeawed with tears, but he was scarcely arrived there, whenas these Barbarians slew him, and his Father too, with six or seven other of his kinsmen. Whilest this past so, the women made such fearfull cries in the house, as terrified all those that heard them, so that even the earth and the ayr seemed to tremble at it, or to say better, they demanded vengeance of God for the little respect which was had to his divine justice, and for so great a violence as this was; and truly if I do not more amply report the particularities of so black and so abhominable an action, I desire to be excused, in regard I passe them by for the honor of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation. Wherefore it shall suffice me to say, that this poor Maid seeing her self upon the point to be forced, strangled her self with a string that she wore about her middle for a girdle, which she chose rather to do, then suffer this sensuall and bruitish man to carry her away with him by force; but he was therewith so displeased, as he was heard to say, that he repented him more for that he had not enjoyed her, then for u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her in that sort as he did. Now from the day of this abhorred act, till four years after, the good old man, the Father of the Bride, was never seen to go out of his house; but at length to give a greater demonstration of his sorrow, and to shew his extreme resentment of the matter, he covered himself with an old tattered mat, and in that sad equipage went up and downe, begging an alms of his very slaves,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:50126:149"/>
never eating any thing, but lying all along naked, and his face fixed on the ground. Thus continued he in so sad a manner of life, untill in the end he saw that the season invited him to have recourse unto justice, which he demanded in this sort; perceiving that in the Kingdome there was another King, other Governors, and other Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, alterations which time ordinarily produceth in every country, and in all kind of affairs, he went out of his house in the wretched fashion he had so long used, having a big cord about his neck, and a white beard, reaching almost down to his girdle, and got him into the midst of a great place, where stood a Temple called <hi>Quiay Fantare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus the number of the people still more and more increasing, they ran thronging strait to the Kings Palace, with so horrible a noyse, as struck terror into all that heard them. In this disorder, being arrived at the outward Court of the Palace, they cried out six or seven times with a dreadfull tone; <hi>O King come out of the place wherein thou art shut up, to hearken to the voice of thy God, who demands justice of thee by the mouth of thy poor people.</hi> At these cries the King put forth his head out of the window, and affrighted with so strange an accident, would needs know of them what they would have? whereunto they all answered unanimously with such loud cries, as seemed to pierce the heavens, <hi>Iustice, justice against a wicked infidell, who to spoil us of our goods hath killed our fathers, our children, our brothers, and our kinsmen.</hi> The King having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon inquired of them who it was, <hi>it is,</hi> answered they, <hi>an accursed thief, participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the works of the Serpent, who in the fields of delight abused the first man that God created. Is it possible,</hi> said he unto them, <hi>that there should be any such thing as you tell me?</hi> whereunto they all replied, <hi>This same is the most accursed man that ever was born on the earth, and is so out of his wicked nature and inclination, wherefore we all of us beseech thee in the name of this God of the afflicted, that his veins may be as much emptied of his bloud, as hell is filled with his wicked works.</hi> At these words the King turning towards them that were about him, <hi>What do you think hereof,</hi> said he unto them? <hi>What am I to do? and how am I to carry my self in so strange and extraordinary a matter</hi>? To which they all answered, <hi>My Lord, if thou wilt not hearken to that which this God of the afflicted comes to demand of thee, it is to be feared that he will take care no longer to aid th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus marching from one street to another, he arrived in the end at the <hi>Bazor,</hi> which was a publike place where all kind of wares was sold; but as he was going thither, he met by chance with <hi>Balthazar Suarez</hi> his son, who came from a Merchants house, whither his Father had sent him that morning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some money that was owing to him. The Son, seeing his Father in this plight, alighted presently from his horse, and casting himself at his feet; <hi>What means this, my Lord,</hi> said he unto him with tears in his eys, <hi>and whence cemes it that you are led along in this sort? Ask it of my sins,</hi> answered Diego Suarez, <hi>and they will tell thee, for I protest unto thee my Son, that in the case I am in, all things seem dreams unto me.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon imbracing one another, and mingling their tears together, they continued so, untill such time as the <hi>Chirca</hi> commanded <hi>Balthazar Suarez</hi> to get him gone, which he would not do, being loth to part from his father, but the Ministers of justice haled him away by force, and pushed him so rudely, as he fell and broke his head, yea and withall they gave him many blows besides, whereat his Father fell into a swoun. Being come again to himself, he craved a little water, which he had no sooner taken, but lifting up his hands to heaven, he said with tears in his eys, <hi>Si iniquitates observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

An houre after they drew forth the poore <hi>Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Suarez</hi> from under the stones, and with another new tumult of cries and voices they tore him in pieces, with so much fury and hatred of the whole people in generall, as there was not he which did not believe that he did a charitable and holy work in giving a reward to the most muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous amongst those, which dragged his members and entrailes up and downe the streets. This execution done, the King willing to confiscate his goods, sent men to his house for that purpose, where the disorder was so great, in regard of the extreme avarice which these hungry dogs had, they left not a tile unmoved; and because they found not so much as they expected, they put all his slaves and servants to torture, with such an excesse of cruelty, as eight and thirty of them remained dead in the place, amongst which were seventeen <hi>Portugals,</hi> who bore the pain of a thing whereof they were not guilty. In all this spoile there were no more then six hundred bisses of gold found, which are in value three hundred thousand duckats, besides some pieces of rich houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuffe, but no precious stones, nor jewells at all, which perswaded men that <hi>Diego Suarez</hi> had buried all the rest; howsoever it could never be found out, notwithstanding all the search that was made for it, and yet it was verified by the judgement of some who had seene him in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, that he had in meanes above three millions of gold, according to the supputation of the country.

These extortions rendered him so odious, as the most part of those that were with him abandoned him to side with the <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> who had for him at that time the towns of <hi>Digon, Meideo, Dalaa,</hi> and <hi>Coulam,</hi> even to the confines of <hi>Xaraa,</hi> from whence he parted in hast to go and besiege this Tyrant with an army of two hundred thousand men, &amp; five thousand Elephants. When he was arrived at the city of <hi>Pegu,</hi> where <hi>Xemin de Satan</hi> then kept his Court, he invested it round about with palisadoes and very strong trenches, yea and gave some assaults to it, but he could not enter it so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily as he believed, in regard of the great resistance he found from them within; wherefore judging it requisite for him to alter his mind, being prudent as he was, he came very subti ly to a truce of twenty dayes with the Tyrant upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conditions, whereof the principall was, that if within the terme of those twenty dayes he gave him a thousand bisses of gold, which are in value five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Duckats, he would desist from the pretension and right which he had to this Kingdome; and all this he did (as I have already said) cunningly, hoping by this means to bring him to his bow with lesse perill. So the time of the truce beginning to run on, all things remained peaceable on either side, and the besiegers fell to communicate with the besieged. During this pacification every morning two houres before day, they of the <hi>Xemindooes</hi> Camp played af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their manner upon divers sorts of instruments very melodiously, at the sound whereof all they of the city ran to the walls to see what the matter was. Whereupon those instruments ceasing to play, a Proclamation was made by a Priest, accounted by every man a holy personage, who said these words with a very sad voice, <hi>O ye people, ye people! unto whom Nature hath given eares to hear, hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the meane time the besieged Tyrant, seeing that these secret Proclamations of the enemy were so prejudiciall unto him, as they could not chuse but turn to his utter ruine, brake the truce at twelve dayes end, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated with his Councell what he should do, who advised him by no means to suffer h mself to remaine any longer besieged, for feare left the inhabitants should mutinie, and fall from him to the enemy; and that the best and surest way was to fight with the <hi>Xemindoo</hi> in the open field, before he grew to any further strength. This resolution being approved of by <hi>Zenim de Satan,</hi> he prepared himself for the execution of it; to which effect he two dayes after before it was day sallied out at five gates of the city with fourscore thousand men, which then he had, and charged the enemies with strange fury. They then in the meane time, who alwayes stood upon their guard, received them with a great deale of courage, whereupon insued so cruell a conflict between them, that in lesse then halfe an houre, for so long lasted the heat of the fight, there fell on both sides above forty thousand men; but at the end of that time the new King <hi>Zenim</hi> was born from his Elephant by an harquebuze shot, discharged at him by a Portugall, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Gonçalo N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THe <hi>Xemindoo</hi> seeing himself Crowned King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and peaceable Lord of all the kingdome; began to have thoughts far different from those which <hi>Xemin de Satan</hi> had had, being raised to the same dignity of King; for the first and principal thing wherein he imployed himself with all his endeavour, was to maintain his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in peace, and to cause Justice to flourish; as indeed he established it with so much integritie, as no man how great so ever he was, durst wrong a lesser then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: withall in that which concerned the government of the Kingdome, he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with so much vertue, and equity, as it filled the strangers that were there with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, so that one could not without marvel consider the peace the quiet, and union of the wills of the people; during the happy and peaceable estate of this Kingdome, which continued the space of a year, and better; at the end whereof the <hi>Chaumigrem,</hi> foster-brother to the same King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> whom <hi>Xemin de Satan</hi> had slaine, as I have before declared, having received advertisement, that by reason of the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and warres, which since his departure from thence had happened in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Pegu</hi>; the principall men of the State there, had lost their lives; and the <hi>Xemindoo</hi> who then raigned, was unprovided of all things necessary for his defence; he resolved once again to adventure upon the same enterprise, which had formerly been undertaken by his late King. With this design, he entertained into his pay a mighty Army of strangers, unto whom he gave a Tincall of gold by the month, which is five dackets of our mony; when as he had prepared all things in a readinesse, he departed from <hi>Tanguu,</hi> the place of his birth: On the ninth day of March, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, five hundred, fifty and two, with an Army of three hundred thousand men, whereof only fifty thousand were <hi>Bramaas,</hi> and all the rest <hi>Mons, Chaleus, Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minhams, Sau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rus,</hi> and <hi>Auaas.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> the new King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> having certain intelligence of these great forces, which were coming to fall upon him, made preparation to go and meet them, with a design to give them battle; for which effect, he assembled in the same City where he was; a huge Army of nine hundred thousand men, which were all <hi>Pegues</hi> by nation, and consequently of a weake constitution, and lesse warlick then all the others, whereof I have spoken; and on Tueseday the fourth of April, about noone, having received advice that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Army was incamped all along the river of <hi>Meleytay</hi> some twelve leagues from thence, he used such expedition, as the same day, and the next night all his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were put into battle array, for whereas they had prepared every thing long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and had also been trayned by their Capt. there needed no great ado to bring them into order. The day ensueing, all these men of warre begun about nine of the clock in the morning, to march at the sound of an infinite company of warlick instruments, and went and lodged that night some two leagues from thence neer to the river <hi>Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus the night past with a good guard, and a strange noise that was made on either part. The day following, which was a Saturday, the seventh of Aprill in the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, five hundred, fifty and three, about five of the clock in the morning, these two Armies began to move, but with different intentions; for the designe of the <hi>Bramaa</hi> was to passe the foard, and recover an advantageous peece of ground, which lay neer to another river; and the <hi>Xemindoo</hi> had a desire to keep him from it, and to stop his passage; upon this contention, some skirmishes ensued, which continued most part of the day, and wherein about five hundred men on the one side, and the other were slain,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:50126:152"/>
howbeit the advantage remained with the <hi>Chaumigrem,</hi> because he gained the place whereunto he pretented, and passed all the night there in banquetting, and making great bonfires for this good successe. The next day betimes in the morning the <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindoo,</hi> King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> presented the battail to his enemyes, who did not refuse it; so that they incountred one another with all the fury that a cruel hatred is accustomed to kindle in such like cases; the two vantgards then, vvho vvere the best Soldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, fell so lustily unto it, that in lesse then half an hour, all the Field was covered with dead bodies, and the <hi>Pegues</hi> began to lack courage. Wherupon the <hi>Xemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doo</hi> seeing his men give ground, came to succor them with a body of three thousand elephants, wherewith he set upon the seventy thousand horse so couragiously, and to the purpose, as the <hi>Bramaaes</hi> lost all that they had gained; which perceived by the <hi>Chaumigrem,</hi> who was better experienced in matters of Warre, knowing full well what he was to doe, to recover all again; made shew of retyring, as if he had been vanquished; the <hi>Xemindoo</hi> thereupon, who understood not this stratagem, and that thought of nothing but the victory, pursued his enemie about a quarter of a league: but incontinently the <hi>Bramaa</hi> facing about with all his forces, fell upon his enemy with such violence and horrible cryes, as not only men, but even the very earth, and all the other elements seemed to tremble at it. By this meanes the conflict renewed in such sort, as in a little time the ayre was seen all on fire, and the ground watered all over with bloud; for the <hi>Pegu</hi> Lords and Commanders, beholding their King so farre ingaged in the battle, and likely to lose the day, ran instantly to his succor, the like did the <hi>Panonsaray,</hi> the <hi>Bramaaes</hi> brother, on his side, with fourty thousand men, and two thousand elephants; so that there ensued betwixt them, so bloudy and dreadfull a fight, as words are not able to expresse the truth of it; wherefore I shall say no more, but that half an hour, or there about, before Sun-set, the Army of nine hundred thousand <hi>Pegues</hi> was utterly discomfited; and as it was said, four hundred thousand of them were left dead on the place, and all the rest, or the most part of them, grievously wounded; which the <hi>Xemindoo</hi> seeing, fled out of the field, and so escaped. Thus did the victory remain unto the <hi>Chaumigrem,</hi> who thereupon caused himself to be crowned King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> with the same royal Ensignes, magnificence, and triumph, as the other King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> whom <hi>Xemin de Satan</hi> slew, had formerly been. And in regard it was already night, they bestowed the time in no other thing, but in dressing the hurt men, and keeping good watch in the Camp.</p>
            <p>The next day, as soon as it was light, all the victorious souldiers,<note place="margin">

The souldiers being well satisfied in this particular, the new King of this miserable Kingdome parted forthwith from the place where he had gotten the Victory, and marched towards the Citie of <hi>Pegu,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Now forasmuch as hee would not that day enter into it, for certain considerations which I will relate hereafter, hee set himself down in the view of it, about half a league off, in a Plain, called <hi>Sunday Patir:</hi> and after he had thus encamped his Army, hee gave order for the guard of the four and twenty gates thereof, by placing at each of them a <hi>Bramaa</hi> Commander with five thousand Horse. In this manner hee remained there five dayes, without being able to resolve to enter into the Citie, out of the fear he was in, lest the strangers should require of him the pillage of it, as indeed, he was obliged to grant it to them by the promise which he had made them for it at <hi>Tanguu.</hi> Now the custom of men of War, who live but upon their pay, being to have regard to nothing but their interests, these six Nations seeing the King thus defer his entry into the Citie, which they could not brook, began to mutinie, and this by the instigation of a <hi>Portugal,</hi> named <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano Surnento,</hi> a man of a turbulent spirit, but otherwise a good and valiant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; and this mutinie proceeded so far, as the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> for his own safety was constrained to retire into a <hi>Pagode,</hi> where he fortified himself with his <hi>Bramaaes,</hi> untill that the next morning about nine of the clock hee came to a truce with them, and causing them to assemble together, from the top of a wall he spake to

them in this sort, <hi>My worthy Friends, and valiant Commanders, I have caused you to come to this holy resting place of the dead, to the end that with a solemn Oath I may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto you my intentions; whereof, with my knees on the ground, and my eyes lift up unto heaven, I take to witness</hi> Quiay Nivandel, <hi>the God of Battel of the field</hi> Vitau, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching him to be Iudg of this between you and me, and to strike me dumb, if I do not tell you the truth. I very well remember the promise I made you at</hi> Tanguu, <hi>which was, to give you the pillage of this tumultuous Citie; as well because I believed your valor would be as it were the minister of my revenge, as in some sort to satisfie your avarice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I know you are naturally very much inclined: Now having given you this promise for a gage of my faith, I acknowledg that I am altogether obliged not to break my word with you But when on the other side, I come to consider the great inconveniences which may accrue to me thereby, and the strict account which I shall one day render for it before the equitable and rigorous justice of the Lord above, I must confesse unto you, that I am very much affraid of charging my self with so heavie a burthen: wherefore Reason ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises me to render my self <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Behold, how I earnestly intreat you, as children that you are of my bowels, that having regard to my good intention, you will not kindle this fire wherein my soul will be burnt, since you see well enough how reasonable that is which I desire of you, and how unjust it would be for you to refuse it me. Neverthelesse, to the end you may not remain altogether without recompense, I do here promise you to contribute thereunto all that shall seem reasonable to you, and to supply this default in part with my own goods, with my Person, with my Kingdom, and with my State.</hi> Hereupon the Commanders of those six Nations hearing the Kings justification, and the promise which hee made them, yeelded to agree unto whatsoever he would do: howbeit, they prayed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things to have regard unto souldiers pretensions, who were not at any hand to be discontented, but greatly to be made account of. Whereunto the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>That they had reason, and that in all things he would endeavour to conform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to whatsoever they should judg reasonable.</hi> In the mean time, to avoid disputes which might ensue hereupon, it was concluded, that they should referr themselves to Arbitrators: for which effect the Mutiners were to name three on their side, and the King three others on his, which made six in all, whereof three were to be Religious men, and the rest Strangers, that so the judgment might be given with lesse suspicion. This resolution being taken between them, they agreed together, that the three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men should be the <hi>Menigrepos</hi> of a <hi>Pagode,</hi> that was named <hi>Quiay Hifaron,</hi> that is to say, the God of Povertie; and that for the other three Strangers, the King and the Mutiners should cast lots, to see who should chuse one or two of them on his side. This Election being fallen to the King, he made a choice of two <hi>Portugals,</hi> of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty that were then in the Citie; whereof the one was <hi>Gonçalo Pacheco,</hi> the King our Masters Factor for Lacre, a worthie man, and of a good conscience; and the other a worshipful Merchant, named <hi>Nuno Fernandez Teixeyra,</hi> whom the King held in good esteem, as having known him in the life time of the deceased King. By the same means the Commanders of the Mutiners elected another stranger, whose name I do not know. Things thus concluded, the Judges destined for the resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Affair, were sent for, because the King was not willing to stirre out of the place where he was, untill the matter was determined; to the end he might dismisse them all peaceably before he entred into the Citie, for fear lest if they entered with him, they should not keep their word. For this purpose then the King about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night sent a <hi>Bramaa</hi> on horseback to the <hi>Portugals</hi> quarter, who vvere in no lesse fear then the <hi>Pegues</hi> of being plundered and killed. After that the <hi>Bramaa</hi> vvas come into the Citie, and that hee had asked aloud (for so they use to do vvhen they come from the King) vvhere the Captain of the <hi>Portugals</hi> vvas, he vvas presently conducted to his Lodging, vvhere being arrived, <hi>It is a thing</hi> (said he to the Captain) <hi>as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the nature of that Lord above, who hath created the firmament and the whole heavens, to make good men for the conversion of the wicked, as it is ordinary with the pernicious Dragon to nourish in his bosome spirits of commotion and tumult, to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50126:153"/>
bring disorder unto the peace which conserves us in the holy Law of the Lord. I mean hereby</hi> (continued he) <hi>that amongst all those of your Nation there is one wicked man found, vomiting out of his infernall stomack flames of discord and sedition, by means wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he hath caused the three strange Nations of the</hi> Chalons, Meleytes <hi>and</hi> Savadis <hi>to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie in the King my Masters Army, whereupon hath ensued so great a mischief, that besides almost the utter ruine of the Camp, three thousand</hi> Bramaaes <hi>have been slain, and the King himself hath been in such danger, as he was fain to retire into a Fort, where hee hath remained three dayes, and still is there, not daring to come out, because he cannot put any trust in those strangers. Howbeit, for a remedy of so great unquietnesse, it hath pleased God, who is the true Father of concord, to inspire the Kings heart with patience to endure this injurie, being prudent as he is, to the end hee may by that means pacifie the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and rebellion of these three turbulent Nations, who inhabit the most desert parts of the mountains of</hi> Mons, <hi>and are the most accursed of God amongst all people. Now, to make an entry into this peace and union, a Treaty hath been had between the King and the Commanders of the Mutiners, whereby it hath been concluded on either part with an Oath, That to exempt this Citie from the plundering which had been promised to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the King shall give them out of his own estate, as much as six men, deputed for that purpose, shall award; of which number there are already four, so that to make up the whole six, there wants none but thee, whom the King hath chosen for him; and another Portugal, whose name is written in this paper, whereby thou shalt be ascertained of that which I have said unto thee.</hi> Thereupon he delivered a Letter unto him from the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi>; which <hi>Gonçalo Pacheco</hi> received upon his knees, and laid upon his head, with exterior complements so full of civilitie and courtesie, as the <hi>Bramaa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained very much contented and satisfied therewith, and said unto him, <hi>Surely, the King my Master must needs have a great knowledg of thee, in that hee hath chosen thee for a Iudg of his Honour and Estate</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hereupon <hi>Gonçalo Pacheco</hi> read the Letter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud before all the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who heard it standing, with their hats in their hands: The contents of it were to this effect, <hi>Captain</hi> Gonçalo Pacheco, <hi>my dear Friend, and that appears before my eyes like a precious Pearl, as being no lesse vertuous in the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie of thy life, then the holyest Menigrepos which live in the Deserts; I, the ancient</hi> Chaumigrem, <hi>and new King of fourteen States, which God hath now put into my hands by the death of the holy King my Master, do send thee a smile of my mouth, to the end thou mayest be as agreeable to me, as those whom I cause to sit at my table in a day of joy and feasting: Know then, that I have thought good to take thee for a Iudg of the Affair that is in question, and therefore have sent for thee, together with my good Friend,</hi> Nuno Fernandez Teixeyra, <hi>to come presently unto me, for to give an end to this businesse, which I wholly commit unto your trust. And for so much as concerns the security of your persons, in regard of the fear you may be in of the late Mutinie, I do engage my word, and swear to you by the faith which a King ought to have, whom God himself hath annointed, that I will take you, and all those of your Nation, with all others that beleeve in your God, into my protection.</hi> After that this Letter was read, to the great astonishment of all us that heard it, we could beleeve no other, but that by Divine permission it came from Heaven for the assurance of our lives, whereof we stood in very great doubt until then. <hi>Gonçalo Pacheco</hi> and <hi>Nuno Fernandez,</hi> with ten other <hi>Portugals</hi> which were chosen for that purpose, instantly prepared a Present of divers rich Pieces to carry to the King, unto whom they went that very same night an hour before day, in the company of the <hi>Bramaa</hi> who brought the Letter, in regard the haste the King was in would brook no delay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gonçalo Pacheco, Nuno Fernandez,</hi> and the other <hi>Portugals,</hi> arrived at the camp an hour before Sun-rising, and the King sent to receive them one of the chiefest <hi>Bramaa</hi> Commanders that he had, and in whom he very much confided, who was accompanied with above an hundred horse, and six Serjeants at armes that carried ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This same received the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and lead them to the King, who did much honour unto <hi>Gonçalo Pacheco,</hi> and <hi>Nuno Fernandez</hi>; and after he had talked with them of divers matters, he put them in mind of the importance of the businesse for which he had sent for them, and willed them by any means to leane rather to the Commanders then to him, assuring them that he should be very well contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,

and said many things to them to that purpose. Then he caused them to be conducted by the same <hi>Bramaa</hi> Lord to the Tent, where the other four Arbitrators were with the high Treasuror and two Registers; when as they had commanded si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to all that were without, they fell to debating of the businesse for which they were assembled together; whereupon there were many opinions, which took up the most part of the day, but at last all six came to conclude, That albeit on the one side the King, by the promise which he had made at <hi>Tanguu</hi> to the forraigne Souldiers, for to give them the spoil or pillage of the places which he should take by force, was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly obliged to the performance thereof, yet seeing that on the other side this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was of great and notable prejudice to the innocent, because it could not be put in execution without greatly offending God; these things considered, they ordained by their award; <hi>That the King, in regard of the promise which he had made them, should pay unto them a thousand bisses of gold out of his own treasure; and that upon the Souldiers receiving thereof, they should passe over to the other side of the River, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire directly into their countries; but that they should first be also paid all that was due to them before this mutiny began, and that they should be furnished with victuals suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for twenty daies.</hi> This award being published, was received with much content to either party; So that the King commanded it to be instantly and punctually executed; and for a greater testimony of his liberality, after he had paid them all this sum of mony, he bestowed upon the Commanders and Officers of each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany many bountifull rewards, wherewith they were all of them very well pleased, and satisfied. In this sort were these three mutinous nations discharged; for the King would by no meanes trust, or make use of them any longer: Howbeit, he would not suffer these strangers to go all away together, but caused them to be divided into troups; each of them consisting of a thousand men, to the end that by this means, they should give the lesse suspicion in their returne, and should be lesse able to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the open townes, by which they were to passe; and thus the next day they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. As for <hi>Gonçalo Pacheco,</hi> and <hi>Nuno Fernandez Teixyra,</hi> the King gave them ten bisses of gold, for being his Arbitrators in this affair, whereunto he added a pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port written with his own hand, whereby the <hi>Portugals</hi> were permitted to retire free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the <hi>Indies,</hi> without paying any custome or duty for their marchandize; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we made more account then of all the mony could have been given us, because that for three years before the precedent Kings had retayned us in this country, with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much vexation and tyranny, whereby we were oftentimes in great danger of our lives, by reason of the successe of that which I have spoken heretofore. This done, there were Proclamations made by men on horseback, to give notice that the day following, the King would enter into the City in a peaceable manner, threatning all such as should do the contrary, with a cruell death. Accordingly, the next morning at nine of the clock the King parted from the <hi>Pagode,</hi> whither he had retired himself; and about an hour after arrived at the City, wherein to entring by the chiefest gate, he was received by an assembly (in form of a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Procession</hi>) of six thousand Priests of all the twelve Sects which are in this Kingdome; by one of whom, called <hi>Capizundo,</hi> an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made unto him, whereof the preface was thus, <hi>Blessed and praised be that Lord, who ought truly to be acknowledged of all men for such, in regard of the holy works which he hath made with his Divine hands, testified to us by the light of the day, the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the night, and all the other magnificences of his mercy which he hath produced in us; Praised be he, I say, for that by the effects of his infinite power, which are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto him, he hath been pleased to establish thee on the earth above all the Kings that govern it; and seeing we hold thee for his favorite, we humbly beseech thee our Lord, that thou wilt never more remember the faults and offences which we have committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, to the end that these thy afflicted people may be comforted with the promise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which they hope thy Majesty will make them at this present.</hi> This same request was likewise made unto him by the six thousand <hi>Grepos,</hi> all prostrated on the ground, and with their hands lifted up to heaven, who with a dreadful tumult of voices said unto him; <hi>Grant, our Lord and King, peace and pardon for that is past to all the people of this thy Kingdome of Pegu, to the end they may not be troubled with the feare of their offences, which they confesse publikely before thee.</hi> The King answered them, that he
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50126:154"/>
was contented so to do, and swore to them by the head of <hi>Quiay Nivandel,</hi> the God of Battel of the field <hi>Vitau,</hi> for the confirmation thereof. Upon this promise all the people prostrated themselves with their faces on the ground, and said unto him; <hi>God make thee to prosper for infinite years in the victory over thy enemies, that thou mayest trample their heads under thy feet.</hi> Hereupon for a token of great gladnesse, they fel to playing on divers instruments after their manner, though very barbarously, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunably; and the <hi>Grepo Capizondo</hi> set on his head a rich Crown of gold and precious stones of the fashion of a Miter, wherewith the King made his entry into the City, with a great deal of state and tryumph, causing to march before him all the spoile of the elephants and chariots, as also the statue of the <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> whom he had vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, bound with a great yron chain, and forty Colours trayled on the ground; As for him, he was seated on a very mighty elephant, harnessed with gold, and invironed with forty Serjeants at armes bearing Maces: there marched likewise all the great Lords and Commanders on foot with their Scymitars covered with plates of gold, which they carried on their shouldiers, and three thousand fighting elephants, with their Castles of divers inventions, besides a world of other people, as well foot as horse, which followed him without number.</p>

            <head>CHAP. LXXIV. The finding of the <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> and bringing of him to the King; with the manner of his execution and death; and other particularities concerning the same.</head>
            <p>AFter that the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> had continued peaceably in this Citie of <hi>Pegu</hi> for the space of six and twenty daies, the first thing he did was to make himself Master of the principal places of this Kingdome, which not knowing the defeat of the <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> held still for him: To this purpose, having given Commission to some Commanders for it, hee wrote to the inhabitants of those places divers courteous Letters, wherein he called them his dear children, and gave them an abolition of all that was past: He also promised them by a solemn oath, to maintain them in peace for the time to come, and alwayes to minister justice to them, without any Imposts or other oppression; but that hee would contrarily do them new favours, as to the very <hi>Bramaas</hi> which served him in the Warres. To these words hee added many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, very well accommodated to the time and his desire; for the better crediting whereof, they that were already reduced under his obedience, wrote their Letters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein they made an ample relation of the Franchises and Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the King had granted to them. All this, accompanied with the same which ran thereof in all parts, wrought so great an effect, as all those places rendred unto him, and put themselves under his obedience: so that in imitation of them all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities, Towns, States and Provinces that were in the Kingdom did the like. For my part, I hold, that this Kingdome whereof the King of <hi>Bramaa</hi> made at this time a new Conquest, is the best, the most abundant, and richest in Gold, in Silver, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones that may be found in any part of the world. Things being thus accomplished, to the great advantage of the <hi>Bramaa,</hi> he dispatches divers Horsemen with all speed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all parts, to go in quest of the <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> who (as I have already declared) had escaped from the past Battel, and was so unhappy, that he was discovered in a place named <hi>Fauleu,</hi> a league from the Town of <hi>Potem,</hi> which separates the Kingdom from <hi>Aracam:</hi> Presently whereupon, he was lead with great joy by a man of base conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to this King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> who in recompence thereof, gave him thirty thousand Duckats of yeerly rent. Being brought before him, bound as he was with an iron coller, and manacles, he said unto him in way of derision, <hi>Thou art welcome</hi> (<hi>King of</hi> Pegu) <hi>and maist well kisse the ground which thou seest; for I assure thee, I have set my foot on it; whereby thou mayest perceive how much I am thy Friend, since I do thee an honour which thou couldst never imagine.</hi> To these words the <hi>Xemindoo</hi> made no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; so that the King falling to jeer this miserable man anew, vvho lay before him with his face on the ground, said unto him, <hi>What means this? Art thou amazed to see me, or to see thy self in so great honour? Or what is the matter, that thou dost not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to that which I demand of thee?</hi> After this affront, the <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> whether it were
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50126:155"/>
that he was troubled with his misfortunes, or ashamed of his dishonour, answered him in this sort; <hi>If the clouds of Heaven, the Sun, the Moon, and the other creatures, which cannot expresse in words that which God hath created for the service of man, and for the beautifying of the Firmament, which hides from us the rich treasures of his power, could naturally with the horrible voice of their dreadfull Thunder explain to them which now look upon me, the estate whereunto I see my self reduced before thee, and the extreme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which my soul doth suffer, they would answer for me, and declare the cause I have to be mute in the condition wherein my sins have set me: and whereas thou canst not be Iudg of that which I say, being the party that accusest me, and the minister of the execution of thy designe, I hold my self for excused, if I do not make thee an answer, as I would do before that blessed Lord, who, how faulty soever I could be, would have pitie on me, moved with the least tear that I should shed.</hi> This said, he fell down with his face on the ground, and twice together asked for a little water: Whereupon the King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> the more to afflict him, commanded that the <hi>Xemindoo</hi> should receive this water from the hand of a Daughter of his, (held by him as a slave) whom he exceedingly loved, and had at that time of his defeat promised to the Prince of <hi>Nautir,</hi> Son to the King of <hi>Avaa.</hi> The Princesse no sooner saw her Father lying in that manner on the ground, but she cast her self at his feet, and straitly embracing him, after shee had kissed him thrice, she said to him with her eyes all bathed in tears, <hi>O my Father, my Lord, and my King, I intreat you, for the extreme affection which I have alwayes born you, and for that also which you have at all times shewed to me, that you will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to lead me with you, thus imbracing you as I do, to the end that in this sad passage you may have one to comfort you with a cup of water, now that for my sins the world refuses you that respect which is due unto you.</hi> It is said, that the Father would fain have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to these words, yet could not possibly do it, so much was he oppressed with grief and anguish of minde, to see this Daughter whom he so dearly loved, in such a taking; but fell as it were in a swoun, and so continued a good vvhile; vvherewith some Lords that were there present vvere so moved, as the tears came into their eyes; vvhich observed by the King of <hi>Bramaa,</hi> and that they vvere <hi>Pegues,</hi> vvho had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been the <hi>Xemindoo</hi>'s Subjects, fearing lest they should betray him in time to come, he caused their heads to be presently strucken off, saying vvith a disdainfull and fierce countenance, <hi>Seeing you have so great pitie of the</hi> Xemindoo <hi>your King, get you before and prepare a lodging for him, and there he will pay you for this affection which you testifie to have for him.</hi> After this, his wrath redoubled in such sort, as instantly he caused this very Daughter to be killed in her Fathers arms; which truly was more then a bruitish and savage cruelty, in seeking to hinder the affections which nature hath imprinted in us. Then no longer enduring the sight of the <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be taken from thence, and to be carried to a close prison, where he passed all the night following under a sure guard.</p>
            <p>The next morning, Proclamation was made over all the City, for the people to be present at the death of the unhappy <hi>Xemindoo</hi>; now, the chiefest reason why the <hi>Bramaa</hi> did this, was, that the inhabitants seeing him dead, might for ever lose all hope of having him for their King, as all generally desired; for whereas he was their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, and the <hi>Bramaa</hi> a Stranger, they were in extreame fear, least the <hi>Bramaa</hi> should become in time like unto him whom <hi>X<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

About ten of the clock, the unfortunate <hi>Xemindoo</hi> was drawn out of the dungeon where he was, in the manner ensuing. Before him marched through the Streets, by which he was to passe, forty men on horseback with lances in their hands, to prepare and clear the waies; there were as many behind as before him, which carried naked swords, crying aloud to the people, whereof the number was infinite, to make roome: After them follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about fifteen hundred harquebusiers with their matches lighted; next to these last, which they of the country use to call, the <hi>avant coureurs</hi> of the Kings wrath, went an hundred and threescore elephants armed with their Castles, and covered with silk ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestry,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:50126:155"/>
marching by five and five in a rank; after them rode in the same order by five in a rank, fifteen men on horseback, which carried black ensignes all bloudy; crying aloud, as it were by way of Proclamation; <hi>Let those miserable wretches, which are the slaves of hunger, and are continually persecuted by the disgrace of fortune, hearken to the cry of the arm of wrath, executed on them that have offended their King, to the end that the astonishment of the pain, which is ordained them for it, may be deeply imprinted in their memory.</hi> Behind these same were other fifteen, clothed with a kind of bloudy garment, which rendred them dreadfull and of a bad aspect; who at the sound of five Bell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se, came the poor patient, mounted on a lean ill-favored jade, and the hangman on the crupper behind him, holding him up under both the armes. This miserable Prince was so poorly clad, that his naked skinne was every where seen; withall, in an exceeding derision of his person, they had set upon his head a Crowne of straw, like unto an Urinall case; which Crowne was garnished with muscle-shells, fastned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with blew thred; and round about his yron coller were a number of onions tyed: Howbeit, though he was reduced to so deplorable an estate, and that his face was scarce like to that of a living man, yet lest he not for all that, from having something of I know not what in his eyes, which manifested the condition of a King. There was besides observed in him, a majesticall sweetnesse, which drew tears from all that beheld him. About this guard which accompanied him, there was another of above a thousand horse men, intermingled with many armed elephants; Passing thus tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the twelve principall streets of the City, where there was a world of people, he arrived at last at a certain street called <hi>Cabam Bainhaa,</hi> out of which he went but two and twenty days before, to go and fight with the <hi>Bramaa,</hi> in such pomp and greatnesse, as by the report of them that saw it, and of which number I was one, it was without doubt, one of the most marvellous sights that ever hath been seen in the world; whereof notwithstanding I will make no mention here, either in regard I cannot promise to recount rightly how all past, or for that I fear some will receive these truths for lies; neverthelesse mine eyes having been the witnesses of these two successes, if I do not speak of the greatnesse of the first, I will at leastwise declare the miseries of the second, to the end that by these two so different accidents, happening in so short a time, one may learn what little assurance is to be put in the prosperities of the earth, and in all the goods which are given us by inconstant and deceitful Fortune. Whenas the poor Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent had past that street of <hi>Cabam Bainha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> he arrived at a place where <hi>Gonçalo Pacheco</hi> our Captain was, with above an hundred Portugals in his Company; amongst the vvhich there was one of a very base birth, and of a minde yet more vile, vvho having been robbed of his goods some yeers before, as he said, at such time as the Patient raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and complained to him of those who had done it, he vvould not vouchsafe to give him audience; so that thinking to be revenged on him for it now, vvith extravagant and unseemly speech; as soon as this poor Prince came where <hi>Gonçalo Pacheco</hi> was, with all the other Portugals, the witlesse fellow said aloud to him, that all might hear him <hi>O Robber</hi> Xemindoo, <hi>remember how when I complained to thee of those that had robbed me of my goods, thou wouldst not do me justice; but I hope that now thou shalt sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie what thy works deserve: for I will at supper eat a piece of that flesh of thine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I will invite two dogs that I have at home.</hi> The sad Patient having heard the vvords of this hair-brain'd fellow, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and after he had continued a while pensive, turning himself vvith a severe countenance towards him that uttered them, <hi>Friend,</hi> said he unto him, <hi>I pray thee, by the great goodness of that
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50126:156"/>
God in whom thou believest, to pardon me that for which thou accusest me, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that it is not the part of a Christian, in this painful estate wherein I see my self at this present, to put me in mind of that which I have done heretofore; for besides that, thou canst not thereby recover the loss which thou sayest thou hast sustained, it will but serve to afflict and trouble me the more. Pacheco</hi> having heard what this fellow said, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to hold his peace, which immediately he did; whereupon the <hi>Xemindoo</hi> with a grave countenance made shew that this action pleased him, so that seeming to be more quiet, it made him to acknowledge that with his mouth, which he could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise requite, <hi>I must confess,</hi> said he unto him, <hi>that I could wish, if God would permit it, I might have one hour longer of life to profess the excellency of the faith wherein you Portugals live; for, as I have heretofore heard it said, your God alone is true, and all other gods are lyers.</hi> The Hangman had no sooner heard these words, but he gave him so great a buffet on the face, that his nose ran out with bloud, so that the poor Patient stooping with his hands<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After then, that the tumult was appeased, and that certain men on horseback had imposed silence on the people by making certain publications, whereby the Transgressors therein were threatned with terrible punishments, a bell was heard to toll five several times; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this signal twelve men clothed in black robes, spotted all over with bloud, having their faces covered, and bearing silver Maces on their shoulders, came out of a house of wood, made expresly for that purpose, and distant some five or six paces from the Scaffold; after them followed twelve Priests, which they call <hi>Talagrepos,</hi> being, as I have said, the most eminent Dignities amongst these Pagans, and held by them as Saints; then appeared the <hi>Xemin Pocasser,</hi> the King of <hi>Bramaaes</hi> Uncle, who seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be near an hundred years old, and was as the rest, all in mourning, and inviron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with twelve little boyes richly apparelled, carrying on their shoulders Courtelasses curiously Damasked.

            <p>THe death of the good King of <hi>Siam,</hi> and the adulterie of the Queen his wife, whereof I have spoken at large heretofore, were the root and beginning of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny discords, and of so many cruell warres, which hapning in those two Kingdomes of <hi>Pegu</hi> and <hi>Siam,</hi> indured three years and an half, with so much expence of mony and bloud, as is horrible to think of.

thousand men, and of sixteen thousand elephants; whereof nine thousand were for the carriage of the Baggage, and seven thousand for fighting; an enterprize that was so dammageable for us, as I learned afterwards, that it cost us two hundred and four score Portugals. I come now again to my designe, from which I have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a good while. After that these commotions, whereof I have spoken hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were all appeased, <hi>Gonçalo Pacheco</hi> departed from the City of <hi>Pegu,</hi> with all us the rest of the Portugals which remained there, and whom the new King of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maa</hi> had delivered, as I have already declared, causing their merchandize to be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them, and obliging them with many other courtesies, as well of Honour, as of Liberty: So we, an hundred and three score Portugals as we were, imbarqued our selves in five vessels, which were at that time in the Port of <hi>Cosmin,</hi> one of the principal Townes of that Kingdom; and there we divided our selves as pilgrims and travellers to the Indiaes, for to go into divers Countries, according as each of us thought to be most convenient for him. As for me, I set sail for <hi>Malaca,</hi> with six and twenty of my companions; where when we were arrived, I sojourned there one month only, and then imbarqued my self again to go to <hi>Iapan</hi> with one <hi>Iorge Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> who in a Sip belonging to <hi>Simono de Mello,</hi> Captain of the Fortresse, went to traffick. Now having been already six and twenty dayes under sail, in conti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ing our course with a good winde, according to the season, wee came in sight of an Iland, called <hi>Tanixumaa,</hi> some nine Leagues South towards the point of the Land of <hi>Iapan</hi>; so that turning our prow that vvay, vve vvent and rode the next day in the midst of the haven of <hi>Ganxiroo</hi>: In this place the <hi>Nautaquin,</hi> who was Governour thereof, had the curiositie to come unto us for to see a thing which he had never seen before; to which effect he got aboard of us, where amazed with the fashion and equipage of our vessel, as being the first that ever arrived in that Country, he seemed to be infinitely glad of our coming, yea, and was very earnest vvith us to have us trade in that place with him: but <hi>Iorge Alvarez</hi> and the Merchants excused themselves, saying, that this port was not safe for their Ship, if any contrary winde should happen to arise. The day following, being parted from this place, to go to the Kingdom of <hi>Bungo,</hi> from whence vve vvere distant some hundred leagues to the Northward; in five dayes after our departure it pleased God that we arrived in the port of the Town of <hi>Fucheo,</hi> where we were vvell received, as vvell by the King as the people, vvho great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favoured us in that vvhich concerned the duties of our Merchandize; and the King had yet more obliged us, if in the little time that vve abode there he had not been miserably slain by a Vassal of his named <hi>Fucarandono,</hi> a mighty Prince, Lord of many Subjects, and exceeding rich; a disaster, which hapned as followeth, At the time when we arrived there, there was in the King of <hi>Bungo's</hi> Court a young man, called <hi>Axirandoo,</hi> Nephew to the King of <hi>Arimaa,</hi> vvho in regard of the ill intreaty vvhich he had received from the King his Uncle, had retired himself into this Court, and continued there above a yeer, with an intent never to return into his Country again: but his good fortune was such, as his Uncle coming to die, and having no other to succeed him, he declared him for his Heir. Whereupon the <hi>Fucarandono,</hi> of whom I lately made mention, desiring to marry this Prince to a Daughter of his, intreated the King to mediate this marriage for him, which he easily condescended unto. For vvhich effect the King one day invited the Prince to go a hunting with him into a Wood, which was some two leagues off, and where there was great store of game, vvhich he much delighted in. When they were there in private together, he moved this Marriage unto him, and certified how exceedingly it vvould content him that hee vvould accept of it; vvhich accordingly he did; vvherewith the King seemed to be extremely satisfied; so that upon his return unto the Town, hee sent for the <hi>Fuca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randono,</hi> and told him how he had prevailed for the Marriage of his Daughter vvith the King of <hi>Arimaa,</hi> and therefore vvilled him to go and acknowledg unto him vvith all thankfulnesse this grace and honour which he did him; for he assured him on the vvord of a King, that he himself had desired him for his Son-in-Law. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Fucarandono</hi> cast himself presently at the Kings feet, and in convenient terms for so great an obligation, kissed them, with much sense of so extraordinary a favour as he had shewed him. That done, he went home to his Palace, where, with much
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50126:157"/>
joy and contentment, he gave an account of this Affair to his Wife, to his Sons, and his kinsmen, who shewing themselves exceedingly satisfied therewith, congratulated one another for it, as they commonly use to do in such honourable Matches as this. In the mean time, the Mother of the Bride, as she that had the best part in this Joy, went unto a chamber where her Daughter was sowing, with divers other young Maids that served her; and taking her by the hand, lead her into the room, where her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Brethren, and kinsmen were, who rejoyced with her for so happy a fortune, and honoured her with the Title of <hi>Highnesse,</hi> as being already Queen of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Arimaa</hi>; and so all that day was spent in Feasts, Banquets, visits of Ladies, and presenting her with many rich Gifts. But whereas the good or evill of such like Affairs consists more in that which followeth, then in the original thereof, upon the good and joyfull beginning of this Marriage, such great disasters ensued, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most equalled them of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> whereof I have spoken heretofore: which I stick not to say, in regard I can affirm it with truth, as having seen these two Successes with mine own eyes, and been present at them wich danger enough of my person. All this day was spent in the visits of the principal persons of the Kingdom; But in this publick rejoycing there was none save the Bride alone that was disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in regard she was desperately in love with a young Gentleman, the son of one <hi>Groge Arum,</hi> who was as a Baron amongst us, but very much different in extraction and quality from the <hi>Fucarandono,</hi> the Father of the Bride: who, as soon as it was night, compelled by the violence of the love which she bore to him, sent him word by her whom she had alwayes secretly made use of in this Affair, that she would have him come and steal her away out of her Fathers house before some other mischief arrived. Whereupon the young man, vvho was no more free from this passion then shee, failed not to come to her to a place in which they used to meet together, where his Mistresse importuned him in such manner, as he was constrained to carry her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from her Fathers house, and put her into a Monastery of Religious women, vvhereof an Aunt of hers was as it were the Abbesse; in vvhich she continued nine dayes concealed, without the knowledg or privity of any body. The next morning her Governesse vvent into her chamber where she had left her the night before; but not finding her there, she presently repaired to her Mothers chamber, imagining that she was gone thither to trick up her self extraordinarily, in regard of the time, or for some other such like occasion; and missing of her there too, she returned to her bed-chamber, vvhere she found one of the vvindows that looked into a garden, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, together with a sheet fastned to one of the barrs, and one of her sandals lying below on the ground. Presently misdoubting the businesse, she went without farther delay to impart the sad news unto her Mother, who was still in her bed, out of which in all haste she arose, and diligently searching all the women chambers, vvhere she conceived she might be, and not finding her, it was said, that she vvas so overcome vvith grief, as she fell down dead in the place. In the mean time, the <hi>Fucarandono,</hi> vvho as yet understood nothing of the matter, hearing the noise which the women made, ran in haste to know the cause thereof: Whereupon, being assured of the flight of his Daughter, he sent with all speed to acquaint his kinsmen therewith; who amazed vvith the novelty of so unfortunate and unexpected an accident, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly unto him: Having consulted then amongst themselves vvhat they should do in this Affair, they resolved to proceed therein with all the rigour that possibly could be used; so that presently beginning with the vvomen of the house, they cut off I know not how many of their heads, under pretext of being complices of this rape or flight. After this execution, being of different opinions touching the place where this maid might be, they were all of the minde not to proceed any further, untill they had first acquainted the King with the businesse; which instantly they did, and withall, very earnestly besought him to permit them to go and search the houses of some whom they named unto him, where they beleeved she was: Which the King refusing, as well to exempt the Masters of them from such an affront, as also to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the tumult which this disorder might cause; the <hi>Fucarandono</hi> offended for that the King did not grant him his request, returned with his kinsmen to his Palace, where he resolved with them to do therein all that in such a case he thought was for
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50126:158"/>
his honour, alledging that it was onely for men of little worth, and base mindes, to proceed by way of justice in matters which might be carried by force.

To this disorder the King ran in person with his guard, to see if he could pacifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it; but the quarrell grew so hot betwixt them, as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to appease it: so that after they had lost the respect which they owed to the King, they turned all their fury against him, and slew the most part of them that were with him, so that he was constrained to retire unto his Palace, where he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered unto him as many as possibly he could upon a sudden; but all that served him to little purpose, for they pursued him thither, and killed him, together with very neer all them that he had drawn to his defence, amounting to the number of seven or eight thousand men; amongst the which were six and twenty <hi>Portugals</hi> of forty that were with the King. But these ministers of Satan, not contented with having committed so horrible a Treason, went directly to the Queens lodging, where having found her sick in her bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they most mercilesly butchered her with three of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r Daughters, and all the women they could meet withall. After this, with an inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged fury, they set fire on the Town in six or seven places, which kindling by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the vvinde, that was very high at that time, it took hold of it in such sort, as in lesse then two hours it was almost burnt down to the ground. Whereupon, vve seven and twenty <hi>Portugals</hi> that remained, retired with much adoe to our Vessel, vvhere we saved our selves as it vvere by miracle, leaving our anchor in the sea, and setting sail with all the speed we could. The next morning the mutiners, who were about ten thousand, having sacked the Town, divided themselves into two troops, and retired to a hill, called <hi>Canaphama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note>The same day, after the end of this disorder, advertisement was given thereof to the Prince, the Kings Son, who was at that time in the fort of <hi>Osquy,</hi> some seven leagues from the town of <hi>Fucheo.</hi> This young Prince, extremely afflicted with this newes, would presently have gone to the town with some of his favorites, which were all the company that he had then with him; but the <hi>Fingeindono</hi> his governor, was utterly against it, alledging many reasons to perswade him not to budge from that place, until he had been more amply informed in what termes this affair stood; for it was very credible, that they who durst kill his father, would not stick to dispatch him out of the way too, since it lay in their power so to doe, he not being in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to defend himself: Wherefore he advised him to assemble all the forces he could, to the end he might by their means subdue and chastise his enemies. The Prince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of this counsell, and having taken order for that which he judged was most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary according to the estate wherein he as, he commanded some that were about him, to go and wind the horn, a thing observed in <hi>Iapan,</hi> which caused such a hurly burly over all the country, as words are not able to expresse it. Now the better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this same, you must know, that by an ancient custome of this Kingdome of <hi>Iapan,</hi> all the inhabitants, in whatsoever place they lived, from the least to the greatest, are bound to have in their houses a horn of a great sea-winckles shell, which they are forbidden at any time to winde upon pain of great punishment, save in one of these four cases, namely, a tumult, a fire, a robberie, and a treason; so that if one winds a horn, the cause of it is presently known; because if it be a tumult, one winds it once; if a fire, twice; if a robberie, thrice; and if it be a treason, four times; insomuch,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50126:158"/>
that at the first winding of the horne, all others are bound upon pain of death to wind theirs, and in such sort as the first hath winded his, to the end that it may be distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known what it is, and that there may be no confusion. Now, because this signal of treason is not so ordinary as the others, which arrive very often; when it happens to be given, all the people are so affrightrd with it, as without further delay, they run thronging to the place where the horn was first winded; so that by this means, the bruit passeth from one to another with such speed, as within lesse then an hour, one is advertised thereof above twenty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But to return to that which I said but now; as soon as the Prince had given order for that particular, he retired into a Monastery of Religious persons, which stood in the midst of a wood; there he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained shut up three daies, during the which, he did nothing but bewail his Father, Mother, and Sisters; and that vvith exceeding demonstrations of sorrovv, testified by his sighs, and tears. At the end of that time, in regard great numbers of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects vvere assembled unto him, he went out of that Monastery to provide for that which he judged necessary, as well for the safety of his kingdome, as for the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of the rebels; vvhose goods and estates were immediately confiscated, their houses demolished, and such terrible Proclamations published against them, as could not be heard without trembling. Seven daies after this deplorable event, the Prince was counselled, in regard he had, as already I have said, great numbers come unto him, to go and besiege the ten thousand Mutiners in the place of their retreat: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he parted from the fort of <hi>Osquy,</hi> and marched directly to the town with his Army, which it was said, consisted of very neer an hundred and thirty thousand men, whereof seventeen thousand were horse, and the rest foot, all lusty and well armed, and capable of executing any high enterprise. Being arrived at the town, he was vvonderfully vvell received by the people, vvho <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>estified a great deal of resentment for the death of the late King his father: He vvould not go at first to the Roiall Palace, but went before he past any further to the <hi>Pagode,</hi> where his father was buried; there he took care to make him a funerall Pomp, with a great deal of cost and honor, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of the country, which lasted the two nights following. In conclusion, he was shewed the same robe all bloudy, that his father had on when he was killed; upon which he took a solemn oath, never to pardon any of them that should be found guilty, no not if they were <hi>Bonzes</hi>; and to burn all the Temples where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into those traitors had fled for sanctuary. The fourth day after his entry into the town, he was proclaimed King, though but with little ceremony and magnificence, in regard of the general mourning. That done, accompanied as he was, with an hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score thousand men, he marched directly to the place, whither the mutiners were retired: Now to the end he might the more easily take them, and keep them from flying away; he besieged them in the mountain where they were, and that for the space of nine daies: But whereas they saw that they could hold out no longer for lack of victuals, and that they had no hope of succor, they thought it was better for them to die like valiant men, then to let themselves be besieged like cowards; vvith this resolution, under the favor of a very dark and rainy night, they descended from the mountain by four severall waies, and falling on the Kings Army, which was ready to receive them in battel array, as having been advertised of their design, there ensued so dreadfull and furious a fight betwixt them, as it lasted two hours within day, but at length, the conflict ended with the death of seven and thirty thousand men; amongst the which, the ten thousand Mutiners were slain, not one of them deigning to save himself upon any termes whatsoever. In the mean time, the death of his men great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted the King, who after this punishment of the rebels, retyring to the town, the first thing he did was to provide for the curing of the hurt men, wherein he spent a good time, in regard they were very many, and whereof a great number died af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>

But whereas the Lord doth dispose of things according to his good pleasure, by waies which surpasse our understanding; he permitted, for reasons only known to himself, that on the new moon in December, being the fifth day of the month, there arose so furious a tempest of wind and rain, as all those vessels saving a few perished, in it: so that the losse caused by this storm, amounted unto a thousand, nine hundred, and seventy two <hi>Iuncks</hi>; amongst the which, were six and twenty Portugals ships, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five hundred and two of our nation were drowned; besides, a thousand Christians of other Countries, and eight hundred thousand duckets worth of goods cast away.

To this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, we sent a present to the Captain of the place, that he might suddenly give us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary succor, as accordingly he did; so that the very same day, the ship was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her former estate, and better then before: Neverthelesse, as we were weighing anchor again, the cable of our anchor broke, and because we had but one more in the ship, we were forced to indeavor all that we might for the recovery thereof, by reason of the great need we stood in of it; now, to do this, we sent to land for such as could dive, who in consideration of ten duckets that we gave them, fell to diving into the sea, where they found our anchor in six and tvventy fathome depth, so that by the means which we fastned unto it, vve hoysted it up, though vvith a great deal of labour, vvherein vve all of us bestovved our selves, and spent the most part of the night. As soon as it vvas day, vve set saile, and parting from this river of <hi>Hiamangoo,</hi> it pleased God, that in fourteen daies, vvith a good vvind, vve arrived at <hi>Chincheo,</hi> vvhich is one of the most renovvned and richest Ports of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>China</hi>; there vve vvere advertised, that at the entrance of this river, there

            <p>Having stayed some time at <hi>Malaca,</hi> for the dispatch of certain affaires that I had there, I imbarqued my self for <hi>Goa,</hi> vvith an intent of length, to return into <hi>Portugal,</hi> if I could meet vvith shipping ready to depart from thence at that time; but some fevv daies after my arrivall there it happened, that a <hi>Portugal</hi> named <hi>Antonio Ferreyra,</hi> brought a present of very rich peeces to the Vice-Roy <hi>Don Pedro Mascarenhas,</hi> which the King of <hi>Bungo</hi> sent him from <hi>Iapan,</hi> to getherwith a letter, whereof the contents were these, <hi>Illustrious Lord, and of great majesty, Vice-Roy of the limits of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaes, the dreadfull Lion in the flouds of the sea, by the force of thy ships and artillerie: I</hi> Yacatauandono <hi>King of</hi> Bungo, Facata<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for asmuch as his return hath been longer then I looked for, I have sent thus expresly to know both of him, and of you, the cause of this retardment of his. Wherefore my Lord, I desire you, that he may hasten away to me with all the speed that the first season which shall be proper for navigation, will permit. For besides, that his arrivall in my Kingdome is greatly important for the service of God, it will be also very profitable to my self, for the contracting of a new league with the great King of</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, <hi>to the end that by this amitie, my country and his may hereafter be but one thing, and that his subjects may in all our ports and rivers be as free as they are in your</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim <hi>where you are; wherefore your Lordship shall exceedingly oblige me by sending one unto me, that may be witnesse of the desire I have to serve your King; for I will do it as willingly, as the Sun is ready to hasten his course from the morning to the night. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> Antonio Ferreyra <hi>will give thee the very same armes wherewith I vanquished the Kings of</hi> Fiangaa <hi>and</hi> Xemenarequa, <hi>and which I wore in the day of battel.

The Vice-Roy having read this Letter, sent for one father <hi>Belquior,</hi> Rector of the Colledg of the Jesuits, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving imparted unto him the King of <hi>Bungoes</hi> desire, he told him, that in regard Father <hi>Xavier</hi> was dead, he could wish that he would in his stead undertake this voyage to <hi>Iapan,</hi> which in all probalitie would very much redound to the service of God, and the propogation of the Christian faith. The Rector upon the hearing hereof, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbraced the imployment, wherewith the Vice-Roy was exceedingly well pleased, and very much commended him for such his good and pious resolution. After this, the Vice-Roy consulting with some of his friends about the chusing of a man, that in qualitie of his Ambassador, might accompany the Father in this expedition; I was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated unto him, as the fittest he could fix upon, in regard of the knowledg I had, both of the Country, and of the then King thereof: whereupon, I was immediatly also sent for, and the Vice-Roy acquainting me with the great desire he had, that I should take this negotiation upon me, which he said, did so much import the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God, and the King our Masters service; he prest me so earnestly to it, that I knew not how to refuse him, although I must confesse, I was very unwilling thereunto: So that consenting to what I could not well avoide, he commanded that all things necessary for our voyage should with all convenient speed be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>

            </head>
            <p>FOurteen dayes after, namely on the sixteenth of <hi>April,</hi> One thousand five hundred fifty and four, Father <hi>Belquior</hi> and I set sail for <hi>Malaca</hi> in a ship, wherein also was <hi>Don Antonio de Noronha,</hi> Son to <hi>Don Garcia de Noronha,</hi> who had been Vice-Roy of the Indiaes, that was going to take possession of the Government of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse there; from the which the Vice-Roy had sent order to displace <hi>Don Alvaro de Tayda,</hi> who was Captain of it, as well for that he would not obey his Commands, as for many other misdemeanors which he had committed, whereof I will not speak in particular here, because they are altogether from my purpose at this time. The fifth day of June following, we and the new Captain arrived at <hi>Malaca,</hi> where the Licentiat <hi>Gasper Iorge</hi> Superintendant Generall of the Indiaes, who was the man that prosecuted this businesse, caused the people of the Town to assemble together upon the tolling of a Bell; and having read unto them the Vice-Roys Letters Patents, whereby he displaced <hi>Don Alvaro,</hi> he examined him upon divers Interrogatories, whereof two Registers made a verbal process, which was signed both by them and the said Superintendent, and the new Captain. After all this, <hi>Don Alvaro</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed from his Government, made a prisoner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all his estate confiscated: the like was done to all his partakers who had favoured him in the imprisoning of <hi>Gamboa,</hi> Superintendent of the Treasure, and in disobeying the Vice-Roys Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, as also in many other disorders that had been committed thereupon: vvhich was executed with so much rigour, as the most part fled to the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> whereby the Fortresse remained so bare of men, as it was in danger of being undone, had not the new Captain provided for it with a great deal of prudence, granting a general Abolition unto all, although they returned for all that but with an ill will. These revolutions, and this excesse of justice, which put all the Country into an uproar, were the cause that Father <hi>Belquior</hi> and I could not this year pass unto <hi>Iapan,</hi> as we had resolved; so that we were constrained to winter at <hi>Malaca</hi> until <hi>April</hi> following, in the year One thousand five hundred fifty and five, which was ten months. During that time, the Auditor <hi>Gaspar Iorge</hi> continuing the rigorous executions which he exercised day by day, was a subject of great scandal to all the Country; vvherewith not yet contented, and relying on the large Commission vvhich the Vice-Roy had given him, he would needs intermeddle with the Captain <hi>Don Antonio</hi>'s Jurisdiction; and indeed, he incroached so far on his Authority, as <hi>Don Antonio</hi> had no more but the name of it, and was no other then as a guard of the Fortress. Now though he was very sensible of this affront, yet he did dissemble and endure it with a great deal of patience: But these excessive rigours of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor continuing for the space of four months; during the which there vvere many discontentments, vvhereof I will not treat here in particular, because the discourse of it would be infinite. One day <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> seeing the time proper for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that which he had formerly resolved on, caused some, whom he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined for it, to seise on him in the Fortress, and carry him to a private house; vvhere (according to report) he was stript stark naked, and his hands and feet being bound with cords, he was grievously whipped: After which, having drop'd scald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oyl on his bare flesh, (which had almost killed him) and clapt irons on his legs, and manacles on his hands, they pluck'd off all the hair of his beard, leaving him not so much as one, and did many other such like things unto him, as it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly spoken: so that the poor Licentiat <hi>Gaspar Iorge,</hi> who termed himself Auditor Generall of the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> great Provisor of the deceased and Orphelins, and Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent of the Treasure of <hi>Malaca,</hi> and or the Countries of the South, for the King our Soveraign Lord, vvas thus handled by <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> if the report of it be true. Finally, when the season of Navigation was come, he was sent, so manacled as he was to the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> with an infamous verball process; which the Parliament of <hi>Goa</hi> annulled afterwards: And <hi>Don Antonio</hi> had thereupon an expresse Commandment
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:50126:160"/>
from the Vice-Roy <hi>Don Pedro de Mascarenhas,</hi> who governed the State of the <hi>Indiaes</hi> at that time, to appear personally before him as a Prisoner, for to be confronted in judgment with <hi>Gaspar Iorge,</hi> and render an account of his proceeding against him; as indeed <hi>Don Antonio</hi> failed not in making his appearance at <hi>Goa</hi> accordingly: where being about to justifie himself for that which had past, he was ordered to answer within three dayes to an ignominious Libel, which <hi>Gaspar Iorge</hi> had exhibited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: But forasmuch as <hi>Don Antonio</hi> was naturally an enemy of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by Answers and Replyes, whereby it was said, the Councellors of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment intended to surprize him, the report went (at least wise such was the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Detractors; for as for me, I neither saw nor am assured of it) that in stead of imploying the three dayes which had been given him, in making answer to this Libell, hee vvithin four and twenty hours having met accidentally vvith <hi>Gaspar Iorge,</hi> sent him to prosecute his Suit in the other World, laying him so sure on the ground, as he never rose again. Howbeit, there are those vvhich recount this Affair quite otherwise, and that say, how in a Feast, vvhereunto he was invited, hee vvas poysoned. By this death of his all this difference vvas decided, and this businesse vvholly ceased, so that <hi>Don Antonio</hi> vvas by Sentence absolutely clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and sent back to his Government: wherein he continued not above two months and a half, at the end vvhereof he died of a bloody Flux: and so vvere all the storms of envie and discord vvherewith the Fortresse of <hi>Malaca</hi> had been beaten, appeased.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note> on the first day of <hi>April,</hi> in the year One thousand five hundred fifty and five, wee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Malaca,</hi> after vvee had imbarqued our selves in a Carvel belonging to the King our Soveraign Lord, which <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> the Captain of the Fortresse gave us by the expresse command of the Vice-Roy. Three dayes after our putting to sea, we arrived at an Island called <hi>Pulho Pisan,</hi> at the entering into the Streight of <hi>Sincaapura,</hi> where the Pilot having never navigated that way before, ran us with full sails so dangerously on certain Rocks, as we thought our selves to be utterly lost, without all hope of recovery: In regard whereof, by the advice of all the rest, the Father and I were constrained to get into a Manchua, for to go and demand succour of one <hi>Luis Dalmeida,</hi> who two hours before had passed by us in a Vessell of his, and lay at anchor two leagues off us, by reason the winde was against him: So the Father and I made to him with peril enough. For whereas all that Country, which appertained to the King of <hi>Iantana,</hi> Grand-childe to him that had been King of <hi>Malaca,</hi> our mortall Enemy, were at that time in arms, his <hi>Balons</hi> and <hi>Lanchares,</hi> that were assembled in a Fleet of Warr, continually gave us chase, with an intention to take us; but by Gods providence we escaped them. At length, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had got to this ship, with no little fear and trouble, he that was Captain of her furnished us with a Boat and Mariners, and so we returned to our Carvel as speedily as we could, for to succour and draw her out of the danger wherein we had left her: But it pleased the Lord that we found her the day after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from it; though it is true, that she took in water abundantly in the prow's side; but in the end we stanched it at <hi>Patana,</hi> where we arrived seven dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. There I went ashore with two others, to see the King; unto whom I deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Letter from the Captain of <hi>Malaca:</hi> and being received very graciously by him, he read it over, whereby he understood, that the cause of our coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to provide our selves of victuals, and some other things which we had not taken in at <hi>Malaca</hi>; as also that we were resolved to proceed on in our course directly to <hi>China,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Iapan,</hi> where Father <hi>Belquior</hi> and others with him were to preach the Christian Law to the Gentiles: vvhich the King of <hi>Patana</hi> having read, after he had mused a little, he turned to them that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and said smiling to them, <hi>O how much better were it for these men, since they expose themselves to so many travels, to go to</hi> China <hi>and inrich themselves there, then to recount tales in strange Countreys?</hi> Whereupon, calling the <hi>Xabandar</hi> to him, <hi>Be sure,</hi> said he unto him, <hi>that thou givest these men here all that they shall demand of thee, and that for the love of the Captain of</hi> Malaca, <hi>who hath greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:50126:161"/>
them unto mee: and above all remember, That it is not my custome to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a thing twice.</hi> When we had taken leave of the King, exceedingly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the good reception he had given us, we fell presently to buying of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and other such things as we stood in need of; So that in eight dayes we were abundantly furnished with whatsoever was necessary for us. Being departed from this Haven of <hi>Patana,</hi> we sailed two dayes together with a South-east winde along by the coast of <hi>Lugor</hi> and <hi>Siam,</hi> traversing the Barr of <hi>Cuy,</hi> to go to <hi>Pulho Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim,</hi> and from thence to the Islands of <hi>Canton,</hi> with an intent there to attend the conjunction of the new Moon: But it was our ill fortune to be surprized by East and South-east winde, (which raign in that Coast the most part of the year) whereof the violence was so great, that we were in fear to be cast away: so that to decline the event thereof, we were forced to tack about again to the Coast of <hi>Malaya</hi>; and arriving at an Island, called <hi>Pullo Timan,</hi> we ran into great danger there, as well by reason of the tempest which we had upon the sea, as in regard of the great treason of the people of the Country. Now after five dayes that we had continued there, without having either fresh water or victuals, because for the easing of our Vessell we had cast out all into the Sea, it pleased God that wee encountred with three <hi>Portugal</hi> Ships which came from <hi>Sunda,</hi> by whose arrivall we were very much comforted in our travels: Whereupon Father <hi>Belquior</hi> and I began to treat with the Captains of those Vess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There amongst the Rocks we perceived a very-fair Cross graven on a great free Stone, and under it 1518, with six letters abbreviated, which said, <hi>Duart Coelho:</hi> We observed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so towards the River, and on the South-side, two flight shot off, threescore and two men hanged on trees alongst the Strand, besides others that lay on the ground half eaten; a thing which seemed to have been done not above six or seven dayes before. Upon another tree there hung a great Banner, wherein these vvords vvere seen in <hi>Chinese</hi> letters, <hi>Let every Ship or Iunck which shall arrive in this place, be sure to dislodg quickly from thence after shee hath furnished her self with fresh water, whether shee hath time, or hath it not; on pain of incurring the same justice as these wretches have done, whom the fury of the arm of the son of the Sun hath overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Wee were mightily surprised vvith so strange an accident, so that vve could make no other judgment of it, but that some <hi>Chinese</hi> Army had arrived there, and meeting with those vvretches, had (as Pirats use to do) intreated them as vve saw, under the specious pretext of Justice.</p>

            <p>WHen we were parted from the Iland of <hi>Champieloo,</hi> we got to the Ilands of <hi>Canton,</hi> so that on the fifth day of our voyage, it pleased God that we arrived at one of them, called <hi>Lampacau,</hi> where at that time the <hi>Portugals</hi> excercised their commerce with the <hi>Chineses,</hi> which continued untill the year One thousand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50126:161"/>
fifty and seven; when as the <hi>Mandarins</hi> of <hi>Canton,</hi> at the request of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of the Country, gave us the port of <hi>Macao,</hi> where the trade now is; of which place (that was but a desert Iland before) our country men made a very goodly planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein there were houses worth three or four thousand Duckats, together with a Cathedral Church: Moreover, this Colony hath its Governor, Auditor, and Officers of Justice; whereunto I shal add, that the inhabitants of this place are in as great safety there, as if they were in the quietest part of <hi>Portugal.</hi> But God grant of his infinite mercy, and goodnesse, that this Colony may be of longer durance then that of <hi>Liampoo,</hi> which was another of the Portugals, and whereof I have spoken at large heretofore, being two hundred leagues from this same on the North Coast. But ill fortune would, that by the disorder of one Portugal, it was demolished in a very little time; in which disaster, I my self was present, and can say, that the losse which was made there, as well of people, as of riches, was inestimable. For in this plantation, were three thousand men, whereof twelve hundred were <hi>Portugals,</hi> and the rest Christians of divers nations: Yea, and I have heard many say, which spoke like knowing men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that the Portugals traffick there, exceeded three millions of gold: Now, the most part of this traffick was in lingots of silver of <hi>Iapan,</hi> which had been found out not above two months before, and was such as a man doubled his mony three or four times by the commodities which he sent thither. In this Colony, there was a Governor, who resided in the Country; there were also an Auditor, Judges, Sheriffs, Aldermen, a Provisor of the deceased and Orphelins, a town Clark, and all other Officers that are usually in a Commonwealth; together with four publick Notaries, and six Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters, each of whose offices were sold for three thousand duckats; yea, and there were some farre dearer. There were also two Hospitals, wherein above thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand duckats was spent every year, and the Town house had in revenue six thousand <hi>per annum</hi>; So that it was generally said, that this Colony was the richest, and best peopled, of any that was in the Indiaes; besides, for matter of extent, it had not its fellow in all <hi>Asia.</hi> Furthermore, when the Registers or Secretaries passed any Grant, or when the publick Notaries made any writings, they ordinarily used these termes; <hi>In this most noble and alwaies faithfull town of</hi> Liampoo, <hi>for the King our Soveraign Lord.</hi> Now, having said so much of it, I hold it not amisse to tell you, how and wherefore so noble and rich a Colony was destroyed, which arrived in this sort. There was living there a man of a good extraction and rank, named <hi>Lancerote Pereyra,</hi> born at <hi>Pont de Lima,</hi> a town in <hi>Portugal</hi>; it is said, that this same had lent some thousand duckats to certain <hi>Chineses,</hi> who were not men solvent, but became bankrupts, and never paid him any thing, nor could he hear any newes of them afterwards; which was the cause that desiring to make good this losse, and to recover it of them which were not the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it, he assembled for that effect some eighteen or twenty <hi>Portugals,</hi> idle fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and of lewd dispositions, with whom, under the favor of the night, he fell upon a village, some two leagues from thence where he robbed eleven or twelve labouring men; and withall, seizing on their wives and children, killed about half a score persons, without any reason at all so to do. In the mean time, the Alarum being taken up by the whole country round about, by reason of this violence, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants went and complained to the <hi>Chumbin</hi> for Justice; and having made a verball process of the businesse, they presented it in the name of the people to the <hi>Chaem</hi> of the Government, which is as one of the Vice-Roys of the Kingdome; who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately thereupon, disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50126:162"/>
and two and forty Juncks. It is said, that in this common ruine, there was lost to the value of two millions of Gold, as well in Lingots, Pepper, Sandal, Cloves, Mace, and Nutmeggs, as in other Commodities; and all these desasters arrived by the ill conscience, and little judgment of an avaricious <hi>Portugal.</hi> Now, from this misfortune, was another farre greater derived; which was, that we lost our credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation so mightily over all the Country, as the inhabitants would no longer endure the sight of us; saying, that we were divels incarnate, ingendred by the malediction of the wrath of God, for the punishment of sinners. This hapned in the year, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, five hundred, forty and two, <hi>Martim Alfonso de Sousa</hi> being Governor of the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> and <hi>Ruy Van Pereyra Marramaque</hi> Captain of <hi>Malaca.</hi> Two years after, the <hi>Portugals</hi> desiring to make another new Colony in a Port, called <hi>Chincheo,</hi> in the same Kingdome of China, five leagues lower then <hi>Liampoo,</hi> with an intention to settle their trade there, the Merchants of the Country coming to consider what great profit would redound to them thereby, intreated the <hi>Mandarins</hi> to make shew of permitting it, and obliged them thereunto with many great presents; we had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce then with those of the Country about two yeares and an half, untill such time as by the expresse command of <hi>Simano de Mello,</hi> Captain of the Fortresse, there was sent into this place another man of the same humor as <hi>Lancerote Pereyra</hi> was of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the said <hi>Simano de Mello</hi> gave a commission to be Governor of this Port of <hi>Chincheo,</hi> and Provisor of the Deceased: but the bruit went of him, that the extream covetuousnesse wherewith he was possest, made him lay hands on all things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the least respect to ought whatsoever. It hapned then that in his time there arrived in the Port of <hi>Chincheo</hi> a stranger, by nation an <hi>Armenian,</hi> who was held by every one for a very good Christian: This man, who had an estate of ten or twelve thousand duckets, and being a Christian, as I have said, and a stranger, as we were, passed out of a <hi>Mahometans</hi> Junck, wherein he was, into the ship of a <hi>Portugal,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Luis de Montaroyo.</hi> Now having lived some six or seven months very peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably amongst us, and much respected and favored of every one, he chanced to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>all sick of a feaver, whereof he died, but before he gave up the Ghost, he declared by his Testament, that he had a wife and children in a town of <hi>Armenia,</hi> called <hi>Gaborem,</hi> and that of his twelve thousand duckets estate he left two thousand to the Hospitall at <hi>Malaca</hi>; and for the rest, he desired it might be kept in safe hands, untill there were an opportunity to have consigned it unto his children, as to his lawfull heirs; and in case they were dead, he left it to the Hospitall. Behold, what was the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament of this faithfull Christian, who was no sooner buried, but <hi>Ayr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>z Botelho de Sousa,</hi> Provisor of the dead, seized on all his estate, without making any Inventorie, or other kind of accompt, saying, that before any farther proceeding therein, they were to send to make enquiry in <hi>Armenia,</hi> which was above two thosand leagues from thence, to see whether there were not some ingagements, or seizure of Justice upon it: There arrived also at the same time, two <hi>Chinese</hi> Merchants, who had to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of three thousand duckets in silk, peeces of damaske, musk, and porcelaines, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the deceased <hi>Armenian</hi>: the Provisor arrested them all, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented therewith, he would needs make the <hi>Chineses</hi> beleeve, that all the merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise which they had, belonged also unto the <hi>Armenian</hi>; so that under the pretext thereof, he took eight thousand duckets from them, and bid them go to <hi>Goa</hi> and there demand justice of the Provisor Generall, by reason he could do no otherwise then he did; for that, he was obliged to deal in that sort by the duty of his Charge. Now, not to stand upon the delivering of the reasons, which in vain were alledged by them against this injustice of his; I will only say, that these two Merchants returning home without any of their merchandise, went with their Wives and Children, and casting themselves at the <hi>Chaems</hi> feet, represented unto him in a Petition the whole businesse, as it past: informing him, moreover, that we were men quite-void of the fear of God. The <hi>Chaem</hi> willing to do justice then to these Merchants, and to many others which had formerly complained against us, caused it to be every where proclamed, that no man on pain of death should converse with us; whereupon, the scarcity of victuals came to be so great amongst us, as that which was wont to be bought for six blanks, was then worth above a ducket; so that necessity constrained us to go unto certain hamlets;
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:50126:162"/>
whereupon ensued such disorders, as all the Country rose up against us with so much hatred and fury, that sixteen daies after we were set upon by an Army of an hundred and twenty very great Juncks, which intreated us in that manner for our sins, as ofthir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ships which we had in the Port, there was not one that was not burnt; and of five hundred <hi>Portugals</hi> which were abiding in the Country, thirty only escaped, who had not the worth of a penny left them. From these two sad histories, recounted by me, I inferre, that it seemes the Affairs which we have now in <hi>China,</hi> and the tranquillity and confidence wherewith we live there, (supposing that the treaties of peace which we have with them be firm and assured) wil last but til our sins shal serve for motives to the inhabitants of the Country to mutine against us, which God of his infinite mercy, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not for the time to come. To return again now to my former discourse, you must understand, that after we were arrived at the Port of <hi>Lampacau,</hi> as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, we could not meet with any vessel that was bound for <hi>Iapan</hi>; so that we were constrained to passe another year too in this Port, with a design in May following, which was ten months off, to continue our voyage as we had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Belquior</hi> and I perceiving that there was no hope of going to <hi>Iapan</hi> this yeare, as well for that the season was past, as for other inconveniences that fell out, we were forced to stay in this Iland till the time should serve for us to make our voyage thither. Having continued there then til the seventeenth of Feb. following, certain news came to us from <hi>Cantan,</hi> that on the third day of the same month the Province of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy</hi> had been swallowed up in the manner ensuing. The first day of Frebruary, the earth fel a trembling from eleven til one of the clock at night, and the next day from mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night til two in the morning; as also the day following from one til three: During this trembling it was a dreadful thing to hear the terrible noise which the stormes and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der made: After all this such an horrible inundation of waters borke forth out of the center of the earth, as in an instant, all the Country about, was swallowed up threescore leagues round, without the saving of any living creature from perishing, but only of one child of seven years of age, and which was for a great wonder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the King of <hi>China.</hi> In the mean time this news was no sooner come to the City of <hi>Cantan,</hi> but all the inhabitants thereof were terrifyed with it, yea and all ours were so amazed at it, that holding it for an unpossible thing, fourteen of our company would needs go thither to know the truth thereof; which they immediately put in execution, and at their return affirmed, that the matter was very certain, whereof an attestation was made, signed by fourteen ocular witnesses, who had been upon the place; which attestation was afterwards sent by <hi>Francisco Toscano</hi> to the King of <hi>Portugal, Don Ioano</hi> the third of glorious memory. This prodigious event so affrighted the inhabitants of the City of <hi>Cantan,</hi> that all of them generally testified a world of repentance; and although they were Gentiles, yet must it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that they confounded us Christians, who saw how far their devotion extended. For on the first day when the newes thereof arrived there, Proclamations were made throughout all the Principall streets of the City by six men on horseback, who in long mourning robes, and with a sad and lamentable voice, rode crying out these words; <hi>Miserable creatures as you are, that cease not from offending day by day, the Lord of all things: Heare, O heare, the most lamentable and dreadfull adventure that ever was; For you are to know, that for our sins God hath drawn the sword of his Divine Iustice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the people of</hi> Cuy <hi>and</hi> Sansy, <hi>overwhelming pell mell with water, fire, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests from Heaven all that great Province of</hi> China, <hi>none being saved but one only Child which is carried to the Son of the Sun.</hi> And thereupon, they rung a little bell thrice, which they had in their hands; Then all the people prostrating themselves on the ground, said with fearfull cryes, <hi>God is Iust in all that he doth.</hi> After this was past, all the inhabitants retired into their houses, which were shut up for five daies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so that the City was so desolate, as there was not a living creature seen stirring in it. At the end of the five daies, the <hi>Chaem</hi> and the <hi>Anchassis</hi> of the government, together with all the rest of the people (wherein the men only vvere comprehended, for as for the vvomen, they hold them incapable of being heard of God, by reason of the disobedience of the first sinne committed by <hi>Eve</hi>) vvent as it vvere in proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50126:163"/>
thorow the principall Streets of the Citie, while their Priests, which vvere above five thousand in number, cryed with a loud voyce that pierced the very skies, <hi>O marvellous and pitifull Lord, have no regard to our wickednesse; for if thou takest account of them, we shall remain dumb before thee.</hi> Whereunto all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with an other fearfull cry, answered, <hi>Lord, we confesse our faults before thee.</hi> And so the Procession continuing, still going on, they at length arrived at a magnificent Temple, called <hi>Nacapyrau,</hi> whom they hold for the Queen of Heaven, as I have heretofore related. From thence they went the next day to another Temple, called <hi>The God of Iustice:</hi> and in this sort they continued fourteen dayes; during which, were great Alms generally bestowed, and many prisoners freed; also divers Sacrifices were made of the odoriferous perfumes of Aloes and Benjamin: There were many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too, wherein there was good store of blood shed, and wherein many Kine, Stags and Swine vvere offered, vvhich were all distributed in almes to the poor. In pursuance whereof, during the three months that we abode there, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in doing many other good works, which were performed vvith so much charge and charity, as it is to be beleeved, that if the Faith of Jesus Christ had been added thereunto, they would have been acceptable unto him. We heard afterwards, and this report was universall over all the Country, that during the three dayes of that Earth-quake at <hi>Sansy,</hi> it had still rained blood in the City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> vvhere the King of <hi>China</hi>'s Court was at that time, vvhich made the most part of the inhabitants to forsake it, and the King to fly to <hi>Nanquin,</hi> vvhere, it was said, he gave great alms, and set at liberty an infinite many of Slaves; amongst the which were five <hi>Portugals,</hi> vvho had been retained prisoners in the Town of <hi>Pocasser</hi> above twenty yeers together. When these came to <hi>Cantan,</hi> they recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us divers marvellous things; and amongst others, they told us, that the almes which the King had given upon this occasion, amounted to six hundred thousand Duckats, besides the magnificent Temples which he built to appease the vvrath of God; amongst the which hee made one in that very City, very sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and of great majesty, under the title of <hi>The Love of God.</hi>

            <p>THe season being come vvherein vve might continue our Voyage, vve parted from this Island of <hi>Lampacau</hi> the seventh day of <hi>May,</hi> One thousand five hundred fifty and six, after vve had imbarqued our selves in a Ship, vvhereof <hi>Don Francisco de Mascarenhas,</hi> surnamed <hi>Pallia,</hi> vvas Captain. So vve proceeded on in our course for fourteen dayes together; at the end whereof vve discovered the first Islands, at the height of five and thirty degrees; and vvhich by gradation regard the West, North-vvest of <hi>Tanixumaa:</hi> vvhereupon, the Pilot knowing that it vvas ill sailing there, steered to the South-vvest, to finde out the point of the Mountain of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natoo</hi>: We coasted <hi>Tanoraa</hi> then, and still ran along this coast to the Port of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugaa.</hi> And forasmuch as in this Climate the windes are Northerly, and that the current of the vvater vvas contrary to them, the Pilot had a very bad opinion of his Navigation; so that vvhen he came to know his fault, although out of an accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med obstinacy of Mariners, he vvould not confess it, vve vvere already past three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score leagues beyond the Port vvhere vve meant to arrive; by reason vvhereof, we vvere fain to tack about for the recovery of it fifteen dayes after, though with travell enough, for that the vvindes were crosse; and (without lying) our goods and lives were in no little jeopardy, by reason all this Coast was risen up against the King of <hi>Bungo</hi> our Friend, and the inhabitants, who vvere greatly inclined to the Law of the Lord, vvhich had formerly been preached unto them. At length, after that by the mercy of God vve had got to the Town of <hi>Fucheo,</hi> vvhereof I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes spoken, which is the capitall of the Kingdom of <hi>Bungo,</hi> where the chiefest Christians of all <hi>Iapan</hi> do now flourish; all they of the Ship thought it requisite that I should go to the Fortresse of <hi>Osquy,</hi> where we heard the King then was: Now though I feared to undertake this Journey, in regard the Country was all up, yet I
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:50126:163"/>
resolved for it, at the perswasion of them of the ship, who all in generall intreated me very earnestly unto it. Having prepared my self then, and received a Present worth five hundred Crowns, which <hi>Don Francisco,</hi> Captain of the Ship sent to the King, I took four of my companions with me, and so went away. After I was land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Town Key, the first thing I did was to go to the house of the Admirall of the Sea, who received me with great demonstrations of friendship, and confirmed me against the fear I was in; whereupon, having given him an account of the cause of my coming thither, I desired him to give me horses and men that might conduct me to the King; which most willingly he did, and more freely then I required. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing departed from this Town, the next morning about nine of the clock I arrived at a place called <hi>Fingau,</hi> which might be a quarter of a league from the Fortresse of <hi>Osquy</hi>; There I sent one of those of <hi>Iapan,</hi> which I had with me, to let the Captain of the place understand that I was arrived, and that I had an Embassie to deliver to his Highnesse from the Vice-Roy of the <hi>Indiaes:</hi> In which regard, I intreated him <hi>to appoint me such a time as he pleased, that I might speak with him.</hi> Hereunto he returned me this answer by a Son of his, <hi>That my Companions and I were very welcome, and that the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was in the Isle of</hi> Xequa, <hi>where he was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining himself in the catching of a great Fish, whereof the name was not known, and which was come thither from the bottom of the Sea, with a great number of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little fishes: and that having cooped him up in a Channel there, it was likely that he would spend all the day in that sport, and not return till night: But that he would howsoever immediately advertise him of my arrivall.</hi> Thereupon he sent me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose my self in a better lodging which he gave me, where I was abundantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with all that was necessary for mee; yea, and he told me by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, that all this Country was no lesse the King of <hi>Portugals,</hi> then <hi>Malaca, Cochin and Goa.</hi> Then one of his Followers, whom he had appointed to wait on us, gave us an extraordinary good reception in a <hi>Pagode,</hi> whereof the <hi>Bonz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s</hi> made us a very sumptuous Feast. In the mean time, the King having notice of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall, dispatched away from the Island where hee was catching that great Fish, three light Galleys, and in them his Chamberlain, a great Favourite of his, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Oretandano,</hi> who about evening came to me to the place where I was, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told me that by word of mouth which the King had enjoyned him, he drew forth a Letter, and having kissed it with the Ceremonies and Complements used amongst them, he delivered it unto me, wherein I found this written, <hi>Being at his present imployed in an exercise which is very pleasing unto me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have been advertised of thy arrival in my Country, wherewith I am so contented, that I protest unto thee, I would have come away presently unto thee, had I not sworn that I would not part from hence, till I had killed a great Fish which I hold coop'd up here: Wherefore I intreat thee, as my good Friend, since by reason thereof I cannot go to thee, that thou wilt come thy self to me in this Vessel which I have sent for thee: for on thy coming, and on the death which I hope to give to this Fish, my perfect content depends.</hi> Having read this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I instantly imbarked my self in the Galley wherein <hi>Oretandono</hi> came for me, and my followers in the other two, with the Present they carried. And forasmuch as those Galleys were very swift, we arrived within lesse then an hour at the Island, which was some two leagues and an half off. Now we came thither at such time as the King, with above two hundred men in boats, with darts in their hands, was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing a prodigious Whale, which was altogether unknown and strange to them, as having never seen such a Fish before in all that Country. After they had killed and drawn it to land, the King was so pleased therewith, that to recompence all the fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were imployed in the action, he exempted them from a certain Tribute which they had accustomed to pay before: as also conferred new Honours on some Gentlemen whom he loved, and that were there with him, and gave a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Taeis</hi> in silver to his Pages: withall, he received me with a smiling count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:50126:164"/>
esteem vvherein we vvere at that time in the Country; for all the inhabitants held it for most certain, that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was indeed the only Prince, which might terme himself the Monarch of the world, as well for the large extent of his territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as for his power, and mighty treasure; in regard whereof chiefly they of these Countryes made great account of our amitie. These things done, the King vvent from this Iland towards <hi>Osquy,</hi> and about an hour within night he arrived at his Castle, vvhere he was received with a great deal of rejoycing, and applaued by every one for so honourable an exploit, as that of killing the Whale, attributing to him alone, that which all the rest had done; whereby one may see, that this pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vice of flatttery raigns so absolutely in the Courts of Princes, as it hath establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed its felf a place even amongst the very Gentiles and Infidels. The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dismissed all them that had accompanied him, vvent to Sup with his Wife and Daughters, and would not then be attended on by any body, because the feast was made at his vvives charge. And whereas vve vvere then at a Treasurers house of his, where vve vvere appointed to lodg, he sent for us all five, and intreated us that vve should eat in his presence after the manner of our Country, adding, that the Queen did infinitely desire it. Then having caused a table to be covered for us, and on it placed store of excellent good meat and vvell drest, vvhich vvas served up by very fair vvomen; vve fell to eating after our manner, of all that vvas set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, vvhilest the jeasts vvhich the Ladies broke upon us, in seeing us feed so vvith our hands, gave more delight to the King and Queen, then all the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that could have been represented before them: for those people being accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to feed vvith tvvo little st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon the Kings Daughter, a marvellous fair Princesse, and not above fourteen or fifteen years of age, craved leave of the Queen her Mother, that she and six or seven of her companions might present a certain Play before them concerning the subject in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; which the Queen with the Kings consent granted her.

the King and Queen could not forbear laughing, to see that this old Merchant, who had so many children, and so many incommodities, was the Princesse their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, very young, and exceeding beautifull: But the King forbearing a little from laughing, answered her with a great deal of gravity, that shee should shew some samples of the Merchandize which she had, and if it were such as would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate us, he would desire us to buy it. At these words, the pretended Merchant having made a very low obeysance, retired into the other room again. In the mean time, we were so confounded with what we heard and saw, as we could not tell what to think, or what should be the event of it; whilest the vvomen which were in the room, being about three score in number, (for there were no other men but we five there) fell to jogging one another, and laughing at us. Hereupon, the Merchant comes in again, bringing with her six fair young maids, richly clad, and disguised also like Merchants, carrying samples of the Merchandize they had to sell: They had Scymiters and Daggers by their sides all guilt, with grave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances and high looks, being all of them Daughters to the greatest Lords of the Kingdom, whom the Princesse had expresly chosen to act this Play with her. Each of these six Damsels bare on her shoulder a fardle of green Taffats, and all of them together, seeming to be Merchants sons, danced a Ball to the tune of two Harps and a Viol, and ever and anon sung in verse with a very sweet and melodious voyce, words of this substance, <hi>High and mighty Lord, by the riches which thou possessest, we pray thee to think of our poverty; we are miserable creatures in this strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and consequently despised by the inhabitants thereof, which exposeth us to great affronts: wherefore we beseech thee by that which thou art, be mindfull of our poverty.</hi> After that these young Merchants had finished their Dance and Song, they fell all on their knees before the King, and then the eldest of them having rendred him most humble thanks for the favour he did them, in helping them away with their Merchandize, they untied all their fardle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and let fall in the midst of the room a great number of woodden arms with hands, the said eldest of them saying with a very good grace, <hi>Since that Nature for our sins hath subjected us to so villanous a misery, that our hands must of necessity smell alwayes of flesh or fish, or of such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meat as wee eat with them, this Merchandize will greatly accommodate us, to the end that whilest we make use of one sort of hands, the other may be washed.</hi> The King and Queen fell heartily a laughing at this Speech; vvhereas in the mean time we five were so ashamed, as the King perceiving it, desired us to take it in good part, saying, That the Princesse his Daughter had done this to no other end, but for the better entertainment of us, vvhom she respected as her Brothers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto vve made answer, That <hi>we hoped God our Master would reward his Highnesse for this honour and grace that he did us; which we confess'd was very great, and for such wee would publish it over all the world as long as we lived:</hi> Wherewith the King, Queen and Princesse shewed themselves very vvell satisfied, giving us thanks vvith many complements after their manner: yea, and the Princesse said to us more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>If your God would take me for his servant, I should endeavour the best I could to please him: but I hope he will not forget me.</hi> At these vvords vve prostrated our selves on our knees before her, and kissing the hem of her garment, vve answered her, <hi>That we hoped no lesse of her, and that in case shee became a Christian, we should see her Queen of Portugal:</hi> Whereupon the Queen her Mother and she fell a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Having taken leave then of the King, vve returned to our lodging, and the next morning as soon as it vvas day, he sent for us again, and questioned us very exactly about the coming of Father <hi>Belquior,</hi> the intention of the Vice-Roy, the Letter which I had brought from him; our Ship, and the goods that were in her; and many other things, wherein we spent four hours at the least; after which he dismissed us, saying, that within six dayes he would be at the Town, and that there he would receive the Letter, see the Father, and make answer to all.</p>

            <head>CHAP. LXXX. My reception by the King of <hi>Bungo,</hi> as Ambassador from the Vice-Roy of the Indiaes.</head>
            <p>AFter the six daies were past the King parted from <hi>Osquy</hi> to go to the town of <hi>Fucheo,</hi> accompanied with a great number of Nobilitie, and a guard of six hundred foot, and two hundred horse, which made a goodly shew. Being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there, he was received by the people with great demonstrations of joy, with Shewes, Interludes, and many other inventions after their manner, that were very costly; after which, he went to his Palace, an exceeding fair and magnificent structure, whither the next day he sent for me, and bid me bring him the Vice-Roys Letter, as being come for no other end but to receive it, and that after he had read it, he would speak with Father <hi>Belquior</hi> touching the matters that were most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant. Whereupon I presently returned to my lodging, and having made ready all that was necessary for me, about two of the clock in the afternoon, the King sent the Captain of the town, and four other of the chiefest men of the Court for me; who conducted me to the Palace, accompanied with forty <hi>Portugals,</hi> which marched all on foot, because it is the custome of the Country so to do. All the streets thorow which we past, were very handsomly set forth, and there was such a world of people, as the officers had much adoe to make way for us. Three <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> on horseback, carried each of them a peece of the present; and a little after them followed two curious Spanish Gennets, with rich Saddles and Trappings, and with such Armes as are used in Justs. Upon our arrival at the first court of the Palace, we found the King there on a scaffold, which had been erected expresly for him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with all the Lords of the Kingdome, amongst whom, vvere the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of three strange Princes, namely the first of the King of the <hi>Lequios,</hi> the second of the King of <hi>Chauchim,</hi> and Isle of <hi>Tosa,</hi> and the third of the Emperor of the <hi>Miacoo</hi>; and round about as far as the court extended, there were above a thousand har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers, and four hundred men mounted on good horses, besides a multitude of people without number. After that the forty <hi>Portugals</hi> and I were come to the Scaffold where the King was, we performed all the ceremonies and complements which are used to be done to him in such cases; and then approaching a little neerer to him, I delivered him the Letter from the vice-Roy, which he would not receive but stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Then being set down again in his place, he gave it to one about him, that was as his Secretary who read it aloud that every one might hear. After it was read, the King questioned me before the three strange Ambassadors, and the great Lords with whom he was accompanied, about certain things which he was curious to know touching our <hi>Europe</hi>; whereof one was, how many men, armed <hi>cap-a-pe,</hi> and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on such horses as those were that I saw there, the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> could bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field? Whereupon fearing least I should blush if I came to tell a lie; I must confesse, that I was much troubled how to answer, which one of my companions who was neer me, perceiving, speaking for me, made answer; That he could bring an hundred or sixscore thousand; a matter whereat the King was much abashed, and I too: But the King taking pleasure as it seemed, in the marvellous answer, which this <hi>Portugal</hi> gave him, bestovved above an hours time in asking him que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions. In the mean season, even the King himself, and all they that were present with him, being exceedingly amazed to hear such great and strange things delivered, he turned to them and said; <hi>I sware truly unto you, that I should desire nothing so much in the world, as to see the Monarchy of this great Country, whereof I have heard such wonderfull things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well concerning the immence treasures, and the infinite number of ships which he hath; for could I but once do this, I should live very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented the rest of my daies.</hi> Thereupon having sent me, and those that accompanied me, away, he said unto me, <hi>When thou shalt think it a fit time, thou maiest bid the Father come unto me, for he shall find me ready here to receive him.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:50126:165"/>After I was retired to my lodging. I gave Father <hi>Belquior</hi> an accompt of the Kings good reception of me, together with all that had past besides,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note> and how desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous he was to see him; in regard whereof I held it fit, since all the <hi>Portugals</hi> vvere then together, and in their best clothes, that he should go to him out of hand, which he liked very vvell of. Having furnished himself then with certain things necessary for the better setting forth of his person, he and I went avvay, accompanied vvith forty <hi>Portugals,</hi> all very well apparrelled, and vvearing chaines of gold Scarfe-wise; and four pretty boyes in cassocks, and hats of white taffata, and silken crosses on their brests, together with a converted <hi>Iapanois,</hi> Christened <hi>Ioana Fernandez,</hi> to serve for Interpreter. When wee vvere arrived at the first Court of the Kings Palace, we found some Lords attending us there, who vvith a great deal of courtesie and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of friendship brought the Father and me up to a chamber where the King stayed for him, who having taken him by the hand with a joyfull countenance, said unto him; <hi>Beleeve me, Father, this day is the only one that I can call mine, in regard of the extreme pleasure I take to see thee before mine eyes, because, me thinks, I see Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Xavier, <hi>to whom I wished as well as to mine own person:</hi> Then leading him into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother inner chamber, that was richlyer furnished, he set him down by him, and made very much of the four little Boyes, for that it was a new thing to him, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen in that Country before. The Father rendred him thanks conformable to the great honor he did him, and after that manner which they are wont to use amongst themselves, and which <hi>Ioana Fernandez</hi> had taught him. After this, he entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with the principall cause of his coming, which was, that the Vice-Roy had sent him expresly to serve him, and to shew him the assured way of salvation; which the King seemed to like of, by his action of bowing down of his head: The Father going on, made an holy speech somewhat like unto a Sermon unto him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the businesse in hand; and which, he had directly studied for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Whereunto the King made this answer, <hi>Good Father, I know not how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the great content which I take in seeing thee in this house, and in learning all that which my ears have heard thee say; which I do not answer for the present, in regard the affaires of my State are such, as thou maiest peradventure have heard: Wherefore, I earnestly intreat thee, since God hath brought thee hither, that thou wilt repose thee a while from the travel which thou hast endured for his service. And as for that which the Vice-Roy hath written to me, touching the businesse which I sent to him about by</hi> Antonio Ferreyra, <hi>I still avow it; but the Affaires of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time, are reduced to that passe, as I am much afraid, if my subjects see any change in me, that they will approve of the</hi> Bonzoes <hi>counsel; Besides, I make no question but the Christians which are here, have told thee the great danger I run in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by reason of the mutinies that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ave past here, during the which, I have been in as great jeopardy as any other; so that for the safety of my person, I have been inforced to execute in one morning thirteen of the Principallest Lords of my Kingdome, together with sixteen thousand persons of their faction and league, besides as many more which I have banished. Bat if it ever happens, that God shall grant me that which my soul desires of him, I shall hold it a small matter, to consent to what the Vice-Roy advises me by his Letter.</hi> Hereunto, the Father replied, <hi>That he was greatly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with his holy resolution; but he was to remember, that his life was not in the hands of men, because they were mortall; and that if he should chance to die before he effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it, what would then become of his soul?</hi> To which he answered smiling, <hi>God knows.</hi> The Father seeing that he could receive no other satisfaction from the King at that present but good words, without making any conclusion on a matter that was so important for him, dissembled with him, and changing discourse, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to him of other things, wherein he knew he took more pleasure. So, having spent the most part of the night with the Father, in questioning him about divers novelties, whereunto he was much affected, he dismissed him in very plausible termes, with hope that he would become a Christian, but not so soon; a thing which was then well enough understood, and that sufficiently discovered his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The next day about two a clock in the afternone the Father went to see the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:50126:166"/>
King again, and setting aside his kind welcoming of him, this Prince never answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to purpose; and within a while after returned to his Fortresse of <hi>Osquy,</hi> from whence he sent to desire him to continue abiding where he was, and to come some times and see him, for that he took extream pleasure in talking with him of the great things of God, and perfection of his Law. In the mean space, above two months and an half past away, without giving in all that time any other fruit of himself, then certain kind of hopes, accompanied ever and anon with some excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which did not much content the Father: so that he thought it requisite for him to return to <hi>Goa,</hi> as well for the discharging of the duty of his charge there, as for many other reasons that moved him thereunto. Being resolved then for our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I went to the Fortresse of <hi>Osquy</hi> to the King, to demand an answer of the Letter I brought him from the Vice-Roy of the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> which he presently gave me, having made it ready against my coming; and in exchange of the Present he had received, he sent him very rich Armes, together with two Scymitars garnished with gold, an hundred Ventiloes of the Country of the <hi>Lequios.</hi> In the Letter which he himself had written, were these words contained: <hi>Lord Vice-Roy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Majestie, that art seated in the Throne of those which render Iustice by the power of the Scepter: I</hi> Yaretandono, <hi>King of</hi> Bungo, <hi>give thee to understand, that</hi> Ferdinand Mendez Pinto <hi>is come to me, with a Letter from thy Royall Lordship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a present of Armes, and other peeces very agreeable to my desire, and which I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much esteem, for that they are of a Country in the other end of the world, which we call</hi> Chenchicogim, <hi>where through the power of great Armies, composed of divers Nations, raignes the Crowned Lion of</hi> Portugal, <hi>whose servant and subject I do by these presents declare my self to be: Wherefore I pray thee, that as long as the Sun shall not swerve from the effect for which God hath created him, nor the waters of the sea cease from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and falling on the shoares side, thou wilt not forget this homage, which hereby I make to your King, whom I acknowledg for my elder Brother; to the end, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this my obedience may remain the more honorable, as I am confident it shall alwaies be: And I desire thou wilt daign to accept of these Armes which I send thee, as a gage and assurance of my faith. From this my Fortresse of</hi> Osquy, <hi>the ninth</hi> Mamocos <hi>of the third Moon, in the thirtie and seventh year of our age.</hi> With this Letter, and his present I returned to our ship, which rode at anchor some two leagues off in the Port of <hi>Zequa,</hi> where I found Father <hi>Belquior,</hi> and all the rest of our company, already imbarqued, and from thence we set sail the day after, being the fourteenth of November, One thousand five hundred fifty and six.</p>

            <head>CHAP. LXXXI. What past after our departure from <hi>Zequa,</hi> till my arrivall in the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> and from thence into the Kingdome of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FRom this Port of <hi>Zequa</hi> we continued our course with Northerly vvinds, which were favourable unto us in this season, and on the fourth of December vve ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Port of <hi>Lampacau,</hi> vvhere we met with six <hi>Portugal</hi> ships, vvhereof was Generall a certain Merchant, called <hi>Francisco Martinez,</hi> the creature of <hi>Francisco Barreto,</hi> at that time Governour of the State of the Indiaes in the place of <hi>Don Pedro Mascarenhas.</hi> And because that then the season for Navigation into <hi>India</hi> was almost past, our Captain <hi>Don Francisco Mascarenhas</hi> stayed no longer there then was necessary for providing of victuall. We departed then from this Port of <hi>Lampacau</hi> a little before <hi>Christmasse,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Goa</hi> the seventeenth of February. The first thing I did there was to go to <hi>Francisco Barreto,</hi> unto whom I gave an account of the Letter which I brought from the King of <hi>Iapan</hi>: but he having referred it to the day following, I failed not to deliver it to him the next morning, together with the Arms, the Scymitars, and the other Presents which
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:50126:166"/>
that Pagan King had sent. Whereupon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after he had seen all at leasure, addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himself unto me, <hi>I assure you,</hi> said he unto me, <hi>that I prize these Arms which you have brought me, as much as the Government of India: for I hope that by the means of this Present, and this Letter from the King of</hi> Japan, <hi>I shall render my self agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the King our Soveraign Lord, that I shall be delivered from the fortune of</hi> Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, <hi>where almost all of us that govern this State, do go and land for our sins.</hi> Then, in acknowledgment of this Voyage, and the great expence I had been at, he made me many large offers, which I would by no means accept of at that time: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I was well contented to justifie before him by attestations, and acts past ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly for it, how many times I had been made a slave for the service of the King our Master; and how many times also I had been robbed of my Merchandize: for I imagined that this would suffice to keep me at my return into my Country, from being refused that, which I believed was due to me for my services; as indeed, the Vice-Roy past me an Act of all these things, adding thereunto the Certificates which I presented unto him: withall, he gave me a Letter, addrest to the King, wherein he made so honourable a mention of me and my Services, that relying on these hopes, grounded as they were on such apparant reasons as I had on my side, I imbarqued my self for to return into the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi>; so contented with the Papers which I carried along with me, that I counted them the best part of my estate; at leastwise, I beleeved so, because I was perswaded that I should no sooner ask a recompence for so many services, but wont it be presently granted me. Upon this hope being put to sea, it pleased our Lord, that I arrived safely at the Citie of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the two and twentieth day of September, in the Year One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand five hundred fifty and eight, at such time as the Kingdome was governed by Madam <hi>KATHERINA,</hi> our Queen of happy memory. Having deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her the Letter then from the Vice-Roy of the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> I told her by word of mouth all that I thought was important for the good of my businesse: vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon she referred mee to the Minister of her State, who had the charge of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her Affairs: At first he gave me very good words, but far better hopes, as indeed I held them for most assured, hearing what he said unto me: But in stead of letting me see the effect thereof, he kept me these miserable papers of mine four years and an half, at the end of which, all the fruit I reaped thereby was no other, then the labor and pains which to no purpose I had imployed in these vain sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and which had been more grievous unto me, then all the troubles I had suffered during my voyages: Wherefore seeing of what little profit all my past ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were unto me, notwithstanding all the suit I could make; I resolved to retire my self, and remain within the terms of my miserie, which I had brought along with me, and gotten by the means of many misfortunes, which was all that was resting to me of the time and wealth which I had bestowed in the service of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, leaving the judgment of this processe to the divine Justice. I put this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of mine then in execution, not a little grieved that I had not done it sooner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I might thereby peradventure have saved a good peece of mony. For a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, behold what the services have been which I have done for the space of one and twenty years, during which time, I was thirteen times a slave, and sold six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times, by reason of the unlucky events of so long and painfull a voyage, whereof I have made mention amply enough in this Book. But although this be so, yet do I not leave to beleeve, that the cause why I remained without the recompence whereunto I pretented for so many services and travels, rather proceeded from the Divine providence, which permitted it to be so for my sins, then from the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and fault of him, whom the duty of his charge seemed to oblige to do me right. For it being true, that in all the Kings of this Kingdome who are the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly source from whence all recompence do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:50126:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
