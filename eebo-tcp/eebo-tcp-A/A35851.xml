         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>DEar precious Brethren and Sisters, in the ever honourable,
peaceable birth of the Seed immortal, which the Lord hath
blessed; grace, mercy, and peace be multiplyed amongst you in
the aboundings of the enlarged mercies of our Lord Jesus Christ;
in whom feel the flowings of the bowels of your brother, whose
life with all the relations and enjoyments of this world hath been
and is freely given up to serve you. Dear breathing, hungry and
thirsty babes of my heavenly Father. Oh the deep of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions
that opens in my heart to you; Children, Immortal,
born again, in which bowels of tender love I exhort you all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to watch to the heavenly attendancies of the spirit of life,
in the Covenant of Light, in the Lord our Righteousness, that
you may all feel his mighty power condemning sin in the flesh, and
quicken your spirits, to live and reign through faith in his name,
that over the accuser of the Brethren you may stand and never
more to be bowed down, as some of you have been in years past,
through the mysterious working of the evil attendancies of your
minds, in which you will read me in what I write: for you that
fear the Lord, &amp; watch to his light, you have a clear discovery in the
true sensibility of what is good, and what is evil, and hear you
have learned your condemnation; but some that come forth with
us after a regulation of their conversations in some outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
according to the light, for want of watchfulness, are
drawn by the mystery of iniquity, and so go from us to rest in
what they have done, and delights their hearts in the knowledge
more then the life that gives the knowledge, and thus they eat
the forbidden fruit, and what ever is pretended in the service of
God there is self-endedness in every undertaking, and under the

they do a great deal of good, and say in their own hearts I am

manifest that God never sent them; therefore do they not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
the people at all; and if they turn not to the light to wait for
God to destroy the self-priding spirit in the gifted man, that the
birth may reign that makes self of no reputation, but they abide
where they are to feed of the tree of knowledge, of good and
evil, from whence rises strife and contentions, then shall they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly

Lambs of the Lord God Almighty, who delights to hear the
living voice of the spirit of the most high God amongst his people,
that so you may have the bread of life broken to you for which
you hunger, and untill you have it, your sorrows is known unto
the Lord, &amp;c. and to with-hold you from the enjoyment of what
you hunger, for great is the wrath of the enemy as before writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as he leads some to their own destruction in a self-priding
spirit in outward observation, so doth he seek to destroy the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
babes by his temptations and his secret and private accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
where he continually seeks to add affliction to the afflicted,
who live in the deep sence of their own misery, notwithstanding

who violently assaults you, and accuses you day and night before
the throne of God, and when any sparklings of the glory of the
quickening spirit is manifest in you to raise you up to believe in
the name of Christ, where your life is hid: Then the Accuser in
great fury strikes you down and bids you take heed of presuming,
there is no such thing belongs to you as yet, you must see such
and such things overcome before you can expect such attainments
of the free mercy of the Lord: thus doth the enemy chain you in
darkness, and draws you into a self-striving spirit, where many
strives to enter the Kingdom, and enters not, for without Faith
there is no entrance, neither is it possible to please God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

where your burdens is mine, and your sorrows is my sorrows,

Christ, the sence of your exercises, weights and burdens, causes

may have life: oh be entreated in true watchfulness, in the light,
to judg all your doubts, thoughts, fearfulness, and unbelief, and
what ever would hinder you, from laying hold of the soul-saving
Power, of the Lord of Life: Oh let not the locks of the beloved,
be any more bedewed with the drops of the night; which is
your doubts, and resistances of his love, but all you necessitated
people, that are born of the Seed, that cannot live without the
Light of the Countenance of God; and in the secret of your

serve the Lord in uprightness; is the pressure of your spirits;
and your dayly breathings unto the Lord: Oh open your eares,
and hear the Proclamation, from the Throne of the Glory, of
the unlimited love, and mercy of the God of your Salvation;
who hath commanded me once more, in the demonstration and

Man be hearkned unto in this day of Gods invitation; but
every one in the sense of your necessities draw near; and look all

and he will lift up the bowed down heads; and he will consolate
the afflicted, and set free the Captives; and he will wash the stains
off all your Garments; and he will dry up all the Ishues, that
hath putrified, and will cause the dumb to speak, and the solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

to sing the high praises of our God; he will be the Husband
of the desolate Widdow; and an entertainer of the stranger;
in his great distresses; and a Father he will be, to the immortal
birth, that hath no comfort, but in his presence; therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, and dearly entreat you, who hath any sensibleness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your spirits, of the need of the help of the Lord, our God:
Oh stand not at a distance, in unbelief; oh be perswaded to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your souls and bodies to the orderings of the Lord Jesus;
where your help is laid up for you, and all that truly wait and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in his Light, and Life, shall see, the Windowes of Heaven
opened; and the Sluces of the River of pleasure drawn; and
the Flood-gates of mercy set wide; that every one that's born
again, may find more strength, life, soul-saving power, joy, and
peace, in the Light and Covenant of Life, in the Lord Jesus,
then there is strength in the power of Darkness, to draw us from
him. Therefore dear Brethren and Sisters, be not doubtful, be
not doubtful, but believe, over, above, and beyond, all whatever
appeares within, or without, that would draw you from your
stedfast standing in the Light, Power, and Life of Jesus; that so
through faith, in his name, you may say to the Mountaines, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and it shall be so; yea in this faith, resist the Devil, he
will fly away, and you shall tread down Sathan, and trample upon
all wicked thoughts, and evil attendancies of your mindes, as
ashes under the soales of your feet, yea the accuser of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that accused you, before the Throne of God, will be cast
down; and you shall reign over him, in the Light, and Life of the
Lord of Glory; and so become the free born Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the ever living God; members of the Church of the first
born, who are redeemed from the Earth, and on whom the ends
of the World is come, that in newness of Life through faith, you
may live, which will make an entrance through all that would
vaile, into the holy City, new Jerusalem, where there is no
curse, neither is the Gates shut day nor night; for there is no
night, as you in the powerful word of faith, reign over your
dark thoughts, doubts and accusings, which did benight you;
but now fighting the good fight of faith, the enemy will be kept
forth of your habitations, and you will see your right to the
Tree of Life, which stands in the midst of the Paradise of God,
there to feed, and grow Pillars in the Temple of the Lord; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104063:5"/>
shall go no more forth, but as you have received Christ, so to
walk in him, and as you are overcome with the glory of his pure
love, and constrained in the overcoming life, to offer up sacrifice
of prayer, exhortation or praises in the Assemblies of the People
of the Lord, or in your own Families you are to be faithful, for the
least mite of the returns of his own spirit is acceptable to him, so

yet notwithstanding what they do; let not the dear Children of
the Lord be unfaithful when you are moved in the forcible power

a Family of Prophets, and as Assemblies of living Ministers from
the highest stature to the least babe born again Immortal of the

Prophets, and every Member in the pure life will know their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

the washing one anothers feet, and here is Christ and his Disciples,
and the Lord really known to be one and his name one, which
binds up in the Eternal Unity of the Spirit and bond of peace,
being all cloathed with the Wedding Garment, sitting at the Table
of the Lord, eating his flesh, and drinking his blood; so we being

understand their lot to be in this Inheritance, and there to abide
to the end of their days, that an Eternal Crown of Glory may

And all you my honourable Brethren and Sisters in the Lord, who

travel in the strength of his pure peaceable Spirit to gather the

Almighty God prosper you in your undertakings, who often
leaves the ninty and nine that kept their state with God and in the

and when they will submit to the Word of the Lord, oh how do

honourable Brethren and Sisters in whom this pure peaceable
spirit of our beloved reigns, my soul blesses the name of the Lord
for you that ever you had a being amongst the Children of Men,
for you are the Chosen of the Lord from the least to the highest
stature, for to stand saviours upon mount Zion this day, wherein
the Lord is making up his Jewels whom he hath prepared to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the trial of this suffering day, which ten years ago I was sent
to proclaim in your ears, that all might prepare to meet the Lord
when it should speak forth it self as in some measure it hath done,
and now doth, to awake all to walk in newness of life, to reign
over the spirit of this world, and all the pomp and glory thereof,
and so to dwell in the established life, there to be hid in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of the hand of the Almighty God, as in a munition of Rocks
in this dreadful and terrible day of the Almighty God, wherein
all hearts will fail, but whose confidence is in the Lord alone, and
waits in the Resurrection of the Royal seed to be kept out, over,
and above all things that would provoke the eyes of his glory,
that so in close union every soul may be kept in the bosom of the
Lord of life, the husband of the bride, the Lambs wife; for whom
the eternal, everliving, glorious majesty, God over all, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to appear as he hath done, so will he more and more, for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104063:6"/>
the help of his helpless People, whom he hath chosen to trust in
him before the Sons of Men, and hath given victory to overcome,
in washing their Garments, and making them white in the blood of
the Lamb, therefore stand they before the throne of God praising
him day and night in his holy Temple, over all the wrath and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of Men; therefore all Chosen of the Lord look up to the
Lord, who will plead our cause in the face of all People; for
<hi>Michael</hi> the great Prince spoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet, will
stand up and deliver them whose Names are written in the Lambs
Book of Life: Oh let us trust in Him, and give up all to Him,
for he will astonish the People as much as ever he did in
any Generation, when he arises in his dreadful vengeance to
plead the cause of his own Church, which he will preserve, and
who finish in the way their faithful Testimony, the Crown of
Glory is their reward for ever; but a remnant there is who shall
see the Lord bring to nought all the wicked devices of the enemies
of God in this Nation, whom he will pour his vengeance
upon, that they shall curse the day that ever they afflicted the

alone; yea, it  makes my eyes to be watered with tears in the
deep sence of the great Calamity that will come upon those
that seek to destroy the People of the most high God; Oh
vengeance, terrible vengeance from the Lord our God will be
poured forth, that shall cause all hearts to fail that withstand the
rising of his Glory, and they shall gnaw their tongues for pain,
in the anguish of their souls, untill they set free the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
of the Lord, and give them liberty to serve their God
in the Land of their Nativity.</p>
            <p>And this my God hath commanded me once more to
declare unto you dear suffering Lambs of my Heavenly
Father, for he is mighty to save, and will not let any suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
