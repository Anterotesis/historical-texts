            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ONE PROJECT For the GOOD of ENGLAND: THAT IS, Our <hi>CIVIL</hi> UNION is our <hi>CIVIL</hi> SAFETY. Humbly dedicated to the <hi>Great Council,</hi> The Parliament of England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>ELIGION, as it is the nobleſt End of Man's Life, ſo it were the beſt Bond of <hi>Humane Society,</hi> provided Men did not err in the Meaning of that excellent Word. Scripture interprets it to be <hi>Loving God above all, and our Neighbours as our ſelves</hi>; but Practice teacheth us, that too many meerly reſolve it into <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Form</hi>; in which, not the <hi>Text,</hi> but the <hi>Comment</hi> too often prevails: whence it comes to paſs that thoſe <hi>Bodies</hi> of Men, who have but one <hi>Common Civil Intereſt,</hi> are miſerably diſtramed in favour of their <hi>adopted Notions,</hi> upon whom they are impatient to beſtow an Earthly Crown. And this is the Reaſon of that Miſchief and Uncertainty that attend Government, No ſooner one Opinion prevails upon another (though all hold the <hi>Text</hi> to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred) but <hi>Humane Society</hi> is <hi>ſhaken,</hi> and the <hi>Civil Government</hi> muſt receive and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a <hi>Revolution:</hi> in ſo much, that when we conſider the Fury and Unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome People for Religion (which ſhews they have none that's True (Religion making Men moſt Natural as well as Divine) we have Reaſon to Bewail the <hi>Miſ-underſtanding</hi> as well as <hi>Miſ-living</hi> of that venerable Word.</p>
            <p>But ſince 'tis ſo hard to diſabuſe men of their wrong Apprehenſions of Religion, and the true Nature and Life of it, and conſequently as yet too early in the day to fix ſuch a Religion upon which Mankind will readily agree as a common <hi>Baſis</hi> for Civil Society, we muſt recur to ſome lower but true Principle for the preſent, and I think there will be no Difficulty of ſucceeding.</p>
            <p>'Tis this, <hi>That Civil Intereſt is the Foundation and End of Civil Government,</hi> and <hi>where it is not maintained entire the Government muſt needs decline.</hi> The word INTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REST has a good and bad Acceptation; when it is taken in an ill Senſe, it ſignifies <hi>a purſuit of Advantage without regard to Truth or Juſtice</hi>; which I mean not: The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60052:2"/>
good ſignification of the word, and which I mean, <hi>is a Legal Endeavour to keep Rights, or augment honeſt Profits,</hi> whether it be in a private Perſon or a Society. By GOVERNMENT, I underſtand a <hi>Juſt and Equal Conſtitution,</hi> where <hi>Might</hi> is not <hi>Right,</hi> but <hi>Laws</hi> rule, and not the <hi>Wills</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> of Men; for that were plain <hi>Tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Goverment muſt have a Supream Authority in it ſelf to Determine, and not to be Superceeded or Controuled by any other Power, for then it would not be a Government, but a Subjection, which is a plain Contradiction.</p>
            <p>Having thus explain'd the Terms of the <hi>Principle</hi> I have laid down, I repeat it, viz. <hi>That Civil Intereſt is the Foundation and End of Civil Government,</hi> and prove it thus, The <hi>Good</hi> of the Whole is the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of Government, but the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Whole</hi> muſt needs be the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Whole,</hi> and Conſequently the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi> is the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of Government. None can ſtumble at the Word <hi>Good,</hi> for every man may eaſily and ſafely Interpret that to himſelf, ſince he muſt needs believe; 'tis <hi>Good for him to be preſerv'd in an undiſturb'd Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Civil Rights,</hi> according to the <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Juſt Laws of the Land,</hi> and the Conſtruction he makes for himſelf will ſerve his Neighbour, and ſo the whole Society.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>Good</hi> of the People is properly the <hi>Civil Intereſt</hi> of the People, and <hi>that,</hi> the Reaſon and End of Government; ſo is the Maintenance of that <hi>Civil Intereſt entire,</hi> the Preſervation of Government. For where People are <hi>ſure</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> and are Protected from Violence or Injury, they chearfully yield their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and pay their Contribution to the ſupport of that Government. But on the contrary, where men are Inſecure of their Civil Rights, nay, where they are daily violated, and themſelves in danger of Ruin, and that for no ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted aginſt the Nature of Civil Intereſt (to preſerve which, Government was inſtituted) we ought to ſuppoſe their Affections will flagg, that they will grow dead-hearted, and that what they pay or do, may go againſt the Grain: And to ſay true, ſuch unkindneſs is ready to tempt them to believe they ſhould not of right Contribute to the Maintenance of ſuch Governments as yield them no Security or Civil Protection. Which Unhappy <hi>Flaw</hi> in the Civil Intereſt, proves an untoward <hi>Crack</hi> in the Government; Men not being cordially devoted to the Proſperity of that Government, that is exercis'd in their Deſtruction; and how far that Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the Common Intereſt of the People may Affect the Government I cannot tell, but to be ſure 'tis inſecure to any Government, to have the People (its Strength) divided, as they will be, where their Intereſt is ſo disjoynted by the Government; One <hi>Protected,</hi> the Other <hi>Expos'd.</hi> Wherefore, Wiſe Governments have ever taken Care to <hi>preſerve</hi> their People, as knowing they do thereby <hi>preſerve</hi> their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> and that how <hi>Numerous</hi> their People, ſo <hi>large</hi> their Intereſt. For not only <hi>Solomon</hi> has told us, <hi>That the Honour of a Prince is in the Multitude of his People,</hi> but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teaches, that <hi>Plenty</hi> of People is the Riches and Strength of a Wiſe and Good Government; as that is, where Vice is corrected and Vertue encourag'd, and <hi>All</hi> taken in and ſecured in Civils, that have the ſame Civil Intereſt with the Government.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Whole</hi> is the Riſe and End of Government, ſo muſt it ſuppoſe, that the <hi>whole</hi> (which takes in all Parties) concurs in ſeeking the <hi>Good</hi> of the Government; for the Reaſon of the Government will not ſuffer it to protect thoſe that are Enemies to its Conſtitution and Safety; for ſo it would admit of ſomething dangerous to the Society, for the Security of which, <hi>Government</hi> was at firſt <hi>inſtituted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will follow, that thoſe that own another temporal Power ſuperior to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they properly belong to, make themſelves Subjects not of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60052:2"/>
they are born under, but to that Authority which they avow to be ſuperior to the Government of their own Country, and conſequently men of another Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, becauſe 'tis their Intereſt to purſue the Advantages of that Power they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be ſoveraign: But thoſe that own, embrace and obey the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own Country as their temporal ſupream Authority, and whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is one and the ſame with that of their own proper Government, ought to be valued and protected by that Government.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Principle</hi> thus far lyes <hi>General,</hi> I will now bring it to our own Caſe.</p>
            <p>ENGLAND is a Country <hi>Populous</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and though under ſome <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents</hi> within it ſelf, yet the <hi>Civil Intereſt</hi> is the <hi>ſame,</hi> and in ſome ſenſe the <hi>Religious too.</hi> For <hi>firſt,</hi> all <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> whether <hi>Conformiſts</hi> or <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> agree in this, <hi>that they only owe Allegiance and Subjection unto the Civil Government of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and offer any Security in their power to give of their Truth in this Matter. And in the next place, they do not only conſequentially diſclaim the <hi>Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> and all adheſion to <hi>forreign Authority</hi> under any Pretence, but therewith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and oppoſe the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> as it ſtands degenerated from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>pureſt Ages</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which makes up a great <hi>Negative Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it cannot be unknown to men read in the Reaſons of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> that a <hi>Proteſtation</hi> made by the <hi>German Reformers</hi> againſt the <hi>Imperial Edicts of</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth, impoſing Romiſh Traditions,</hi> gave beginning to the word <hi>Proteſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort; It is the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Ruling</hi> or <hi>Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould have no Claim or Power in <hi>England.</hi> It is alſo the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Proteſtants,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould have no Claim or Power here in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe they are ſubject to the ſame Miſchiefs and Sufferings in their Civil and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Rights that the <hi>Church Proteſtants</hi> are liable to: if then both are like to loſe by <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Forraign Authority,</hi> their <hi>Intereſt</hi> muſt needs be <hi>one</hi> againſt <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Forraign Authority</hi>; and if they have but <hi>one Intereſt,</hi> it will follow, that the <hi>Church Proteſtant</hi> cannot prejudice the <hi>Diſſenting-Proteſtant,</hi> but he muſt <hi>weaken and deſtroy his own Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Civil Intereſt</hi> of Engliſh Proteſtants being thus the ſame, and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Intereſt too, ſo far as concerns a <hi>Negative to the Uſurpation and Error of</hi> Rome; I do humbly ask, if it be the Intereſt of the Government, to expoſe thoſe to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery that have <hi>no other Civil Intereſt than THAT of the Government?</hi> Or if it be juſt or equal that the <hi>Weaker</hi> ſhould be proſecuted by the <hi>more Powerful</hi> Proteſtants, whoſe Intereſt is <hi>Poſitively the ſame in Civils, and in Religion Negatively?</hi> One would think 'twere Reaſonable that they ſhould not ſuffer by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who if <hi>Popery</hi> ever have a day, are likely to ſuffer with them, and that upon the ſame Principles. Experience tells us, That the wiſeſt <hi>Architects</hi> lay their Foundations broad and ſtrong, and raiſe their Squares and Structure by the moſt exact Rules of Art, that the Fabrick may be ſecure againſt the Violence of ſtorms; but if People muſt be deſtroy'd by thoſe of the ſame Intereſt, truly that <hi>Intereſt</hi> will ſtand but Totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and every breath of Oppoſition will be ready to ſhake it.</p>
            <p>'Twas the Inconfutable anſwer <hi>Chriſt</hi> made to the <hi>Blaſphemers</hi> of that Power by which he wrought Miracles; <hi>A Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand</hi>: what he ſaid then, let me on another occaſion ſay now, an <hi>Intereſt divided againſt it ſelf muſt fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know ſome Men will take <hi>Fire</hi> at this, and by Crying The CHURCH, The CHURCH, hope to ſilence all Arguments of this Nature; But they muſt excuſe me, if I pay no manner of Regard to their Zeal, and hold their Devotion both Ignorant and Dangerous at this time. It is not the way to fill the Church, to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60052:3"/>
Deſtroy the People. A Church without People is a Contradiction, eſpecially when the Scripture tells us that 'tis the People that makes the Church.</p>
            <p>And 'tis not without an appearance of Reaſon that ſome good &amp; wiſe men are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, that the greateſt <hi>Sticklers</hi> for Perſecuting <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> in favour of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> are men addicted and devoted to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> or at leaſt animated by ſuch as are; who, diſparing of doing any great Feats, if known, hide themſelves under theſe pretences; but the meaning of it is to debilitate the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> cauſe in general, by exciting the Church of <hi>England</hi> to deſtroy all other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Intereſts in theſe Kingdoms, that ſo nothing may remain for <hi>Popery</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with but the few Zealous <hi>abettors</hi> of that Church.</p>
            <p>And that this may not look diſingenuous, or like a <hi>Trick</hi> of mine, I will enforce it by a demonſtration. It is plain fact, that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath ever ſince the Reformation practic'd the Reſtoration of her Religion and Power in theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. It is as evident that <hi>Religion</hi> is with her a word for <hi>Civil Intereſt,</hi> that is, that ſhe may have the <hi>Rule over men both Body and Soul. For 'tis Government ſhe aims at, to have the rains of Power in her hand, to give Law and weild the Scepter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To do this ſhe muſt either have a greater intereſt then the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that are now in poſſeſſion, or elſe divide their Intereſt, and ſo weaken them by themſelves, and make them Inſtruments to her ends. That her own force is Inconſiderable is clear: She has nothing within Doors to give her hope but the <hi>Diſcord</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> It follows then that ſhe muſt of neceſſity beſtir her ſelf and uſe her Arts to enflame the reckoning among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and carry their <hi>Diſſents</hi> about <hi>Religious</hi> matters to a <hi>diviſion</hi> in the <hi>Civil Intereſt.</hi> And it is the more to be fear'd, becauſe whatever ſhe has been to others, ſhe has been ever true to her ſelf.</p>
            <p>If this then be the <hi>only</hi> domeſtick Expedient left her, we are ſure ſhe will uſe it; and if ſo, it muſt needs be of great Importance with all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to let fall their private Animoſities, and take all poſſible care that their <hi>diſſents</hi> about Faith or Worſhip (which regard the other World) <hi>divide</hi> not their Affection and Judgment about the Common and Civil Intereſt of their Country: becauſe if that be kept entire, it <hi>equally fruſtrates</hi> the deſigns of <hi>Rome,</hi> as if you were of <hi>one</hi> Religion. For ſince, as I ſaid before, <hi>Religion,</hi> with the great men of that <hi>Church,</hi> is nothing elſe but a ſofter word for <hi>Civil Empire,</hi> preſerve you but your Civil Intereſt from fraction, and you are in that ſenſe of <hi>one Religion</hi> too; and that <hi>ſuch</hi> an one, as you need not fear the temptation of <hi>Smithfield,</hi> if you will but be true to it.</p>
            <p>This being the caſe, I would take leave to ask the <hi>Zealous Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Church, <hi>If Conformity to the faſhion of their Worſhip be dearer to them then</hi> Englands <hi>Intereſt and the Cauſe of Proteſtancy</hi>? if their love to Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be greater then to the Church and her Religion, and to their Country and her Laws? or laſtly, whether in caſe they are ſincere in their Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the <hi>Church</hi> (which I confeſs ingenuouſly I am apt to ſuſpect) it is to be ſuppoſed that the preſent <hi>Church-men</hi> (Conformiſts I mean) are better able of themſelves to ſecure <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> and <hi>our Civil Intereſt</hi> againſt the Attempts of <hi>Rome,</hi> then in <hi>Conjunction with the Civil Intereſt of all Proteſtant Diſſenters?</hi> If they ſay yes, I would have them at the ſame time, for the ſame reaſon, to give it under their Hands, that 'tis a ſtanding Rule in <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> that ONE is more then SIX, and that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto we have been all miſtaken in the art of Numbers.</p>
            <p>Being brought to this pinch, I conceive they muſt ſay, that they had rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up their <hi>Church</hi> to the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Deſigns</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> then ſuffer <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to live freely among them, though <hi>Proteſtant, of one negative Religion, and of the ſame Civil Intereſt</hi>; or elſe haſten to break thoſe bonds that are laid upon Diſſenters of truly tender and (by experience) of peaceable Conſciences; and by Law eſtabliſh the

free Exerciſe of their Worſhip to Almighty God, that the <hi>Fears, Jealouſies, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection</hi> and <hi>Diſtraction,</hi> that now affect the one common Intereſt of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> may be removed; for it ſeems impoſſible to preſerve a diſtinct Intereſt from both. But to which of theſe they may incline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt not determine; and yet I hope, they will not be of the mind of a late <hi>Monk</hi> of <hi>Cullen,</hi> that in his publick Exerciſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the <hi>Civil Magiſtrates</hi> to chuſe to have their City <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>Catholick,</hi> that is <hi>Popiſh,</hi> rather then <hi>great</hi> and <hi>Opulent</hi> by the Admiſſion of <hi>trading Hereticks</hi>; but if they ſhould, may our <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> have at leaſt their Prudence; for the <hi>Culleners</hi> gave him the hearing, but were as <hi>true to their Intereſt,</hi> as the <hi>Monk</hi> to his <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under favour, the <hi>Civil Government</hi> is greatly concern'd to diſcountenance ſuch <hi>Biggotrys</hi>; for it <hi>Thins</hi> the People, <hi>Leſſens</hi> Trade, <hi>Creates</hi> Jealouſies, and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers</hi> the Peace and Wealth of the Whole. And with Submiſſion, of what ſhould the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> be more tender, than in ſuffering the Civil Intereſt of a great People to be diſturb'd and narrow'd for the <hi>Humor</hi> of any one <hi>Party</hi> of them? for ſince the Civil <hi>Intereſt</hi> lies as large, as the People of that Intereſt, <hi>the people muſt be preſerved in order to preſerve that Common Intereſt.</hi> Other Notions ever did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and weaken <hi>Empire,</hi> and in the end they have rarely miſt to pull the Old Houſe about their Ears, that have govern'd themſelves by ſuch diſproportionable meaſures: By all means, intereſt the Affections of the People in the Proſperity of the Government, by making the Government a SECURITY to their perticular Rights and Properties.</p>
            <p>I ask, if more Cuſtom comes not to the King, and more Trade to the Kingdom by encouraging the Labour and Traffick of an <hi>Epiſcopalian, Presbyterian, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, Quaker</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> than by an <hi>Epiſcopalian</hi> only? If this be true, why ſhould the reſt be render'd uncapable of Trade, yea, of Living?

No, no; <hi>Self</hi> will always be true to its <hi>Intereſt,</hi> let Superſtition mutter what it will.</p>
            <p>But ſince the <hi>Induſtry, Rents</hi> and <hi>Taxes</hi> of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are as currant as their Neighbours, who loſes by ſuch narrowneſs more than <hi>England,</hi> than the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the Magiſtracy?

            <p>I beſeech you, let <hi>Nature</hi> ſpeak, who is ſo much a better Friend to Humane Society, than Falſe or Froward <hi>Opinion,</hi> that ſhe often rectifies the Miſtakes of a Prejudiced

            </p>
            <p>Let us go together as <hi>far as our way lies,</hi> and Preſerve our Unity in thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which maintain our Civil Society. This is our Common and our Juſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, all <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters</hi> agree in this, and it is both Wiſe and Righteous to admit no Fraction upon this Pact, no Violence upon this Concord. For the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of permitting any thing to break in upon the Principles of Humane Society, that is <hi>Forreign</hi> to the Nature of it, will diſtract and weaken that Society.</p>
            <p>We know, that in all <hi>Plantations</hi> the Wiſdom of <hi>Planters</hi> is well aware of this: and let us but conſider, that the <hi>ſame</hi> ways that plant Countries, <hi>muſt be kept to for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Plantation,</hi> elſe 'twill quickly be <hi>Depopulated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Country which is Falſe to its firſt Principles of Government, and miſtakes or divides its <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Popular Intereſt,</hi> muſt Unavoidably Decay. And let me ſay, That had there been this Freedom granted Eighteen Years ago, <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> had been too Potent for the Enemies of it; nor had there been thoſe Diviſions for <hi>Popery</hi> to make its advantage by; at leaſt, not in the <hi>Civil Intereſt</hi> of the Nation. And where that has been preſerv'd entire, it has been never able to Prevail: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the careful Government of <hi>Holland,</hi> where the Preſervation of their Civil Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt from Fraction hath Secur'd them againſt the growth of <hi>Popery,</hi> though it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Tolerated by them: So powerful are the Effects of an <hi>United Civil Intereſt</hi> in Government. Now becauſe the <hi>Civil Intereſt</hi> of this Nation is the <hi>Preſervation of the Free and Legal Government of it from all Subjection to Forreign claim,</hi> and that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are united, as in the <hi>common Proteſtancy</hi> (that is, a <hi>General Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of</hi> Rome) ſo in the Maintenance of this <hi>Civil Government</hi> as a common Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (for it ſtrikes both at their Rights Civil and Sacred, their Conſcience, Religion and Law to admit any Forreign Juriſdiction here) it muſt follow, that had theſe ſeveral, as well <hi>Engliſh</hi> as <hi>Protestant</hi> Parties been timely encourag'd to this united Civil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, they had ſecur'd the Government from this danger by rendering it too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable for the Attempt.</p>
            <p>But there is a twofold Miſtake that I think fit to remove. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the difference betwixt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> &amp; their <hi>Diſſenters</hi> is generally manag'd, as if it were <hi>Civil. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> The difference betwixt <hi>Papiſt</hi> &amp; <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is carried on, as if it were chiefly <hi>Religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay, 'Tis plauſible, but falſe, it is an Artifice of ill men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60052:5"/>
the Government againſt good People, to make baſe Ends by other Mens Ruin; whereas they that diſſent, are at a <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> on the behalf of the Engliſh Government, as well as themſelves. They neither acknowledge nor ſubmit to any other Authority. They <hi>hold the one common Civil Head,</hi> and not only acquieſs in the Diſtribution of Juſtice by Law; but embrace it as the beſt part of their <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> So that the difference between <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and their <hi>Diſſenters</hi> is purely <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> and moſtly about <hi>Church-Government,</hi> and ſome <hi>Forms</hi> of Worſhip, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to be not ſo pure and <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> as could be deſired; and here it is, that Tenderneſs ſhould be exercis'd, if in any caſe in the World, or St. <hi>Paul</hi> is Miſtaken.</p>
            <p>But as to the <hi>Second,</hi> under Correction, the caſe is alter'd, for though it be moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manag'd on the ſide of <hi>Religion,</hi> The great Point is meerly <hi>Civil,</hi> and ſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld never be otherwiſe admitted or underſtood. For want of this caution <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſuffer themſelves to be drawn into tedious Controverſies about Religion, and give occaſion to the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Favourers</hi> of that way to exclaim againſt them, as <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors</hi> for Religion, who had <hi>reprobated</hi> ſuch Severity in the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to their <hi>Anceſtors</hi> (a moſt plauſible and very often a ſuccesful <hi>Plea</hi>) when in reality the difference is not ſo much <hi>Religious</hi> as <hi>Civil.</hi> Not but that there is a vaſt <hi>contrariety</hi> in Doctrine and Worſhip too; but this barely ſhould not be the cauſe of our ſo great diſtance, and that Proviſion the Laws make againſt them; but rather that <hi>Fundamental in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtancy</hi> they carry with them to the <hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Government</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi> unto which they belong, by acknowledging a Forreign Jurisdiction in theſe Kingdoms. So that drawing into Queſtion and Danger the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> to which <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Civil Pact</hi> oblige their Fidelity and Obedience, there ſeems a <hi>Diſcharge</hi> upon the <hi>Civil Government</hi> from any further care of their Protection, that make it a <hi>piece of Conſcience to ſeek its Ruin,</hi> and which is worſe, a <hi>Principle, not to be informed of better things,</hi> for even here not Reaſon or Law, but the Pope muſt be Judge.</p>
            <p>This being the Brief and Modeſt ſtate of the Caſe, I muſt return to my firſt great Principle, <hi>That Civil Intereſt is the Foundation and End of Civil Government</hi>: and that how much Men <hi>deſert</hi> the Intereſt of a Kingdom, ſo much they <hi>Wound</hi> and <hi>Subvert</hi> the Government of it. I appeal to all Wiſe and Conſiderate Men of the Truth of this by the preſent Poſture of Affairs and their proper Cauſes.</p>
            <p>To come then to our Point, Shall Engliſh Men by <hi>Engliſh Men,</hi> and Proteſtants by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> be Free or Oppreſt? That is, <hi>Whether ſhall we receive as</hi> Engliſh men <hi>and</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>thoſe that have no other Civil Intereſt than that which is purely Engliſh, and who ſincerely profeſs and embrace the ſame Proteſtation, for which the Antient Reformers were ſtiled</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>or for the ſake of Humour or Baſe Ends diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own them, and expoſe them and their Families to utter miſery</hi>?</p>
            <p>I would hope better of our great Church-mens Charity and Prudence; but if they ſhould be ſo unhappy as to keep to their old meaſures, and ſtill play the Gawdy but empty Name of <hi>Church</hi> againſt the <hi>Civil Intereſt and Religion of the Nation,</hi> they will ſhew themſelves deſerted of God, and then how long it will be, before they will be ſeen and left of all ſober men, let them Judge. For to ſpeak freely, after all this <hi>Light</hi> that is now in the world, no <hi>Ignorance</hi> can excuſe ſuch <hi>Zeal,</hi> nor will wiſe men believe it to be <hi>either,</hi> but a <hi>Trick</hi> to weaken <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> that her <hi>declared Enemy</hi> may with leſs hazard gain the <hi>Chair.</hi> And there is not ſo much reaſon to fear Profeſt <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as thoſe <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who valuing themſelves by their reſpects to the <hi>Church</hi> and tenderneſs of her <hi>Independent</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>have the opportunity with leſs ſuſpition of letting in</hi> Popery <hi>at the Back door.</hi> Theſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60052:6"/>
are the men that pay off the <hi>Phanatick</hi> in the Name of the Church, but for the good of the Pope, to whoſe account thoſe endeavours muſt be placed.</p>
            <p>But it will go a great way to our Deliverance if we are not Careleſs to obſerve the <hi>Secret</hi> workings of thoſe that have vow'd our Miſery, &amp; of them ſuch, as are in <hi>Maſckarade,</hi> and wear the <hi>Guize</hi> of Friends are moſt Dangerous: But ſome Men are <hi>Pur-blind,</hi> they can ſee Danger as near as their <hi>Noſe,</hi> but in a Difficulty, that is not a <hi>Foot</hi> from them, they are <hi>Preſumptive, Ruſty</hi> and not to be govern'd, Could ſome <hi>Church-men</hi> but ſee the Irreparable Miſchiefs that will attend them (if ſincere to their preſent Profeſſion) unleſs prevented by a <hi>Modeſt and Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion to</hi> Diſſenting Proteſtant Chriſtians, they would never ſuffer themſelves to be Miſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that moſt Meek and Self denying Religion, cannot prevail upon them, me thinks the Power of Intereſt, and that <hi>Self intereſt</hi> too, ſhould have ſome Succeſs for in thoſe caſes they uſe not to be obſtinate.</p>
            <p>But I expect it ſhould be told me, <hi>That this is the way to Ruin the Church, and let in an Anarchy in Religion: Cujus contrarium verum.</hi> I am glad to obviate this, before I leave you, ſeeing the Contrary is moſt true; for it leaves the <hi>Church and Church-men</hi> as they are, with this Diſtinction, that whereas now Conformity is <hi>Coercive,</hi> which is <hi>Popiſh,</hi> it will be then <hi>Perſwaſive,</hi> which is <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> And there may be ſome hopes, when the <hi>Parſons,</hi> deſtitute of the Magiſtrates Sword, ſhall of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity enforce their Religion by good Doctrine and holy Living; nor ought they to murmur, for that which ſatiſfied Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſhould ſatiſfie them: <hi>His Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> therefore they ſhould not <hi>Fight</hi> for him, if they would be his <hi>Servants</hi> and the <hi>Children</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> Chriſt and not Civil Force is the Rock his Church is built upon. Nor indeed has any thing ſo <hi>Tarniſht</hi> the Cauſe of <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> as the Profeſſors of it betaking themſelves to <hi>Worldly Arms</hi> to propagate their Religion. <hi>David</hi> could not wear <hi>Saul's</hi> Armor, and <hi>true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> cannot uſe <hi>Popiſh</hi> Weapons, <hi>Impoſition</hi> and <hi>Perſecution.</hi> In ſhort; 'Tis the very Intereſt of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to preſerve the Civil Intereſt entire, or elſe Popery will endanger all; but that cannot be unleſs all of that Civil Intereſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; therefore <hi>Proteſtaat Diſſenters</hi> ſhould be indulg'd.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, <hi>There is a Difference even among Diſſenters; Some will give a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to the Civil Government by taking the Oaths; others will not, and be it through Tenderneſs, how do we know, but Papiſts will ſhrow'd themſelves under the Wings of ſuch Diſſenters, and ſo in Tolerating Proteſtant Diſſenters to fortify Proteſtancy, in reality Popery will be hereby ſhelter'd</hi> incognito.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſuch <hi>Oaths</hi> are little or no Security to any Government, and though it may give ſome <hi>allay</hi> to the <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of <hi>Governors,</hi> they never had the Effect deſired.

Men may take them for their own Advantage, or to avoid Loſs and Puniſhment: But the Queſtion is, What real Benefit, or Security comes thereby to the Government? It is certain they have often <hi>enſnared a Good Man,</hi> but never <hi>caught one Knave yet</hi>: we ought not to put ſo great a Value upon <hi>Oaths,</hi> as to render the Security of our Government ſo low and hazardous.</p>
            <p>God's Providence and the Wiſdom of our Anceſtors have found out a better Teſt for us to reſt upon, and that is our <hi>Common Intereſt and the Laws of the Land</hi> DULY <hi>executed</hi>: Theſe are the Security of our Government.</p>
            <p>For example, a <hi>Man</hi> Swears he will not Plot, yet Plots; pray what Security is

this <hi>Oath</hi> to the Government? But though 'tis evident, that this be no Security; that <hi>Law</hi> which <hi>Hangs</hi> him for Plotting, is an <hi>unqueſtionable one.</hi> So that 'tis not for wiſe Governours, by Swearing men to the Government to think to ſecure it; but all having agreed to the Laws, by which they are to be governed, <hi>let any Man break them at his Peril.</hi> Wherefore good <hi>Laws,</hi> and a Juſt <hi>Execution</hi> of them, and not <hi>Oaths,</hi> are the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>real Security of a Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But next, though ſome may ſcruple the <hi>Oaths,</hi> 'tis not for the ſake of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo much as Form, which you know is not the caſe of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> (pray diſtinguiſh) and thoſe very Perſons, whoever they be of <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters,</hi> I dare ſay, they will very cheerfully promiſe their Allegiance on the ſame Penalties, <hi>and ſubſcribe any Renunciation of Pope and Forraign Authority, which the Art of man can Pen</hi>; nor ſhould it be hard for you to believe they ſhould ſubſcribe what they have alwayes liv'd.</p>
            <p>To that part of the Objection, which mentions <hi>the danger of</hi> Papiſts <hi>concealing themſelves under the Character of</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Diſſenters</hi>; under Favour I ſay, it is moſt reaſonable to believe, that thoſe who will deny their Faith upon record, as thoſe that ſubſcribe your <hi>Declaration</hi> do, will ſwallow the <hi>Oaths</hi> too; for the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> flatly denys the <hi>Religion,</hi> but the <hi>Oaths</hi> only the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> which even ſome of themſelves pretend to reject. Therefore thoſe that can ſincerely ſubſcribe the <hi>Declaration,</hi> cannot be <hi>Papiſts.</hi>

            <p>If it be yet objected, that <hi>Papiſts</hi> may have <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> to ſubſcribe the <hi>Teſt,</hi> or a <hi>Pardon,</hi> when they have done it; I anſwer, they may as well have <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> to take the <hi>Oaths</hi> or <hi>Pardons</hi> when they have taken them, and theſe laſt ſix Moneths prove as much. There is no Fence againſt this Flail: At this rate they may as well be <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as <hi>Proteſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diſſenters, Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>Churches,</hi> as <hi>Speakers</hi> or <hi>Preachers</hi> in <hi>Meeting-houſes:</hi> Nay, 'tis more probable, where there is leaſt <hi>Suffering,</hi> and moſt <hi>Preferment.</hi> But this <hi>Objection</hi> only ſhews the weakneſs of both <hi>Oaths and Declaration</hi> for the Purpoſe intended, and not, that they can hide themſelves more under one People then another. For they that can have a <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> or <hi>Pardon</hi> for one act, can have it for another; eſpecially when the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Declaration</hi> is of a more general weight to them, then <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Oaths</hi>; all which confirms my former Judgment of the Inſecurity of ſuch <hi>Oaths</hi> to any Government.</p>
            <p>Give me leave then upon this to ask you, if you will bring a <hi>certain Ruin</hi> upon any <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> for the ſake of ſuch an <hi>uncertain Security</hi> to your ſelves? for this is the Queſtion; I beſeech you to weigh it as becomes wiſe and good men, ſhall they be Reprobated for tenderly refuſing, what being <hi>perform'd,</hi> cannot ſave or ſecure you?</p>
            <p>Conſider, you have no reaſon to believe, but thoſe that are <hi>allow'd</hi> to ſubſcribe the <hi>Declaration,</hi> or that will be <hi>pardon'd,</hi> when they have done it, may be <hi>allow'd</hi> to take the <hi>Oaths,</hi> or will be <hi>pardon'd</hi> and <hi>abſolv'd,</hi> when they have taken them: but you are certain on the other ſide, that the Impoſing of the <hi>Oaths</hi> will be a great <hi>Snare</hi> to many <hi>Proteſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diſſenters,</hi> that love the Government, and renounce both <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi>; They will be ruin'd; which to me is of the nature of an Argument for thoſe People: for their not taking the <hi>Oaths,</hi> proves plainly, they have no <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> nor hopes of <hi>Abſolution,</hi> and therefore no <hi>Papiſts</hi>; ſhall they then lie under the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities intended againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who have none of their <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> or <hi>Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to deliver them from them? This is (with Submiſſion, but in plain terms) to make the caſe of the Kingdom worſe; for it deſtroys thoſe who are not Guilty, and whom, I believe, you would not deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Having brought the matter to this, I ſhall firſt offer you a new <hi>Test</hi>; Next, the ways of taking it, with moſt aggravation againſt the <hi>Party</hi> rejecting or breaking it; And laſtly, how you may ſecure your ſelves from <hi>Papists</hi> diſguizing themſelves among <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenters</hi>; that ſo nothing may remain a <hi>Remora</hi> in the way, that ſhall not be removed, to leave you a plain and even Path to Peace and Safety.</p>

                        <p>I A.B. do ſolemnly and in good Conſcience, in the ſight of God and Men, acknowledge and declare, that <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>the ſecond is Lawful King of this Realm, and all the Dominions thereunto belonging.</hi> And that neither the <hi>Pope</hi> nor <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any elſe by their Authority have <hi>Right</hi> in any Caſe to Depoſe the <hi>King, or</hi> Diſpoſe of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or upon any ſcore whatever to <hi>abſolve</hi> his <hi>Subjects</hi> of their Obedience, or to give leave to any of them to <hi>Plot</hi> or <hi>Conſpire</hi> the Hurt of the <hi>King's Perſon,</hi> his <hi>State</hi> or <hi>People;</hi> and that all ſuch Pretences and Power are <hi>Falſe, Pernicious</hi> and <hi>Damnable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And I do further ſincerely profeſs, and in good Conſcience declare, that I do not believe, that the Pope is <hi>Chriſt's Vicar,</hi> or <hi>Peter's Lawful Succeſſor,</hi> or that <hi>He</hi> or the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeverally or joyntly are the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Controverſie,</hi> or that they can <hi>abſolve</hi> Sins: Nor do I believe, there is a <hi>Purgatory</hi> after Death; or that <hi>Saints</hi> ſhould be <hi>pray'd to</hi> or <hi>Images</hi> in any ſenſe be <hi>worſhip'd.</hi> Nor do I believe, that there is any <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> in the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> or <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> at or after the Conſecration thereof by any Perſon whatſoever.

            <p>This is the <hi>Teſt</hi> I offer; large in Matter, becauſe comprehenſive of <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Teſt</hi> too, yet brief in words.</p>
            <p>The next thing is the Wayes of taking it with moſt <hi>Aggravation</hi> upon the Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers or Violaters of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in all Cities and great Towns, notice be given by the Magiſtrates thereof to the Inhabitants of every <hi>Ward</hi> or <hi>Pariſh</hi> to appear on ſuch a day, be it <hi>New-Years-Day</hi> or <hi>Aſh-wedneſday</hi> rather (when the <hi>Pope Curſes all Proteſtants</hi>) at their publick Hall or other places of Commerce, where the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> ſhall firſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Read, Subſcribe</hi> &amp; <hi>Seal</hi> the <hi>Teſt.</hi> Then that it be read again by the proper Officer of the Place to the <hi>People,</hi> and that thoſe that take it, do <hi>audibly pronounce</hi> the words after him that reads it, and when they have ſo done, that they ſubſcribe and ſeal it. That ſuch Subſcriptions be <hi>Regiſter'd,</hi> and Copies of each Pariſh's Subſcription tranſmitted to the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> and Affixt upon ſome publick Place for all that will to ſee.</p>
            <p>That in the Countries the Pariſhes of each <hi>Hundred</hi> or <hi>Rape</hi> may be likewiſe ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd to appear upon the Day aforeſaid at the head <hi>Market Town</hi> in the ſaid Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or Rape, and that the <hi>Juſtices of the Peace</hi> within that part of the Country ſhall firſt <hi>read, ſubſcribe</hi> and <hi>ſeal</hi> the ſaid <hi>Teſt</hi> in view of the People, and then that the People <hi>ſay, ſubſcribe</hi> and <hi>ſeal</hi> the <hi>Teſt,</hi> as is before expreſt. Which being done, let the ſaid <hi>Subſcriptious</hi> be collected into one Volumn, and kept in the County Court as a Book of <hi>Record</hi>; and that to each Pariſh be tranſmitted a Copy of the ſaid <hi>Pariſh's Subſcription,</hi> to be affixt upon ſome publick Place within the ſaid <hi>Pariſh</hi> for all to ſee, that pleaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let this be done Annually, that is, upon every <hi>New-Years Day</hi> or <hi>Aſh-wedneſday,</hi> as a perpetual <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the Peoples Affection to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and their <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of the Practices of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Abuſe of this Diſcrimination ſhould be very Penal; for 'tis a great Lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Man's own Conſcience and a Cheat put upon the Government: Your Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can beſt proportion and direct the Puniſhment; but it can ſcarcely be too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, as our Buſineſs ſtands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60052:7"/>But as in caſe of ſuch Hypocriſie a ſevere Penalty ſhould be inflicted, ſo pray let Proviſion be made, that if any Perſon ſo ſubſcribing ſhould be afterwards call'd by the Name of <hi>Jeſuit</hi> or <hi>Papiſt,</hi> without very good Proof, it ſhould be <hi>deem'd</hi> and <hi>puniſht</hi> in open Seſſions for a <hi>Slander</hi> and <hi>Breach of Peace,</hi> yet ſo, as that the Penalty may be remitted at the Requeſt of the Abuſed <hi>Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould think that this buſineſs, carefully done, might render needleſs my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the laſt Objection, viz. <hi>which Way ſhall we be able to prevent</hi> Papiſts <hi>from paſſing for</hi> Proteſtant Diſſenters, <hi>that ſo the Security propounded to the Government be not baffled by Diſguize</hi>? For no <hi>Papiſt</hi> can ſubſcribe this but he will Lye in the Face of the Government and Country, and that <hi>Yearly,</hi> and upon <hi>Record</hi> too; which is ten times more then a <hi>Tranſient Oath,</hi> mutter'd with one word <hi>ſpoken,</hi> and another <hi>dropt:</hi> However, that we may carry it as far as humane Prudence can go,—</p>
            <p>I yet offer two <hi>Expedients</hi>;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That upon Jealouſie of any Perſons being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or <hi>Popiſhly inclined,</hi> who is known to frequent the Aſſemblies of <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> Four of that <hi>Party</hi> of moſt Note and Integrity, unto which he pretends to adhere, ſhould be ſummoned to appear before thoſe <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the Peace, unto whom the Complaint is made, to teſtifie their Knowledge of the Perſon ſuſpected, his <hi>Education, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> and <hi>Manner of Life</hi>; which way of Inſpection, as it goes as far as Man can reach, ſo can it ſcarcely fail; for thoſe Perſons will not only diſcover their own <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> if they conceal him, but expoſe themſelves and their Friends to Ruin. So that to ſay true, the Government has the <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> of an <hi>Entire Party,</hi> for the <hi>diſcovery</hi> of every ſuch <hi>ſuſpected Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this will not do, then</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be you pleaſed to refer the Diſcrimination of ſuſpected Perſons to the good old way of the Government; that is, the Inquiry and Judgment of <hi>Twelve Men of the Neighbourhood,</hi> to wit, a <hi>Jury</hi>; provided always, that they be ſuch as have taken or will themſelves take the <hi>Teſt</hi>; elſe, that they may be <hi>Exceptable</hi> by the <hi>Party ſuſpected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed a good Expedient may be made out of both, for the <hi>firſt</hi> may be the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> to the <hi>laſt,</hi> and I think you will hardly fail of your Ends.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with this Requeſt, Firſt to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> that he would pleaſe to make us <hi>truly and deeply ſenſible of his preſent Mercies to us, and to reform our Hearts and Lives to improve them thankfully.</hi> And Secondly to <hi>you, that we may be loving, humble and diligent one to and for another</hi>; for as from ſuch Amendments we may dare promiſe great and ſuddain Felicity to <hi>England,</hi> ſo if <hi>Looſneſs</hi> in Life, and <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> in Religion be not ſpeedily reprehended and reform'd, and the <hi>Common Civil Intereſt maintained entire,</hi> God will, I juſtly fear, <hi>repent</hi> he has begun to do us good, <hi>Adjourn</hi> the Day of our Deliverance to that of our Repentance and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and <hi>Overcaſt</hi> theſe happy Dawnings of his Favour by a thick and diſmal Cloud of Confuſion and Miſery; which GOD AVERT!</p>
            <p>Theſe things that I have written, are no <hi>wild Gueſſes</hi> or <hi>May<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>be's,</hi> but the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> and <hi>Cure,</hi> the <hi>Danger</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; in treating of which, that God that made the VVorld knows, I have not gratified any private Spleen or Intereſt (for I am ſorry of the Occaſion) but ſingly and conſcientiouſly intended his Honor, and the laſting Good of <hi>England,</hi> to which all <hi>Perſonal</hi> and <hi>Party</hi> Conſiderations ought ever to ſubmit.</p>
