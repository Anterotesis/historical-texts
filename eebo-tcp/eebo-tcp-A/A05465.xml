            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>YOU are both so rooted in <hi>oppression,</hi> and so <hi>malicious</hi> in thirsting after <hi>innocent blood,</hi> that the actions of the one, may be attributed and judged, to be the actions of you both; there is such a harmony betwixt you in <hi>wickednesse,</hi> so that I will now put you both in the singuler number, and write unto you, as if you were but one; Desireing to let you understaud, that in <hi>December</hi> was 2. yeares, the Devil your old Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8, 44. (for my <hi>innocencie) cast me into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and <hi>William Laud</hi> his obedient Sonne, got me committed to your custodie to be <hi>tormented,</hi> in which Art you are very exquisite, and expert; and your plots to murther me, and to take away my <hi>innocent blood</hi> from me, have not been a few, which have been, and still are so palpable, that they cannot be hid from the world; unto the view of which I have already in part, in my Printed Books, layd them open in a brief way: but much more then I have in publique said, have I yet behind, truly to declare. You may remember that last yeare, the 17. of <hi>September,</hi> you set the greatest part of twenty of your blood Hounds, to <hi>murther me,</hi> with whom I was forced to fight the greatest part of two houres, to save my <hi>life,</hi> and my left hand in the broyle I had like to have lost; and to requite one of them for his good indeavours to take away my <hi>life,</hi> you gave him halfe a crown, as he himselfe confessed: but when I was under the Chyrurgions hands, more likely to dye upon the wound, then to live, yet would you neither pay the Chyrurgions for the Cure, nor suffer my Friends to come to me, that so I might get moneys to pay them my selfe. Also, when your slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen my Keepers afterwards did still prosecute the taking away of the last drop of my <hi>blood</hi> (divers quarts of which I lost
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21816:2"/>
the day before mentioned) I in a large Letter in <hi>December</hi> after in a faire way acquainted you with it, intreating you in peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble termes to take some course, that I for my <hi>innocencie</hi> might not be <hi>murthered</hi> by your men: then you and they together, as to'me it seems, invented another way, if it were possible to put an end unto my dayes, and therfore placed two Chamber-Mates with me, the 12. of <hi>December,</hi> contrary unto my Order, which is, <hi>that I should lye alone,</hi> and so made use of them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to get me into your cheating and poysoning shoppe, the Lodge, that so in a Tubbe of liquor I might receive my deaths wound: into which place when I absolutely refused to come (though I were severall times earnestly solicited) then upon the 15. of <hi>December</hi> you set your murthering Slaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or cruell blood Hounds, not onely to kill and murther my selfe, but also one of my Friends that came to the Prison dore, to inquire after my necessaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in likelyhood they had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled their <hi>bloody intentions,</hi> if some Prisoners had not been that saved my <hi>life</hi> by rescuing of me from their devouring hands. And then betwixt that time and the beginning of the last Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in <hi>April</hi> last, many plots there was contrived against me, and for feare that I should there prosecute you as a <hi>blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirsty</hi> and <hi>murthering man,</hi> you procured one of your Affidavite slaves many times to pick quarrels with me, that so some slight occasion might be taken to lock me up againe, to frustrate me in my <hi>just</hi> and <hi>grievous complaints,</hi> and some blowes was struck upon the second day of the Parliament: I being not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner of the quarrell, but onely a defender of my selfe, as many of your Prisoners can justifie, and the next morning you sent 5. or 6. of your murthering Officers unto me, as though you would speake with me, but they coming in such a hostile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they did, made me afraid that they would indeed kill me; and therefore to save my <hi>life,</hi> I kept my doore barred against them, whereupon I was locked up, which when you had done, I wanted some water to dresse my diate; and you have kept an honest Gentleman up ever since closse Prisoner, for giving me but three bottles of water, that so the cruelty inflicted upon him, might make all the rest of the Prisoners afraid to doe the least courtesie for me, that so you might at least prevayle against me, to take away my <hi>life</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> from the earth. And my Friends being severall times assaulted by your Officers (for coming to the Prison dore to see me, and speake to me) to the great hazard of some of their <hi>lives</hi>; some of them to avoyd the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21816:2"/>
danger, that formerly they went through, did goe up into <hi>Thomas Deanes</hi> room over against me, that so they might know how it fared with me, there being the breadth of the Prison yard betwixt us; and our discourse and talke was such, that we did not care who heard it, which the Prisoners not onely walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Yard, but also those that were in their Lodgings might heare, if they would, as well as our selves: but seeing that still I live, and that your malice cannot put an end unto my dayes, you have taken him to task severall times, as though my Order were so strickt, that you shall incurre a great deale of <hi>detriment,</hi> if Persons came there to speake with me. And therfore have you commanded him, either to leave his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or else to suffer no more Persons to speak to me out of his Chamber. Well, it may be, before you and I have done, you had as good have held your peace, and have said nothing. You can execute my Order when you please, and you can break it when you lift, or doe any thing that my <hi>life</hi> may be brought in danger: for time hath been when my Friends would yeeld to the covetous <hi>exactions</hi> of my Keepers, to give them 12 pence, 18 pence, and 2 shillings, and more at a time, for coming to see me, and speake with me, they might be let up into my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to talke with me. Yea to such a height of <hi>covetousnesse</hi> was your man <hi>Murry</hi> grown unto, that he would not let my Friends Servants up with that Diate they brought me, unlesse they would give him <hi>money,</hi> which was the first occasion of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall and mine. And you have not onely broke my Order, by placing others in my Chamber to lodge with me, but also by your Man <hi>Murry</hi> in giving me leave to walke at my pleasure in the Prison Yard, and to come into his cozening and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lodge, to drinke with whom I would, and this I can justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie by honest men, that were the messengers severall times to bring me up the tidings: but because I was afraid of <hi>poysoning</hi> (as I told them) and would not upon any termes come into the Lodge to receive it: The strictnesse of my Order must be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon me againe, and I must be locked up closse in a room, and my Friends must not come to me, to relieve me, nor come to speake with me, to see if I be alive or no; and the poor Prisoners must be punished, and tormented; if they give me but a little <hi>water,</hi> or doe any other courtesie for me (some of whom have had three Beds taken from under them, by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and order, and several times put off the <hi>charity,</hi> and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by your selfe to be put in Irons, for helping me to my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21816:3"/>
Victuals) and yet, you, nor your great Lord and Master will not alow me one <hi>farthing</hi> to live upon: and if this be not hard measure, then sure I am, the Devils Instruments, never mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured any in their lives. But for my Order, the strictnesse of which at some times you so much stand upon, let me tell you without feare, That I verily beleeve, if <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of Devils had sate in personall presence at the Inner Star-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, instead of the Pope of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> his dutifull Son, he could not have made a more mercilesse inhumane Order against me, then my Order is which the bloody Prelat caused to be made against me the 18. of <hi>Aprill</hi> was 2. yeares, after he had caused me to be whipped at a Carts arse, from <hi>Fleet</hi> Bridge to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> Hall. For how can a Man live when all resort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons shall be kept from him, and that necessary subsistence from his Friends, and yet his Enemies will not allow him a bit of <hi>bread,</hi> or a drop of drinke. Well Sir, if by your new plots you take away my <hi>life</hi> from me, before I can have Justice against you in the Parliament, know thus much, that I have already made my Will, and <hi>bequeathed my soule, to him that purchased it with his own blood, and my body to the dust, from whence it came</hi>; and if the Priests will not suffer it to be buried in the Church-yard (as they call it) then would I have it layd beside the Coblers, in <hi>Finsbury</hi> Fields: and for my <hi>goods</hi> they are soon disposed of, for the Prelats, have already robbed me of the most part of them; for <hi>Canterburies</hi> Catchpoles took from me last yeare, at the Custom-house, almost two thousand of my Books, as they came from <hi>Amsterdam</hi>: but when I was informed that they had cozened him of the greatest part or them, and sent them to <hi>Scotland</hi> for filthy lucres sake, at whose Parliament they were fold as publique as <hi>Martin Parker</hi> (the Bishops champion Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad maker) Ballads are sould here at <hi>London,</hi> it made me to laugh at my losse: but yet for all that I have left you for a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacie, a biting whippe to lash and scourge your fat and knavish sides; for to my Executor as the greatest part of my Treasure, that I have to leave him, have I bequeathed to him, a punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Anatomie, of some part of your matchlesse knavery, villany, and bloodthirstinesse, with a strict Order to put it in Print, with some Marginall notes to it; and also to prosecute you in the greatest Court in <hi>England,</hi> for a criminall, and fellonious person, for murthering the Kings loyall and faithfull Subjects, for their <hi>innocencie,</hi> and their honest, reall, and good indeavours for the welfare of his Kingdomes.

Not long agoe I was in <hi>Holland.</hi> Where I was like to haue settled my selfe in a Course of trading, that might haue brought me in a - pretty large portion of earthlie things; (after which my heart did too much runne) but the Lord hauing a better portion in store for mee, and more durable riches to bestow vpon my soule. By the same hand of providence: brought me back a gaine. And cast me into easie affliction, that there by I might be weaned from the world, and see the vanitie and emptines of all things therein. And he hath now pitched my soule vpon such an object of beautie, amiablenessc:&amp; excelencie, as is as permanent and endurable as eternitie it selfe, Namely the personall excelencie of the Lord Iesus Christ. the sweetnesse of whose presence, no affliction can ever be able to wrest out of my soule.</p>
                  <p>Now while J was in <hi>Holland,</hi> it seemes ther were divers Bookes. of that Noble and Renowned <hi>Dr. Iohn Bastwicks</hi> sent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> which came to the hands of one <hi>Edmond Chillington,</hi> for the sending over which I was taken, and apprehended. the plot being before laid, by one <hi>Iohn Chilliburne</hi> (whom I supposed) &amp; tooke to be my friend) servant to my old fellow souldier <hi>Mr. Iohn Wharton</hi> living in <hi>Bow-lane</hi> (after this manner.)</p>

                  <p>Now at my Censure before the <hi>Lords:</hi> I there declared vpon the word of <hi>a Christian</hi> that I sent not over those Bookes, neither did I know the Shipp that brought them. nor any of the men that belonged to the Shipp, nor to my knowledge did I ever see, either Shipp: or any appertaining to it, in all my dayes.</p>

To that I answer, that for mine owne perticuler I never read nor saw any of the <hi>Drs.</hi> Bookes: but the forenamed foure in English. and one little thing more of about two sheetes of paper, which is annexed to the <hi>Vanity of the Old Letany,</hi> And as for his Lattine Bookes J never saw any but two: Namely his <hi>Flag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And some of this impression was in England before J came out of Holland.</p>
                  <p>And these are the maine things for which I was Censured and Condemned. Being two Oaths in which the said <hi>Chillington,</hi> hath palpably forsworne himselfe.

                  <p>But besides all this, there was an inquisition-Oath-tendered vnto mee (which J refused to take) on foure severall daies; the summe of which Oath is thus much. You shall sweare that you shall make true answer to all things that shall be asked of you: So helpe you God. Now this Oath I refused as a sinfull and vnlawfull Oath: it being the <hi>High-Commission Oath,</hi> with which the Prelates euer haue and still do so butcherly torment, afflict and vndoe, the deare Saints and Servants, of God, It is also an Oath against the Law of the Land,

As <hi>Mr. Nicholas Fuller</hi> in his Argument doth proue. And olso it is expressly against the <hi>Petition of Right an Act of Parlament Enacted</hi> in the second yeare of our King. Againe, it is absolutely against the Law of God, for that law requires noe man to accuse himselfe, but if any thing be laid to his charge: there must come two or three witnesses at the least to proue it. It is also against the practise of Christ himselfe, who in all his examinations before the High Priest would not accuse himselfe: but vpon their demands, returned this answer: <hi>Why aske yea mee, go to them that heard mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With all this Oath is against the uery law of nature, for nature is alwaies a preserver of it selfe and not a distroyer.

Soe that the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie comes from the Devill, and the Prelates, and their Creatures in their printed Bookes, do challenge their authoritie jurisdiction and Power, (that they exercise over all sorts of people) is from Rome.</p>
                  <p>And for proving of the Church of England to be a true Church, their best &amp; strongest argument is: that the Bb. are lineally discen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded from his Holines (or impiousnes) of Rome: as you may read in <hi>Pocklingtons</hi> Booke, called <hi>Sunday no Sabboth.</hi> So that by their own confession they stand by that same power and authoritie that they haue receaved from the <hi>Pope.</hi> Soe that their calling is not from God but from the Divill. For the Pope cannot give a better au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie or calling to them, then he himselfe hath. But his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and Calling is from the Devill: Therefore the Prelates Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and authoritie is from the Devill alsoe. <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. 3. <hi>And there came out of the smoake, Locusts upon the earth: and unto them was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven power as the Scorpions of the earth haue power to hurt.</hi> and vndoe men, as the Prelates dailie doe.

For in their Sermons that they preach before his Majestie: how doe they incense the <hi>King</hi> &amp; nobles against the people of God. labouring to make them odious in his sight &amp; stirring him up to execute vengance vpon them, though they be the most harmelesse generation of all others.</p>
                  <p>And as for all these officers that are vnder them &amp; made by them, for mine own particular I cannot se but that their callings <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yet not withstanding, this proves not their Callings to be ever the better. As it is in civill government. If the King (whom God hath made a lawfull Majestrate) make a wicked man an officer, hee is as true an officer and as well to be obeyed, comming in the Kings name, as the best man in the world comming with the same atthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. for in such a case, he that is a wicked man hath his calling from as good authority as the godliest man hath: And therefore his call<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing is as good as the others.</p>
                  <p>But on the other side, if he that hath noe authoritie make officers, though the men themselues be never so good and holie. Yet their holines maks their calling never awhitt the truer, but still is a false a calling: in regard his authority was not good nor lawful that made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so the ministers, be they never so holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet they haue one and the same calling with the wickedest that is amongest them, their holines proues not their callings to be ever the truer: seeing their authority that made them ministers is false, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue more to answer for then any of the rest: by how much the more God hath bestowed greater guists vpon them then vpon others, and yet they detaine the truth in vnrighteousnesse from Gods people: and do not make knowne to them as they ought, the whole will and counsell of God.</p>
                  <p>And againe, the greater is their sinne if their callings be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, (as J verily beleeve they are) in that they still hold them

Ey, but you must give me an answer, said hee, for I must certifie the Lords thereof. Then, said I, I pray you tell their Honours, I am unwilling to tell you. What were those Bookes, said he, that you threw abroade, were they all of one sort? Those that have them, said I, can certifie you of that. I my selfe have one of them, said he, and have read it, and I can finde no wit in it, there is nothing but railing in it. Sir, said I, I conceive you are mistaken, for the Booke is all full of wit; it is true, this Booke

which you lighted on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not so full of soliditie as other of his Bookes are; but you must understand, that at that time when the Dr. made that Booke, hee was full of heavines and in danger of a great punishment, for the Prelates had breathed out more crueltie against him for writing his <hi>Apology</hi>; And at that time also he was compassed about on every side with the P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

So I must (said he) for the Lords have commaunded me so to doe, therefore open your Trunke. Sir, said I, it is open alreadie. Search it <hi>Iohn Hawes,</hi> said he. So he search it, and found nothing there. Open the Cubbard, said he. So I gave the Porter the key of my Cub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, to search it, and he found nothing there but my victuals. Search his pocket said the <hi>Warden.</hi> Indeed Sir, said I, there is none in them; Yet he searched them, and found as I said. Then he

searched all my Chamber over, but found nothing at all. Well Sir, said I, now you can certifie the Lords how you finde things with me; But I pray Sir, mu<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>And the next day, being <hi>Fryday,</hi> and a <hi>Starr-Chamber-day,</hi> J hoped I should have had the Libertie of the Prison; But in stead thereof, newes was brought me at evening, that I must be removed to the <hi>Common Goale,</hi> or a worse place, and that I must bee put in Irons. Well, for all this my God enabled me to keep my hold still, and not to let my confidence goe; For (blessed be his name for it) this newes did not in the least manner trouble me.</p>
                  <p>And upon <hi>Saterday</hi> morning <hi>Iohn Hawes</hi> the Porter came with the Woman that looked to mee to my Chamber, to stand by her that none might speake with me till she had made my bedd, and done other things for me; And he told me, hee was sorrie to heare such newes as he did concerning me. VVhat is it, said <hi>I? I</hi> heare, said he, that the Lords have ordered, that you must be put into the <hi>Wards,</hi> and kept close Prisoner there, and lie in irons, and none must be suffered to come at you, to bring you any thing; but you must live upon the Poore Mans Box. Sir, that's verie hard, said J, but the will of my God be done; For mine owne part, i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> nothing at all troubles me; For I know in whom I have beleeved, and I know, not one Haire of my Head shall fall to the ground without his providence; And I have cast up my account alreadie what it will cost me; Therefore I waigh not any thing that can be inflicted on me; For I knovv, that God, that made <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> to singe in the Stocks at midnight, will also make me rejoyce in my Chaines; But it is verie much that they wil let none com to me, to bring me any thing; it seemes, they wilbe more cruell to me then the verie <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Pagan Romans</hi> were to <hi>Paul,</hi> who when he was in Prison, did never refuse to let any come to him, to administer to his necessities; But I vvaigh it not, for I knovv my God is and vvill be with me, to make me goe through all my afflictions with cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes,

for I feele his power within me so mightily supporting and upholding me, that no condition in this World can make me mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable; And for mine owne part, I doe no more sett by my life and blood in this cause, then I doe a peece of bread when I have newly dyned.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards the VVoman telling mee shee hoped I should not have so sore a punishment laid on me, but that I might have things brought me from my Freinds, I told her I did not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
