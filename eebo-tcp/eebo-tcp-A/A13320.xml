            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wee are made after Gods owne
image, (who is truth it selfe) that wee might expresse the
same in our life, in our words, and in our maners. But by
reason of original sinne, we all haue made shipwracke of
the truth, &amp; euerie man is become a liar. Yet, what man
is he so vnregenerate, that in open shew seemeth not to
like and loue truth? Doe not the greatest liers and most
false accusers pretend truth? Celsus and Antiphon, two
heretiques, called their bookes, Bookes of truth. The
false Prophets which deceiued Achab, made a great brag
of truth. The deuill (who can transforme himselfe into an
Angel of light) when he tempted Christ, had in his mouth
the infallible truth of Gods word. But Prosper sayth very
well, <hi>Parum est, si verum in ore est, et falsum in corde.</hi> And an
other father to the same purpose saith: <hi>Nihil prodest, quia
hymnum cantat lingua tua si sacrilegium exhalat vita tua.</hi> It
is a verie vile thing to haue truth in the mouth, and fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in the heart. A theefe many times is not knowen
by his face from a true man. Experience proueth, that as
poisoning hearbes do grow greene as well as the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some:
And as counterfait golde looketh to the eie so
faire as good coine: so doth falsehoode appeare often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
like the truth, yea to some, more plausible and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.
For art and science, which should serue for the

gifts which God hath giuen vnto men, against the truth?
to wit, such as are in the Papists, Heretiques, Brownists,
the familie of Loue, Martinistes, and all Schismatiques,
which neuer cease peruerting the truth? It were to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

miserable contentions with which the
Church of <hi>England</hi> at this day is so vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and turmoiled by the children of follie,
I cannot but on the one side condemne
the late <hi>Martine</hi> libellers, and their fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
who hauing a bad cause, do as leudly handle the same: and
on the other side mislike some repliers, who notwithstanding
they haue chosen the better part, yet handle it not so charitably
and modestly as it requireth. And albeit the first scandale com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by those foolish workers of iniquitie, yet <hi>Angerona</hi> the
Goddes of silence, might better haue answered them, then men
of vncircumcised lips, whose euill wordes corrupt good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:

            </p>
            <p>These things considered, I haue thought good to tender this
<hi>Myrror,</hi> to take from the face manifest spots: wishing as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
that the Church might be as frée from those <hi>Martine</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers,
as they séeme to wish it to bee without all manner of
blemishes and imperfections.<note place="margin">Cant. 6. 8</note> But although the Church of

strong, but the tyrants of the worlde doe sometime assaile and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18665:4"/>
shake the same: neither is it so holy, but that prophane and
wicked men séeme to haue place therein. Our sauiour Christ
sayd,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 47.</note> that the kingdome of heauen (which is the Church (hath

wheate: &amp; yet these are not of the substance, but as it were the
dregs and excrements thereof. The bodie of Christ is liuely,
neither hath it anie dead members: and therefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>
speaking of false Apostles sayth,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2. 19</note> 
               <hi>They went out from vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

doe faine and imagine to themselues a Church so reformed
héere in earth, as they will haue nothing out of square in the
same: &amp; doe looke for that here, which is no where to be found
but in heauen. And if they finde not the Church according to
their conceit, they incontinent forsake the same and make a
scisme. Which to the Church (according to <hi>Cyprians</hi> opinion)
is more permitious than idolatrie. For hee sayth, that heresie
and schisme succéeded in the place and selfe same degrée that ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie
had afore time.<note place="margin">Cyprian lib. de vnitate Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae.</note> 
               <hi>Christi aduentu prostratus inimicus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
idola derelicta, &amp;c.</hi> The enimie Sathan being ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
by the comming of Christ, séeing idols forsaken, and his
sees and temples to be left desart, by reason of the great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of faithfull people, deuised a new subtiltie vnder the verie
title and name of Christianity, to deceiue the vnwary: he found
out (I saie) heresies and schismes, wherby he might ouerthrow
faith, corrupt the truth, &amp; diuide the vnitie of Christs Church.
This title and name of Christianitie, whereof <hi>Cyprian</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
is that cloke of schismatiques, by which they would séeme
holy and good to the detriment of the godlie.</p>
            <p>Schisme (according to Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion) springeth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18665:4"/>
from a certaine hatred amongst brethren. Many causes hereof
are rehearsed by the fathers of the Primitiue Church: but they
all agrée that there be foure especiall meanes to hatch them,<note place="margin">The causes of Schisme.</note> all
which foure haue a soueraigne supremacie, and a supreame so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie
in this latter age of the worlde. The first they set
down, is the contempt of Bishops,<note place="margin">Ierom. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad Eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grium.</note> to whom (as <hi>Ierome</hi> saith)
euer since Saint <hi>Markes</hi> time, the gouernment of the Church
belonged: <hi>In hoc omnes sunt docti, &amp;c.</hi> By so much bee they
nowe accounted better learned, by howe much they can whet
their tongues sharper, and shoote out more poisoned arrowes
euen bitter wordes against them. The second is, ambition, or
as some thinke, enuie at the preferment of others: This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of olde <hi>Arrius, Donatus,</hi> and <hi>Nouatius</hi> to straine theyr
braines, to finde out their monstrous assertions, &amp; being found,
to teach and preach them openly: neither shall the sectaries of
our daies, euer cléere themselues from this suspition. The third
cause is, false loue. All men desire to bee commended for theyr
skill. They thinke nothing to be truly sayd, or well done, but
that which they themselues doe. The fourth is, couetonsnesse,
this caused <hi>Balaam</hi> to curse Gods people: and <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
to desire the giftes of the holy Ghost:<note place="margin">Theodoret. li. 2. Fab.</note> and hope of gaine is said
to be it, that caused <hi>Paulus Samosatenus</hi> to fall into his
damnable opinions.</p>
            <p>This contagion hath so spread it selfe like a canker through
the veines and hearts of the world at this daie, that there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
no hope of anie recouerie. In respect whereof it cannot
be sayd, as it was of <hi>Iay rouse</hi> daughter, that it is euen nowe
dead: but as they sayd of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that it alreadie stinketh.</p>
            <p>These causes considered,<note place="margin">A definition of Schisme.</note> it may easily be séene what schisme
is, namely, a separation of a congregation, either through ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and contempt of Bishoppes, ambition, selfe-loue, or coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes,
by which there ariseth a diuersitie either of minde, or
opinion, or spéeches, or election of gouernours, whether ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
or ciuill, which things doe both bréede and increase that
hatred, contempt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Howbeit all Schisme is not to be condemned. For there is
a separation which we may iustly allow &amp; commend,<note place="margin">A distinction of Schisme.</note> as when
certaine partes separate themselues from the whole, because
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18665:5"/>
they will not be corrupted and infected with vngodlynes. In
this respect <hi>Abraham</hi> is commended, because he forsooke <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
his natiue Countrie: <hi>Lot, Sodome:</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>
was no Schismatique, though he departed from the Leuitical
Priesthood, himselfe being of the same Tribe: <hi>Paul</hi> departing
from the Scribes and Pharesies: the Gentiles conuerted from
the Iewes: and we,<note place="margin">Math. 10. 34</note> from the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For Christ
came not to send peace, but a sworde, and to seuere men from
their owne household.</p>
            <p>But if the body it selfe being good, and some members being
putrified and defiled are departed awaie,<note place="margin">A most detesta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble schisme.</note> such a schisme is most
detestable: both because the Church séeing it is a bodie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
partes, when it is diuided, is after a sort ruined: and also
because the parts thereof being distracted and torne a sunder,
doe perish, forsomuch as they do fall from eternall life.</p>
            <p>They that separate themselues in this kinde of Schisme,
what other thing do they but rip vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seamlesse coat of Christ,
and breake the limites he hath set, by disquieting the peace of
his Church, casting innummerable bones of debate, to set men
together by the eares, so destroying their owne soules, and so
much as in them lyeth, the whole Church, vnles Christ vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
his mercie, to restore and preserue the same. Here a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be asked, why God doth suffer his Church to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and turmoiled by Schismes, innouations, and fantasticall
deuices (of the which greate learned men are many times the
authors) in such wise, that not onely affinities, kindreds, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
and whole families are subuerted, as if <hi>Bellona</hi> or the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were among them: but also Cities, Prouinces, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
brought thereby to vtter desolation.</p>
            <p>Moses <hi>the man of God answereth this question thus,</hi> If
there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dremes,<note place="margin">Deut. 13</note>
(and giue thee a signe or a wonder, and the signe or the
wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der which he hath told thee come to passe) saying, Let
vs goe after other Gods which thou hast not knowen, &amp;
let vs serue them: Thou shalt not hearken to the wordes
of that Prophet, or dreamer of dreames: for the Lorde
your God proueth you, to knowe whether yee loue the
Lord your God with all your heart, &amp; with all your soule.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18665:5"/>
               <hi>The cause then we sée is as cléere as the light, why the diuine
prouidence sometime suffereth certain teachers in the Church-learned
men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">False tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> 
               <hi>to preach and maintain new opinions (sayth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)</hi>
That the Lord your God might trie or proue you. <hi>And
in verie déede this is a sore temptation, that hee whome thou
iudgest to be a Prophet, a disciple of the Prophets, whom thou
reputest to be a Doctor and teacher of the truth, whome thou
doest reuerence and greatly loue, that he (I saie) should sodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and couertly sowe hurtfull errours, which thou canst not
quickly find out, nor easily condemne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make this place of Moses more manifest, I will set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thée some Ecclesiasticall examples.</p>
            <p>When that vnhappie <hi>Nestorius</hi> was turned from a shéepe
to a woulfe, how grieuously did he then teare &amp; spoile the flock
of Christ: when as they themselues were bitten of him, which
for the most part as yet tooke him for a shéepe, and therfore laie
more open to be deuoured of him. For who wold haue thought
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could easily haue erred, which was elected to be Bishop of
<hi>Constantinople</hi> by a generall consent of learned men, who
was beloued of the best, and reuerenced of all men: who dailie
handled Gods word, and confuted the pernitious errours both
of the Iewes and also of the Gentiles? Who would not haue
beléeued,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nestorius</hi> held that <hi>Marie</hi> was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Christ, but not the mother of God: making two Christs.</note> that this man did teach and preache nothing but the
truth, &amp; that he had bin of a sound iudgement? But he to make
a waie for his owne heresie (denying the diuinitie of Christ) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed
against the blasphemies of all heresies. And this is that
which Moses sayd, <hi>The Lorde your God doth proue you
whether ye loue him or not.</hi> Many things are reported by
<hi>Zozomenus</hi> in his Ecclesiasticall storie of the wickednesse of
this <hi>Nestorius,</hi> where amongst other things he setteth foorth
the wonderfull and terrible iudgement of God vpon this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,
whose tongue, with the which he had blasphemed Christ,
was immediatly after his death, found eaten &amp; consumed from
within his mouth with wormes.</p>
            <p>But to leaue <hi>Nestorius,</hi> in whom there was more cause of
wonder then matter of profite, more fame then desert: who
was for a time more fauoured of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon multitude (whom
he sought to please) then beloued of God. I will set before you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18665:6"/>
those of more deserued fame and learning, and thereby a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
temptation to good men. Among which, <hi>Photinus</hi> is to bée
reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Photinus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Christ</note> who not long after that he was called to the Church
of <hi>Syrmitana</hi> by a general consent, shewed himselfe soone after
rather a tempter then a teacher, insomuch, that sodainly lyke
that euill Prophet, or dreamer of dreames, of whome Moses
speaketh, he began to persuade the people committed vnto him
to followe strange Gods, that is to say, strange errours, which
before they had not knowen: to bring which wickednesse to
passe, he had great helpes, as a singular wit, profound learning
and persuasible eloquence: insomuch that he could speake copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
with delight, and dispute and write subtilly and sententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie
with commendation: as plainly appeared by his bookes
which he wrote in Gréeke and Latine. But happily it befell,
that the shéepe of Christ committed vnto him, hauing a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
eie and carefull regard vnto their faith, soone remembred
the forewarning of Moses: and although they had in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the learning and eloquence of their pastour and prophet,
yet were they not ignorant of the temptation. For him whom
afore they followed as the bel-weather of the flocke, the same
now they began to shunne and flie from as a most dangerous
woulfe.</p>
            <p>As we are warned by this example of <hi>Photinus,</hi> so also are
we taught by another of <hi>Appollinar,</hi> to beware of the danger
of this Ecclesiastical temptation, and to take diligent héed that
we kéepe the faith. This <hi>Appollinar</hi> was also a man of great
learning,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apollinor</hi> held that Christ had no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane soule: &amp; that he tooke no flesh of the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> but brought it from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c</note> as appeareth by those thirtie bookes which he wrote
against <hi>Porphyrius:</hi> and as he was learned, so also he séemed
zealous in ouerthrowing many heresies, and confuting such er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
as were contrarie to the faith. It were too tedious to
make report of all his workes, by which he might séeme equall
to the greatest builders of the Church. But sée the mallice of
sathan. This man through a certaine prophane desire of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
curiositie, began to be new-fangled, and so as it were by
the contagion of a leprosie, he defiled and corrupted all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
whereby his doctrine in the end shewed it selfe to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an Ecclesiasticall temptation, than a building of the
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:18665:6"/>But of all the most dangerous tempters of olde time, none
may be compared to <hi>Origen,</hi> in whom many things were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
many excellent, and many wonderfull: to speak of whose
condigne praises, in respect of the mans rare gifts, a whole daie
will scarse suffice: all which notwithstanding did not make so
much for the glorie of religion, as they do set forth the greatnes
of the temptation. For what man is he, that rather than hée
would cast off one endued with such a wit, so profound in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in all science, such swéete eloquence, so holy a life, and with
so great grace, will not vse this sentence, that hee had rather to
erre with <hi>Origen,</hi> then with others to be of a true and sounde
iudgement. And yet for all this, no common, but a perillous
temptation by him (as the end shewed) carried many from the
integritie of faith: insomuch that the selfe same <hi>Origen,</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
abusing the grace of God, trusting too much to his wit,
and standing too fast in his owne conceit, made smal account of
Christian religion, thought himself more wise then others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
the ancient rites of the Church, and interpreted some
places of Scripture after a new and strange sense, giuing iust
occasion to Moses, to speak vnto the Church of Christ concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him, <hi>Thou shalt not heare the voice of that Prophet,
because the Lorde your God proueth you, whether yee
loue him or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what néede wée séeke examples so farre of, when as at
home daily we haue too many of these before our eies, of such
men as are indued with competent learning and other good
giftes, and hauing once begun well in the race of discretion, to
run a good course, and like good builders, to lay a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to reare vp the Church of Christ by the preaching of the
Gospel, are now at the last lyke those foolish builders of <hi>Babel,</hi>
confounded in their worke, building by presumption a tower of
fonde conceit to themselues, and are by the iust plague of God
so diuided therein, that some are Anabaptisticall <hi>Brownists,</hi>
some libertine <hi>Family-louists,</hi> and some (beside other sectes)
malecontent <hi>Martinists,</hi> birdes hatcht of an euill egge, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of vipers, that can finde no life but by the destruction
of their mother, to too gréedie to séeke themselues &amp; not Christ,
hauing no care to maintaine the peace of his Church, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18665:7"/>
séeke to disturbe the same: which preach not his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
simply, but their selfe conceited deuises, which are infinite:
which masking kinde of hypocrites, haue their visors daily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from theyr faces, and the most godly wise do knowe them
perfectly, and can saie, that they are no better than those sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
dreamers and false teachers, of whom Moses speaketh, by
which God vseth to trie vs, whether we loue him or not.</p>
            <p>Who therefore séeing these dangerous daies, doth not rather
wish with <hi>Ieremie</hi> to dwell in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wildernes, that so they might
leaue the societie of sinfull men, and giue themselues onelie to
contemplation, that so also they might not sée the miseries like
to fall vpon vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polycarpus</hi> that holy martyr, scholler to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Euangelist, when he heard in his time but of a little discord, in
regard of that which at this daie raigneth both in Church and
common wealth, is reported to haue cried out, <hi>Deus bone, in
quae tempora me reseruasti vt haec audiam,</hi> Good God, vntill
what time hast thou kept &amp; continued me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I shuld heare these
things? How much more iust occasion haue the godly of this
age, not onely to crie out with the heathen Oratour, <hi>O tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora,
ô mores:</hi> O times, O manners: but also with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Isay, Heare O earth, and hearken O heauen, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 1</note>
            </p>
            <p>The godly and faithfull of this most Christian Church of
<hi>England</hi> féeling and fearing the danger of Schisme, doe euery
where greatly complaine of the discorde among Ministers.
Such is the miserable corruption of this latter world, that
whereas calamities, troubles, and contentions do euery where
abound, and the dutie of the Ministers of the Church is, euen
as Fathers,<note place="margin">The dutie of good mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> chiefe men, and teachers, or rather as messengers
of peace in the house of God, to teach men plaine and simplie,
and instruct and confirme them in faith, to reproue sinne and
errours, to exhort vnto good workes, to comfort the afflicted, &amp;
finally to stirre them vp both to peace, charitie and concord, to
amendement of life, and repentance from sinne: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
many of them doe nothing lesse. And which is worse,
they themselues are the authors of schisme, and distracting of
the simple and ignorant multitude, vsing a contentious kinde
of teaching and quarrelling among themselues, that beeing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18665:7"/>
with these garboiles, they nothing regarde howe
they may (as cause requireth) prouide for the publique state, but
in stead thereof, vnder a great shew of holines and zeale, they
thrust into the house of God, before the whole congregation,
their contentious conceits &amp; péeuish affections: and so by these
kinde of Sermons, the simple and silly people receiueth small
profit, being by these not instructed as they ought to be, in faith
confirmed, nor moued to repentance: but rather are troubled,
and made worse and disobedient. Whereby it commeth to passe
that they saie they cannot tell what to beléeue, nor to what
sound and true foundation to leane. And thus these Scisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
by their contentions (to vse Saint Ambrose wordes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them) <hi>Quadam nuncapatiua fidei germanitate parrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialibus
gladijs homines cupiunt vulnerare.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ambr. de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnat. Dom. cap. 2.</note> With a certaine
brotherly affinitie or likenes of one faith, they couet to wound
men, as if one brother should drawe his sword against another.
Such false Apostles are craftie workers, transforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
into the Apostles of Christ, and are excellently described
in the Apocalips, vnder the names of locusts, the formes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were <hi>similes equis paratis in praelium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apoc. 9.</note> like horses redie to the
skirmish: that is to saie, hot and vehement, and they had vppon
their heads, as it were crownes, not crownes in déede, and like
to golde, but not golde: &amp; their faces were as the faces of men,
that is, they séemed good and honest men: and they had hayre
like vnto womens haire,<note place="margin">False Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles described</note> many faire shewes and resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the noise of their wings, was like the noise of many
chariots and horses, but they had tayles like to Scorpions, and
their stings were in their tailes: that is to say, the end &amp; effect of
all their labours, was to seduce men to euerlasting damnation.</p>
            <p>The state therefore of the Church in these our dayes, is like
a great houshold, wherein not onely the sonnes, daughters and
seruants are at continuall discord, &amp; braule among themselues,
whereby it commeth to passe that none of them doth his dutie,
nor séeketh to vpholde the state of the house: but also the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
themselues, which are chiefe of the house, and ought to
remoue those contentions, and put euery man in minde of his
dutie, are also at contention and strife together: and so hauing
respect onely to their owne contentions, they let the whole
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18665:8"/>
house go to hauock, caring nothing at all whether it be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
well or ill: yea by reason of these braules, they confirme the
troubled housholde in their conceiued wickednes, whereby at
last they altogether miserablie perish. For these vnhappie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of the parents, are the chiefe meanes to vpholde the
cause of that heauie destruction of the whole housholde. This
is a verie fit reseblance of the Ministers of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
at this daie (I meane those that be faltie in this behalfe.)
For those which are not faultie, (as I hope through the grace
of God, the most are such) are not offended with this speach.
For the other doe grieuously offend, and no small parte of the
cause both of the corruptions of the present manners, and also
of the times doe rest in them. For whereas they ought by doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
reprouing and exhorting grauely, to helpe the publique
state and preuent the worst, they doe not as they ought, imploy
their diligence herevnto,<note place="margin">Contentious Ministers,</note> but rather doe giue themselues to sow
sedition, then studie to follow their function: and so vnfruitfully
they continually wearie and offend the people, that many (the
more is to be lamented) do stubburnly persist and continue in
their incredulitie, and so repent not, to theyr owne destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and at the last contemne both the Church and doctrine.</p>
            <p>But such as rather loue contentious inuectiues then quiet
preachings, and haue so vsed themselues thereunto, that they
can almost doe nothing els but contend, obiect to vs the saying
of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 9</note> who commandeth a Bishoppe to holde fast that
faithfull word which tendeth vnto doctrine, that he may bée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to exhort by wholesome instruction, and to confute such as
shall speake there-against.</p>
            <p>Truly I answere,<note place="margin">Ministers must reproue errours.</note> it is néedfull that euerie faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
should stedfastly cleaue to wholsome doctrine, and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bend himselfe against that which is contrarie, and agaynst
such as peruert the same, so as hée may bée able with firme ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to confute their peruerse and false opinions, and so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe
falshood before they can vtter it.</p>
            <p>This may be done stoutly,<note place="margin">Modestie and mildnes of spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit becommeth Ministers.</note> and yet modestly. And this graue
modestie is to be learned by the examples of the Apostles, who
although they had many enemies, yet notwithstanding did not
immodestly rage in any place of their writings and sermons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18665:8"/>
a publike estate of the whole Church which themselues
had planted. The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who would haue a Bishop to
holde fast true doctrine, and to resiste those that speake agaynst
the same, doth notablie speake of these things, charging thus,
<hi>The seruant of the Lord must not striue, but must be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to all men:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 24.</note> 
               <hi>apt to teach, suffering euill men patientlie,
instructing them with meeknes, that are contrarie min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
prouoking, if God at anie time will giue them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that they may know he truth, &amp;c.</hi> These precepts of
the Apostle are to be obserued by the Ministers of the worde,
in such wise, that they be not moued to immoderate heate and
rayling, whereby in déede they destroie more then they build.</p>
            <p>But (saie they) the euill manners of men must be restrained
by the straight discipline of the Primitiue Church, and religion
must be restored to that perfection, from which by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of times it is fallen, and this, say they, is the marke &amp; ende
of all our labours.</p>
            <p>Let vs sée and consider this, haue these reformers taken in
hand to embrace méeknesse and humility?<note place="margin">A comparison betweene the Apostles and our reformers</note> Haue they cast from
them the bitter gall of hatred and cursed speaking? Haue they
crucified their fleshly desires? The Apostles, whose steps they
would séeme to followe, by their example exhorted the world to
humilitie, lowlynes, méeknesse and patience: these teach theyr
schollers pride, crueltie, scolding, and cursed speaking. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
saie, they may not tarrie the leasure of the Magistrate in
reformation of religion: the present state is Antichristian. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
they were all of one minde, disciples of one maister the
holy Ghost, they laboured to knit men together with the sure
bond of peace, and to fasten them with the gliewe of mutuall
loue: they praied to God for the health and wealth of them that
wronged them: being rayled on, they gaue not foule language
againe. Alas, the contrarie is true with them. <hi>Quot capita, tot
sensus.</hi> How many heads, so many opinions. Their shamefull
doings, do disproue their shamelesse sayings. They speake as if
they had <hi>in se nihil humanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as if they had mortified al concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence
in their mortall bodies, as loosed from the bondage of sin,
as if God were the onely obiect of their thoughts, and the holie
Ghost their counsailour. <hi>Curios simulant, et Bacchanalia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uunt:</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:18665:9"/>
they doe outwardly pretend religion, and inwardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
subuersion: promise and proclaime that they will restore
ancient perfection, but they performe nothing but the idle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites
of their owne fansies. What better argument can there
be of this, then their deadly hatred toward their brethren, their
daily contentions, their tanting &amp; ribaldrie railings vpon theyr
superiours, and their Momish fault finding, wherein Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> fitly compareth them vnto <hi>Iobs</hi> dogs, which lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his sore partes onely. And Iustine Martyr compareth them
to flies, which doe euer gather about the diseased partes of anie
creature.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, many great Clarkes now a daies without anie
iust cause stirre vp grieuous contentions,<note place="margin">Peruerters of good things.</note> by mistaking and
peruerting the godly actions, and also the sound and wholsome
doctrine of reuerend Fathers and good men: and so by this
means those good Ministers which are giuen to peace, and had
rather applie themselues to teaching reformation of lyfe, and
edifying of the Church, are constrained by force to cease from
their function and labour (being a thing most néedful) and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
themselues for their defence against <hi>Brownists, Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
and such other like pestilent Sectes and Schismatiques,
wherby it commeth to passe, that euen against their wils, they
are wrapped in contentions.</p>
            <p>But those that kindle these flames of discord, and by that
meanes prouoke other vnto schisme which are louers of peace,
doe greatly offend the maiestie of God. And those again on the
other side, are both before God and man to bee excused, which
stoutly and modestly withstand that viperous broode, and yet
so much as in them lieth, doe still prefer peace before Schisme.</p>
            <p>In the Primitiue Church of Christ, if there happened anie
sturre, or anie suspition of errour to arise, they sought the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and quieting thereof farre otherwise, to wit, by admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
by friendly communication and brotherly conference:<note place="margin">How schismes and errors in the Primitiue time of the Church were suppressed.</note>
and when any manifest proofe of suspected opinion was eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
shewed forth, they receiued the same, and quietly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
gainsaying yéelded themselues, as it may euidently appeare
in the reconciliation of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Antioch, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doretus,</hi>
and others of the East, with <hi>Cirillus Alexandrinus.</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:18665:9"/>
And by this meanes they suffered not one braule to bréede of an
other: neither were their contentions endlesse, neither striued
they despitefully among themselues, but handled al things with
godly zeale vnto sound doctrine. But if anie had erred and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
obstinatly in his errour, then did they admonishe all men
to beware of him,<note place="margin">Tit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 10</note> and to auoide his companie, like as Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> both taught, and did also himselfe. And by this meanes all
things in the Church were in good state, and al contentions for
the most part were quieted. Also the ancient Fathers in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
did bend themselues against those which peruerted the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
actions and sound doctrine of others,<note place="margin">The ancient fathers were euer enemies to scismatikes</note> and which went about
to stirre vp néedlesse contentions in the Church.</p>
            <p>And those which in the Primitiue Church professed one and
the same religion of Christ, could not easily bee stirred to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, least they should giue occasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
vnto their enemies the Philosophers, idolatrous Priestes,
and others of the subtill Gentiles and Heathen to reioyce, or
matter whereby they might be confirmed in their errors. But
they altogether gaue themselues vnto concorde,<note place="margin">Concord.</note> cutting off in
due time all occasions of discord, and ioyning their forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fought against the enemies of the Church: whereof <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinus

the Bishops. But when they followed not his counsell,<note place="margin">The mischiefe of discord.</note>
but without all reconciliation stroue among themselues, there
arose héereof most lamentable miseries to the Church: as the
histories both of <hi>Arrius</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> doe euidently proue.</p>
            <p>There arise also diuers discords and dissentions among the
Ministers of the Church:<note place="margin">Singularitie.</note> when some of them vse a proper and
peculiar forme and order which themselues haue deuised, both
of preaching, and also of other actions in religion, and woulde
binde others to the same, although they knowe that the whole
state being christian, hath otherwise decréed. And if peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
their deuice be reiected, so that men do not conforme them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues
to their fantasticall conceits, by and by they iudge them
not onely enemies, but also crie out against them, and saie, that
they are Papists and seducers: being so contentious and pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish,
that by no meanes they will bee satisfied, except that all
those things may bee receiued wherewith themselues are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted.

But let them knowe, that where there is a Christian
Church once instituted and established,<note place="margin">Order.</note> all things ought to bee
done in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same in due order: els why did <hi>Paul</hi> reproue some for

who misliketh not anie thing so much (especially in diuine

            <p>As there is one God, one Faith, and one Baptisme: one
Christ, one holy Ghost, &amp; one onely true religion: so is it néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that all things be done according to one rule: els many, yea
infinite religions will rise, one contrarie to another, yea &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie

to his owne fantasie. We haue all one hope, one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,

            <p>It is most conuenient that there be in the Church one vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

            </p>
            <p>Now a daies, this vniformitie of many inconstant men is
loathed, &amp; noueltie desired, who are euer learning &amp; deuising, &amp;
neuer holde anie thing firme and certaine. <hi>Tertullian</hi> a most
ancient writer, doth in his booke <hi>de Praescriptionibus,</hi> shew
that in his time there were the like sort of men, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
did search the Scriptures, that they might thence bring
forth some new thing, and were wont alwayes to defend them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues
with these wordes of the Gospell, <hi>Seeke and yee shall
finde.</hi> To whom he answereth: in déede we must séeke, but
yet onely those things which pertaine to our saluation, and not
strange things which are nothing necessarie, but are rather
contrarie to the Scriptures, and rule of our faith. For like as
he which hath found that which is true &amp; right ceaseth from
séeking: so he which continueth séeking, testifieth thereby that
he hath not yet found out the truth. There is an end of séeking,
beyond the which we may not passe. For the Christian faith
is not such, whose end cannot be found, so that we shoulde haue
néede alwayes to séeke. And this is confirmed by the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list
S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who sayth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christ did many things which were
not written, for if they shoulde haue beene orderly written, the
world could not containe them. But he addeth, <hi>These thinges
are written that ye might beleeue that Iesus is Christ the
sonne of God, and that so beleeuing yee might haue lyfe
through his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And héerein wée sée commonly the most blinde, the most
bolde: the more ignorant, the more busie: and the least wittie,
to be most inquisitiue. With such kinde of men Saint <hi>Basil</hi>
was also troubled in his time, who beeing in godly conference
with the Emperour <hi>Valens</hi> about pointes of religion, one <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes,</hi>
which was the Emperours cooke, rudely woulde
interrupt him, and peruert places of Scripture according to his
fantasie and purpose: whose presumption, Saint <hi>Basil</hi> béeing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18665:11"/>
no longer able to beare, hee méekely reproued him with these
wordes,<note place="margin">Histor. tripart. lib. 7. cap. 36.</note> 
               <hi>Tuum est de pulmentariis cogitare, non dogmata diuina
decoquere.</hi> It belongeth to thy office to make pottage, and not
to make a hotchpot of Scripture. The heathen misliked that
the shoomaker should censure aboue the shooe: and woulde that
Carpenters onely should (because they best coulde) deale with
buildings. <hi>Tractant fabrilia, fabri, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He therefore is a good and true Christian, which loueth the
simple truth of God, stayeth himself in true religion, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
firme and stable in the faith, what nouelties so euer anie
one or a few light heads shall deuise in corners, knowing that
they doe not appertaine vnto religion, but rather vnto tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
the which also the Apostle confirmeth, saying: <hi>There
must bee sectes, that the perfect among you may bee
knowen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And obserue it who that list, at the first budding forth of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
noueltie, the grauitie and steadfastnes of the wheate, and the
lightnes of the chaffe is by and by discerned.<note place="margin">Inconstancie.</note> For the chaffe is
carried hether and thether with euerie vaine blast of erronious
doctrine. One while through rash presumption, they approue
and allow those things which séeme vncertain, &amp; another while
they stand in doubt through a feare without reason of those
things which are certayn: vncertayne they are which way to
take, or which way to returne, what to take holde of, or what
to let passe. Thus being out of the safe hauen of truth, they are
tossed with the waues of diuers cogitations, and so are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to pull downe their sayles of pride, which before they had
spread abrode through the blasts of nouelties. Which when I
consider with my selfe, I cannot meruayle enough at so greate
madnes, and so great a desire that some men haue to erre, that
not being contented with good and profitable rules of most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Ecclesiasticall gouernment, doe still from day to day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
and séeke after new and strange plats to fit theyr fansies,
and doe euer in the store house of theyr vayne conceites, finde
some thing to adde, to change, and to pull from religion, as if
it were not a diuine and heauenly thing, which sufficeth not to
be once well established, but an earthly institution, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
otherwise be made perfect, but by a continuall and daylie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18665:11"/>
reformation, or rather reprehension. Whereas the wise man

               <hi>Goe not from the doctrine of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

thou shalt learne vnderstanding.</hi> And the Apostle after the

from a propheticall and most charitable spirite, foreséeing &amp; sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing

is committed vnto thée: and let that onely be deliuered by thée:
Thou hast receiued gold, deliuer gold again. I would not haue
thée chop and change deceitfully, and as one deuoide of shame,
craftily to tender copper in stead of golde: but pure and perfect
golde, such as thou hast receiued. <hi>O Tymothe,</hi> O most reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Doctor and teacher, as God hath furnished thée with good

may be resplendant and beautifull: let it be plainly vnderstoode
by thy exposition, which afore time was obscurely beléeued: let
this latter time be thankfull to thée for the vnderstanding of it,
which the former ages haue reuerenced, not vnderstoode: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

so teach those things which thou hast learned, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
when thou speakest them newly, thou speakest not nouelties.</p>
            <p>But some man will saie, do ye then mislike that there should
be anie profiting and good procéeding in religion? No verilie, it
is most to be desired. And who is he so enuious vnto men, and so
abhominable vnto God, which goeth about to forbid this? But
yet there must be great care had, that it be a procéeding in déed,
and not rather a backsliding, an innouation &amp; alteration from
good to euill.</p>
            <p>It is a profiting and a good proceeding, when a thing is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified
and enlarged in it selfe: and it is an alteration or innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when one thing is transposed into another.</p>
            <p>The vnderstanding, knowledge and wisedome, as well of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
one as of all men, as well of one man, as of the whole
Church, must of necessitie grow &amp; greatly profit by the degrées
of ages &amp; times: but yet onely in one kind, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is to saie, in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
in one sense, and in one and the selfe same opinion.</p>
            <p>The religion of mens soules may be resembled vnto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> course
and order of their bodies, which albeit they growe to their full
stature and bignesse,<note place="margin">Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to mens bodies.</note> by processe of time and yeres, yet they are
the verie same still that they were before. There is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene the blossome of youth, and the ripenes of age,
and yet olde men are the verie same that they were when they
were yong: insomuch, that although the stature, apparell, and
forme of the man be altered, yet the nature abideth all one, and
the person is the same. Small are the members of sucking
babes, greater when they be yong men, yet all one &amp; the same.
The child hath as many sinewes, vaines, an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bones as the olde
man, and looke what the more ripe age hath, the same did the
séede of infancie bring forth: so that olde men haue nothing new
in them, which afore time laie not hid in children. There is no
doubt then, but that this is the most true rule of profiting, the
sure and comely order of growing, when age alwaies discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
those partes and formes in the greater, which the wisdome
of the creator made before in the smaller. But if the forme of
man be turned afterward into any other similitude and likenes
then of his owne kinde: or if he haue anie more or fewer mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
then he should, the bodie then must néedes either decay, or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18665:12"/>
els become monstrous. In like sorte Christian religion must
follow these lineaments of profiting, to wit, in yeres it must bée
made sound and perfect, in time extended and inlarged, &amp; in time
extolled and aduanced, and yet so, that it abide vncorrupted and
pure, full and perfect in all the proper members and sences ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
because it will not suffer alteration, or innouation, no losse
of propertie, nor anie varietie of definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for example, Our
forefathers of olde time, I meane in time of the Primitiue
Church did sowe in this ecclesiasticall sowing the séedes of pure
faith. It were now vnfit that we their posteritie, in sted of the
true and pure grain, should choose the deceitfull errors of tares:
but this rather is more méete and agréeing, that the first &amp; the
last, not disagréeing with themselues, wée reape the fruite from
the increase of pure instruction, and also of pure religion: that
when the first sproutes of those séedes by processe of time begin
to appeare, and is now prosperous and garnished, yet nothing
of the propertie of the naturall séede is altered. And although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
forme, difference and distinction be added, yet the same
nature of kinde remaineth. For God forbidde that the rosarie
plant of true religion, should be turned into briers and thornes.
Yea God forbid that in this spirituall Paradise, the swéete Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namom
and fragrant Balsamus trees, should yield forth foden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and vnlooked for deadlie poison. Therefore whatsoeuer hath
bene sowen in this church, which is Gods husbandrie, hath bin
sowen by the faithfull and painfull labours of their fathers: the
same ought now to be trimmed and garnished by the industrie
of the children and posteritie: the same must flourish and waxe
ripe: the same must profite and be profited. For it is meet that
those ancient decrees of heauenlie Philosophie, shoulde by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of time be adorned, beautified and polished: but vnm<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et to
be changed,<note place="margin">Innouation a dangerous euill.</note> abridged or maimed. They may receiue cleerenes,
light and distinction, and yet retaine fulnesse, integrity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie.
If this wicked libertie to chop and change, to alter, to
innouate, to set vp and pull downe, according to euerie fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
deuice, be granted, I feare to thinke, and quake to speak, in
what danger religion shall be to be defaced and quite abolished.
The which one done but in part, we shall haue euerie yere, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
moneth, nay euerie daie a new religion. For the parts by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18665:13"/>
little and little being reiected, what will followe at the last, but
that the whole also shall be banished. And if nouelties may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
auncient godly rules, if prophane men may deface goldie
Fathers, which stand as pillers in the Church, it wil at the last
come to this, that nothing in the Church shall bee leste vntou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
nothing sound, nothing free: whereby in the end, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which
was afore time the closet of a chast, pure, and vncorrupt truth,
shall become a filthie sinke of abhominable errours, and a soule
cage of vncleane birdes. But God for his mercie furne this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
far from the mindes of his chosen, and let this bee rather
the furie and madnesse of the wicked.</p>
            <p>The Church of Christ being a vigilant and wary keeper of
the doctrine committed to her, doth not change, diminish nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
anie thing at anie time concerning the same. It cutteth not
off necessarie matter: it doth not adde superfluous thinges: it
looseth not that which belongeth to her: it vsurpeth not forain
and prophane things: but withall endeuour she seeketh this,
that making much, and embracing the most ancient rules and
precepts, faithfullie and wiselie the may further &amp; aduance that
which at the first was but begun, she may ratifie and establish
things expressed and manifested, &amp; may constantly keepe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
was before confirmed and determined.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the wordes of the Apostle, <hi>O Tymothe,</hi>
(saith he) <hi>keepe that which is committed vnto thee, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
prophane and vaine bablings</hi> Shunne (saith he) such

first preached by him, then by Saint Peter, Saint Paul,
and the rest of the Apostles, and which hath so remained from
age to age by the incorrupt tradition of truth, and shall also so

him not to house, neither bid him God speed: for he that
biddeth him God speed is partaker of his euill. Auoide</hi>
(saith Saint Paul) <hi>prophane and vaine bablings.</hi> And what
is that? Truelie such speeches and writings as sauour nothing

ouerflowe with euill speeches, braulings, nips and tants: yea, and
that against magistrates, and such as are in chiefe authoritie. Are

long since, who seeing it impossible to induce the people to
their heresie, while the good Bishops were had in reputation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised

Of these weaklings <hi>Chrisostome</hi> speaketh thus: <hi>Venit
gentilis et dicit, velim fieri Christianus, sed nescie cui adherem, &amp;c.</hi>
The Gentile commeth and sayth, I woulde faine bee a Christian,

whom we should auoide, meaning the Papists, but whome to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

at this day, through the diuersitie of opinions, that weaklings
are greatly dismaied. Yet this excuse in the day of iudgement, will
not make weaklings (whome Paul secludeth out of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)
faultlesse: &amp; at the end of theyr life, except they conuert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnto Christ, and yéeld themselues wholy vnto him, they can

            <p>Other some also saie (and most truely) that God is the God of
peace and concord, and not of strife: but these Preachers (say they)
are at dissention among themselues, and therfore God is not with
them. But this might haue bene obiected against the Churches in
all ages. For among the Iewes were sects, as the Saduces, the
Pharesies, the Essers and the Stoikes. Among the Schoole men
were Scotists, Tomists, and Occamists. Among the seuen Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons

            <p>Yea, this might haue bene obiected against the Primitiue and

            <p>These markes being so euident, you cannot be seuered from the

most perillous.<note place="margin">Ecclesiast. hist. lib. 6. cap. 37</note> The famous Bishoppe <hi>Dionysius,</hi> as witnesseth
<hi>Eusebius,</hi> saith y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> to suffer martyrdome for the auoiding of schisme,
is more commendable, then for the auoiding of idolatrie, because in
the one is the safetie of our soules, in the other is the saluation of
the whole Church. The place is pregnant. And Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
proueth, that schisme offended God more then idolatrie, because it
was more grieuously punished, as in <hi>Chore, Dathan</hi> &amp; <hi>Abiram,</hi>
who were schismatiques, then in <hi>Aaron:</hi> and them that worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the golden calfe, who were idolaters. The greater punishment
most commonly is a token of the greater sinne. Also the danger is
greater which groweth by conuersing with schismatiques and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques,
then with Painims &amp; idolaters, which Augustine noteth
verie well in these words (handling the Psal. 54.) <hi>Ab his qui longe

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:18665:16"/>It is a most dangerous thing to be separated by anie occasion
from the true Church, the which (God be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked) may be so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
séene at this day in this realme of <hi>England,</hi> that no man can
doubt of it. And yet very many haue bin carried awaie from the
same through the blasts of false doctrine: and some without anie
cause haue too too rashly diuorced themselues, what color of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
so euer they haue pretended. The Corinthians were very
much diuided among themselues: one woulde be of <hi>Paul,</hi> another
of <hi>Cephas,</hi> another of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and so they attributed as much to
theyr Ministers as vnto Christ. They brought their strifes and
contentions to the iudgement seate of Ethnikes: they suffered an
incestuous man, who had the wife of his Father, to be conuersant
among them: they thought not whooredome to be sinne: they did
euery where eate with the Painims, of things offered vnto idols:
they celebrated the supper of the Lord with vnquietnes of minde:
they abused the gift of tongues: neither did they iudge trulie and
godlie of the resurrection. These were no doubt grieuous blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
yet notwithstanding Paul did not forsake the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.
Neuertheles some men can (as they thinke) with a safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
condemne this our most Christian Church, both by spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and writing against it, and also by cutting off themselues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the same, gathering themselues together into corners and in secret
conuenticles, as the Family of Loue, the Brownists, the Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
and others like vnto them.</p>
            <p>Such were in olde time theyr predecessors the Donatists, who
in comparison of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues condemned all other Christians. They
released theyr owne crue from the seueritie of the censure, and yet
in theyr congregation suffered most impure men, namely the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatians,
the Gildonians, and the Primians.</p>
            <p>Be not ye like vnto those men? abstain from theyr companies,
refraine theyr assemblies, frequent not theyr sermons, reade not
theyr libels, defend not theyr opinions, but rather detest them. By
reading hereticall bookes,<note place="margin">Eus. Eccle. hist. lib. 7. cap. 6</note> many learned men haue yéelded to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and may not ignorant men much sooner? <hi>Dionysius Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi>
a most learned and vertuous Bishop, confesseth to a friend
of his, that he felt himself much the worse by reading of euil bookes.
If ye shall presume vpon your constancie &amp; knowledge, that there
can insue no danger, <hi>Qui stat, videat ne cadat,</hi> Let him that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,

            <p>The Epharamites were of the people of God, and yet reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
awaie from the lawe, though still they held (after a sorte) the
profession thereof: and hauing so done, they so continued a long

al the warnings that God by his Prophets did giue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
But yet it is recorded of them, that at the length they returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18665:17"/>
smiting vpon the thigh, and acknowledging that they had
committed many shameful things. If now with Ephraim ye haue
so erred and stept aside, pittie it were but that ye should be as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with him to repent and returne againe. Remember what S.
Paul writeth to the Ephesians, <hi>Be ye careful to keep the vnitie

of all the members of the Church. This vnitie we must by no

that we should liue in vnitie: For if we fast (saith he) the deuill sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

he neuer sleepeth: if we praie, he regardeth it not, because he
neuer praieth: but that we should be in vnitie, it displeaseth him:
because we being men, and on the earth, should doe that which hée
could not doe, being an Angell in heauen. Wee knowe it now by
experience, that <hi>Fratrum odia acerbissima,</hi> and that <hi>inimici homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis

that a mans enemies shall be they of his owne housholde. The
Church of God neuer receiued more detriment by the tyrannie of

that the earthly Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Psal. 122. 3.</note> is builded as a citie that is at

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18665:18"/>
with one accord in praier: and the multitude of them that
beléeued, were of one heart and of one soule. If ye wil abide in this

vpon men.<note place="margin">Act. 4. 32</note> For through inconstancy the peace of the church,
which is the bond of vnitie, is many times broken, when as our
affections and likings of men is such, that therafter as ye loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
so ye like their doctrine. For ye regard the messenger, and not his
message: ye looke vpon the earthen vessell, and not vpon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
treasure therein contained. And hereof it commeth to passe,
that ye doe contemne and despise, not onely wholsome doctrine, but
also the minister and preacher thereof: and then commeth such a
nicenes and choice liking of some, that at the last followeth also an
vtter loathing of others, whom before ye greatly liked.</p>
            <p>Thus hath the common multitude alwayes behaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues
towards the ministers of the Gospell.<note place="margin">Inconstancie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude</note> Yea thus was our sauiour
Christ himselfe handled among the Iewes:<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 14. 15</note> who one while would
néeds make him a king,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. 1</note> and anon after was ready to kill him: one
while they called him <hi>Rabbi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn, 6. 60</note> and another while a Samaritan,
saying that he had the deuill: they which once loued his doctrine,
sayd afterward, this is a hard saying. And as Christ himselfe: so
also were Apostles rewarded at their auditors hands: and no
meruaile,<note place="margin">Luke. 6. 40</note> for the disciple is not aboue his master. It is inough for
the disciple,<note place="margin">Luke. 3. 15 and verse 20</note> if he be as his master is. Therefore Iohn the Baptist
had such estimation for a while, when he first began to preach the
Gospell,<note place="margin">Math. 14. 10</note> that he was taken of most men for the Messiah: yet stood
he not long before he lost his head.<note place="margin">Act 14. 11 and verse 15.</note> When <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi> had
wrought that notable myracle vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lame man, the people were
blindly carried with such inconsiderate zeale, that in all hast they
would haue done sacrifice vnto them as vnto God: but in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
this hot zeale was so cold towards Saint Paul, that they
stoned him almost for dead. The same Apostle was of the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
also reputed for an Angell of God,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 14 and vers. 15. 16</note> insomuch, that if it had
bin possible, they would haue pluckt out their owne eies for him to
do him good, but afterward they tooke him for no better then their
enemie. And why? Forsooth because hee preached vnto them the
truth. Consider and sée, if the verie like inconstancie, and far worse
if worse may be, hath not bin among you. In the beginning of her
Maiesties most happie raigne, you had those learned and graue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in great estimation, which during the time of Quéene <hi>Mary</hi>
suffered exile for the testimony of the gospel, some in Geneua, some
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18665:18"/>
in Frankford, and some other in other partes of Germanie: and
at their first returne to the Church of Englande, beeing placed by
her Maiestie in the roomes of greatest charge in the Church, as
tried and approued men that had borne the whole heate and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of the daie, ye estéemed of them worthily, ye were very glad
to sée and heare them, ye embraced theyr most wholsome doctrine,
and so ye begun to runne wel in a good course, but ye persisted not,
ye were soone wearie of your olde men, and yee must needes haue
new: and I feare me that this propheticall saying of the Apostle,
is verified vpon many of you, The time will come, when they wil
not suffer wholsome doctrine, but hauing their eares itching, shall
after theyr own lusts get them a heape of teachers,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 3</note> and shall turne
theyr eares from the truth,<note place="margin">Gal 1. 6</note> and shall be giuen vnto fables.</p>
            <p>Be not carried about with euery winde,<note place="margin">Eccle. 5 9</note> and goe not into eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way: for (so sayth the wise man) doth the sinner that hath a
double tongue. Such double walking, and such dissembling tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
will at the last, and that ere it be long, cause greater diuision
and contention among you, to the wofull ruine of vs all, if it be not
amended betimes. And if we goe forwarde in discorde and bitter
contentions, as we haue hetherto done, it is greatly to be feared,
least GOD haue appointed and ordayned that same agaynst vs,
which in time past he did in the raignes of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi>
the Emperors, when as there were like strifes and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Church: as notably appeareth in the Ecclesiasticall
historie written by <hi>Eusebius:</hi> the effect of which history is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to be marked for this cause, to wit, for that in those daies the
Church of Christ flourished. But the people were vnthankful vnto
God, and impenitent, and the ministers of the Church were ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and stirred vp grieuous and hot contentions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Wherefore God being angry with them, gaue them into
the hands of tyrants, who raised vp greater persecutions agaynst
the Church then euer was heard of before. For thus writeth Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius.</p>
            <p>But when we were not touched with anie of these things, nor
went about to reconcile our selues vnto God, but as godles men,
supposed that God neither cared for, nor yet would visit our wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse,
but heaped sinne vpon sinne. And those which tooke vpon
them to be our patrones, shaking off and casting from them the
rule of godlynes, were kindled with hatred one agaynst another: &amp;
whilest they gaue themselues onely hereunto, to wit, to threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18665:19"/>
pride, mallice and hatred, euery one gréedely, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a certain tyrannie followed their owne ambition. Then the
Lord, euen then I say, made the daughter of Sion obscure &amp; dark,
according to the prophesie of <hi>Ieremie.</hi> For hee lifted vp the right
hand of her enemies, turned from her his sword of defence, &amp; was
not her helpe in the day of battell, but ceased from purifieng her, &amp;
threw her throne vnto the ground, and shortned her daies; aboue
all this he poured out confusion and shame vppon her. All these
things are fulfilled amongst vs, whilest we sée the places appointed
to praier, to be raced from the top to the very foundations, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
and holy Scriptures to be burned in the middest of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
places, and the Ministers of the Church with horrible confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to run here and there to hide themselues, and some were taken
and put to open shame by theyr aduersaries: and according to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prophesie, Contempt was poured out euen vpon their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus farre <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who after through his whole booke fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
describeth the martyrdomes, calamities &amp; afflictions which
the faithful in that most cruel persecution suffered. Wherfore God
is most earnestly &amp; diligently to be praied vnto, that he wil vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to giue vs his grace, repentance, and mutuall concord: least for
our leude liues, ingratitude and contentions, he deale with vs as
he hath done with those fathers before vs, &amp; so deliuer vs into the
cruell and bloudy hands of the Turkes, and others the enemies of
Christianitie. God in his mercie turne this euill from vs.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, all godly and Christian Princes and Magistrates, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their calling committed to them by GOD,<note place="margin">An exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to magistrats.</note> ought dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to take héed hereunto, and with al their might and wisdome
helpe, that the people of this Realme may altogether forsake those
vnprofitable and troublesome contentions, and cease to braule and
quarrell with their brethren and fellow-seruants: and that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
may fruitfully with great modestie &amp; grauitie, preach vnto
the congregation repentance &amp; amendement of life, and true faith
in Christ.</p>
            <p>It is written of king <hi>Iosophat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Chron. 17</note> that he sent certaine Princes &amp;
Leuites, and giuing vnto them the booke of the lawe of the Lorde,
commanded that they should teach true faith, and the sincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of God. The like did the most holy kings <hi>Ezechias</hi> and
<hi>Iosias,</hi> who religiously depriued from their offices, all those which
walked not rightly in the way of the Lord, and did not according
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18665:19"/>
to the law of God. <hi>Constantinus</hi> the great, followed the example
of those most holy kings, &amp; performed the like in his Empire. For
when the Prelates in his time were at variance and contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselues, and writ and preached one against another, and
were so bold to offer those contentious libels vnto the Emperour
himselfe, to the end that they might contend before him: he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
al theyr bookes, sharply reproued them, inasmuch as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the prouidence of God appointed vnto the people for pastors
and captaines of concord and charitie, were so at variance among
themselues. Neither would heee giue any iudgement as touching
theyr controuersies, or yet reade their libels which they deliuered
vnto him, but cast them into the fire: as he also commanded vpon
paine of death,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Martian</hi> and <hi>Iustinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> mad careful lawe to the lame purpose.</note> that no man should reade<note place="margin">Reade</note> the bookes of <hi>Arrius,</hi> but
burne them at the first hand: that at the least they might thereby
learne that those contentions and braules displeased his maiestie:
and so setting discord apart, might afterwarde giue themselues to
peace and concord. In like manner when he sate with the Bishops
at the Counsell of Nice,<note place="margin">Zozomenes li. 1. cap. 20 <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

were, he laying forth the bookes of the Prophets and Apostles, to
wit, the holy Bible, commanded them to decide and end theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies
by them, and all of them with one consent, to preach one
and the selfe same faith.</p>
            <p>This excellent example of the worthie Emperor <hi>Constantine,</hi>
whom God in this world honored with the title of Great, whose
name and glory through the whole world was famous &amp; of greate
renowme among all men, and is much more excellent in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
felicitie. This example I say, let all Princes and magistrates
of this age follow, touching the staying and suppressing of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies
among the prrofessors of the Gospell, that thereby they
may prouide for the peace and publike health of the Church.</p>
            <p>Peace is that new yéeres gift, which Christ gaue vnto vs at his

wounds of our sauiour and redéemer Iesus Christ, that none doe
increase olde faults by new offences, but rather that euery man in
sinceritie and holy obedience, reforme his owne waies, &amp; conforme

of our hearts with the florishing branches of a godly life, mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Let vs beare the sailes of our conuersations euen with the winde
