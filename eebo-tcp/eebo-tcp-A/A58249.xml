         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO A PAMPHLET INTITULED, <hi>A Vindication of Sir</hi> Tho. Player, <hi>and thoſe Loyal Citizens concerned with him.</hi> In Defence of A REPLY TO A SPEECH made by Sir <hi>Tho. Player.</hi>
            </head>
            <byline>By <hi>H. B.</hi> Citizen of <hi>London.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>THe ſaid <hi>H. B.</hi> for further Anſwer taken to the Exceptions in the ſaid Vindication, anſwers and ſays, That the ſaid Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> might as reaſonably have taken <hi>H. B.</hi> for a Jew, as a Prieſt or Papiſt, there being nothing in his Anſwer, from which any ſuch Concluſion can be drawn from the Premiſſes. But it's obſervable, that any perſon that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts the King's Legal Prerogative, and the eſtabliſhed Religion, muſt be a Papiſt, without any contradiction whatever. And I muſt alſo obſerve, That the detecting and ſuppreſſing the Popiſh Plot, (in the opinion of the Phanaticks) cannot be effected by the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65093:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 7 -->
without their aſſiſtance, (whether requir'd or not.) But the Water being diſturb'd, they put in their Hooks, Baits and Nets, to try whether they can catch the Fiſh, (that is to ſay, the Government.) And 'tis obſervable, that there is a Sect of men, whoſe Ambition, Jenkiſme, Faction, or pretended blinde Zeal, will never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the beſt of Governments, which ours is, under a qualified Monarchy, unleſs they themſelves be at Helm ſteering.</p>
            <p>Surely this Vindicator cannot have ſo little Logick, as to ſuppoſe it was ever underſtood, that Parliaments or Courts of Judicature could ever be intended as Routs and unlawful Aſſemblies: He would make Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up his men like theſe; which not being according to Law, I affirm, may be reaſonably accounted ſo. But to make it not ſo, Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> had two deſigns in it; one, to ſhew his Attendants whom he would have to vouch Jealouſies and Fears for him: the other, to vote for Mr. <hi>J.</hi> to be a Pentioner-Sheriff, ſo as with that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to make his Factious Party the ſtronger. But the true Loyal Citizens, not ſo in title, as you title your ſelves, were the greater number.</p>
            <p>I expected to have met with Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> at the Meeting of the Lieutenancy, on the 18th of this Month, with half a ſcore of his <hi>Men of Senſe</hi>; but becauſe he was prohibited from bringing great numbers with him, he thought fit to wave it: Or elſe Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> and thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were ſo employed in writing a Vindication for thoſe Loyal Citizeus, that they could not ſpare time: It being better to rail at a Church of <hi>England</hi> man, by calling him Sawcy Jeſuit, and more ill Names than are yet invented at <hi>Billinſgate,</hi> than to be rendred Idle and Officious.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh that his Club would conſider Law, as well as Faction, and they might ſquare their actions more diſcreetly. For how impudently doth this Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator affirm, that the City of <hi>London</hi> is not altogether
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65093:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 7 -->
tyed up by thoſe Acts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the City have the command of their Militia? and inſtances, That Burgers of all Cities in the world have the command of them. This is denied, for that there are no Cities, unleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Commonwealths (which we are not under the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of yet) have that command. But if it had been ſo, what is that to our Law eſtabliſhed? Where by all the Acts, the Militia is declared to be abſolutely in the Power of the; King. And I am ſure no perſon durſt have ſaid the contrary, but one that would favour Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, ſo ſoon as an opportunity offers it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I muſt make bold once more to aſſert, that the keeping up the Guards of the City is a vaſt expence to the poor of the City, and tends much to the impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of them. But our Vindicator ſays, <hi>Volenti non fit injuria,</hi> not conſidering it's againſt Law. But if he conſidered the uſe of them, he might finde them uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and againſt Reaſon too. But the <hi>Patriot,</hi> as he terms him, could once affirm, That the King having Guards for his perſon, was againſt Law. Let any man therefore judge of the Vindicator's Principles, <hi>Ex pede Herculent</hi>: Not forgetting <hi>The good old Cauſe.</hi> It's commendable in Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> to cloak the old grudge ſo, to place his Revenge under a cloak of Publick Safety, and for the good of the City.</p>
            <p>I muſt declare, it's ſome reflection upon the City, to have made choice of Factious Perſons to be our principal Officers in the City, and to place them in the Publique Offices. But it ſo hapned, it might not appear ſo to us then: But upon diſcovery, the City is ready enough to ſet ſuch perſons aſide. Neither do I know how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the matter, for one that's Chamberlain of <hi>London</hi> to be a Parliament-man, becauſe of the unlimitedneſs of that Priviledge; which, if made uſe of, may tend to the ruine of many Orphans and other perſons, that are forced to give credit to this Publick Truſt. <hi>Abundans Cautela non nocet.</hi> Without that there is any matter or
