            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to our great grief &amp; diſpleaſure. Wherin our principal hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance hath not proceeded ſo much of the induſtry and force of the followers and defenders of the ſaid new opinion, as of others, who ſhrowding themſelues vnder a falſe prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of zeale to the ſaid Catholique Religion, haue a long time ſought to ſeduce the moſt part of our Catholique Subiects by falſe perſwaſions, and practiſed a League and ſecret aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation among themſelues: whereof they were the chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, vnder colour of aſſuring after vs (if God ſhould call vs out of this world without iſſue) the preſeruation of the ſaid Catholique religion, againſt ſuch of the new opinion as might pretend to ſuccéede vs in this Crowne.</p>
                  <p>But their end and purpoſe tending to the vſurpation and parting of the ſame among themſelues, after they had made them a partie among our ſaid Catholique ſubiects, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derpropped them ſelues by intelligences with ſtrangers, who might ſeeke the weakening of this Realme, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their authoritie and greatneſſe. They haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played againſt our perſon &amp; authoritie, the ſecrets of their damnable driftes: Firſt by backbiting and miſreporting our actions, to bring them into hatred with our people, and to drawe their affections to themſelues vnder a plauſible hope which they ioyned with the pretence of religion, <hi>viz.</hi> to eaſe them of the charges, which the troubles of the time had brought vpon them: yet neuertheleſſe their behauiours in places vnder their commaund, were no fauourable wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of their promiſes in that behalfe.

their procéedings. And in caſe the firſt aſſayes of their ſaid armies were pernitious to this ſtate, the ſequele is yet more hurtfull and daungerous, hauing by their ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties newly repleniſhed France with trouble and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall ciuill warre, ſeditions, contempt of magiſtrates, bloud, pillage, ranſomings, ſacke of goods both ſacred and profane, forcing of women and maidens, and infinite other kinds of inhumanities and diſorders, ſuch as the like was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſéene or heard of, &amp; all to the great preiudice not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our auctoritie and royall perſon (againſt whom they haue openly declared themſelues, not being aſhamed to publiſh that they ſought after our very life) but alſo of this floriſhing Crowne in generall, which they purpoſe to ſhare and diſmember among themſelues, with the aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrangers to the great diſhonour and obloquie of the French name, but ſpecially of the nobilitie in old time of ſuch fame and eſtimation through out the whole world for their vertue, proweſſe and ſingular loue &amp; fidelitie to their Kings: yea and which is worſe, to the great detriment of the Catholike, Apoſtolike: Romane religion. For beſides that ciuil warre corrupteth good maners, &amp; alienateth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s harts no leſſe from all piety and reuerence to the honour of God, then from all humaine charitie: this diuiſion is the very meanes for thoſe of the contrarie opinion to enlarge and ncreaſe their conqueſts. The which neuertheleſſe we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to preuent to our power, and endeuoring to reduce all things into a good order, whereto through Gods grace we had brought them, and where from wée were diuerted through theſe preſent troubles, wée haue yet ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſought al meanes to vs poſſible by cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie to reduce all our Catholike ſubiects to a good &amp; firme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union vnder our obedience, and by the meanes of the ſame to put in execution that which, at their inſtant requeſt we promi-ſed in the aſſembly of our Eſtates.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit ſo farre was the hardneſſe of their hartes from being mollified or bent to any compaſſion of ſo many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4140:4"/>
which they haue cauſed, as not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders paſſed, no not with the raiſing of moſt of our townes againſt vs, the ſlaying, impriſoning or depoſing of our offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, the ranſoming of the wealthieſt of ourrealme of what degrée, ſtate, qualitie, kind, condition or age ſoeuer, yea euen the Clergie, the breaking of our ſeales, defacing of our armes, renting and ſhamefull handling of our pictures, the eſtabliſhing of Counſels and officers at their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies, the ſpoiling of our treaſury, with all other actes of contempt, deriſion, hoſtility and cruelty: but alſo heaping iniury vpon iniury, they prepared to come and aſſaile our own perſon with artillery taken out of our ſtorehouſes, and armies compoſed as well of our ſaid rebellious ſubiects as of ſtrangers in part contrary to the Catholike, Apoſtolike, and Roman religion, whereof they neuertheleſſe proclaime themſelues the onely protectors, to the ende togither with our ſelues to oppreſſe all our good Catholike ſubiects and ſeruaunts, in ſtéed of addreſſing themſelues againſt thoſe of the contrary opinion whom they ſuffer in peace and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſtretch as farre as they liſt, as indéed they haue not ouerſlipped the occaſion. For the king of Nauarre while we were preparing and furniſhing our ſelues of forces for our warrantize againſt the bad intents of the ſaid rebels, tooke and ſeazed vpon our townes of Niort, S. Maixant, Maillezais, Chaſtelleraut, Lodune, Liſle Bouchart, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treuilbelay, Argenton, and Blanc in Berry, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced his forces néere to this towne, whither we were come vpon the firſt day of his ſaid exploits, to the ende to take what order we could for the ſtopping of him from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding any farther. Thus in the end knowing our ſelues vnable to performe with our weapons, at ſuch time as we were vpon neceſſitie to employ them in the preſeruation and defence of our owne perſon, together withour ſaid good ſubiects and ſeruants againſt the rage and violence of the ſaid rebels whom we found inflexible to any conditions of reconciliation, vpon ſuch motions as we had cauſed to be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4140:4"/>
made vnto them: and againe conſidering that albeit our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues did know that he ſought not, as they, to aſſault our life and authoritie, yet our ſaid good ſubiects might neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe be greatly moleſted by his weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in caſe we tooke not from him all occaſion to employ them according as the preſent eſtate of the affaires of this Realme did miniſter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie: and on the otherſide being vrged &amp; preſſed by the cries and complaints of our prouinces, moleſted by his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, to prouide ſome remedy, and that rather by ſome ſurceaſe of hoſtility then otherwiſe, without the which their force failing for to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, togither with the meanes to entertaine men of warre, all hope of ability to ſuſtaine their liues &amp; families was taken from them, and ſome of them conſtrained through the violence of the euill, had of themſelues compounded already. All theſe ſaid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by vs brought into deliberation with the princes of our bloud, the officers of our Crowne and others of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile about vs, among theſe extremities we could find no other meanes then to take and yéeld to our ſaid ſubiects ſome releaſe from warres on the behalfe of the ſayd King of Nauarre. And therefore to the ſame effect wée haue graunted to him for himſelfe and all his partakers a Truce and abſtinence of warre and of all hoſtilitie, according to his requeſt vnto vs made in acknowledgement of his duetie toward vs, and being moued with compaſſion for the miſeries whereunto this realme is now brought, which moueth all ſuch as yet retaine the feeling of good French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to helpe to quench the fire of diuiſion that conſumeth it and ſtill threatneth the vtter ruine thereof, wherefro we neuertheleſſe hope that God of his goodneſſe will yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue vs to his glory againſt the driftes and endeuours of thoſe who for their priuate ambition do deſire and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the diſſipation thereof: which Truce and abſtinence from armes we meane ſhalbe generall throughout our Realme for the ſpace of one whole yeare, beginning the third of this preſent moneth and ending at the like day

And that whereſoeuer he ſhall paſſe or ſoiourne, except in thoſe places which he held before the day aforeſaid, he ſhall not change or permit any change or alteration in matter concerning the Catholicke Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke and Romane Religion, neither that any harme or moleſtation be offered to our Catholicke ſubiects, Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or others that abide faithfull vnto vs or are good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, either in their perſons, goods or otherwiſe howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: that if during this warre he or his do take any townes, caſtles, or other places by force, ſurpriſe or intelligence, either do enter in what ſorte ſoeuer, he ſhall immediatly leaue &amp; permit them to be in our frée diſpoſition, according as he hath promiſed vs. That in reſpect of the premiſſes the ſaid king of Nauarre and his partakers ſhall haue the benefite of their goods, and the ſame to enioy ſo long as the ſaid Truce ſhall continue: As alſo interchangeably they ſhall permit the Catholicks both Clergie men &amp; others our good ſeruaunts to enioy their goods and reuenewes in thoſe places that they do hold.</p>
                  <p>We farther will &amp; command you, that euery one of you ſo farre as it may concerne him, to obſerue and procure the obſeruing of the ſaid Truce and abſtinence of armes with all the contents aboue mentioned from point to point, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Enrie</hi> by the grace of God, King of Nauarre, firſt Prince of the bloud, chiefe Péere, and protector of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed churches of Fraunce, &amp;c. To all Gouernors of Prouinces, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of townes &amp; cities, fortreſſes and caſtles, Chieftaines and leaders of men of warre, Maiors, Conſuls, and ſworne men of townes, Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and officers, as well of our ſoueraigne Lord the king, as to all others to whom it may appertaine, &amp; that are vnder our authoritie and protection, Gréeting. Whereas it is wel knowen to all men that we neuer tooke or retayned armes in this miſerable warre, but ſo farre as neceſſitie enforced vs: Alſo, that we haue by our actions ſufficiently teſtified our extreame ſorow, ſéeing our ſelues entangled, and bound thereto through the malice of the enemies of this Realme. On the other ſide, the deſire that we had to be able to ſerue his Maieſtie againſt them for the reeſtabliſhing of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and the reſt and tranquilitie of his good Subiectes: yet ſuch was the miſchiefe, that our good meaning was by ſundrie ſleights diſguiſed, &amp; the bad mindes of the ſaid ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4140:7"/>
ſo farre cloaked vnder beautifull and fauourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, that this Realme was brought to the point of ineui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ruine, had not the wiſdome of our ſaid ſoueraign Lord the king, ſundrie times contraried and croſſed with infinite lets, bene ſufficient to diſcerne our innocencie from among their ſlaunders, he had not alſo euen through their coulors and diſſimulations eſpied their inueterate malice: And it is moſt euident that this warre begun vnder colour of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is euen at once found to be méere warre of eſtate: That thoſe of the League are not gone to ſéek or aſſaile thoſe of the religion which we profeſſe, but haue abuſed both the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and authoritie which were to that end deliuered vnto them, to get ſuch townes of this realme as were fartheſt of and leaſt ſuſpected for religion: as litle alſo haue they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their preachers in the conuerſion of thoſe whom they did pretend to be hereticks, but contrariwiſe they haue vſed them in all townes to the ſubuerſion of this realme, as fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandes to kindle the eſtate, to ſuborne the ſubiects againſt their prince, to make them reiect all obedience to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, to frame them to ſeditions and alterations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to confound all things both diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: whereby haue happened to the great griefe of all good men, an incredible reuolt throughout this nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſoueraigne Lord the king, and conſequently ſuch a confuſion in ſundry townes and prouinces that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſhadow of piety and iuſtice hath quite extinguiſhed the body, the feare of God, the reuerence of his true image, and the lawfull and ſoueraigne Magiſtrate by him inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in theſe extremities: wherevpon acknowledging our duetie vnto our ſaid ſoueraigne Lord the King, and euen from the bottome of our hart bewayling the calamitie of this eſtate and people, we haue withdrawen our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Maieſtie, and at his féete preſented him our liues and goods to aſſiſt him againſt his enimies, for the reeſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his authoritie and his good ſubiects. Proteſting, as before we had done, to intend to no other but his ſeruice: as

alſo euery man may iudge that if we had otherwiſe meant, we had fit occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to helpe our ſelues by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> publike miſeries: who did vs this honor to acknowledge vs &amp; willingly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of our good willes: alſo to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end to giue vs better means to ſerue him, he reſolued vpon a Truce or abſtinence of warre with all hoſtilitie, whereof we hope through Gods helpe, of a good peace to enſue. Therefore that wée giue you to wit, and to all and euery of you which acknowledge our authoritie and protection, and that haue and doe follow that part which we vphold, euery one for himſelfe, that we haue treated, decreed and concluded with our ſoueraigne Lord the King, vpon a truce or abſtinence generall from armes throughout this land for one whole yeare, to begin the third day of Aprill, and to end vpon the like day, as well the one as the other therein concluded. Wherein alſo our meaning is to compriſe the ſtate and Countie of Veniſe with the ſubiects thereof as being vnder the protection of our ſaid ſoueraigne Lord the King: &amp; ſo conſequently we doo forbid all perſons of whatſoeuer eſtate or calling, not to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt or enterpriſe againſt thoſe places where his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties authoritie is acknowledged, neither againſt the ſaid ſtate or Countie of Veniſe, or in any other place or places where we ſhall enter, paſſe by, or ſoiourne, expreſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that there be nothing enterprized againſt his good and loyal ſubiects, no not againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Clergie, neither to innouate or interrupt any thing concerning the Catholike Romane religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as alſo in caſe by Gods grace we enter whether by ſurprize, force or otherwiſe into any hold or towne occupied by the enimies, our meaning is there ſhall be no alteration in the ſeruice or other matter belonging to the ſaid Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Romane religion, according as more at large haue by vs béene concluded with our ſoueraigne Lord the King. Alſo whereas in conſequence of the premiſſes it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Maieſtie to graunt and yéeld a generall enioyment of their goods, &amp; to all thoſe of the religion which we do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and others of this partie, to enioy the ſame during this

                  <p>For this cauſe, wee being called of God, nature and lawe, to ſo neceſſary a worke, haue reſolued with our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to employ our liues, goods and abilities vpon the reſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the king our ſoueraigne Lordes authoritie, the reſtauration of this Realme, the preſeruation and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

(ſo farre as in vs may lye) of all the good ſubiects of the ſame againſt thoſe who ſo openly haue attempted againſt the perſon of his Maieſtie, and dared to enterpriſe the vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his Realme, and brought almoſt to the point of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitable ruine ſo many poore people, which God of his grace hath vnited &amp; preſerued in ſo many ages vnder the ſacred and inuiolable lawes of this Realme.</p>

The Magiſtrates, what théeuery is crept in at the gate of common weale, when in the chamber of the Péers of this Realme, where the greateſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reuerence to iuſtice, do leaue of their ſwords, an Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhall enter in armes accompanied with twentie raſcals &amp; cary his ſword to the throat of the Parliament of France, and in triumph lead it away in red robes to the Baſtille: when a chief Preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhalbe murthered, trailed about, and hanged at Tholouze (one that was a zelous follower of his Religion, if euer there were any, and the moſt formall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the contrary) by the conſpiracie of a Biſhop: and with what ſhew of hereſie?

and the ranſoming of good men that grone vnder theſe diſorders: A matter that can not continue many dayes, which expired, the communaltie being fleſhed in the ſpoyle of thoſe whom they terme Politicks, as wolues vpon carrion, and their booties failing them, wil cruelly &amp; without reſpect fall vpon all that be of any countenance. Let thoſe townes that haue taken their parte remember in what ſtate they were before, and in what they be now: The traffick (who ſo liſt to ſéeke it) in the midſt of a forreſt? Iuſtice, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dungeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Baſtill? Learning, where barbarouſneſſe poſſeſſeth all? yet be theſe the meanes that haue brought them to ſo great glorie and wealth: yea euen the meanes that onely could therein enterteine them: At this day it is hereſie to be a Politick: but the pollicie that had brought them to their flower is runne to contempt: Shortly it will be an vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable treſpaſſe to be ritch. Moreouer if they haue any gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon their libertie periſheth, and the lickerouſneſſe of this word hath made them loſe it: If they haue no garriſon, then are they a pray, oppreſſed with gardes and badly kept, at euery moment in daunger of ſurpriſe: and thus behold an imaginary libertie in ſtead of a priſon. Neither ſhall the fields haue any better bargaine, if this miſchief continue. A king cannot abide to be diſgraded by his ſubiectes: Rigour muſt be ſet againſt rigour, and force againſt force: The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe, exceſſe and diſorders of theſe perturbers will draw on others: Againſt the vſurpation of a ſtraunger his Maieſty muſt be ſuccoured by ſtraungers: againſt the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes drifts with Suitzers and Germaines: our fieldes ſhall become forreſts, &amp; our warres yong ſprings, a diſeaſe common to the laborer and the burgeſſe, to the Gentleman and the Clergie: a diſeaſe that will multiply robberies in the fieldes and rages in the townes: then woe to the auctors and fauorers of theſe miſeries: the people will conuert this fury againſt them, and with their bloud will redéeme their abolition, their owne peace and life, and to their coſtes they ſhall ſée what it is to wreſt the ſcepter from the ſoueraigne,

and the ſword from the Magiſtrate therewith to arme and authoriſe the licentiouſneſſe of the people.</p>
                  <p>Marke their imaginations, after they haue plucked the king out of his throne, they haue left the place empty: aſke then whom in conſcience they will place therein: the Duke of Mayenne? What prince is there in Chriſtendome that will not withſtand it? that knoweth not himſelfe to be hurt in this example?

How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny princes of the houſe of Bourbon muſt they pierce before they come there? Princes I ſay armed with right, with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and with credite againſt this imaginatiue Chimere of vſurpation, for whoſe bloud the nobilitie wil hazard theirs: the Nobilitie which in like alterations findeth it ſelfe ſtill buried with the Monarchie: Nobility, whoſe honour and degrée is tied to that of our kings: Nobility which to be briefe can not hope to kéepe that degrée ouer the commons which God hath giuen it, when it ſhall ſée their ſoueraigne, him of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it holdeth the ſword caſt headlong from his. Let euery man hold his peace: let vs ſuffer them at leaſure to do what they liſt. If they will ground their vſurpation vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Charlemains prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes, how will they agrée with the Duke of Lorraine and his children? how? albeit they will agrée with the braunch of Vaudemont? Againe if they thinke the crowne due to the deſerts, to the labours &amp; to the vertues, that is to ſay, to the late Duke of Guiſes Monopoles, how

can they fruſtrate his heyre? but who doubteth that all the varlets of the houſe pretend not a ſhare, that is, that they are not reſolued to rent aſunder the ſtate and to ſhare out the péeces?</p>
                  <p>O Frenchmen, imagine what your eſtate ſhall then be. Theſe chaunges out of one extremity into an other are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer made without a moſt violent ouerthrow: the houſe wherein we are now lodged ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ouerthrowen but we ſhall be oppreſſed therein. Our bodies turne not to wormes and ſerpents before death catcheth hold: theſe ſerpents can not be borne, neither procéede out of the body of this eſtate before it be diſſolued, periſhed and rotten, and that wée all which do not liue, other then in it, muſt runne to ruine. It is very eaſie to deſire a crowne: it is very eaſie for a people moued and paſſionate againſt their Prince, to thinke vpon the alteration of the Eſtate. Betwéene an ambitious deſire and the accompliſhment thereof, betwéene your haſty chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and your reuenges ſo far of, how many daies workes and battels? what plenty of bloud, ſacke and miſery? the ages of the world will not ſuffiſe to decide this quarrell: the ſonne will take the fathers place, and the brother the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: you ſhall make a perpetuall confuſion to the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which ſhall curſe the memory of your madneſſe.</p>
                  <p>And how much more conuenient for you were it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge ſo many calamities with a peace? a peace which out of the darke Chaos wherein you haue plunged your ſelues, might reduce you into the light, which might reſtore you to your ſelues, to your nature &amp; to your ſences, which might deliuer you out of theſe diſquietneſſes wherein you are, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this labyrinth wherinto you are entered, which you do wel déeme you can not get out of, &amp; whereof in the meane while you ſée not the end: a peace which might replant euery one in that he loueth: might reſtore to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> huſbandma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his plough, to the artificer his ſhop, to the marchant his traffick, to the countrie aſſurance, to the townes gouernment, &amp; to all men indifferently vpright iuſtice: a peace that might returne you
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4140:12"/>
the kings fatherly loue, to him the obedience &amp; fidelitie that you owe him: to be briefe, a peace that might render to this eſtate both ſoule and body: the body which through theſe ambitious is haled in a thouſand péeces: the ſoule, I meane the good order that hath preſerued it, which from the higheſt degrée to the loweſt runneth all to confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things conſidered, euery one ſounding the very bottome, whether it be the euil that he doth himſelfe, or that he is to ſuffer: in theſe confuſions we aſſure our ſelues that they who hitherto haue perſiſted in their dueties to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, will double their affections and courage to ſerue him from good to better againſt his enimies: that they who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſimplicity haue let themſelues run into their practiſes, would not be inſtruments of their owne deſtruction, by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the foundation of this eſtate to pull it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne heads, but will rather abandon ſo bad a faction, &amp; haue recourſe to his Maieſties clemency, who ſtill kéepeth the gate open to all that ſéeke it.</p>
                  <p>As for ſuch as obſtinately ſhall perſiſt enemies to the king, to this Realme &amp; to their owne good, as they ſhall moſt iuſtly purchace Gods wrath &amp; the hatred of man, ſo are they to expect no other but a fearefull iudgement from aboue worthy their merites, which God for his mercy haſten vpon the obſtinate, to the abridging of ſo many miſchiefs and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, &amp; to the weale, peace, &amp; quiet of ſo many poore people.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of our ſelfe, we proteſt that ambition armeth vs not: ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly haue we ſhewed that we do deſpiſe it, &amp; it is honour enough to vs to be that we are, neither can y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this Eſtate periſh but we muſt decay. And ſo litle, (God is our witneſſe) are we lead by reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge that none hath receaued more wrongs &amp; iniuries the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we, neither hath any hitherto made leſſe purſuite: neither ſhal any be more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to forgiue the enemies, if they amend, in any caſe that may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne the tranquilite &amp; peace of France. That which afflicteth vs, which we can neither ſée nor foreſée without teares, is that this Eſtate ſhalbe brought to that point that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4140:13"/>
its harme is ſo growen and ſtubburne, that it can not be holpen without great miſchief.</p>
                  <p>From theſe miſchiefes doo we proteſt againſt the wound and thoſe that made it: he that made the wound is guiltie of the fire, the coroſiue, the inciſions, and the griefes that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie they make. It ſufficeth, and euery one may ſée it, that in that little which we may, we bring the care of the good ſurgeon that loueth the patient. The enemies in deede that loue the diſeaſe, will, beſides the iron, bring both hatred &amp; fraud, as they that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue no contentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but in their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition ouer this eſtate, neither can they content thmſelues but in her ſinall death, a death which we will redéeme with the price of our life and all our goods. But rather (as we truſt in God the preſeruer of kings and kingdoms) we ſhal ſhortly as the fruite of our labours, ſée the king in his due authority, whereto he is borne, and the Realme in like force and dignitie as heretofore, to the contentment of all good Frenchmen, the comfort of ſuch numbers of poore people, &amp; the hart breaking of ſuch as doe couet the ruine thereof.</p>
                  <p>We doe therefore beſéech the Lordes of the Courtes of Parlement, all gouernors, lieutenants generall of the prouinces, chambers of accompts, courts of aides, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſourers generall of Fraunce, prouoſtes, bailiffes, ſene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchalles, iudges, maiors, ſheriffes, iurats, conſuls, headbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, bodies and communalties of townes, and all other iuſtices and officers my Lord the Kings ſubiectes, to aſſiſt, fauour, &amp; leane vnto vs, for the benefite of his affaires and ſeruice: For ſuch is our deſire.</p>
