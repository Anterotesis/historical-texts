            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for this last age of the
World, wherein hee intends to
do great things for his <hi>Church</hi>
and <hi>against</hi> his <hi>enemies,</hi> the
accomplishment of many precious <hi>promises,</hi> and
the discovery of most glorious <hi>providences.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all other your State observations, I hope
you treasure up the <hi>experiences</hi> of his <hi>wonder-working


<pb facs="tcp:50291:3"/>
hand</hi> for you since this happy <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

<hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>Counsellors</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reason then you, to say with the Psalmist, Psal.
139. 17. <hi>How precious are thy thoughts unto
mee,</hi> O God: <hi>how great is the summe of them!</hi>
It were well worthy your wise <hi>care,</hi> to take some
course, what ever it cost, by a discreet and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
pen, to preserve the <hi>story</hi> of Gods <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
about you since these troubles began, that so
his <hi>honour</hi> might live therein, when you are
<hi>dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its true indeed, the Lords <hi>dispensations</hi> have
been very various towards you, and the <hi>method</hi>
of his <hi>counsels,</hi> past finding out; As the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
in the <hi>wildernesse,</hi> were sometimes not far
from <hi>Canaan,</hi> and then cast back for a long time;
so you sometimes begin to think your selves got
neere the <hi>shore,</hi> and to discover the <hi>Land,</hi> some
<hi>hopes</hi> of a gracious issue, then a new <hi>storme</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
and <hi>drives</hi> you into the main <hi>Sea</hi> again: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
your <hi>present straites,</hi> your renued per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities.
Amongst other reasons hereof, this may
bee one; It may bee God will not finish your <hi>state-affaires,</hi>
till you are more vigorous in his <hi>Temple-work.</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:50291:3"/>
Who knows how soon poore <hi>England,</hi> yea
and all the <hi>three Kingdoms,</hi> might become glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<hi>happy,</hi> could you remove such <hi>obstructions,</hi>
as interrupt the building of <hi>Gods house?</hi> Your
selves are not a little concerned in the <hi>expediting</hi>
this great businesse of <hi>setling</hi> the Church; <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
of most dangerous consequence begin now to
spring up amongst us. The controversie is not
now onely betwixt <hi>congregationall</hi> and <hi>classicall</hi>
Divines, (who are called <hi>Independents,</hi> and
<hi>Presbyterians</hi>) in point of Church government;
(There seemes to bee some <hi>good hopes</hi> of a faire
<hi>accommodation</hi> betwixt them) But with such
<hi>others</hi> also who vehemently cry down not only the
<hi>power</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiasticall Synods,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Civill Magistrate,</hi> in

even for <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> and any whomsoever.
The Good Lord stirre up your hearts who have so
great a share in the <hi>managing,</hi> and in the <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi>
of the great work in hand, to do what <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

            <p>You will please to allow mee the boldnesse to put
you in mind of <hi>Davids carriage,</hi> who, when the
<hi>three mighty men brake through the Host of
the</hi> Philistims, <hi>and drew water out of the
well of</hi> Bethlehem, 2 Sam. 23. 16. <hi>He would
not drinke thereof, but poured it out unto
the Lord:</hi> and hee said, Bee <hi>it farre from mee
O Lord, that I shall doe this? Is not this the
blood of men that went in jeopardy of their
lives?</hi> therefore <hi>hee would not drinke it, ver.
17.</hi> The <hi>tranquillity</hi> and many sweet refreshings,
the <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> of doing Service
to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> in the Parliament which
you enjoy; <hi>Is it not the blood of very many
men?</hi> How often have your <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Generall</hi> with other <hi>VVorthies</hi> of the first
<hi>Magnitude,</hi> jeoparded their lives in the High
places of the field to secure you in your <hi>Houses,</hi> in
your <hi>employments?</hi> How much trouble and
hazzard have our <hi>deare Brethren of Scotland</hi>
undergone to themselves and Kingdom, to keepe
You from the danger of <hi>popery</hi> and <hi>slavery?</hi>
yea how many thousands, some of all rankes, (it


<pb facs="tcp:50291:4"/>
may make us bleed with sorrow to number them)
have already shed their <hi>dearest blood,</hi> that you
may possesse your <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>estates?</hi> God forbid,
bee it farre from any of you, that what is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
at so deare a rate, should bee prostituted to
your own <hi>selvishnesse,</hi> or any <hi>ignoble service.</hi>
Let all you have, rather be powred out to the Lord,
and consecrated to his service in building him an
House,<note place="margin">Isa. 43. 4.</note> who hath <hi>loved</hi> you so much and given
<hi>so many men for your lives.</hi>
            </p>

out this admirable expression: <hi>O that I had

I had another life to loose for</hi> Jesus Christ!
Let this speech <hi>live</hi> in you after his <hi>death.</hi> Bee

Hereupon this man of God, the Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> being sent with a

complaints to their <hi>negligent intermission,</hi> in the Lords Worke, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering

               <note place="margin">Verse 2.</note> which did mis-lead them, <hi>ver. 2. This

            </p>
            <p>Indeed they doe not here bluntly, and peremptorily refuse to
joyne in building the Temple, but indevour cunuingly to put it
off.</p>

            <p>And where ever it light they care not, so they may but shelter and
justifie themselves in their own <hi>omissions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They will bee so presumptuous as to devolve their negligence in
re-edifying the Temple upon <hi>Gods providence,</hi> as if by those lets
which had been an hinderance unto them, <hi>God</hi> had showne, that
hee would have the worke deferred till some other time, and rather
then they will bee put out of their pace, they will likewise cast <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi>
upon the <hi>zeale and forwardnesse</hi> of those who began to lay the
foundation of the <hi>Temple,</hi> so soone after they returned from the
Captivity. Their sloath and subtilty prompts them to cry out in
this disparaging and discouraging language: <hi>The time is not yet
come, the time is not yet come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the very same <hi>spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A strong anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy against rebuilding the Temple in all ages.</note> which now adayes breathes in our

Oh how long doe you thinke should <hi>Haggai, Zerubbabel,</hi> and <hi>Joshu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>

            <p>First, one drawn from the shamefull <hi>preferring themselves before
God. ver. 4. Is it a time for you, O yee, to dwell in your seiled houses, and
this house lye waste?</hi> most unlike to <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 2.</note> who sware unto the Lord,

them, in preserving and bringing them out of the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

            <p>Secondly, another drawn from those <hi>smarting evidences of Gods
displeasure,</hi> against their negligence, <hi>ver. 6, 7. Now therefore, thus saith
the Lord of Hoasts, Consider your wayes, yee have sown much, and bring
in little, &amp;c.</hi> And then like a good Physitian, after the <hi>discovery</hi> of a

serious consideration of their wayes, but divers times in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in such other places of Scripture, where the people of God
met with Armies of adversaries to hinder them from building the

doe with God by Fasting and Prayer, (that is a good feare which
drives us to God, and begets Prayers unto him.) In his prayer

gathers together many strong Arguments. Hee. well knew that

contriving the <hi>protraction</hi> of these Warres, even when we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun

there have been overtures of a pacification, but then not

It was <hi>Ephraims</hi> fault, they did not set their hearts upon their

            <p>By the good hand of our God upon us, there is a <hi>beautifull
Fabrick</hi> of his <hi>House,</hi> (as neere as wee can according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall

               <note place="margin">Great things done in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> towards Church Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> In stead of the <hi>High Commission,</hi>

wee have an <hi>Honourable Committee,</hi> that <hi>turns the wheele</hi> upon such

and through their retardings to carry on Temple-work with
great advantage; All our <hi>delayes and difficulties</hi> may prove the
<hi>Lords method</hi> to fetch off peoples Spirits, to close more fully
with his own work. The businesse of <hi>Church-Reformation,</hi> stuck
here most of all, even in the <hi>reluctancy</hi> of the peoples minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, and their <hi>indisposednesse</hi> to comply with it, as in good
<hi>Jehosophats</hi> dayes, <hi>The high places were not taken away, for as yet the
people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their Fathers,</hi>
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 33. Our Temple-work was no more <hi>forward,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the hearts of the most of <hi>England</hi> have been so <hi>backward</hi>
to it. Behold here the admirable providence of God, how hee
hath improved the lengthening of our Troubles; Hereby hee
hath by little and little moulded peoples spirits to a more ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
disposition,<note place="margin">Temple-work goes on in the midst of all our troubles with advantage.</note> and made many much more ready to concurre
in the building of the <hi>Temple,</hi> in the <hi>Advancing</hi> of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the warres began, thousands in <hi>England</hi> who in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
would have taken up Armes to fight for the <hi>Prelacy and the
Service-Book,</hi> have been so hammered and hewed by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of Gods Judgements upon us, that now they are come
to this; <hi>Let the Parliament and Assembly doe what they will with
Prelacy and Liturgie, so the sword may bee sheathed,</hi> now <hi>Truth</hi> shall
bee welcome, so they may have <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O then, why should not you hold up your courage and
confidence in the midst of all obstructions and difficulties? <hi>God
walkes towards you in his ordinary pace.</hi> You have already reaped
such good fruits as will helpe to beare the charges of our long
delayes. The Lord hath hereby facilitated the rebuilding of his
own house. There are wise men who think our <hi>Reformation</hi>
would have been very <hi>low,</hi> had not God raised the spirits of our
<hi>Reformers</hi> by the length of these multiplyed Troubles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50291:20"/>
It hath been more then once observed by such as looke on,
that when our <hi>Parliament Spirits</hi> have begunne to faile and sinke,
then some <hi>Plot</hi> or other of the undermining adversaries hath
been discovered, whereby they have been quickned to the Lords
work, and when they have begunne to clash and divide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves, then hath appeared some common <hi>danger,</hi>
wherein they were all <hi>involved,</hi> and so have been happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
for the publick welfare of Church and State. God knows
how to make all events subservient to his own purposes. You
read in <hi>Isa. 1. 25. 27. Before Zion shall be redeemed with Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
hee will purely purge away her drosse, and take away all her
Tinne.</hi> Here was much drosse in <hi>England,</hi> both of persons and
things. Wonder not if they bee not suddainly or easily remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Many drossie persons and things have been taken away
by the length of these troubles, which otherwise in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
would still have clogged us. As in matters of <hi>State, the
civill Sword</hi> being so <hi>indulgent,</hi> would not take off Delinquents,
therefore the Lord still renues the Commission of the <hi>Militarie
Sword,</hi> to doe Justice till his Counsell bee fulfilled. So in the
Affaires of the <hi>Church,</hi> many poore deluded people in <hi>England</hi>
were fond of their needlesse <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and ready to dote on
some Babylonish trinkets, who probably would not have been
weaned from them, had not God whipped them off by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of these troubles. You have the greater reason to bee
satisfyed under his hand; who hereby makes us more willing
heartily to return from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> that wee may goe
up to the <hi>Mountaine,</hi> and build the <hi>Lords House:</hi> And so I hasten
to the last observation out of the eighth verse. <hi>Goe up to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain

            </p>
            <p>It is doubtful to some Expositors what <hi>Mountain</hi> is here meant,

how to recover themselves from under those evils which lye
upon them, hee bids them shake off their sluggishnesse, breake
through opposition, goe up to <hi>Sion,</hi> and build the <hi>Temple.</hi> Hence
observe;</p>
            <p>To set seriously and readily about building the Temple is a most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
way to obtain favour from the Lord of Hosts when his hand

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lords great designe</hi> here on earth, is to prepare a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
to raise a <hi>glorious Throme</hi> for his Sonne in his <hi>Church:</hi> This
is the tenour of his <hi>promises, I will make thee an eternall excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

runne this way, <hi>Isa. 62. 6, 7. I have set watchmen upon thy

or <hi>Vnderminers</hi> of the building, in these times of Reformation.</p>

                  </gap>s of Retarders of Temple-work</note> who
are of two sorts.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>prophane Atheists,</hi> who cannot endure to thinke of any
such Reformation as will confine and straiten them in making
<hi>provision for their lusts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Prophane Atheists.</note> There are too many of all rankes who

the <hi>prafanum vulgus,</hi> who quarrell against the strictnesse of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I wish none of our <hi>great ones</hi> were to bee found in this <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</hi>
I feare many of our <hi>Ministers</hi> will help to fill it up. When
Christ was to come into his Temple, there needed a <hi>John</hi> Baptist to
prepare the way, to <hi>make the mountaines l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fire, and the Fullers sope.</hi> In such a posture Christ appeares in
<hi>England,</hi> in these Reforming times, which makes profane ones
who are not willing to be refined, retard what they can.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Carnall Selfe-Seekers</hi> are deeply guilty of retarding Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-worke;<note place="margin">2 Carnall selfe-seekers.</note>,
you shall find in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. 4. there is a wicked Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a wretched conspiracy of such men as make the last times pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous.
In the very front comes selfe-love, <hi>ver. 2. Men shall bee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of their own selves,</hi> and withall, <hi>ver. 4. Such as are lovers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
more then of God.</hi> They who value their carnall-selfe at so high
a rate, that they will preferre their owne <hi>ends,</hi> their <hi>ease,</hi> their <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi>
any thing of themselves before God and his <hi>Honour,</hi> will bee
ready upon every occasion, to hinder <hi>Reformation,</hi> and will rather
imploy their wit and influence, to keep down Gods House, then
that the building of Gods House should occasion the pulling down
of their beloved carnall-self.</p>
            <p>The second Item is for <hi>underminers</hi> of <hi>Templework,</hi> of whom there
are likewise two sorts,<note place="margin">Two sorts of underminers of Temple-work.</note> swayed by two different undermining prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">1 Some would allow nothing by divine right in the Church.</note> 
               <hi>Such who would have nothing</hi> jure divino, <hi>nothing stand by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

own word. <hi>Moses</hi> had the pattern of the <hi>Tabernacle, Solomon</hi> of the

Doubtlesse there may bee an extreame on both hands, some would

Religion in the Christian Church. Let there bee a most exact inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
what Latitude the Scripture doth allow for different opinions
and practises in that <hi>one true way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to set the doore so wide open as to <hi>tolerate all Religions,</hi> to
make <hi>London</hi> an <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> (which yet some contend for, and
would now bee content to tolerate Popery it selfe, so they might
enjoy their own way, though not many yeeres since their spirits

such an undermining of the Temple, that this would soon pull
down Gods house here, but never build it up. God forbid that any
of you should bee sound either retarders or underminers of such a

            <p>I desire you may remember all Gods <hi>diverting providences,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Remember Gods diverting providences for our good.</note>
working for your good, that your active prudence may bee inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for his service. Had not the Lord of Hosts diverted the <hi>Kings
Army</hi> from comming up towards <hi>London,</hi> when they had gotten
<hi>Bristoll,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>New-Castles</hi> Forces from comming up
to the then <hi>Associating Counties,</hi> when hee set down before <hi>Hull;
yea,</hi> had not the Lords mighty hand kept Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Army from comming <hi>Southward,</hi> when hee had got so
great an advantage by raising the Siege at <hi>Yorke;</hi> how much
more sad might <hi>Englands</hi> condition have been before this time?
And I hope you will upon this day of humiliation so wisely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his <hi>humbling providences</hi> in our present straites and troubles,<note place="margin">Improve humbling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</note>
that you may bee awakened to a more serious consideration of
your own wayes, and in an holy revenge of your former negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
set your selves upon the building of the Lord Christs house.</p>
            <p>O that there were amongst our <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> many more
of <hi>Davids</hi> spirit, who made great preparations for the building
of the Temple, 1 <hi>Chron. 22. 5. Yea in his trouble hee prepared for
the house of the Lord, ver.</hi> 14. They have had a large share in these
devouring troubles. Much of the <hi>blood</hi> of our <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi>
hath been spilt and many of their houses and estates ruined in
this unnaturall Warre, as if the Lord had a speciall quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, intending to <hi>staine the pride of their glory.</hi> The Lord
make them wise who remaine to study Gods meaning herein.
Certainly this were a good improvement of it, for you who
have been preserved to consecrate your <hi>lives,</hi> your <hi>Honour,</hi> to the
honour of your good God, in the <hi>building</hi> of his <hi>House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What preparations should wee make for the building
of Gods House? what may wee do towards it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Bee pleased to accept of these few plain directions,<note place="margin">Directions how to help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

your interest and influence for the acting of them.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Downe</hi> with the <hi>old building</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Prelacy.</hi> The
Pope hath been raising himselfe a <hi>pompous palace,</hi> for many
yeeres together, upon Christs ground, a great incroachment upon


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50291:23"/>
our deare Saviour, who is King of his Church, which must
come down, it is designed to ruine, <hi>Rev. 14. 8. Prelacy</hi> was the
<hi>Scaffold</hi> whereby this building of Popery was raised to so great
an heighth, and now many would retain it as a <hi>crutch,</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
tottering <hi>Babylon;</hi> Make good your <hi>Solemn Covenant;</hi> If you
are not in a capacity for the overthrowing of it by the exercise of
the <hi>Legisative power</hi> in a <hi>Bill;</hi> it's worthy your wise considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whether it were not fit to doe what you can by passing an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi>
of <hi>Parliament</hi> against it.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Away with all the rubbish</note>, when you have pulled downe the old building,
<hi>leave no rubbish upon the place.</hi> It was an unhappy defect in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Reformations, though some of the grand <hi>Idols</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
yet still there was so much <hi>Babylonish sfuffe</hi> left behind,
which now hath occasioned great trouble. Away with <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
Altars,</hi> and <hi>Crucifixes,</hi> away with the <hi>Popes Canon Law,</hi> or
whatsoever may give any occasion to <hi>Samarit an builders,</hi> to make
such a mixture in the Church, as is contrary to the <hi>simplicity
in Christ, 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 3. which should bee the <hi>rule</hi> of the <hi>Churches
Conformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Lay a good foundation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Lay a good foundation. Fundatto fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daussima. sun.</note> in the building of Gods house,
Christ in his Gospell a <hi>sure foundation, Isa.</hi> 28. 16. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
is both the <hi>strength</hi> and the <hi>rule</hi> of the building, to which
it should be commensurate: There is a foundation <hi>personall,</hi> Christ
himselfe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. and <hi>doctrinall,</hi> as hee is held forth in the
doctrine of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles, Ephes.</hi> 2. 20. The more you
minde these in the worke of Reformation, the more glorious
house you will raise for God to dwell in.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Look to the superstructions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4 Look to the superst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ctions</note> when you have laid a
good foundation. Doe not multiply <hi>humane inventions,</hi> in stead
of <hi>divine Ordinances.</hi> Consider what <hi>Offices,</hi> what <hi>Administrations</hi> the Lord of the house hath prescribed in his Word. Hee hath
given <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers, Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. Hee hath set in the
<hi>Church, Helpes, Governments, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 28. not <hi>helpes in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
(as it is in some Copies mis-printed) but <hi>Helpes, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
which most learned Expositors make to bee <hi>Deacons,</hi> and
Ruling <hi>Elders,</hi> to assist the <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers;</hi> Let us not bee
afraid of admitting such as God himselfe hath prescribed; there
is no better way of building Gods House, then out of his <hi>own
Materials.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:50291:23"/>
Fifthly, Labour to approve your selves <hi>lively stones, spirituall

to the building of Gods house: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5. The Apostle repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents

            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Improve your Parliament power, to <hi>multiply builders
in the Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">6 Multiply Builders.</note> Poore <hi>England</hi> complains under three great defects:</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Schooles and Vniversities</hi> are much decayed, where builders

            <p>Secondly, <hi>Ordination</hi> is wanting, whereby they might bee so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
