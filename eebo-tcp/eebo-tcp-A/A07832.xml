            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>REputation is such a thing, that it keepes many men in awe, even amongst Civilized nations, and is very much stood upon: it is (as one hath very well noted) the awe of great men and of Kings, and since I have observed it, to be maintained amongst Salvage people, I cannot chuse but give an instance thereof in this treatise, to confirme the common receaved opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thereof.</p>

                  </note> that the cause why these other Salvages of the Narohigansets, came into these parts, was to see what strength we were of, and to watch an opportunity to cut us off, and take that which they found in our custody usefull for them; And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded further, they would burne our howses, and that they had caught one of his men, named Meshebro, and compelled him to discover to them where their barnes, Magazines, or storehowses were, and had taken away his corne, and seemed to be in a pittifull perplexity about the matter.</p>
               <p>And the more to adde reputation to this tale, desires that his wifes and children might be harbered in one of our howses. This was graunted, and my neighbours put on corslets, headpeeces, and weapons defensive and offensive.</p>
               <p>This thing being knowne to Cheecatawback, hee caused some of his men to bring the Narohigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets to trade, that they might see the preparation.</p>
               <p>The Salvage that was a stranger to the plott, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply comming to trade, and finding his merchants, lookes like lobsters, all cladd in harnesse, was in a maze to thinke what would be the end of it.

               <p>But (as the manner has bin) hee must eate some furmety before hee goe: downe hee sits,<note place="margin">

               <p>THis is a thinge not onely observed by mee, and diverse of the Salvages of New England, but also, by the French men in Nova Francia, and therefore I am the more incouraged to publish in this Treatice my observation of them, in the use of theire sences: which is a thinge that I should not easily have bin induced, to beleeve, if I my selfe, had not bin an eie witnesse, of what I shall relate.</p>

               <p>Their eies indeede are black as iett; and that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is accounted the strongest for sight. And as they excell us in this particular so much noted, so I thinke they excell us in all the rest.</p>
               <p>This I am sure, I have well observed, that in the sence of smelling, they have very great perfection: which is confirmed by the opinion of the French, that are planted about Canada, who have made relation, That they are so perfect in the use of that sence, that they will distinguish between a Spaniard and a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by the sent of the hand onely.<note place="margin">

               <p>ALthough these Salvages are found to be without Religion, Law, and King (as Sir William Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander hath well observed,) yet are they not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without the knowledge of God (historically) for they have it amongst them by tradition, that God made one man and one woman, and bad them live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and get children, kill deare, beasts, birds, fish, and fowle, and what they would at their pleasure; and that their posterity was full of evill, and made God so angry: that hee let in the Sea upon them, &amp; drowned the greatest part of them, that were naughty men, (the Lord destroyed so.)</p>

               <p>And that wee that use the booke of Common prayer, doo it to declare to them, that cannot reade, what Kytan has commaunded us, and that wee doe pray to him with the helpe of that booke; and doe make so much accompt of it, that a Salvage (who had lived in my howse before hee had taken a wife, by whome hee had children) made this request to mee (knowing that I allwayes used him with much more respect then others.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A Salvage desired to have his sonn brought up to learne the booke of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer.</hi>

                  <p>Of their Custome in burning the Country, and the reason thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Salvages are accustomed, to set fire of the Country in all places where they come; and to burne it, twize a yeare, vixe at the Spring, and the fall of the leafe. The reason that mooves them to doe so,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges fire the Country twice a yeare.</hi>
                  </note> is because it would other wise be so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne with underweedes, that it would be all a cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice wood, and the people would not be able in any wise to passe through the Country out of a beaten path.</p>
               <p>The meanes that they do it with, is with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine minerall stones, rhat they carry about them: in baggs made for that purpose of the skinnes of little beastes which they convert into good lether; carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the same a peece of touch wood (very excellent
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:25540:29"/>
for that purpose of their owne making. These mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall stones they have from the Piquenteenes (which is to the Southward of all the plantations in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) by trade and trafficke with those people.</p>
               <p>The burning of the grasse destroyes the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods, and so scorcheth the elder trees, that it shrinkes them, and hinders their grouth very much: So that hee that will looke to finde large trees, and good tymber, must not depend upon the help, of a woodden prospect to finde them on the upland ground; but must seeke for them, (as I and others have done) in the lower grounds where the grounds are wett when the Country is fired: by reason of the snow water that remaines there for a time, untill the Sunne by continuance of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t hath exhaled the vapoures of the earth, and dried up those places, where the fire (by reason of the moisture) can have no power to doe them any hurt: and if he would endevoure to finde out any goodly Cedars, hee must not seeke for them on the higher grounds, but make his inquest for them in the vallies, for the Salvages by this Custome of theirs, have spoiled all the rest: for this custome hath bin continued from the beginninge.</p>
               <p>And least their firing of the Country in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; should be an occasion of damnifying us, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daingering our habitations; wee our selves have used carefully about the same times; to observe the winds and fire the grounds about our owne habitations, to prevent the Dammage that might happen by any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect thereof, if t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:25540:30"/>For when the fire is once kindled, it dilates and spreads it selfe as well against, as with the winde; bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning continually night and day, untill a shewer of raine falls to quench it.</p>
               <p>And this custome of firing the Country is the meanes to make it passable, and by that meanes the trees growe here, and there as in our parks: and makes the Country very beautifull, and commodious.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AMong Fishes. First I will begin with the Codd; because it is the most commodious of all fish, as may appeare, by the use which is made of them in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Codd.</hi>
                  </note>The Codd fishing is much used in America, (whereof New England is a part) in so much as 300. Sayle of shipps, from divers parts, have used to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed yearely in that trade.</p>
               <p>

                  </note>I have seene in one Harboure, next Richmond Iland 15. Sayle of shipps at one time, that have taken in them, driyed Codds for Spaine, and the Straights (and it has bin found that the Saylers have made 15.18.20.22. p. share for a common man.</p>
               <p>The Coast aboundeth with such multitudes of Codd, that the inhabitants of New England doe dunge their grounds with Codd; and it is a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity better than the golden mines of the Spanish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; for without dried Codd the Spaniard, Portingal, and Italian, would not be able to vittel of a shipp for the Sea; and I am sure at the Canaries it is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall commodity: which place lyeth neere New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land

                     <hi>Oyle mayd of the livers of the Codd.</hi>
                  </note> and is a commodity that without question will enrich the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of New England quicly; and is therefore a principall commodity.</p>
               <p>The Basse is an excellent Fish, both fresh and Salte one hundred whereof salted (at a market) have yeilded 5. p. They are so large,<note place="margin">

There are such multitudes, that I have seene stopped into the river close adjoyning to my howse with a sand at one tide, so many as will loade a ship of a 100. Tonnes.</p>
               <p>Other places have greater quantities in so much, as wagers have bin layed, that one should not throw a stone in the water, but that hee should hit a fish.</p>
               <p>I my selfe, at the turning of the tyde, have seene such multitudes passe out of a pound, that it seemed to mee, that one might goe over their backs drishod.</p>
               <p>These follow the bayte up the rivers, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are follwed for bayte and chased into the bayes, and shallow waters, by the grand pise: and these may have also a prime place in the Catalogue of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>

               <p>The Fish is good, salted; for store against the winter, as well as fresh, and to be accounted a good Commodity.</p>
               <p>This Sturgeon in England is <hi>regalis piscis.</hi> every man in New England may catch what hee will, there are multitudes of them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sturgeon.</hi>
                  </note> and they are much fatter then those that are brought into England from other parts, in so much as by reason of their fatnesse, they doe not looke white, but yellow, which made a Cooke presume they were not so good as them of Roushea: silly fellow that could not understand that it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fish salted, or pickelled, the fatter the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower being best to preserve.</p>
               <p>For the taste I have warrant of Ladies of worth, with choise pallats for the commendations, who liked the taste so well, that they esteemed it beyond the Sturgeon of other parts, and sayd they were decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the lookes: therefore let the Sturgeon passe for a Commodity.</p>
               <p>Of Salmons there is greate abundance: and these may be allowed for a Commodity,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:25540:47"/>Of Eeles there is abundance, both in the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters, and in the fresh: and the fresh water Eele there (if I may take the judgement of a London Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger) is the best that hee hath found in his life time.

                  </note> that the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages doe take them up in the rivers with baskets, like sives.</p>
               <p>There is a Fish, (by some called shadds,<note place="margin">

                  </note> by some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizes) that at the spring of the yeare, passe up the rivers to spaune in the ponds; and are taken in such multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in every river, that hath a pond at the end, that the Inhabitants doung their ground with them. You may see in one towneship a hundred acres together, set with these Fish, every acre taking 1000. of them: and an acre thus dressed will produce and yeald so much corne, as 3. acres without fish: and (least any Virginea man would inferre hereupon, that the ground of New England is barren, because they use no fish in setting their corne, I desire them to be remembred, the cause is plaine in Virginea) they have it not to sett. But this practise is onely for the Indian Maize (which must be set by hands) not for English graine: and this is therefore a commodity there.</p>
               <p>There is a large sized fish called Hallibut,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Turbut or Hallibut.</hi>

such plenty, that the fisher men onely eate the heads, and finnes, and throw away the bodies: such in Paris would yeeld 5. or 6. crownes a peece: and this is no discommodity.</p>
               <p>There are excellent Plaice and easily taken. They (at flowing water) do almost come a shore,<note place="margin">

               <p>This being knowne, they shall passe for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to the inhabitants; for the Salvages will meete 500, or 1000. at a place where Lobsters come in with the tyde, to eate, and save dried for store, abiding in that place, feasting and sporting a moneth or 6. weekes together.</p>

               <p>THis was a man approoved of the Brethren, both for his zeale and guiftes, yet but a Bubble, &amp; at the publike Chardge conveyed to New England, I thinke to be Master of the Ceremonies, betweene the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and the Planters: for hee applied himselfe cheifly to pen the language downe in Stenography:<note place="margin">

                  </note> whose oratory luld his auditory fast a sleepe, as Mercuries pipes did Argus eies: for when hee was in; they sayd hee could not tell how to get out: nay hee would hardly out, till hee were fired out, his zeale was such: (one fire they say drives out another,) hee would become a great Merchant,<note place="margin">

and did rejoyce in the bargaine, insistinge on the day, the day, yea marry quoth his freind if you have doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesday for payment you are then well to passe. But if he had not, it were as good hee had, they were payed all alike.</p>
               <p>And now, this Bubbles day is become a common proverbe, hee obtained howse roome at Passonagessit,<note place="margin">

                  </note> hee would not give his host leave to say grace, belike hee thought mine host past grace, and further learned as many other Schollers are: but in the usage and custome of this blinde oratory, his host tooke himselfe abused, and the whiles fell to and had halfe done, before this man Bubble would open his eies, to see what stood afore him, which made him more cautius, and learned, that <hi>brevis oratio penetrat Caelum.</hi> Together Bubbles and hee goes in the Canaw to Nut Island for brants, and there his host makes a shotte &amp; breakes the winges of many, Bubble

               <p>THe Inhabitants of Pasonagessit (having translated the name of their habitation from that ancient Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage name to Ma-re Mount; and being resolved to have the new name confirmed for a memorial to after ages) did devise amongst themselves to have it performed in a solemne manner with Revels, &amp; merriment after the old English custome:<note place="margin">

And because they would have it in a compleat forme, they had prepared a song fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the time and present occasion. And upon May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day they brought the Maypole to the place appointed, with drumes, gunnes, pistols, and other fitting instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for that purpose; and there erected it with the help of Salvages, that came thether of purpose to see the manner of our Revels. A goodly pine tree of 80. foote longe, was reared up, with a peare of buckshorns nayled one, somewhat neare unto the top of it: where it stood as a faire sea marke for directions; how to finde out the way to mine Hoste of Ma-re Mount.</p>
               <p>And because it should more fully appeare to what end it was placed there, they had a poem in readines made, which was fixed to the Maypole, to shew the new name confirmed upon that plantation; which all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were made according to the occurrents

honest Host of Ma-re Mount to overthrow his onder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and to destroy his plantation quite and cleane.

               <p>Oedipus is generally receaved for the absolute reader of riddles who is invoaked: Silla and Caribdis are two dangerous places for seamen to incounter, neere unto vennice, &amp; have bin by poets formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled to man and wife. The like licence the author challenged for a paire of his nomination, the one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting for the losse of the other as Niobe for her children. Amphitrite is an arme of the Sea, by which the newes was carried up and downe, of a rich widow, now to be tane up or laid downe. By Triton is the fame spread, that caused the Suters to muster; (as it had bin to Penellope of Greece) and the Coast lying circuler, all our passage to and froe, is made more convenient by Sea, then Land. Many aimed at this marke; but hee that played Proteus best and could comply with her humor must be the man, that would carry her, &amp; hee had need have Sampsons strenght to deale with a Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lila: and as much patience as Iob that should come there, for a thing that I did observe in the life time o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe Seperatists envying the prosperity, and hope of the Plantation at Ma-re Mount (which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved beganne to come forward, and to be in a good way for gaine in the Beaver trade) conspired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against mine Host especially, (who was the owner of that Plantation) and made up a party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; and mustred up what aide they could; accounting of him, as of a great Monster.</p>
               <p>

               <p>They set upon my honest host at a place, called Wessaguscus, where (by accident) they found him. The inhabitants there were in good hope, of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion of the plantation at Mare Mount, (which they principally aymed at;) and the rather, because mine host was a man that indeavoured to advaunce the dignity of the Church of England; which they (on the contrary part) would laboure to vilifie; with uncivile termes: enveying against the sacred booke of common prayer, and mine host that used it in a laudable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner amongst his family, as a practise of piety.</p>
               <p>There hee would be a meanes to bringe sacks to their mill (such is the thirst after Beaver) and helped the conspiratores to.

And because they answer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It appeares, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In breife, mine host must indure to be their prisoner, untill they could contrive it so, that they might send him for England, (as they said,) there to suffer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the merrit of the fact, which they intended to father upon him; supposing (belike) it would proove a hainous crime.</p>
               <p>Much rejoycing was made that they had gotten their cappitall enemy (as they concluded him) whome they purposed to hamper in such sort, that hee should not be able to uphold his plantation at Ma-re Mount</p>
               <p>The Conspirators sported themselves at my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest host, that meant them no hurt; &amp; were so joccund that they feasted their bodies, and fell to tippeling, as if they had obtained a great prize; like the Trojans when they had the custody of Hippeus pinetree horse.</p>
               <p>Mine host fained greefe: and could not be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded either to eate, or drinke, because hee knew emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines would be a meanes to make him as watchfull, as the Geese kept in the Roman Cappitall: whereon the contrary part, the conspirators would be so drowsy, that hee might have an opportunity to give them a

               <p>Now Captaine Shrimp, the first Captaine in the Land (as hee supposed,) must doe some new act to repaire this losse, and to vindicate his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, who had sustained blemish, by this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight.

               <p>And much it stood mine honest Host upon, to be very circumspect, and to take Eacus to taske: for that his voyce was more allowed of, then both the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and had not mine Host confounded all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that Eacus could make in their defence: and confuted him that swaied the rest, they would have made him unable to drinke in such manner of merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any more. So that following this private coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, given him by one that knew who ruled the rost, the Hiracano ceased that els would split his pinace.</p>
               <p>A conclusion was made, and sentence given, that mine Host should be sent to England a prisoner. But when hee was brought to the shipps for that purpose, no man durst be so foole hardy as to undertake to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him. So these Worthies set mine Host upon an Island, without gunne, powther, or shot, or dogge, or so much as a knife,<note place="margin">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:25540:75"/>
into a league of brother hood with mine Host; so full of humanity are these infidels before those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
               <p>From this place for England, sailed mine Host in a Plimmoth shipp, (that came into the Land to fish upon the Coast,) that landed him safe in England at Plimmouth, and hee stayed in England untill the ordinary time for shipping to set forth for these parts; and then retorned: Noe man being able to taxe him of any thinge.</p>
               <p>But the Worthies (in the meane time) hoped they had bin ridd of him.</p>

                  <p>NOw to illustrate this Poem, and make the sence more plaine, it is to be considered that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at Ma-re-Mount were seaven, and they had sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heads and 14. feete, these were accounted Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra with the seaven heads; and the Maypole with the Hornes nailed neere the topp, was the forked tayle of this supposed Monster, which they (for want of skill) imposed: yet feared in time (if they hindred not mine Host) hee would hinder the benefit of their Beaver trade, as hee had done (by meanes of this helpe) in Kyny back river finely, ere they were a wares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who comming too late, were much dismaide to finde that mine Host his boate had gleaned away all before they came; which Beaver is a fitt companion for Scarlett: and I beleeve that Iasons golden Fleece was either the same, or some other Fleece not of so much value.</p>
                  <p>This action bred a kinde of hart burning in the Plimmouth Planters who after, sought occasion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mine Host to overthrowe his undertakings, and to destroy his Plantation, whome they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpted a maine enemy to theire Church and State.</p>

                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:25540:79"/>By this meanes hee was allowed 4. p. a moneth, and the chirgeons chest, and made Phisition gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of Salem: where hee exercised his gifts so well, that of full 42. that there hee tooke to cure, there is not one has more cause to complaine, or can say black's his eie. This saved Captaine Littleworths credit, that had truck'd away the vittels: though it brought forth a scandall on the Country by it, and then I hope this man may be forgiven, if they were all made fitting plants for Heaven.</p>
               <p>But in mine opinion, hee deserves to be set upon a palfrey, and lead up and downe in triumph throw new Canaan, with a coller of Iurdans about his neck, as was one of like desert in Richard the seconds time through the streets of London, that men might know where to finde a Quacksaluer.</p>

               <p>A silenced Minister out of courteousnesse, came over into new Canaan to play the spie: Hee pretended out of a zealous intent to doe the Salvages good, and to teach them. Hee brought a great Bundell of Horne books with him, and carefull hee was (good man) to blott out all the crosses of them, for feare least the people of the land should become Idolaters.

               <p>ALthough the nine Worthies had left mine Hoste upon an Island, in such an inhumane manner, as yee heard before; yet when they understood that hee had got shipping, and was gone to England of his owne accord, they dispatched letters of advise to an Agent they had there: and by the next shipp sent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to have a snare made, that might hamper mine Host so, as hee might not any more trouble theire conscience: and to that end,<note place="margin">

               <p>Some contributed three pounds; some foure, some five pounds, and procured a pretty quantity by that Devise, which should be given to a cunning man, that could make a snare to hamper him.</p>
               <p>The Agent (according to his directions,) does his endeavoure (in the best manner hee could) to have this instrument made: and used no little diligence to have it effected.<note place="margin">

               <p>To him this agent goes, and praies his aide: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his cause, &amp; tells the substance of his greivance, all at large, and laid before his eies a heape of gold.</p>

rather, because mine Host had store of corne; and hee had improvidently truckt his store, for the present gaine of Beaver: in somuch, that his people under his chardge were put to short allowance; which caused some of them to sicken with conceipt of such useage: and some of them (by the practise of the new entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctor Noddy, with his Imaginary gifts: They sent therefore to exhibit a petition to grim Minos, Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, and Radamant: where they wished to have the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their greife to be converted: and they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it quickly: if curses would have caused it: for good prayers would be of no validity (as they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) in this extremity.</p>
               <p>Now in this extremity Capt. Littleworth gave commission to such as hee had found ready for such imployments, to enter in the howse at Ma-re-Mount,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Of the practise of their Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Church of the Seperatists, is governed by Pastors, Elders, and Deacons, and there is not

any of these (thouh hee be but a Cow keeper) but is allowed to exercise his guifts, in the publik assembly on the Lords day; so as hee doe not make use of any notes for the helpe of his memory: for such things they say smell of Lampe oyle, and there must be no such unsavery perfume admitted, to come into the congregation.</p>
               <p>These are all publike preachers. There is amongst these people a Deakonesse made of the sisters, that uses her guifts at home in an assembly of her sexe, by way of repetition, or exhortation: such is their practise.</p>
               <p>The Pastor (before hee is allowed of) must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime his former calling to the Ministry, as hereticall; and take a new calling after their fantasticall inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and then hee is admitted to bee their Pastor.</p>
               <p>The manner of disclaimeing is, to renounce hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And theire Pastors have this preheminence above the Civile Magistrate: Hee must first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of the complaint, made against a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and if hee be disposed to give the partie complained of, an admonition, there is no more to be said: if not; Hee delivers him over to the Magistrate to deale with him, in a course of Iustice, according to theire practise, in cases of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:25540:90"/>Of these pastors I have not knowne many: some I have observed; together with theire carriage in New Canaan: and can informe you what opinion hath bin conceaved of theire conditions, in the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer.

And how much these things are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the actions of mazed men, I leave to any indifferent man to judge: and if I should say, they are all much alike, they that have seene and heard, what I have done will not condemme mee altogether.</p>

               <p>So that it seemes (by theire discourse about the matter) they stood betwixt Hawke and Bussard: and could not tell which hand to incline unto. They had sounded him secretly: hee was content with it, goe which way it would.

               <p>But the Seperatists love not those good parts, when they proceede from a carnall man (as they call every good Protestant,) in shorte time had found the meanes to pick a quarrell with him.

the meanes must be used for defence.

               <p>If this be one of their guifts, then Machevill had as good gifts as they. Let them raise a scandall on any, though never so innocent; yet they know it is never wiped cleane out: the staind marks remaines: which hath bin well observed by one, in these words of his:

And thus they dealt with Sir Christopher: and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all the wayes, and meanes they could, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his undertakings in those parts.</p>
               <p>And therefore I cannot chuse, but conclude, that these Seperatists have speciall gifts: for they are given to envy, and malllice extremely.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of their defamacion could not please the gentleman well, when it came to his eare, which would cause him to make some reply, (as they supposed) to take exceptions at, as they did against Faire cloath: &amp; this would be a meanes, they thought, to blow the coale, and so to kindle a brand that might fire him out of the Country too, and send him after mine Host of Ma-re-Mount.</p>
               <p>They take occasion (some of them) to come to his howse when hee was gone up into the Country: and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:25540:95"/>
finding hee was from home) so went to worke, that they left him neither howse, nor habitation, nor ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, nor any thing to help him, if hee should retorne: but of that they had noe hope (as they gave it out) for hee was gone (as they affirmed) to leade a Salvage life; and for that cause tooke no company with him: and they, having considered of the matter, thought it not fit that any such man should live in so remoate a place, within the Compas of their patent. So they fired the place; and carried away the persons, and goods.</p>
               <p>Sir Christopher was gone with a guide (a Salvage) into the inland parts for discovery: but, before hee was returned, hee met with a Salvage that told the guide, Sir Christopher would be killed: Master Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perwell (who had now found out matter against him) would have him dead, or alive. This hee related; and would have the gentleman not to goe to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, because of the danger, that was supposed.</p>
               <p>But Sir Christopher was nothing dismaid: hee would on, whatsoever come of it; and so met with the Salvages: and betweene them was a terrible sker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish: But they had the worst of it, and hee scaped well enough.</p>
               <p>The guide was glad of it, and learnd of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that they were promised a great reward, for what they should doe in this imployment.</p>
               <p>Which thing (when Sir Christopher understood,) hee gave thanks to God; and after (upon this occasion, to sollace himselfe) in his table booke, hee composed this sonnet, which I have here inserted for a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall.<q>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ipp was unvitteled, and the Seamen put to straight allowance, which could hold out, but to the Canaries) a part of his owne provision, being two moneths proportion, in all but 3. small peeces of porke; which made him expect to be famished before the voyage should be ended, by all likelyhood. Yet hee thought hee would make one good meale, before hee died: like the Colony servant in Virginea, that before hee should goe to the gallowes) called to his wife to set on the loblolly pot, and let him have one good meale before hee went; who had committed a petty crime, that in those dayes, was made a cappitall offence.</p>
               <p>And now mine Host being merrily disposed, on went the peeces of porke, where with hee feasted his body, and cherished the poore Sailers: and got out of them what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Wethercock, their Master purposed to doe with him that hee had no more provision: &amp; along they sailed from place to place, from Iland to Iland, in a pittifull wether beaten ship; where mine Host was in more dainger (without all question) then Ionas, when hee was in the Whales belly; and it was the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God that they had not all perished. Vittelled they were but for a moneth when they wayd Ancor, and left the first port.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:25540:96"/>They were a pray for the enemy for want of powther, if they had met them: besides the vessell was a very slugg, and so unserviceable, that the Master called a counsell of all the company in generall, to have theire opinions, which way to goe, and how to beare the helme, who all under their hand affirmed the shipp to be unserviceable: so that in fine the Master, and men, and all were at their wits end about it: yet they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the Carpenters to search, and caulke her sides, and doe theire best whiles they were in her. Nine moneths they made a shifte to use her, and shifted for supply of vittells at all the Islands they touched at; though it were so poorely, that all those helpes, and the short allowance of a bisket a day, and a few Lymons taken in at the Canaries, served but to bring the vessell in view of the lands end.</p>
               <p>They were in such a desperat case, that (if God in his greate mercy had not favoured them, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the windes faire untill the vessell was in Plim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth roade,) they had without question perished; for when they let drop an Anchor, neere the Island of S. Michaels not one bit of foode left for all that starving allowance of this wretched wethercock; that if hee would have lanched out his beaver, might have bought more vittells in New England then he &amp; the whole ship with the Cargazoun was worth, (as the passingers hee carried who vittelled themselves affirmed,) But hee played the miserable wretch, &amp; had possessed his men with the contrary; who repented them of waying an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor before they knew so much.</p>
               <p>Mine Host of Ma-re-Mount (after hee had bin in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:25540:97"/>
the Whales belly) was set a shore to see if hee would now play Ionas, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> metamorphosed with a longe voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that hee looked like Lazarus in the painted cloath.</p>
               <p>But mine Host (after due consideration of the premisses) thought it fitter for him to play Ionas in this kinde, then for the Seperatists to play Ionas in that kinde as they doe. Hee therefore bid Wethercock tell the Seperatists, that they would be made in due time to repent those malitious practises, and so would hee too; for hee was a Seperatist amongst the Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists as farre as his wit would give him leave; though when hee came in Company of basket makers, hee would doe his indevoure to make them pinne the basket, if hee could, as I have seene him. And now mine Host being merrily disposed, haveing past many perillous adventures in that desperat Whales belly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne in a posture like Ionas, and cryed Repent you cruell Seperatists repent, there are as yet but 40. dayes if Iove vouchsafe to thunder, Charter and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Seperatists will fall a sunder: Repent you cruell Schismaticks repent. And in that posture hee greeted them by letters retorned into new Canaan; and ever (as opportunity was fitted for the purpose) he was both heard &amp; seene in the posture of Ionas against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crying repent you cruel Seperatists, repent, there are as yet but 40. dayes if Iove vouchsafe to thunder. The Charter and the Kingdome of the Seperatists will fall a sunder: Repent you cruell Schismaticks repent; If you will heare any more of this proclamation meete him at the next market towne, for <hi>Cynthius aurem vellet.</hi>
