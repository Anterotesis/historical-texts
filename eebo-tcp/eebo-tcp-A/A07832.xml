            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And the more to adde reputation to this tale, desires that his wifes and children might be harbered in one of our howses. This was graunted, and my neighbours put on corslets, headpeeces, and weapons defensive and offensive.</p>
               <p>This thing being knowne to Cheecatawback, hee caused some of his men to bring the Narohigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets to trade, that they might see the preparation.</p>

               <p>THis is a thinge not onely observed by mee, and diverse of the Salvages of New England, but also, by the French men in Nova Francia, and therefore I am the more incouraged to publish in this Treatice my observation of them, in the use of theire sences: which is a thinge that I should not easily have bin induced, to beleeve, if I my selfe, had not bin an eie witnesse, of what I shall relate.</p>

               <p>Their eies indeede are black as iett; and that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is accounted the strongest for sight. And as they excell us in this particular so much noted, so I thinke they excell us in all the rest.</p>
               <p>This I am sure, I have well observed, that in the sence of smelling, they have very great perfection: which is confirmed by the opinion of the French, that are planted about Canada, who have made relation, That they are so perfect in the use of that sence, that they will distinguish between a Spaniard and a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by the sent of the hand onely.<note place="margin">

               <p>ALthough these Salvages are found to be without Religion, Law, and King (as Sir William Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander hath well observed,) yet are they not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without the knowledge of God (historically) for they have it amongst them by tradition, that God made one man and one woman, and bad them live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and get children, kill deare, beasts, birds, fish, and fowle, and what they would at their pleasure; and that their posterity was full of evill, and made God so angry: that hee let in the Sea upon them, &amp; drowned the greatest part of them, that were naughty men, (the Lord destroyed so.)</p>

                     <hi>A Salvage desired to have his sonn brought up to learne the booke of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer.</hi>

                  <p>Of their Custome in burning the Country, and the reason thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Salvages are accustomed, to set fire of the Country in all places where they come; and to burne it, twize a yeare, vixe at the Spring, and the fall of the leafe. The reason that mooves them to doe so,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges fire the Country twice a yeare.</hi>
                  </note> is because it would other wise be so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne with underweedes, that it would be all a cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice wood, and the people would not be able in any wise to passe through the Country out of a beaten path.</p>
               <p>The meanes that they do it with, is with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine minerall stones, rhat they carry about them: in baggs made for that purpose of the skinnes of little beastes which they convert into good lether; carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the same a peece of touch wood (very excellent
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:25540:29"/>
for that purpose of their owne making. These mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall stones they have from the Piquenteenes (which is to the Southward of all the plantations in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) by trade and trafficke with those people.</p>
               <p>The burning of the grasse destroyes the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods, and so scorcheth the elder trees, that it shrinkes them, and hinders their grouth very much: So that hee that will looke to finde large trees, and good tymber, must not depend upon the help, of a woodden prospect to finde them on the upland ground; but must seeke for them, (as I and others have done) in the lower grounds where the grounds are wett when the Country is fired: by reason of the snow water that remaines there for a time, untill the Sunne by continuance of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t hath exhaled the vapoures of the earth, and dried up those places, where the fire (by reason of the moisture) can have no power to doe them any hurt: and if he would endevoure to finde out any goodly Cedars, hee must not seeke for them on the higher grounds, but make his inquest for them in the vallies, for the Salvages by this Custome of theirs, have spoiled all the rest: for this custome hath bin continued from the beginninge.</p>
               <p>And least their firing of the Country in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; should be an occasion of damnifying us, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daingering our habitations; wee our selves have used carefully about the same times; to observe the winds and fire the grounds about our owne habitations, to prevent the Dammage that might happen by any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect thereof, if t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:25540:30"/>For when the fire is once kindled, it dilates and spreads it selfe as well against, as with the winde; bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning continually night and day, untill a shewer of raine falls to quench it.</p>
               <p>And this custome of firing the Country is the meanes to make it passable, and by that meanes the trees growe here, and there as in our parks: and makes the Country very beautifull, and commodious.</p>

                  <p>Of the Fishes, and vvhat Commodity they proove.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AMong Fishes. First I will begin with the Codd; because it is the most commodious of all fish, as may appeare, by the use which is made of them in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Codd.</hi>
                  </note>The Codd fishing is much used in America, (whereof New England is a part) in so much as 300. Sayle of shipps, from divers parts, have used to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed yearely in that trade.</p>
               <p>

                  </note>I have seene in one Harboure, next Richmond Iland 15. Sayle of shipps at one time, that have taken in them, driyed Codds for Spaine, and the Straights (and it has bin found that the Saylers have made 15.18.20.22. p. share for a common man.</p>
               <p>The Coast aboundeth with such multitudes of Codd, that the inhabitants of New England doe dunge their grounds with Codd; and it is a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity better than the golden mines of the Spanish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; for without dried Codd the Spaniard, Portingal, and Italian, would not be able to vittel of a shipp for the Sea; and I am sure at the Canaries it is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall commodity: which place lyeth neere New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land

                     <hi>Oyle mayd of the livers of the Codd.</hi>
                  </note> and is a commodity that without question will enrich the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of New England quicly; and is therefore a principall commodity.</p>

There are such multitudes, that I have seene stopped into the river close adjoyning to my howse with a sand at one tide, so many as will loade a ship of a 100. Tonnes.</p>
               <p>Other places have greater quantities in so much, as wagers have bin layed, that one should not throw a stone in the water, but that hee should hit a fish.</p>
               <p>I my selfe, at the turning of the tyde, have seene such multitudes passe out of a pound, that it seemed to mee, that one might goe over their backs drishod.</p>
               <p>These follow the bayte up the rivers, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are follwed for bayte and chased into the bayes, and shallow waters, by the grand pise: and these may have also a prime place in the Catalogue of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>

               <p>The Fish is good, salted; for store against the winter, as well as fresh, and to be accounted a good Commodity.</p>
               <p>This Sturgeon in England is <hi>regalis piscis.</hi> every man in New England may catch what hee will, there are multitudes of them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sturgeon.</hi>
                  </note> and they are much fatter then those that are brought into England from other parts, in so much as by reason of their fatnesse, they doe not looke white, but yellow, which made a Cooke presume they were not so good as them of Roushea: silly fellow that could not understand that it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fish salted, or pickelled, the fatter the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower being best to preserve.</p>
               <p>For the taste I have warrant of Ladies of worth, with choise pallats for the commendations, who liked the taste so well, that they esteemed it beyond the Sturgeon of other parts, and sayd they were decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the lookes: therefore let the Sturgeon passe for a Commodity.</p>
               <p>Of Salmons there is greate abundance: and these may be allowed for a Commodity,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:25540:47"/>Of Eeles there is abundance, both in the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters, and in the fresh: and the fresh water Eele there (if I may take the judgement of a London Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger) is the best that hee hath found in his life time.

You may see in one towneship a hundred acres together, set with these Fish, every acre taking 1000. of them: and an acre thus dressed will produce and yeald so much corne, as 3. acres without fish: and (least any Virginea man would inferre hereupon, that the ground of New England is barren, because they use no fish in setting their corne, I desire them to be remembred, the cause is plaine in Virginea) they have it not to sett. But this practise is onely for the Indian Maize (which must be set by hands) not for English graine: and this is therefore a commodity there.</p>
               <p>There is a large sized fish called Hallibut,<note place="margin">

               <p>This being knowne, they shall passe for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to the inhabitants; for the Salvages will meete 500, or 1000. at a place where Lobsters come in with the tyde, to eate, and save dried for store, abiding in that place, feasting and sporting a moneth or 6. weekes together.</p>

               <p>THe Inhabitants of Pasonagessit (having translated the name of their habitation from that ancient Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage name to Ma-re Mount; and being resolved to have the new name confirmed for a memorial to after ages) did devise amongst themselves to have it performed in a solemne manner with Revels, &amp; merriment after the old English custome:<note place="margin">

And because they would have it in a compleat forme, they had prepared a song fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the time and present occasion. And upon May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day they brought the Maypole to the place appointed, with drumes, gunnes, pistols, and other fitting instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for that purpose; and there erected it with the help of Salvages, that came thether of purpose to see the manner of our Revels. A goodly pine tree of 80. foote longe, was reared up, with a peare of buckshorns nayled one, somewhat neare unto the top of it: where it stood as a faire sea marke for directions; how to finde out the way to mine Hoste of Ma-re Mount.</p>
               <p>And because it should more fully appeare to what end it was placed there, they had a poem in readines made, which was fixed to the Maypole, to shew the new name confirmed upon that plantation; which all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were made according to the occurrents

               <p>Oedipus is generally receaved for the absolute reader of riddles who is invoaked: Silla and Caribdis are two dangerous places for seamen to incounter, neere unto vennice, &amp; have bin by poets formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled to man and wife. The like licence the author challenged for a paire of his nomination, the one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting for the losse of the other as Niobe for her children. Amphitrite is an arme of the Sea, by which the newes was carried up and downe, of a rich widow, now to be tane up or laid downe. By Triton is the fame spread, that caused the Suters to muster; (as it had bin to Penellope of Greece) and the Coast lying circuler, all our passage to and froe, is made more convenient by Sea, then Land. Many aimed at this marke; but hee that played Proteus best and could comply with her humor must be the man, that would carry her, &amp; hee had need have Sampsons strenght to deale with a Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lila: and as much patience as Iob that should come there, for a thing that I did observe in the life time o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

playd Proteus (with the helpe of Priapus) put their noses out of joynt as the Proverbe is.</p>
               <p>And this the whole company of the Revellers at Ma-re Mount, knew to be the true sence and exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the riddle: that was fixed to the Maypole, which the Seperatists were at defiance with? some of them affirmed, that the first institution thereof, was in memory of a whore; not knowing that it was a Trophe erected at first, in honor of Maja, the Lady of learning which they despise; vilifying the two universities with uncivile termes; accounting what is there obtained by studdy is but unnecessary learning; not considering that learninge does inable mens mindes to converse with climents of a higher nature then is to be found within the habitation of the Mole.</p>

               <p>They set upon my honest host at a place, called Wessaguscus, where (by accident) they found him. The inhabitants there were in good hope, of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion of the plantation at Mare Mount, (which they principally aymed at;) and the rather, because mine host was a man that indeavoured to advaunce the dignity of the Church of England; which they (on the contrary part) would laboure to vilifie; with uncivile termes: enveying against the sacred booke of common prayer, and mine host that used it in a laudable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner amongst his family, as a practise of piety.</p>

And because they answer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It appeares, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In breife, mine host must indure to be their prisoner, untill they could contrive it so, that they might send him for England, (as they said,) there to suffer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the merrit of the fact, which they intended to father upon him; supposing (belike) it would proove a hainous crime.</p>
               <p>Much rejoycing was made that they had gotten their cappitall enemy (as they concluded him) whome they purposed to hamper in such sort, that hee should not be able to uphold his plantation at Ma-re Mount</p>

him thether: and these two persons promised theire aides in the quarrell, and confirmed that promise with a health in good rosa solis.</p>
               <p>Now Captaine Shrimp, the first Captaine in the Land (as hee supposed,) must doe some new act to repaire this losse, and to vindicate his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, who had sustained blemish, by this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight.

               <p>Hee takes eight persons more to him, and (like the nine Worthies of New Canaan) they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque with preparation against Ma-re-Mount, where this Monster of a man (as theire phrase was) had his denne; the whole number, (had the rest not bin from home, being but seaven,) would have given Captaine Shrimpe (a quondam Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,) such a wellcome, as would have made him wish for a Drume as bigg as Diogenes tubb, that hee might have crept into it out of sight.</p>

               <p>But mine Host no sooner had set open the dore and issued out: but instantly Captaine Shrimpe, and the rest of the worties stepped to him, layd hold of his armes; and had him downe, and so eagerly was every

               </argument>
               <p>THe nine Worthies of New Canaan having now the Law in their owne hands (there being no generall
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:25540:75"/>
Governour in the Land: nor none of the Seperation that regarded, the duety they owe their Soveraigne, whose naturall borne Subjects they were: though translated out of Holland: from whence they had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to worke all to their owne ends, and make a great shew of Religion, but no humanity, for they were now to sit in Counsell on the cause.</p>
               <p>And much it stood mine honest Host upon, to be very circumspect, and to take Eacus to taske: for that his voyce was more allowed of, then both the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and had not mine Host confounded all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that Eacus could make in their defence: and confuted him that swaied the rest, they would have made him unable to drinke in such manner of merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any more. So that following this private coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, given him by one that knew who ruled the rost, the Hiracano ceased that els would split his pinace.</p>
               <p>A conclusion was made, and sentence given, that mine Host should be sent to England a prisoner. But when hee was brought to the shipps for that purpose, no man durst be so foole hardy as to undertake to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him. So these Worthies set mine Host upon an Island, without gunne, powther, or shot, or dogge, or so much as a knife,<note place="margin">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:25540:75"/>
into a league of brother hood with mine Host; so full of humanity are these infidels before those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
               <p>From this place for England, sailed mine Host in a Plimmoth shipp, (that came into the Land to fish upon the Coast,) that landed him safe in England at Plimmouth, and hee stayed in England untill the ordinary time for shipping to set forth for these parts; and then retorned: Noe man being able to taxe him of any thinge.</p>

                  <p>After a parly, hee capitulated with them about the quarter, they proffered him, if hee would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to goe for England, there to answere (as they pretended) some thing they could object against him principall to the generall: But what it would be hee cared not, neither was it any thing materiall.</p>

               <p>THe Church of Plimmouth having due regard to the weale publike, and the Brethren, that were to come over; and knowing that they would be busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployed to make provision for the cure of Soules, and therefore might neglect the body for that time: did hold themselves to be in duety bound, to make search for a fitting man that might be able, (if so neede requir'd) to take the chardge upon him in that place of imployment:<note place="margin">

                  </note> and therefore called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the whole Synagoge: amongst which company they chose out a man, that long time had bin nurst up in the tender bosome of the Church: one that had
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:25540:79"/>
speciall gifts: hee could wright and reade, nay more: hee had tane the oath of abjuration, which is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall stepp, yea and a maine degree unto perferment, Him they weane: and out of Phaos boxe fitt him with speciall guifts of no lesse worth: they stile him Doctor and forth they send him to gaine imployement and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</p>
               <p>What luck is it I cannot hit on his name: but I will give you him by a periphrasis, that you may know him when you meete him next.</p>
               <p>Hee was borne at Wrington in the County of Somerset, where hee was bred a Butcher. Hee weares a longe beard, and a Garment like the Greeke that beggd in Pauls Church. This new made Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor comes to Salem to congratulate: where hee findes some are newly come from Sea, and ill at ease.</p>
               <p>Hee takes the patient, and the urinall: vies the State there: findes the Crasis Syptomes, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomi natantes: and tells the patient that his disease was winde, which hee had tane by gapeing, feasting, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver board at Sea, but hee would quickly ease him of that greife, and quite expell the winde. And this hee did performe, with his gifts hee had: and then hee handled the patient so handsomely, that hee ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him of all the winde, hee had in an instant.</p>
               <p>And yet I hope this man may be forgiven, if hee were made a fitting Plant for Heaven.</p>
               <p>How hee went to worke with his gifts is a question: yet hee did a great cure for Captaine Littleworth, hee cured him of a disease called a wife: and yet I hope this man may be forgiven, if shee were made a fitting plant for heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:25540:79"/>By this meanes hee was allowed 4. p. a moneth, and the chirgeons chest, and made Phisition gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of Salem: where hee exercised his gifts so well, that of full 42. that there hee tooke to cure, there is not one has more cause to complaine, or can say black's his eie. This saved Captaine Littleworths credit, that had truck'd away the vittels: though it brought forth a scandall on the Country by it, and then I hope this man may be forgiven, if they were all made fitting plants for Heaven.</p>
               <p>But in mine opinion, hee deserves to be set upon a palfrey, and lead up and downe in triumph throw new Canaan, with a coller of Iurdans about his neck, as was one of like desert in Richard the seconds time through the streets of London, that men might know where to finde a Quacksaluer.</p>

               <p>ALthough the nine Worthies had left mine Hoste upon an Island, in such an inhumane manner, as yee heard before; yet when they understood that hee had got shipping, and was gone to England of his owne accord, they dispatched letters of advise to an Agent they had there: and by the next shipp sent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to have a snare made, that might hamper mine Host so, as hee might not any more trouble theire conscience: and to that end,<note place="margin">

               <p>Some contributed three pounds; some foure, some five pounds, and procured a pretty quantity by that Devise, which should be given to a cunning man, that could make a snare to hamper him.</p>

               <p>These are all publike preachers. There is amongst these people a Deakonesse made of the sisters, that uses her guifts at home in an assembly of her sexe, by way of repetition, or exhortation: such is their practise.</p>
               <p>The Pastor (before hee is allowed of) must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime his former calling to the Ministry, as hereticall; and take a new calling after their fantasticall inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and then hee is admitted to bee their Pastor.</p>
               <p>The manner of disclaimeing is, to renounce hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:25540:90"/>Of these pastors I have not knowne many: some I have observed; together with theire carriage in New Canaan: and can informe you what opinion hath bin conceaved of theire conditions, in the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer.

If they sent mine Host a way by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, hee is in possibility to survive, to their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace for the injury done: if they suffer him to stay, &amp; put him in <hi>statu quo prius,</hi> all the vulgar people will conclude they have bin too rashe in burning a howse that was usefull, and count them men unadvised.</p>
               <p>So that it seemes (by theire discourse about the matter) they stood betwixt Hawke and Bussard: and could not tell which hand to incline unto. They had sounded him secretly: hee was content with it, goe which way it would. Nay shackles himselfe, (who was imployed in the burning of the howse, and therefore feared to be caught in England) and others were so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in putting mine Host <hi>in statu quo prius,</hi> after they had found their error, (which was so apparent that Luceus eies would have served to have found it out in lesse time) that they would contribute 40. shillings a peece towards it; and affirmed, that every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ability that had a hand in this black designe should be taxed to a Contribution in like nature: it would be done exactly.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Sir Christopher Gardiner Knight, and hovv hee spedd amongst the Seperatists.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SIr Christopher Gardiner, (a Knight, that had bin a traveller, both by Sea and Land; a good judicious gentleman in the Mathematticke, and other Sciences usefull for Plantations Kimistry, &amp;c. and also being a practicall Enginer) came into those parts, intending discovery.</p>
               <p>But the Seperatists love not those good parts, when they proceede from a carnall man (as they call every good Protestant,) in shorte time had found the meanes to pick a quarrell with him. The meanes is, that they pursue to obtaine what they aime at: the word is there the meanes.</p>
               <p>So that when they finde any man like to proove an enemy to their Church, and state, then straight
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:25540:94"/>
the meanes must be used for defence. The first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in their Politiques is, to defame the man at whom they aime. and then hee is a holy Israelite in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who can spread that fame brodest, like butter upon a loafe: no matter how thin; it will serve for a vaile: and then this man (who they have thus depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) is a spotted uncleane leaper: hee must out, least hee pollute the Land, and them that are cleane.</p>
               <p>If this be one of their guifts, then Machevill had as good gifts as they. Let them raise a scandall on any, though never so innocent; yet they know it is never wiped cleane out: the staind marks remaines: which hath bin well observed by one, in these words of his:
<q>
                     <l>Stick Candles gainst a Virgin walls white back:</l>
                     <l>If they'l not burne yet at the least they'l black.</l>
                  </q>
And thus they dealt with Sir Christopher: and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all the wayes, and meanes they could, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his undertakings in those parts.</p>
               <p>And therefore I cannot chuse, but conclude, that these Seperatists have speciall gifts: for they are given to envy, and malllice extremely.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of their defamacion could not please the gentleman well, when it came to his eare, which would cause him to make some reply, (as they supposed) to take exceptions at, as they did against Faire cloath: &amp; this would be a meanes, they thought, to blow the coale, and so to kindle a brand that might fire him out of the Country too, and send him after mine Host of Ma-re-Mount.</p>
               <p>They take occasion (some of them) to come to his howse when hee was gone up into the Country: and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:25540:95"/>
finding hee was from home) so went to worke, that they left him neither howse, nor habitation, nor ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, nor any thing to help him, if hee should retorne: but of that they had noe hope (as they gave it out) for hee was gone (as they affirmed) to leade a Salvage life; and for that cause tooke no company with him: and they, having considered of the matter, thought it not fit that any such man should live in so remoate a place, within the Compas of their patent. So they fired the place; and carried away the persons, and goods.</p>
               <p>Sir Christopher was gone with a guide (a Salvage) into the inland parts for discovery: but, before hee was returned, hee met with a Salvage that told the guide, Sir Christopher would be killed: Master Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perwell (who had now found out matter against him) would have him dead, or alive. This hee related; and would have the gentleman not to goe to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, because of the danger, that was supposed.</p>
               <p>But Sir Christopher was nothing dismaid: hee would on, whatsoever come of it; and so met with the Salvages: and betweene them was a terrible sker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish: But they had the worst of it, and hee scaped well enough.</p>
               <p>The guide was glad of it, and learnd of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that they were promised a great reward, for what they should doe in this imployment.</p>
               <p>Which thing (when Sir Christopher understood,) hee gave thanks to God; and after (upon this occasion, to sollace himselfe) in his table booke, hee composed this sonnet, which I have here inserted for a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall.<q>

Yet hee thought hee would make one good meale, before hee died: like the Colony servant in Virginea, that before hee should goe to the gallowes) called to his wife to set on the loblolly pot, and let him have one good meale before hee went; who had committed a petty crime, that in those dayes, was made a cappitall offence.</p>
               <p>And now mine Host being merrily disposed, on went the peeces of porke, where with hee feasted his body, and cherished the poore Sailers: and got out of them what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Wethercock, their Master purposed to doe with him that hee had no more provision: &amp; along they sailed from place to place, from Iland to Iland, in a pittifull wether beaten ship; where mine Host was in more dainger (without all question) then Ionas, when hee was in the Whales belly; and it was the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God that they had not all perished. Vittelled they were but for a moneth when they wayd Ancor, and left the first port.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:25540:96"/>They were a pray for the enemy for want of powther, if they had met them: besides the vessell was a very slugg, and so unserviceable, that the Master called a counsell of all the company in generall, to have theire opinions, which way to goe, and how to beare the helme, who all under their hand affirmed the shipp to be unserviceable: so that in fine the Master, and men, and all were at their wits end about it: yet they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the Carpenters to search, and caulke her sides, and doe theire best whiles they were in her. Nine moneths they made a shifte to use her, and shifted for supply of vittells at all the Islands they touched at; though it were so poorely, that all those helpes, and the short allowance of a bisket a day, and a few Lymons taken in at the Canaries, served but to bring the vessell in view of the lands end.</p>
               <p>They were in such a desperat case, that (if God in his greate mercy had not favoured them, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the windes faire untill the vessell was in Plim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth roade,) they had without question perished; for when they let drop an Anchor, neere the Island of S. Michaels not one bit of foode left for all that starving allowance of this wretched wethercock; that if hee would have lanched out his beaver, might have bought more vittells in New England then he &amp; the whole ship with the Cargazoun was worth, (as the passingers hee carried who vittelled themselves affirmed,) But hee played the miserable wretch, &amp; had possessed his men with the contrary; who repented them of waying an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor before they knew so much.</p>
               <p>Mine Host of Ma-re-Mount (after hee had bin in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:25540:97"/>
the Whales belly) was set a shore to see if hee would now play Ionas, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> metamorphosed with a longe voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that hee looked like Lazarus in the painted cloath.</p>
               <p>But mine Host (after due consideration of the premisses) thought it fitter for him to play Ionas in this kinde, then for the Seperatists to play Ionas in that kinde as they doe. Hee therefore bid Wethercock tell the Seperatists, that they would be made in due time to repent those malitious practises, and so would hee too; for hee was a Seperatist amongst the Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists as farre as his wit would give him leave; though when hee came in Company of basket makers, hee would doe his indevoure to make them pinne the basket, if hee could, as I have seene him. And now mine Host being merrily disposed, haveing past many perillous adventures in that desperat Whales belly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne in a posture like Ionas, and cryed Repent you cruell Seperatists repent, there are as yet but 40. dayes if Iove vouchsafe to thunder, Charter and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Seperatists will fall a sunder: Repent you cruell Schismaticks repent. And in that posture hee greeted them by letters retorned into new Canaan; and ever (as opportunity was fitted for the purpose) he was both heard &amp; seene in the posture of Ionas against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> crying repent you cruel Seperatists, repent, there are as yet but 40. dayes if Iove vouchsafe to thunder. The Charter and the Kingdome of the Seperatists will fall a sunder: Repent you cruell Schismaticks repent; If you will heare any more of this proclamation meete him at the next market towne, for <hi>Cynthius aurem vellet.</hi>
