            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>VVE have underſtood, to our great grief and ſorrow, that our Holy Father the POPE hath written a Breve to your Majeſty, by which he doth not only exhort and require you not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

               <hi>Right of Regale,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he declares, that he will make uſe of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if your Majeſty will not ſubmit to the Paternal Remonſtrances that he hath both made, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to you upon this point.</p>
            <p>We have judged it, Sire, our Duty not to be ſilent upon ſuch an important Occaſion as this is, where we ſhall ſuffer, with a moſt ſenſible and extraordinary affliction, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to threaten the eldeſt Son, and the Protector of the Church, as He hath done at other times, and upon other accompts, thoſe Princes who have uſurped his Rights. 'Tis not the leaſt of our deſign to enter with your Majeſty into the bottom of an Affair: Wherein our Predeceſſors of the like Aſſemblies have received upon divers occaſions ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable Marks of your Juſtice and your Piety; but this extraordinary Procedure gives us a moſt wonderful trouble, for it is ſo far from maintaining the honour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the glory of the Holy-See, that in all likelihood it is enough to leſſen them, and to produce very ill effects. It is but too plain and evident that he would not do this, but to favour the malice of ſome turbulent and ſeditious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that, contrary to the Intentions of his Holineſs, which we look upon to be very good, would make uſe of his Name and his Authority, as they do every day, in letting extravagant Roports fly abroad in the World, againſt the honour of your Majeſty, and the moſt qualified Prelates of your Kingdom. They do alſo indeavour what they can to ſtir up a miſ-underſtanding between the Prieſthood and the Royalty, and that at ſuch a time, when they have more reaſon than ever to preſerve a perfect Union, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection you give to the Faith, to the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline,

               <!-- PDF PAGE 35 -->and to the extirpation of Hereſies and Novelties. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſic for us, Sire, being ſupported by your Majeſty, to prevent ſo pernicious and fatal an Evil, either by making known our Sentiments to his Holineſs, with obſerving that reſpect that is due to him, or by taking up Reſolutions commenſurate to the Prudence and the Zeal of the greateſt Prelates of the Church. Our Predeceſſors very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood upon the like conjunctures how to maintain the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of their Churches, without departing from thoſe Meaſures of reſpect which their Birth and their Religion have inſpired into them for KINGS: And as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, Sire, ſurpaſſes by your Zeal and your Authority all thoſe that have been before you, we are ſo ſtrictly ingaged and fixt to it, that nothing is capable of effecting any ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from it. This Proteſtation being ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the vain enterprizes and attempts of the Enemies of the Holy-See, and the State, we deſire to renew it to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty with all the ſincerity and the affection as is poſſible for us, it being fit that all the world ſhould be informed, that we <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
