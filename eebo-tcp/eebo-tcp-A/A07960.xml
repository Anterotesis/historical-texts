            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Enitence, is the griefe and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart for the sins and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces committed, together with an earnest purpose and desire to forsake them, and to be clensed of them, that grace may be restored, by such meanes as GOD hath lefte whereby to obtaine it. To


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:26958:4"/>
say thou art sorie for thy sins co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted against the diuine maiesty, and yet hast a liking thereof, or some remnant of a will or purpose in thy hart to renew them againe, it is but wicked dissumulation &amp; deriding of the holy action of Penitence, without which no sinner can wel hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to saluation. Let such take this for admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both dreadful and often verified, they are most likely to be pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uented


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:26958:4"/>
and ouertaken with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God, whose mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful fauor in giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient space and means to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pent, they haue neglected and ouerpassed, and so shal be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed both of time, and the necessary means to their forgiuenesse.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it will be most safety, readily to embrace Gods mercy when it is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with some deuotion, fear and dread of his iustice. Like


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:26958:5"/>
as it is a thing most dreadful to despaire of forgiuenes, or vpon presuming of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and forgiuenes, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere in a delight &amp; liking of the former sins and offences</p>
                  <p>Penitence is thought to consist of three thinges: viz. Contrition, which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward griefe and hearty sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for our sinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to the impairing of that dignity, and polluting of that purity, whereunto wee


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:26958:5"/>
attained by our calling in Baptisme, but especially to the prouocation of GODS wrath thereby. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and inward motion of grace, mooueth and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saileth to procéede to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold sins, and accusing of our selues in the court of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by confession, there to iudge our selues least we bée iudged of the Lorde.</p>
                  <p>And sith the account of our


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:26958:6"/>
life and offences committed, is the waightiest cause that any mortall man can passe through and deale with in his life, it is to be attempted and taken in hand, rather with all care, feare and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence possible, then sleightly &amp; superficially, without due regard which we vtterly dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>alow of, in the meanest of our worldly causes.</p>
                  <p>Then resteth the thirde parte, which is restitution,


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:26958:6"/>
and amends making, which some do cal satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is not to be taken as though we are able by any workes or merits to deserue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of our sinnes, or to yéelde any méete recompence to God, for offending and displeasing his diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, for in that respect, Christ in his most precious bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedding, hath wrought a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for vs, if wee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perfourme our dueties,


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:26958:7"/>
thereby to bee partakers in that benefite, as by his holy word and the counsaile of the holy Ghost, in his Church, hee hath willed vs. But the satisfaction belonging of our parts, is the humbling of our hearts, the brideling of our fleshly appetites, the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fruits in expres actions to the world: as in almes, prayer, fasting, abating of our pride &amp; pompe in our apparell, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charitable

bestowing of our superfluity to the comfort and reliefe of the needy, or otherwise to the honour of God or good example in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.

But if thy good pleasure bee such, that thou wilt needes visit our iniquities with this temporall punishment, so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vs, I beséech thee, that bearing thy fatherly hande, laide vppon vs, wee dispaire not in thy chastisement.
