            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>

we could be content,
with Plato, that
knowledge were but
Remembrance; that
Intellectuall acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were but Remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscentiall
evocation,
and new impressions
but the colourishing of old stamps which stood
pale in the soul before. For, what is worse know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is made by oblivion; and to purchase a clear
and warrantable body of Truth, we must forget
and part with much wee know. Our tender En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
taking up Learning at large, and together
with true and assured notions, receiving many,
wherein our renewing judgements doe finde no
satisfaction; and therefore in this Encyclopaedie
and round of knowledge, like the great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
<pb facs="tcp:50218:3"/>
wheeles of heaven, wee must observe
two Circles: that while we are daily carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ut,
and whirled on by the swindge and rapt of
the one, wee may maintaine a naturall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
course, in the slow and sober wheele of the
other. And this wee shall more readily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
if we timely survey our knowledge; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
singling out those encroachments,
which junior compliance and popular credulity
hath admitted. Whereof at present wee have
endeavoured a long and serious <hi>Adviso;</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
not onely a large and copious List, but
from experience and reason, attempting their
decisions.</p>
            <p>And first wee crave exceeding pardon in the
audacity of the Attempt; humbly acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
a worke of such concernment unto truth,
and difficulty in it selfe, did well deserve the
conjunction of many heads: And surely
more advantageous had it beene unto Truth, to
have fallen into the endeavours of some coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
advancers, that might have performed it
to the life, and added authority thereto: which
the privacie of our condition, and unequall
abilities cannot expect. Whereby notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wee have not beene diverted, nor have our
solitary attempts beene so discouraged, as to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
the favourable looke of learning upon our
<pb facs="tcp:50218:3"/>
single and unsupported endeavours.</p>
            <p>Nor have wee let fall our penne, upon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of contradiction, unbeleefe, and
difficulty of disswasion from radicated beliefs, and
points of high prescription; although we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sensible how hardly teaching yeares do learn;
what roots old age contracteth into errours, and
how such as are but twigges in younger dayes,
grow Oaks in our elder heads, and become inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible
unto the powerfullest arme of reason. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we have also beheld, what cold requitals
others have found in their severall redemptions
of truth; and how their ingenuous enquiries
have been dismissed with censure, and obloquie
of singularities.</p>
            <p>Some consideration we hope from the course
of our Profession, which though it leadeth us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
many truths that passe undiscerned by others,
yet doth it disturbe their communications, and
much interrupteth the office of our pens in their
well intended transmissions: and therefore surely
in this wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke attempts will exceed performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:

                  </gap>.</note> And therefore
also perhaps it hath not found that regular and
constant stile, those infallible experiments, and
those assured determinations, which the subject
<pb facs="tcp:50218:4"/>
sometime requireth, and might be expected from
others, whose quiet doors and unmolested hours
afford no such distractions. Although who shall
indifferently pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pend the exceeding difficulty,
which either the obscurity of the subject, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
paradoxologie must often put upon the
Attemptor, will easily discerne, a worke of
this nature is not to bee performed upon one
legge, and should smell of oyle if duly and
deservedly handled.</p>
            <p>Our first intentions considering the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
interest of Truth, resolved to propose it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Latine republike and equall judges of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;
but owing in the first place this service un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Country, and therein especially unto its
ingenuous Gentry, we have declared our selfe in
a language best conceived. Although I confesse,
the quality of the Subject will sometimes carry
us into expressions beyond meere English ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions;
and indeed, if elegancie still pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth,
and English Pennes maintaine that
stream wee have of late observed to flow from
many, wee shall within few yeares bee faine to
learne Latine to understand English, and a work
will prove of equall facility in either. Nor have
wee addressed our penne or stile unto the people,
(whom Bookes doe not redresse, and are this
way incapable of reduction) but unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:50218:4"/>
and leading part of Learning; as well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
(at least probably hoping) except they
be watered from higher regions, and fructifying
meteors of knowledge, these weeds must lose
their alimentall sappe and wither of themselves;
whose conserving influence, could our endeavors
prevent, wee should trust the rest unto the sythe
of time, and hopefull dominion of truth.</p>
            <p>Wee hope it will not bee unconsidered, that
wee finde no open tract, or constant manuducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this Labyrinth; but are oft-times faine to
wander in the America and untravelled parts of
truth: For though not many years past, Dr. Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
hath made a learned &amp; full Discourse of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Errors in Physick, yet have we discussed but
two or three thereof. Laurentius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oubertus, by
the same title led our expectation into thoughts
of great releef; whereby notwithstanding we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
no advantage; it answering scarce at all the
promise of the inscription. Nor perhaps (if it
were yet extant) should wee finde any farther
Assistance from that ancient peece of Andreas,
pretending the same title. And therefore wee
are often constrained to stand alone against the
strength of opinion; and to meet the Goliah and
Gyant of Authority, with contemptible pibbles,
and feeble arguments, drawne from the scrip and
slender stocke of our selves. Nor have wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb facs="tcp:50218:5"/>
scarce named any Author whose name we
doe not honour; and if detraction could invite
us, discretion surely would containe us from any
derogatory intention, where highest pennes
and friendiest eloquence must faile in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
            <p>And therefore also wee cannot but hope the
equitable considerations and candour of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
mindes. We cannot expect the frowne of
<hi>Theologie</hi> herein; nor can they which behold the
present state of things, and controversie of points
so long received in Divinity, condemne our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
enquiries in the doubtfull appertinancies of
Arts, and Receptaries of Philosophy. Surely
Philologers and Criticall Discoursers, who look
beyond the shell and obvious exteriours of
things, will not be angry with our narrower ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorations.
And wee cannot doubt, our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in Physicke (whose knowledge in naturals
will lead them into a nearer apprehension of
many things delivered) will friendly accept, if
not countenance our endeavours. Nor can we
conceive it, may be unwelcome unto those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
Worthies, who endeavour the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Learning: as being likely to finde a
clearer progression, when so many rubbes are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled,
and many untruths taken off, which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
as principles with common beliefes, disturb
<pb facs="tcp:50218:5"/>
the tranquility of Axiomes, which otherwise
might bee raysed. And wise men cannot but
know, that Arts and Learning want this expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:
and if the course of truth bee permitted
unto its selfe, like that of Time and uncorrected
computations, it cannot escape many errours,
which duration still enlargeth.</p>
            <p>Lastly, wee are not Magisteriall in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor have wee Dictator-like obtruded our
conceptions, but in the humility of Enquiries or
disquisitions, have only proposed them unto more
ocular discerners. And therefore opinions are
free, and open it is for any to thinke or declare
the contrary. And wee shall so farre encourage
contradiction, as to promise no disturbance, or
reoppose any Penne, that shall Elenchically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
us, that shall onely lay hold of our lapses,
single out digressions, Corollaries, or ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
conceptions, to evidence his own in as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
truths. And shall only take notice of such,
whose experimentall and Iudicious knowledge
shall solemnly looke upon it; not onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
of ours, but to establish of his owne, not
to traduce or extenuate, but to explaine, and
dilucidate, to adde and ampliate, according to
the laudable custome of the Ancients in their

               </gap>er promotions of Learning. Vnto whom
notwithstanding, wee shall not contentiously
<pb facs="tcp:50218:6"/>
rejoyne, or onely to justifie our owne, but to
applaud or confirme his maturer assertions; and
shall conferre what is in us unto his name and
honour. Ready to bee swallowed in any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
enlarger: as having acquired our end, if any
way, or under any name wee may obtaine a
worke, so much desired, at least, desiderated of
truth.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first and father cause of common Error, is the
common infirmity of humane nature; of whose
deceptible condition, although perhaps there
should not need any other eviction, then the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
errors, we shall our selves commit, even in
the expresse declarement hereof: Yet shall wee
illustrate the same from more infallible consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
and persons presumed as farre from us in
condition, as time, that is our first and ingenerated forefathers, from
whom as we derive our being, and the severall wounds of constitution,
so may wee in some manner excuse our infirmities in the depravity of
those parts, whose traductions were pure in them, and their originalls
but once removed from God. Yet notwithstanding (if posterity may
take leave to judge of the fact, as they are assured, to suffer in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
were grossely deceived in their perfection, and so weakly delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the clarity of their understanding, that it hath left no small ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ity
in ours, how error should gaine upon them.</p>
               <p>For first, they were deceived by Satan, and that not in an invisible
insinuation, but an open and discoverable apparition; that is, in the form
of a Serpent; whereby although there were many occasions of suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and such as could not easily escape a weaker circumspection, yet did
the unwary apprehension of Eve take no advantage thereof. It hath
therefore seemed strange unto some, shee should be deluded by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
or subject her reason unto a beast of the field, which God had
subjected unto hers. It hath empuzzeled the enquiries of others to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
and enforced them unto strange conceptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make out
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50218:11"/>
how without feare or doubt she could discourse with such a creature,
or heare a Serpent speake, without suspition of imposture. The wits of
others, have been so bold as to accuse her simplicity in receiving his
temptation so coldly, and when such specious effects of the fruit were
promised, as to make them like gods, not to desire, at least not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
he pursued not that benefit himselfe; and had it been their owne
case would perhaps have replied, If the taste of this fruit maketh the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
like gods, why remainest thou a beast? If it maketh us but like
gods, we are so already. If thereby our eyes shall be opened hereafter,
they are at present quicke enough to discover thy deceit, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
them no opener to behold our owne shame. If to know good and
evill be our advantage, although we have free will unto both, wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to performe but one, we know 'tis good to obey the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, but evill if we transgresse it.</p>
               <p>They were deceived by one another, &amp; in the greatest disadvantage
of delusion, that is the stronger by the weaker: For Eve presented the
fruit, and Adam received it from her. Thus the Serpent was cunning
enough to begin the deceit in the weaker; and the weaker of strength,
sufficient to consummate the fraud in the stronger. Art and fallacy was
used unto her, a naked offer proved sufficient unto him: so his superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was his ruin, &amp; the fertility of his sleep, an issue of death unto him.
And although the condition of sex &amp; posterity of creation might some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
extenuate the error of the woman: Yet was it very strange and

it, neither shall you touch it lest perhaps you dye. In which delivery,
there were no lesse then two mistakes, or rather additionall mendacites;
for the commandement forbids not the touch of the fruit, and positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said ye shall surely dye, but she extenuating replied, <hi>ne forte <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lest perhaps ye dye. For so in the vulgar translation it runneth,
and so is it expressed in the Thargum or Paraphrase of Jonathan. And
therefore although it be said, and that very truly that the divell was a
liar from the beginning, yet was the woman herein the first expresse
beginner, and falsified twice before the replye of Satan, and therefore
also to speak strictly, the sin of the fruit was not the first offence, they

text; That when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
that it was pleasant unto the eye, and a tree to be desired to make one
wise, she tooke of the fruit thereof and did eat. Now hereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that Eve before the fall, was by the same and beaten way of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements

                  </gap>beliefe
of their mortality, even after they had eat of the fruit. For Eve
observing no immediate execution of the curse, she delivered the fruit
unto Adam, who after the taste thereof, perceiving himselfe still to
live, might yet remaine in doubt, whether he had incurred death,
which perhaps he did not indubitably believe, untill he was after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
in the visible example of Abel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he that would not believe
the menace of God at first, it may be doubted whether before an ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
example hee believed the curse at last, and therefore they are not
without all reason, who have disputed the fact of Cain, that is although
he purposed to mischiefe, whether he intended to murther his brother,
or designed that, whereof he had not beheld an example in his owne
kinde, there might be somewhat in it that he would not have done, or
desired undone, when he brake forth as desperately as before hee had
done unmannerly, My iniquity is greater then can be forgiven me.</p>
               <p>Some nicities I confesse there are which extenuate, but many more

foreknew the advent of Christ, or the reparation of his error by

unto his owne resolution, whose determinations we cannot hope from

               <p>Lastly, man was not only deceiveable in his integrity, but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
of light in all their clarity. He that said he would bee like the
highest did erre if in some way he conceived himselfe not so already;
but in attempting so high an effect from himselfe, hee mis-understood
the nature of God, and held a false apprehension of his owne; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
vainly attempting not only insolencies, but impossibilities, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
himselfe as low as hell. In briefe, there is nothing infallible but
God, who cannot possibly erre. For things are really true as they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond
unto his conception, and have so much of verity, as they hold
of conformity unto that intellect, in whose Idea they had their first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations:
And therefore being the rule he cannot bee irregular,

               <p>BEing thus deluded before the fall, it is no wonder if their conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
were deceitfull, and could scarce speake without an error
after; for what is very remarkable (and no man I know hath yet obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
in the relation of Scripture before the flood, there is but one speech
delivered by man, wherein there is not an erronious conception; and
strictly examined, most hainously injurious unto truth. The penne of
Moses is briefe in the account before the flood, and the speeches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
are six.</p>
               <p>The first is that of Adam, when upon the expostulation of God, he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50218:12"/>
replyed; I heard thy voice in the garden, and because I was naked, I
hid my selfe: In which reply, there was included a very grosse mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
and if with pertinacity maintained, a high and capitall errour: for
thinking by this retirement to obscure himselfe from God, he infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the omnisciency and essentiall ubiquity of his Maker; who as he
created all things, so is he beyond and in them all, not onely in power,
as under his subjection, or in his presence, as being in his cognition, but
in his very Ess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce, as being the soule of their cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alities, and the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
cause of their existences. Certainely his posterity at this distance
and after so perpetuated an impayrement, cannot but condemne the
poverty of his conception, that thought to obscure himselfe from
his Creator in the shade of the garden, who had beheld him before in
the darkenesse of his Chaos, and in the obscurity of nothing; that
thought to flye from God, which could not flye himselfe, or imagined
that one tree should conceale his nakednesse from Gods eye, as another
had revealed it unto his owne. Those tormented spirits that wish the
mountaines to cover them, have fallen upon desires of lesse absurdity,
and chosen wayes of lesse improbable concealement; though this be
also as ridiculous unto reason, as fruitlesse unto their desires; for he that
laid the foundations of the earth, cannot be excluded the secrecy of
the mountains, nor can there any thing escape the perspicacity of those
eyes which were before light, and unto whose opticks there is no opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
This is the consolation of all good men, unto whom his ubiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
affordeth continuall comfort and security: And this is the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of hell, unto whom it affordeth despaire, and remedilesse calamity.
For those restlesse spirits that flye the face of the Almighty, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
the fruition of his eye, would also avoid the extent of his
hand; which being impossible, their sufferings are desperate, and their
afflictions without evasion, untill they can get out of Trismegistus his
circle, that is, to extend their wings above the universe, and pitch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
ubiquity it selfe.</p>
               <p>The second is that speech of Adam unto God, the woman whom
thou gavest me to be with me, she gave me of the Tree, and I did eate:
this indeed was a very unsatisfactory reply, and therein was involved
a very impio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s errour, as implying God the Author of sinne, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his Maker of his transgression: as if he had said, If thou hadst not
given me a woman I had not beene deceived: Thou promisedst to
make her a help, but she hath proved destruction unto me; had I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
alone, I had not sinned, but thou gavest me a consort, and so I
became seduced. This was a bold and open accusation of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the fountaine of good the contriver of evill, and the forbidder of
the crime an abetter of the fact prohibited. Surely, his mercy was
great that did not revenge the impeachment of his Justice; and his
goodnesse to be admired, that it refuted not his argument in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50218:13"/>
of his excusation, or onely pursued the first transgression without
a penalty of this the second.</p>
               <p>The third was that of Eve. The Serpent beguiled me, and I did
eate. In which reply there was not onely a very feeble excuse, but an
erroneous translating her owne offence upon another. Extenuating her
sinne from that which was an aggravation, that is to excuse the fact at
all, much more upon the suggestion of a beast, which was before in
the strictest termes prohibited by her God. For although we now doe
hope the mercies of God will consider our degenerated integrities
unto some minoration of our offences, yet had not the sincerity of our
first parents, so colourable expectations, unto whom the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was but single, and their integrities best able to resist the motions
of its transgression: And therefore so hainous conceptions have risen
hereof, that some have seemed more angry therewith then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
being so exasperated with the offence, as to call in question their
salvation, and to dispute the eternall punishment of their Maker. Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
with better reason may posterity accuse them, then they the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
or one another; and the displeasure of the Pelagians must needs
be irreconcileable, who peremptorily maintaining they can fulfill the
whole Law, will insatisfactorily condemne the non-observation of
one.</p>
               <p>The fourth was that speech of Cain upon the demand of God,
Where is thy Brother? and he said, I know not. In which negation,
beside the open impudence, there was implyed a notable errour; for
returning a lye unto his Maker, and presuming in this manner, to put
off the Searcher of hearts, he denied the omnisciency of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
there is nothing concealable. The answer of Satan in the case of
Job, had more of truth, wisdome and reverence, then this; Whence
commest thou Satan? and he said, from compassing of the earth. For
though an enemy of God, and hater of all truth, his wisdome will
hardly permit him to fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie with the Almighty: for well understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the omniscience of his nature, he is not so ready to deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as to falsifie unto him whose cognition is no way deludable: And
therefore when in the tentation of Christ he played upon the falacy,
and thought to deceive the Author of truth, the method of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
arose from the uncertainty of his divinity, whereof had he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
assured, he had continued silent, nor would his discretion at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
so unsucceedable a temptation. And so againe at the last day,
when our offences shall be drawne into accompt, the subtilty of that
Inquisitor shall not present unto God a bundle of calumnies or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
accusations, but will discreetly offer up unto his Omnisciencie,
a sure and undeniable list of our transgressions.</p>
               <p>The fifth is another reply of Cain upon the denouncement of his
curse, My iniquity is greater then can be forgiven: For so is it expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50218:13"/>
in some translations. The assertion was not onely desperate, but
the conceit erroneous, overthrowing that glorious attribute of God
his mercy, and conceiving the sinne of murder unpardonable; which
how great soever, is not above the repentance of man, but far below
the mercies of God, and was as some conceive expiated, in that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he suffered temporally for it. There are but two examples of
this errour in holy Scripture, and they both for murder, and both as it
were of the same person; for Christ was mystically slaine in Abel;
and therefore Cain had some influence on his death, as well as Judas;
but the sinne had a different effect on Cain, from that it had on Judas,
and most that since have fallen into it; for they like Judas desire death,
and not unfrequently pursue it: Cain on the contrary grew afraid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and obtained a securement from it. Assuredly if his despaire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
there was punishment enough in life, and justice sufficient in
the mercy of his protection. For the life of the desperate equals the
anxieties of death, who in uncessant inquietudes but act the life of the
damned, and anticipate the desolations of hell. Tis indeed a sinne in
man, but a punishment onely in the devils, who offend not God but
afflict themselves, in the appointed despaire of his mercies. And as to
be without all hope is the affliction of the damned, so is it the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the blessed, who having their expectations present, are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
with futurities. So is it also their felicity to have no faith, for
enjoying the beatifical vision there is nothing unto them inevident, and
in the fruition of the object of faith, they have received the full
evacuation of it.</p>
               <p>The last speech was that of Lamech, I have slaine a man to my
wound, and a young man to my hurt: If Cain be avenged seven fold,
truly Lamech seventy and seven fold. Now herein there seemes to be
a very erroneous illation; from the indulgence of God unto Cain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
an immunity unto himselfe, that is, a regular protection from a
single example, and an exemption from punishment in a fact that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
deserved it. The Error of this offendor was contrary to that of
Cain, whom the Rabbins conceive that Lamech at this time killed.
He despaired of Gods mercy in the same fact, where this presumed of
it, he by a decollation of all hope annihilated his mercy, this by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderancy
thereof destroyed his justice, though the sin were lesse, the
errour was as great; For as it is untrue that his mercy will not forgive
offenders, or his benignity cooperate to their conversions, So is it also
of no lesse falsity to affirme his Justice will not exact account of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or punish such as continue in their transgressions.</p>
               <p>And thus may we perceive, how weakely our fathers did erre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the floud, how continually and upon common discourse they fell
upon errours after, it is therefore no wonder we have been erroneous
ever since: And being now at greatest distance from the beginning of

               <p>How unequall discerners of truth they are, and openly exposed unto

               <p>For the assured truth of things is derived from the principles of
knowledge, and causes, which determine their verities; whereof their
uncultivated understandings, scarce holding any theory, they are but
bad discerners of verity, and in the numerous tract of error, but casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>Their understanding is so feeble in the discernement of falsities, and
averting the errors of reason, that it submitteth unto the fallacies of
sence, and is unable to rectifie the error of its sensations. Thus the

they judge of humane actions by the event; for being uncapable of
operable circumstances, or rightly to judge the prudenciality of affairs,
they onely gaze upon the visible successe, and thereafter condemn or
cry up the whole progression. And so from this ground in the Lecture
of holy Scripture, their apprehensions, are commonly confined unto

of the soule, and the beatitude of that part which earth and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
too weakly affect. But the wisdom of our Saviour, and the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of his truth proceeded another way, defying the popular provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of happinesse from sensible expectations, placing his felicitie in
things removed from sense, and the intellectuall enjoyment of God.
And therefore the doctrine of the one was never afraid of Universities,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50218:15"/>
or endeavoured the banishment of learning like the other. And though
Galen doth sometime nibble at Moses, and beside the Apostate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
some Heathens have questioned his Philosophicall part or treatie
of the Creation. Yet is there surely no reasonable Pagan, that will not
admire the rationall and well grounded precepts of Christ, whose life
as it was conformable unto his doctrine, so was that unto
the highest rules of reason; and must therefore flourish in the
advancement of learning, and the perfection of parts best able to
comprehend it.</p>
               <p>Againe, their individuall imperfections being great, they are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
enlarged by their aggregation, and being erroneous in their single
numbers once hudled together, they will be errour it selfe; for being
a confusion of knaves and fooles, and a farraginous concurrence of all
conditions, tempers, sex, and ages, it is but naturall if their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be monstrous, and many wayes inconsistent with truth. And
therefore wise men have alwayes applauded their owne judgment, in
the contradiction of that of the people, and their soberest adversaries,
have ever afforded them the stile of fooles and mad men; and to speak
impartially, their actions have often made good these Epithites. Had
Orestes been Judge, he would not have acquitted that Lystrian rabble
of madnesse, who upon a visible miracle, falling into so high a conceit
of Paul and Barnabas, that they termed the one Jupiter, the other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius,
that they brought oxen and garlands, and were hardly restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
from sacrificing unto them, did notwithstanding suddenly after fall
upon Paul, and having stoned him, drew him for dead out of the citie.
It might have hazarded the sides of Democritus, had hee been present
at that tumult of Demetrius, when the people flocking together in
great numbers, some cryed one thing, and some another, and the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
was confused, and the most part knew not wherefore they were
come together; notwithstanding, all with one voice for the space of
two houres cryed out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. It had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the patience of Job, as it did the meeknesse of Moses, and would
surely have mastered any, but the longanimity and great sufferance of
God, Had they beheld the mutiny in the wildernesse, when after tenne
great miracles in Egypt, and some in the same place, they melted down
their stolen ear-rings into a calf, and monstrously cryed out, These are
thy gods O Israel! that brought thee out of the land of Egypt. It
much accuseth the impatiencie of Peter, who could not endure the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>aves of the multitude, and is the greatest example of lenitie in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
when he desired of God forgivenes unto those, who having one
day brought him into the Citie in triumph, did presently after, act all
dishonour upon him, and nothing could be heard but <hi>Cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>fige</hi> in their
courts. Certainely hee that considereth these things in Gods peculiar
people, will easily discerne how little of truth, there is in the wayes of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50218:15"/>
the multitude; and though somtimes they are flattered with that Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme,
will hardly beleeve the voyce of the people to bee the voyce
of God.</p>
               <p>Lastly, being thus divided from truth in themselves, they are yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
removed by advenient deception. For true it is, (and I hope shall
not offend their vulgarities) if I say they are daily mocked into errour
by subtler devisors, and have been expresly deluded, by all professions
whatsoever. Thus the Priests of Elder time, have put upon them
many incredible conceits, not onely deluding their apprehensions,
with Ariolation, South-saying, and such oblique Idolatries, but win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their credulities unto the literall and downe-right adorement of
Cats, L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>zards, and Beetles; and thus also in some Christian Churches,
wherein is presumed an irreproveable truth. If all be true that is suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
or halfe what is related, there have not wanted, many strange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
and some thereof are still confessed by the name of Pious
fraudes. Thus Theudas an Imposture was able to lead away foure
thousand into the wildernesse, and the delusions of Mahomet almost
the fourth part of mankinde. Thus all heresies how grosse soever, have
found a welcome with the people. For thus, what is scarce imaginable,
many of the Jews were wrought into beliefe, that Herod was the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,
and David George of Leyden and Arden, were not without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
amongst the people, who maintained the same opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
almost in our dayes. Physitions (many at least that make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
thereof) beside divers lesse discoverable wayes of fraude, have
made them beleeve, there is the book of fate, or the power of Aarons
brest-plate in Urines. And therefore hereunto they have recourse as
unto the Oracle of life, the great determinator of virginity, conception,
fertilitie, and the inscrutable infirmities of the whole body. For as

that that Disciple should not die. Thus began the conceit and

as is declared by Servius, when some young Thessalians on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe

stand related by Epiphanius, Austin, or Prateolus.</p>

Other wayes there are of deceit which consist not, in false appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of words, that is verball expressions or sententiall significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but fraudulent deductions, or inconsequent illations, from a false
conception of things. Of these extradictionary and reall fallacies, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
and Logicians make in number six, but we observe that men are
most commonly deceived by foure thereof: those are, <hi>Petitio princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pii.</hi>
A <hi>dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter.</hi> A <hi>non causa pro causa.</hi>
And <hi>fallacia consequentis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> which fallacie is committed, when a
question is made a medium, or we assume a medium as granted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we remaine as unsatisfied as of the question. Briefly where that is
assumed as a principle, to prove another thing which is not conceaded
as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ue it selfe. By this fallacie was Eve deceived, when shee took for
granted, the false assertion of the devill; Yee shall not surely dye, for
God doth know that in the day she shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be
opened, and you shall be as gods; which was but a bare affirmation of
Satan without any proofe or probable inducement, contrary unto the
command of God and former beliefe of herselfe; and this was the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
of the Jews, when they accused our Saviour unto Pilate, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
a reasonable impeachment, or the allegation of some crime
worthy of condemnation; they only replyed, if he had not been worthy
of death, we would not have brought him before thee; wherein there
was neither accusation of the person, nor satisfaction of the Judge, who
well understood a bare accusation was no presumption of guilt, and the
clamo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of the people no accusation at all. The same fallacy is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
used in the dispute, between Job, and his friends, they often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that for granted which afterward he denyeth and disproveth.</p>
               <p>The second is <hi>à dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter,</hi> when
from that which is but true in a qualified sense an inconditionall and
absolute verity is inferred, transferring the speciall consideration of
things unto their generall acceptions, or concluding from their strict
acception, unto that without all limitation. This falacie men commit
when they argue from a particular to a generall, as when we conclude
the vices or qualities of a few upon a whole Nation, or from a part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the whole. Thus the divell argued with our Saviour, and by this
he would perswade him he might be secure if hee cast himselfe from
the pinacle: for said he, it is written, he shall give his Angels charge
concerning thee, and in their hands they shall beare thee up, lest at any
time thou dash thy foot against a stone. But this illation was fallacious
leaving out part of the text, Psalme 91. He shall keep thee in all thy
wayes; that is, in the wayes of righteousnesse, and not of rash attempts:
so he urged a part for the whole, and inferred more in the conclusion,
then was contained in the premises. By this same fallaci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> we proceed,
when we conclude from the signe unto the thing signified. By this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50218:18"/>
incroachment Idolatry first crept in, men converting the symbolicall
use of Idols into their proper worship, and receiving the representation
of things as the substance and thing it selfe. So the statue of Belus at
first erected in his memory, was in after times adored as a Divinity. And
so also in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the bread and wine which
were but the signalls or visible signes, were made the things signified,
and worshipped for the body of Christ. And hereby generally men
are deceived that take things spoken in some la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itude without any at all.
Hereby the Jewes were deceived concerning the commandement of
the Sabbath, accusing our Saviour for healing the sicke, and his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
for plucking the ears of corne, upon that day. And by this deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
mistake they were deceived unto destruction, upon the assault of
Pompey the great made upon that day, by whose superstitious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
they could not defend themselves, or performe any labour
whatsoever.</p>
               <p>The third is a <hi>non causâ pro causâ,</hi> when that is pretended for a cause
which is not, or not in that sense which is inferred. Upon this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
the law of Mahomet forbids the use of wine, and his successors
abolished Universities: by this also many Christians have condemned
li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erature, misunderstanding the counsell of Saint Paul, who adviseth
no further then to beware of Philosophy. On this foundation were
built the conclusions of Southsayers in their Auguriall, and Tripudia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
divinations, collecting presages from voice or food of birds, and
conjoyning events unto causes of no connexion. Hereupon also are
grounded the grosse mistakes, in the cure of many diseases, not only
from the last medicine, and sympatheticall receits, but amulets cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fourth is the fallacie of the consequent, which if strictly taken,
may be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as to conclude from the position of the antecedent, unto the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>emotion of the consequent to

in Oratorie illations, and thus the Pharisees, because he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed

               <head type="sub">Of Credulity and Supinity.</head>
               <p>A Third cause of common Errors is the Credulity of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is
an easie assent, to what is obtruded, or a believing at first eare
what is delivered by others; this is a weaknesse in the understanding,
without examination assenting unto things, which from their natures
and causes doe carry no perswasion; whereby men often swallow falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for truths, dubiosities for certainties, fesibilities for possibilities,
and things impossible as possibilities themselves. Which though a
weaknesse of the Intellect, and most discoverable in vulgar heads, yet
hath it sometime fallen upon wiser braines, and great advancers of
truth. Thus many wise Athenians so far forgot their Philosophy, and
the nature of humane production, that they descended unto beliefes,
the originall of their Nation was from the Earth, and had no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
then from the seminality and wombe of their great Mother.
Thus is it not without wonder, how those learned Arabicks so tamely
delivered up their beliefe unto the absurdities of the Alcoran. How
the noble Geber, Avicenna and Almanzor, should rest satisfied in the
nature and causes of earthquakes, delivered from the doctrine of their
Prophet; that is, from the motion of a great Bull, upon whose hornes
all the earth is poised. How their faiths could decline so low, as to
concede their generations in heaven, to be made by the smell of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
or that the felicity of their Paradise should consist in a Jubile of
conjunction, that is a coition of one act prolonged unto fifty years.
Thus is it almost beyond wonder, how the beliefe of reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
should ever submit unto Idolatry: and the credulity of those men
scarce credible, without presumption of a second fall, who could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a Deity in the worke of their owne hands. For although in that
ancient and diffused adoration of Idolls, unto the Priests and subtiler
heads, the worship perhaps might be symbolicall, and as those Images
some way related unto their deities, yet was the Idolatry direct and
downe-right in the people, whose credulity is illimitable, who may be
made believe that any thing is God, and may be made believe there is
no God at all.</p>
               <p>And as Credulity is the cause of Error, so incredulity oftentimes of
not enjoying truth, and that not only an obstinate incredulity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

scepticall infidelity against the evidence of reason and sense. For these
are conceptions befalling wise men, as absurd as the apprehensions of
fooles, and the credulity of the people which promiscuously swallow
any thing. For this is not only derogatory unto the wisdome of God,

                  </gap>standings being eclipsed, as
well as our tempers infirmed, we must betake our selves to wayes of
reparation, and depend upon the illumination of our endeavours; for
thus we may in some measure repaire our primarie ruins, and build our
selves men againe. And though the attempts of some have been preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitous,
and their enquiries so audacious as to come within command of
the flaming swords, and lost themselves in attempts above humanity,
yet have the inquiries of most defected by the way, and tyred within
the sober circumference of knowledge.</p>
               <p>And this is the reason why some have transcribed any thing, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they cannot but doubt thereof, yet neither make experiment
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50218:19"/>
by sence or enquiry by reason, but live in doubts of things whose sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
is in their owne power, which is indeed the inexcusable part
of our ignorance, and may perhaps fill up the charge of the last day.
For not obeying the dictates of reason, and neglecting the cryes of
truth, we faile not onely in the trust of our undertakings, but in the
intention of man it selfe, which although more veniall unto ordinary
constitutions, and such as are not framed beyond the capacity of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
notions, yet will it inexcusably condemne some men, who having
received excellent endowments, and such as will accuse the omissions
of perfection, have yet sat downe by the way, and frustrated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of their habilities. For certainely as some men have sinned, in
the principles of humanity, and must answer, for not being men, so
others offend if they be not more; <hi>Magis extra vitia quam cum virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus,</hi>
would commend those, These are not excusable without an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.
For great constitutions, and such as are constellated unto
knowledge, do nothing till they outdoe all; they come short of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
if they go not beyond others, and must not sit downe under the
degree of worthies. God expects no lustre from the minor stars, but
if the Sun should not illuminate all, it were a sin in Nature. <hi>Vltimus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum,</hi>
will not excuse every man, nor is it sufficient for all to hold the
common levell; Mens names should not onely distinguish them: A
man should be something that men are not, and individuall in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
beside his proper nature. Thus while it exceeds not the bounds
of reason, and modesty, we cannot condemne singularity. <hi>Nos nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
sumus,</hi> is the motto of the multitude, and for that reason are they
fooles. For things as they recede from unity, the more they approach
to imperfection, and deformity; for they hold their perfection in their
simplicities, and as they neerest approach unto God.</p>
               <p>Now as there are many great wits to be condemned, who have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the increment of Arts, and the sedulous pursuit of knowledge,
so are there not a few very much to be pittied, whose industry being
not attended with naturall parts, they have sweat to little purpose, and
roled the stone in vain: which chiefly proceedeth from naturall incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and geniall indisposition, at least to those particular wayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they apply their endeavours. And this is one reason why though
Universities bee full of men, they are oftentimes empty of learning.
Why as there are some which do much without learning, so others
but little with it, and few that attaine to any perfection in it. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
heads that undertake it, were never squared nor timbred for it.
There are not onely particular men, but whole nations indisposed for
learning, whereunto is required not onely education, but a pregnant
Minerva and teeming constitution. For the wisdome of God hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the Genius of men according to the different affaires of the
world, and varied their inclinations according to the variety of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

well understood not; extolling those times their younger yeares have
heard their fathers condemne, and condemning those times the gray
heads of their posterity shall commend. And thus is it the humour of
many heads to extoll the dayes of their fore-fathers, and declaime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the wickednesse of times present; which notwithstanding they
cannot handsomely doe, without the borrowed helpe and satyres of
times past, condemning the vices of their times, by the expressions of
vices in times which they commend, which cannot but argue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of vice in both; Horace therefore, Juvenall and Perseus were
no prophets, although their lives did seeme to indigitate and point at
our times. There is a certaine list of vices committed in all ages, and
declaimed against by all Authors, which will last as long as humane
nature, or digested into common places may serve for any theme, and
never be out of date untill Doomes day. Thirdly, the testimonies of

For some, and those the acutest of them, have left unto us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things of falsitie, controulable, not onely by criticall and collective
reason, but common and countrey observation. Hereof there want not
many examples in Aristotle, through all his booke of animals; we shall

               <p>Other Authors write often dubiously, even in matters wherein is
expected a strict and definitive truth, extenuating their affirmations,
with <hi>aiunt, ferunt, fortasse,</hi> As Dioscorides, Galen, Aristotle, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

their names unto other mens endeavours, and meerely transcribing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all they have written. The Latines transcribing the Greekes, the
Greekes and Latines each other. Thus hath Justine borrowed all
from Trogus Pompeius, and Julius solinus in a manner transcribed
Plinie, thus ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e Lucian and Apuleius served Lucius Pratensis, men
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50218:21"/>
both living in the same time, and both transcribing the same Authour,
in those famous Bookes, Entituled Lucius by the one, and Aureus Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
by the other. In the same measure hath Simocrates in his Tract <hi>de
Nilo,</hi> dealt with Diodorus Siculus, as may be observed, in that worke
annexed unto Herodotus, and translated by Jungermannus. Thus Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tosthenes

Preface. The very same doth Strabo report of Edorus and Ariston
in a Treatise entituled <hi>de Milo.</hi> Clemens Alexandrinus hath also obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
many examples hereof among the Greekes, and Plinie speaketh
very plainely in his Preface, that conferring his Authors, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their workes together, hee generally found those that went before
<hi>verbatim</hi> transcribed, by those that followed after, and their originalls
never so much as mentioned. Even the magnified Virgil hath borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
almost all his works: his Eclogues from Theocritus, his Georgicks
from H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>siod and Aratus, his Aeneads from Homer, the second Booke
thereof containing the exploit of Sinon and the Trojan horses, (as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobius
observeth) he hath <hi>verbatim</hi> derived from Pisander. Our own
profession is not excusable herein. Thus Oribasius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aetius and Aegineta
have in a manner transcribed Galen. But Marcellus Empericus who
hath left a famous worke <hi>de medicamentis,</hi> hath word for word, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
all Scriboneus Largus, <hi>de compositione medicamentorum,</hi> and not
left out his very peroration. And thus may we perceive the Ancients
were but men, even like our selves. The practise of transcription in
our dayes was no monster in theirs: Plagiarie had not its nativitie with
printing, but began in times when thefts were difficult, and the paucity
of bookes scarce wanted that invention.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, while we so eargerly adhear unto Antiquity, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of elder times, we are to consider the fabulous condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and that wee shall not deny if wee call to minde the mendacity of
Greece, from whom we have received most relations, and that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
part of Ancient times, was by the Greeks themselves termed
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is made up or stuffed out with fables, and surely the fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
inclination of those dayes, was greater then any since, which
swarmed so with fables, and from such slender grounds, tooke hyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es
for fictions, poysoning the world ever after; wherein how far they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
may be exemplified from Palaephatus, in his book of fabulous
narrations. That fable of Orpheus, who by the melody of his musick,
made woods and trees to follow him, was raised upon a slender foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
for there were a crew of mad women, retyred unto a mountain,
from whence being pacifyed by his Musicke, they descended with
boughs in their hands, which unto the fabulositie of those times, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a sufficient ground to celebrate unto all posteritie the Magick of
Orpheus harpe, and its power to attract the senselesse trees about it.
That Medea the famous Sorceresse could renue youth, and make
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50218:21"/>
old men young againe, was nothing else but that from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of simples shee had a receipt to make white haire black, and
reduce old heads into the tincture of youth againe. The fable of
Gerion and Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>berus with three heads was this: Gerion was of
the City Tricarinia that is of three heads, and Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>berus of the same
place was one of his dogs, which running into a cave upon pursuit of
his masters oxen, Hercules perforce drew him out of that place, from
whence the conceits of those dayes affirmed no lesse, then that He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
descended into hell, and brought up Cerberus into the habitation
of the Living. Upon the like grounds was raised the figment of Bria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,
who dwelling in a city called Hecatonchiria, the fancies of those
times assigned him an hundred hands. Twas ground enough to fancy
wings unto Daedasus, in that he stole out of a window from Minos, and
sailed away with his son Icarus, who steering his cours wisely, escaped,
but his son carrying too high a saile was drowned. That Niobe weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over her children was turned into a stone, was nothing else but
that during her life, she erected over their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pultures, a marble tombe
of her owne. When Acteon had undone himselfe with dogs, and the
prodigall attendance of hunting, they made a solemne story how he
was devoured by his hounds. And upon the like grounds was raised
the Anthropophagie of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omedes his horses. Upon as slender foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
was built, the fable of the Minotaure; for one Taurus a servant
of Minos begat his mistresse Pasiphae with childe, from whence the
infant was named Minotaurus. Now this unto the fabulositie of those
times was thought sufficient to accuse Pasiphae of Beastialitie, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
conjunction with a Bull, and in succeeding ages gave a hynte of
depravity unto Domitian to act the fable into Realitie.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we applaude many things delivered by the Ancients, which
are in themselves but ordinarie, and come short of our own concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Thus we usually extoll, and our Orations cannot escape the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the wisemen of Greece. <hi>Nosce teipsum</hi> of Thales: <hi>Nosce tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>
of Pittacus: <hi>Nihil nimis</hi> of Cleobulus; which notwithstanding to
speake indifferently, are but vulgar precepts in Morality, carrying with
them nothing above the lyne, or beyond the extemporall sententiosity
of common conceits with us. Thus we magnifie the Apothegmes, or
reputed replyes of wisdome, whereof many are to be seen in Laertius,
more in Lycosthenes, not a few in the second booke of Macrobius, in
the salts of Cicero Augustus, and the Comicall wits of those times: in
most whereof there is not much of admiration, and are me thinkes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
not only in the replyes of wise men, but the passages of socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and daily urbanities of our times. And thus we extoll their adage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
or proverbs; and Erasmus hath taken great pains to make collections of
them, whereof notwithstanding the greater part will, I beleeve, unto in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>different
judges be esteemed no such rarities, and may be paralelled, if
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50218:22"/>
not exceeded, by those of more unlearned nations, &amp; many of our own.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, wee urge authorities, in points that need not, and introduce
the testimony of ancient writers, to confirm things evidently beleeved,
and whereto no reasonble hearer but would assent without them, such
as are; <hi>Nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit. Virtute nil praestantius, nil
pulchrius; Omnia vincit amor. Praeclarum quiddam veritas,</hi> All which,
although things knowne and vulgar, are frequently urged by many
men, and though triviall verities in our mouthes, yet noted from Plato,
Ovid, or Cicero, they receive immediate additions, and become repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
elegancies. For many hundred to instance but in one we meet with
while we are writing. Antonius Guevara that elegant Spaniard, in his
book intituled, <hi>The Diall of Princes,</hi> beginneth his Epistle thus. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius
Thyan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us disputing with the Schollers of Hiarchas, said, that
among all the affections of nature, nothing was more naturall, then the
desire all have to preserve life; which being a confessed truth, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
acknowledged by all, it was a superstuous affectation, to derive its
authoritie from Apolonius, or seeke a confirmation thereof as farre as
India, and the learned Schollers of Hiarchus; which whether it be not
al one to strengthen common dignities and principles known by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
with the authoritie of Mathematicians; or thinke a man should
beleeve; The whole is greater then its parts, rather upon the authoritie
of Euclide, then if it were propounded alone, I leave unto the second
and wiser cogitations of all men. Tis sure a practise that savours much
of Pedantery, a Reserve of Puerilitie wee have not shaken off from
Schoole, where being seasoned with Minor sentences, by a neglect of
higher enquiries, they prescribe upon our riper cares, and are never
worne out but with our memories.</p>
               <p>Lastly, while we so devoutly adhere unto Antiquity in some things,
we doe not consider we have deserted them in severall other; for they
indeed have not only been imperfect, in the conceit of many things, but
either ignorant or erroneous in divers other. They understood not the
motion of the eight spheare from West to East, and so conceived the
longitude of the starres invariable. They conceived the torrid Zone
unhabitable, and so made frustrate the goodliest part of the earth. But
we now know 'tis very well empeopled, and the habitation thereof
esteemed so happy, that some have made it the proper seat of Paradise,
and beene so farre from judging it unhabitable that they have made
it the first habitation of all. Many of the Ancients denyed the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes,
and some unto the penalty of contrary affirmations; but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of our enlarged navigations, can now assert them beyond all
dubitation. Having thus totally relinquisht them in some things, it
may not be presumptuous, to examine them in others, but surely most
unreasonable to adhere to them in all, as though they were infallible
or could not erre in any.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Authority.</head>
               <p>NOr is only a resolved prostration unto Antiquity a powerfull ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
unto knowledge, but also a consident adherence unto any
Authority, or resignation of our judgements upon the testimony of any
Age or Author whatsoever. For first, to speake generally an argument
from Authority to wiser examinations, is but a weaker kinde of proofe,
it being no other but a topicall probation, and as we terme it, an inarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
argument, depending upon a naked asseveration: wherein neither
declaring the causes, affections or adjuncts of what we believe. It carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not with it the reasonable inducements of knowledge, and therefore
<hi>contr a negantem principia, Ipse dixit,</hi> or <hi>oportet discentem credere,</hi> although
they may be postulates, very accomodable unto Junior indoctrinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet are their authorities but temporary, and not to be imbraced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the minority of our intellectuals. For our advanced beliefs are not
to be built upon dictates, but having received the probable inducements
of truth, we become emancipated from testimoniall engagements, and
are to erect upon the surer base of reason. Secondly, unto reasonable
perpensions it hath no place in some Sciences, small in others, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
many restrictions, even where it is most admitted. It is of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
in the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thematicks, especially the mother part thereof Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick
and Geometry: For these Sciences concluding from dignities
and principles knowne by themselves, they receive not satisfaction
from probable reasons, much lesse from bare and peremptory assevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And therefore if all Athens should decree, that in every triangle,
wo sides which soever be taken are greater then the side remaining, or
that in rectangle triangles the square which is made of the side that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>endeth
the right angle, is equall to the squares which are made of the
sides containing the right angle: Although there be a certaine truth
therein, would Geometritians notwithstanding, receive a satisfaction
without demonstration thereof? 'Tis true by the vulgarity of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
there are many points beleeved without probation, and if a
man affirme from Ptolomy, that the Sun is bigger then the Earth, shall
he probably meet with any contradiction herein, whereunto notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Astronomers will not assent without some convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or demonstrative proofe thereof? And therefore certainly of all
men a Philosopher should be no swearer: for an oath which is the end
of controversies in Law cannot determine any here, nor are the deepest
sacraments or desperate imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cations of any force to perswade where
reason only, and necessary mediums must induce.</p>
               <p>In naturall Philosophy, and which is more generally pursued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, it carryeth but slender consideration, for that also procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50218:23"/>
from setled principles, therein is expected a satisfaction from sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entificiall
progressions, and such as beget, a sure and rationall beleefe.
For if Authority might have made out the assertions of Philosophy,
wee might have held, that snow was blacke, that the sea was but the
sweat of the earth, and many of the like absurdities. Then was Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
injurious to fall upon Melissus, and to reject the assertions of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxagoras,
Anaximander, and Empedocles, and then were we also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
unto himselfe, from whom our Junior endeavours embracing
many things by his authority, our mature and secondary enquiries, are
forced to quit those receptions, and to adhere unto the nearest accounts
of reason. And although it be not unusuall, even in Philosophicall
tractates to make enumeration of Authors, yet are there reasons usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
introduced, and to ingenuous readers doe carry the stroake in the
perswasion. And surely if we account it reasonable among our selves,
and not injurious unto rationall Authors, no farther to abet their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
then as they are supported by solid reason; certainly with more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
reservation may we shrink at their bare testimonies, whose ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is but precarious and subsists upon the charity of our assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
In Morality, Rhetorick, Law and History, there is I confesse a
frequent and allowable use of testimony, and yet herein I perceive, it is
not unlimitable, but admitteth many restrictions. Thus in Law both
Civill and Divine, that is only esteemed <hi>legitimum testimonium,</hi> or a
legall testimony, which receives comprobation from the mouths of at
least two witnesses; and that not onely for prevention of calumny, but
assurance against mistake, whereas notwithstanding the solid reason
of one man, is as sufficient as the clamor of a whole Nation; and within
imprejudicate apprehensions begets as firm a beleef as the authoritie or
aggregated testimony of many hundreds: For reason being the very
root of our natures, and the principles thereof common unto all, what
is against the lawes of true reason, or the undeceived understanding of
any one, if rightly apprehended must be disclaimed by all Nations,
and rejected even by mankinde.</p>
               <p>Againe, a testimony is of small validity if deduced from men out of
their owne profession; so if Lactantius affirme the figure of the earth is
plaine, or Austin himselfe deny there are Antipodes; though vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Fathers of the Church, and ever to be honoured, will their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
prove sufficient to ground a beleefe thereon? whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the solid reason or confirmed experience of any man, is
very approveable in what profession soever. So Raymund Sebund,
a Physitian of Tholouze, besides his learned Dialogues, <hi>de natura hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana,</hi>
hath written a naturall Theologie, demonstrating therein the
Attributes of God, and attempting the like in most points of Religion.
So Hugo Grocius a Civilian, did write an excellent Tract in Dutch of
the verity of Christian Religion, and hath since contracted the same
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50218:23"/>
into six bookes in Latine, wherein most rationally delivering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
their works will be embraced by most that understand them,
and their reasons enforce beliefe even from prejudicate Readers. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed have the authorities of men bin ever so awfull, but that by
some they have beene rejected, even in their owne professions. Thus
Aristotle affirming the birth of the Infant or time of its gestation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
sometimes unto the eleventh month, but Hippocrates averring
that it exceedeth not the tenth. Adrian the Emperour in a solemne
processe, determined for Aristotle, but Justinian many yeares after,
tooke in with Hippocrates and reversed the Decree of the other. Thus
have Councels not onely condemned private men, but the Decrees
and Acts of one another. So Galen after all his veneration of Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,
in some things hath fallen from him. Avicen in many from Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
and others succeeding from him: and although the singularity of
Paracelsus be intollerable, who sparing onely Hippocrates, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled
not onely the Authors, but almost all the learning that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; yet is it not much lesse injurious unto knowledge obstinately
and inconvincibly to side with any one: Which humour unhappily
possessing many men, they have by prejudice withdrawne themselves
into parties, and contemning the soveraignty of truth, seditiously abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the private divisions of error.</p>
               <p>Moreover a Testimony in points historicall, and where it is of una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydable
use, is of no illation in the negative, nor is it of consequence
that Herodo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us writing nothing of Rome, there was therefore no such
city in his time; or because Dioscorides hath made no mention of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicornes
horne, there is therefore no such thing in Nature. Indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
an accurate enumeration of Medicall materials, the omission
hereof affords some probability; it was not used by the Ancients, but
will not conclude the nonexistence thereof. For so may we anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate
many simples unknowne to his enquiries, as Senna, Rhabarbe,
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>zoar, Ambregris, and divers others. Whereas indeed the reason of
man hath no such restraint, concluding not onely affirmatively but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively,
not onely affirming there is no magnitude beyond the last
heavens, but also denying there is any vacuity within them: Although
it be confessed the affirmative hath the prerogative illation, and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
engrosseth the powerfull demonstration.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the strange and unimaginable relations made by Authors,

as for the major part have given authority hereto: who although excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and usefull Authors, yet being either transcriptive, or following
the common relations of things, their accounts are not to be swallowed

               <p>1. The first in order as also in time, shall be Herodotus of Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassus,
an excellent and very elegant Historian, whose books of history
were so well received in his owne dayes, that at their rehearsall in the
Olympick g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Now in this Author, as may be observed in our ensuing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and is better discernable in the perusall of himselfe, there are
many things fabulously delivered, and not to be accepted as truthes:
whereby neverthelesse if any man be deceived, the Author is not so
culpable as the believer. For he indeed imitating the father Poet,
whose life he hath also written, and as Thucydides observeth, as well
intending the delight as benefit of his Reader, hath besprinkled his
worke with many fabulosities, whereby if any man be led into errour,
he mistaketh the intention of the Author, who plainly confesseth hee
writeth many things by hearesay, and forgetteth a very considerable
caution of his, that is, <hi>Ego quae fando cognovi, exponere narratione mea

               </p>
               <p>2. In the second place is Cresias the Cnidian, Physitian unto Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes
King of Persia, his books are often cited by ancient Writers;
and by the industry of Stephanus and Rodomanus, there are extant
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50218:25"/>
some fragments thereof in our dayes; he wrote the History of Persia,
and many narrations of India. In the first as having a fair oportunity to
know the truth: And as Diodorus affirmeth the perusall of Persian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
his testimony is acceptable in his Indiary relations, wherein are
contained strange and incredible accounts, he is surely to be read with
suspension; and these were they which weakned his authority with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

he is seldome mentioned, without a derogatory parenthesis in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

up by most succeeding Writers, and many thereof revived by our
Country-man, Sir John Mandevell Knight and Doctor in Physicke,
who after thirty years peregrination dyed at Leige, and was there ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
interred. He left behinde him a booke of his travells, which
hath been honoured with the translation of many languages, and hath
now continued above three hundred years; herein he often attesteth
the fabulous relations of Ctesias, and seems to confirme the refuted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of Antiquity: all which may still be received in some accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of morality, and to a pregnant invention, may afforde commendable
mythologie, but in a naturall and proper Exposition, it containeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities
and things inconsistent with truth.</p>
               <p>3. There is a Book <hi>de mirandis auditionibus,</hi> ascribed unto Aristotle,
another <hi>de mirabilibus narrationibus,</hi> written long after by Antigonus,
another also of the same title by Plegon Trallianus translated by Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,
and with the Annotations of Meursius; all whereof make good
the promise of their titles and may be read with caution; which if any
man shall likewise observe in the Lecture of Philostratus, concerning
the life of Apolonius, or not only in ancient Writers, but shall carry a
wary eye, on Paulus Venetus, Jovius, Olaus Magnus, Nierembergius,
and many other, I thinke his circumspection is laudable, and he may
thereby decline occasion of Error.</p>
               <p>4. Dioscorides Anazarbeus, hee wrote many bookes in Physicke,
but six thereof <hi>de Materia Medica,</hi> have found the greatest esteeme; hee
is an Author of good Antiquity, and better use, preferred by Galen
before Cratevas, Pamphilus, and all that attempted the like description
before him; yet all hee delivereth therein is not to be conceived Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous:
For beside that, following the warres under Anthony, the
course of his life would not permit a punctuall examen in all; There
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50218:25"/>
are many things concerning the nature of simples, traditionally deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and to which I beleeve he gave no assent himselfe. It had been
an excellent receit, and in his time when Sadles were scarce in fashion
of very great use, if that were true, which he delivers, that Vitex, or
Agnus Castus held only in the hand, preserveth the rider from galling.
It were a strange effect, and whores would forsake the expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iment of
Savine. If that were a truth which hee delivereth of Brake or femall
fearne, that only treading over it, it causeth a sudden abortion. It were
to be wished true, and women would Idolize him, could that be made
out which he recordeth of Phyllon, Mercury, and other vegetables,
that the juice of the masle plant drunke, or the leaves but applied unto
the genitalls, determines their conceptions unto males. In these rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
although he be more sparing, his predecessours were very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
and Gallen hereof most sharply accuseth Pamphilus: many of
the like nature we meet sometimes in Oribasius, Acius, Trallianus, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapion,
Evax, and Marcellus, whereof some containing no colour of
verity, we may at first sight reject them, others which seem to carry
some face of truth, we may reduce unto experiment. And herein we
shall rather peforme good offices unto truth, then any disservice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their relators, who have well deserved of succeeding ages, from
whom having received the conceptions of former times, we have the
readier hint of their conformity with ours, and may accordingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
their verities.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> of Verona, a man of great eloquence, and
industry indefatigable, as may appeare by the number of the writings,
especially those now extant, and which are never like to perish, but
euen with learning it selfe, that is, his naturall Historie comprised in
36. bookes; hee was the greatest Collector or Rhapsodist of all the
Latines, and as Suetonius <hi>de viris Illustribus</hi> observeth, hee collected
this piece out of 2000. Latine and Greeke Authors. Now what is very
strange, there is scarce a popular errour passant in our dayes, which is
not either directly expressed, or diductively contained in this worke,
which being in the hands of most men, hath proved a powerfull occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their propogation; wherein notwithstanding the credulitie of
the Reader, is more condemnable then the curiositie of the Authour.
For commonly he nameth the Authors, from whom he received those
accounts, and writes himselfe by heare say, as in his Preface unto Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian
he acknowledgeth.</p>
               <p>6. Claudius Aelianus, who flourished not long after in the raigne
of Trajan, unto whom he dedicated his Tacticks, an elegant and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaneous
Author, he hath left two bookes which are in the hands of
every one, his History of Animals, and his <hi>Varia historia,</hi> wherein are
contained many things supicious, not a few false, some impossible; hee
is much beholding unto Ctesias, and in many subjects writes more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
then Plinie.</p>

7. Julius Solinus, who lived also about his time: He left a work enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
Polyhistor, containing great varietie of matter, and is with most
in good request at this day: but to speake freely what cannot bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
it is but Plinie varied, or a transcription of his naturall historie;
nor is it without all wonder it hath continued so long, but is now like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and deserves indeed to live for ever; not so much for the elegancy
of the text, as the excellency of the comment, lately performed by Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masius,
under the name of Plinian exercitations.</p>
               <p>8. Athenaeus a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a famous piece under the name of Deipnosophista, or <hi>coena sapientum,</hi>
containing the discourse of many learned men, at a feast provided by
Laurentius. It is a laborious collection out of many Authors, and some
whereof are mentioned no where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lse. It containeth strange and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
relations, not without some spice or sprinckling of all learning.
The Author was probably a better Gramarian then Philosopher, deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but hardly with Aristotle and Plato, and betrayeth himselfe much
in his Chapter <hi>de curiositate Aristotelis,</hi> In briefe, he is an Author of
excellent use, and may with discretion, be read unto great advantage:
and hath therefore well deserved, the Comments of Causabon and
Dalecampius: but being miscellaneous in many things, he is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with suspicion; for such as amasse all relations, must erre in some,
and may without offence be unbeleeved in many.</p>
               <p>9. Wee will not omit the workes of Nicander, a Poet of good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
that is, his Theriaca, and Alexipharmaca, translated and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by Gorraeus: for therein are contained severall traditions, and
popular conceits, of venemons beasts, which only deducted, the worke
is ever to be embraced, as containing the first description of poysons,
and their Antidotes, whereof Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen, have made
especiall use in elder times; and Ardoynus, Grevinus and others, in
times more neere our owne. Wee might perhaps let passe Oppianus,
that famous Cilician Poet. There are extant of his in Greeke, foure
bookes of Cynegeticks or venation, five of Halieuticks or piscation,
commented and published by Ritterhusius, wherein describing beasts
of venerie, and fishes, hee hath indeed but sparinlgly inserted the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
conceptions thereof: so that abating onely the annuall mutation of
Sexes in the Hyaena, the single Sex of the Rhinoceros, the antipathy
betweene two drummes, of a Lambe and a Wolfes skinne, the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Cubbes, the venation of Centaures, the copulation of the
Murena and the Viper, with some few others, hee may bee read with
great delight and profit. It is not without some wonder, his elegant
lines are so neglected. Surely hereby wee reject one of the best Epick
Poets, and much condemn the judgement of Antoninus, whose appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
so honoured his Poems, that as some report, for every verse,
hee assigned him a Stater of gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:50218:26"/>
10. More warily are we to receive the relations of Philes, who in

                  </gap>cke Iambicks delivered the proprieties of Animals, for herein hee
hath amassed the vulgar accounts recorded by the Ancients, and hath
therein especially followed Aelian, and likewise Johannes Tzetzes, a
Gramarian, who besides a Comment upon Hesiod and Homer, hath
left us Chiliads <hi>de varia Historia,</hi> wherein delivering the accounts of
C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esias, Herodotus, and most of the Ancients, he is to be embraced
with caution, and as a transcriptive relator.</p>
               <p>11. Wee cannot without partialitie omit all caution even of holy
Writers, and such whose names are venerable unto all posterity, not to
meddle at all with miraculous Authours, or any Legendary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators:
Wee are not without circumspection to receive some
bookes even of Authentick and renowned Fathers. So are we to read
the leaves of Basil and Ambrose in their bookes, entituled <hi>Hexameron,</hi>
or <hi>The description of the Creation;</hi> Wherein delivering particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of all the Creatures, they have left us relations sutable to
those of Aelian, Plinie and other naturall Writers; whose authorities
herein they followed, and from whom most probably, they desumed
their Narrations. And the like hath been committed by Epiphanius,
in his Phisiologie, that is, a booke he hath left concerning the nature
of Animals. With no lesse caution must we looke on Isidor, Bishop of
Sevill, who having left in 25. bookes, an accurate worke <hi>de originihus,</hi>
hath to the Etymologie of words, superadded their received natures;
wherein most generally hee consents with common opinions and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
which have delivered them.</p>
               <p>12. Albertus Bishop of Ratisbone, for his great learning and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of knowledge firnamed Magnus, besides divinitie, he hath written
many Tracts in Philosophie; what we are chiefly to receive with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are his naturall Tractates, more especially those of Mineralls, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,
and Animals, which are indeed chiefly Collections out of
Aristotle, Aelian, and Plinie, and respectively containe many of our
popular errors. A man who hath much advanced these opinions by
the authoritie of his name, and delivered most conceits, with strickt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie
into few. In the same classis, may well be placed Vincentius
Belluacensis, or rather he from whom he collected his <hi>Speculum natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale,</hi>
that is, <hi>Gulielmus de Conchis,</hi> as also <hi>Hortus Sanitatis,</hi> and <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus
Glanvill,</hi> firnamed <hi>Anglicus,</hi> who writ <hi>de Proprietatibus rerum,</hi>
Hither also may be referred Kiranides, which is a collection of Harpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
the Greek, and sundry Arabick writers; delivering not onely
the Naturall but Magicall proprietie of things, a worke as full of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as varietie, containing many relations, whose invention is as
difficult as their beliefes, and their experiments sometime as hard
as either.</p>
               <p>13. We had almost forgot <hi>Ieronymus Cardanus</hi> that famous Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50218:27"/>
of Milan a great enquirer of truth, but too greedy a receiver of it,
he hath left many excellent discourses, Medicall, Naturall, and Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall;
the most suspicious are those two he wrote by admonition in
a dream, that is, <hi>de subtilitate &amp; varietate rerum,</hi> Assuredly this learned
man hath taken many things upon trust, and although examined some,
hath let slip many others. He is of singular use unto a prudent Reader,
but unto him that desireth Hoties, or to replenish his head with varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
like many others before related, either in the originall or confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
he may become no small occasion of error.</p>
               <p>14. Lastly, those Authors are also suspicious, nor greedily to be
swallowed, who pretend to write of secrets, to deliver Antipathies,
Sympathies, and the occult abstrucities of things, in the list whereof
may be accounted, Alexis Pedimont: Antonius Mizaldus, Trinum
Magicum, and many others; not omitting that famous Philosopher of
Naples, Baptista Porta, in whose workes, although there be contained
many excellent things, and verified upon his owne experience; yet are
there many also receptary, and such as will not endure the test: who
although he have delivered many strange relations in other peices, as
his Phylognomy, and his Villa; yet hath he more remarkeably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
himselfe in his Naturall Magick, and the miraculous effects of
Nature: which containing a various and delectable subject, with all
promising wondrous and easie effects, they are etertained by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at all hands, whereof the major part sit downe in his authority,
and thereby omit not onely the certainty of truth, but the pleasure
of its experiment.</p>
               <p>And thus have we made a briefe enumeration of these learned men,
not willing any to decline their Workes, (without which it is not easie
to attaine any measure of generall knowledge) but to apply themselves
with caution thereunto. And seeing the lapses of these worthy pens,
we are to cast a wary eye on those diminutive, and pamphlet Treaties
dayly published amongst us, pieces maintaining rather Typography
then verity. Authors presumably writing by common places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
for many yeares promiscuously amassing all that makes for their
subject, they break forth at last in trite and fruitlesse Rhapsodies, doing
thereby not onely open injury unto learning, but committing a secret
treachery upon truth. For their relations falling generally upon credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Readers, they meet with prepared beliefes, whose supinities had

               <p>THere are beside these Authors and such as have positively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
errors, diverse other which are in some way accessory,
whose verities although they do not directly assert, yet doe they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
concurre unto their beliefes. In which account are many holy
Writers, Preachers, Moralists, Rhetoricians, Orators and Poets; for
they depending upon invention deduce their mediums from all things
whatsoever, and playing much upon the smile, or illustrative argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
induce their Enthymemes unto the people, they take up popular
conceits, and from traditions unjustifiable or really false, illustrate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
though not of consequence, yet undeniable truths. Wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their intention be sincere, and that course not much condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
yet are the effects thereof unwarrantable, in as much as they
strengthen common errors, and confirme as veritable those conceits,
which verity cannot allow.</p>
               <p>Thus have some Divines drawne into argument the fable of the
Phaenix, made use of that of the Salamander, Pellican, Basilisk, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
relations of Pliny, deducing from thence most worthy morals,
and even upon our Saviour. Now although this be not prejudicial unto
wiser judgements, who are indeed but weakly moved with such kind of
argument, yet is it oftentimes occasion of error unto vulgar heads, who
expect in the fable as equall a truth as in the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ll, and conceive that
infallible Philosophy, which is in any sence delivered by Divinity.
But wiser discerners do well understand, that every Art hath its owne
circle, that the effects of things are best examined, by sciences wherein
are delivered their causes, that strict and definitive expressions, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
required in Philosophy, but a loose and popular delivery will
serve oftentimes in Divinity; as may be observed even in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which often omitteth the exact account of things, describing
them rather to our apprehensions, then leaving doubts in vulgar
minds, upon their unknowne and Philosophicall descriptions. Thus it
termeth the Sun and the Moone, the two great lights of heaven. Now
if any man shall from hence conclude, the Moone is second in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
unto the Sun, he must excuse my beliefe; and I thinke it cannot
be taken for heresie, if I herein rather adhere unto the demonstration of
Ptolomy, then the popular description of Moses. Thus is it said, Chron.
2. 4. That Solomon made a molten sea often cubits, from bim to
brim round in compasse, and five cubits the height thereof, and a line
of thirty cubits did compasse it round about. Now in this description,
the circumference is made just treble unto the diameter, that is, 10. to
30. or 7. to 21. But Archimedes demonstrates in his Cyclometro
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50218:28"/>
that the proportion of the diameter, unto the circumference, is as 7 un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
almost 22, which will occasion a sensible difference that is almost a
cubit. Now if herein I adhere unto Archimedes who speaketh exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rather then the sacred Text which speaketh largely, I hope I shall
not offend Divinity. I am sure I shall have reason and experience of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
circle to support me.</p>
               <p>Thus Morall Writers, Rhetoricians and Orators make use of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
relations which will not consist with verity. Aristotle in his Ethicks
takes up the conceit of the Bever, and the divulsion of his Testicles.
The tradition of the Beare, the Viper, and divers others are frequent
amongst Orators. All which although unto the illiterate, and undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
hearers may seem a confirmation of their reallities; yet is this
no reasonable establishment unto others, who will not depend hereon
otherwise then common Apologues, which being of impossible falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
do notwithstanding include wholesome moralities, and such as do
expiate the trespasse of their absurdities.</p>
               <p>The Hieroglyphicall doctrine of the Egyptians (which in their four
hundred yeares cohabitation, some conjecture they learned from the
Hebrewes) hath much advanced many popular conceits, for using an
Alphabet of things, and not of words, through the Image and pictures
thereof, they endeavoured to speak their hidden conceits, in the letters
and language of nature; in pursuit whereof, although in many things,
they exceeded not their true, and reall apprehensions, yet in some other
they either framing the story, or taking up the tradition, conduceable
unto their intentions, obliquely confirmed many falsities, which as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
and conceded truths did after passe unto the Greeks, from them
unto other Nations, are still retained by symbolicall writers, Emble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matistes,
Heraldes and others, whereof some are strictly maintained
for truths, as naturally making good their artificiall representations; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
symbolically intended are literally received, and swallowed in
the first sense, without all gust of the second. Famous in this doctrine
in former ages were Heraiscus, Cheremon, and Epius, especially Orus,
Apollo, Niliacus, who lived in the reigne of Theodosius and in Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian
language left two bookes of Hieroglyphicks, translated into
Greek by Philippus, in Latine published by Hoschelius, and a full col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of all made lately by Pierius.</p>
               <p>Painters who are the visible representers of things, and such as by
the learned sense of the eye endeavour to informe the understanding,
are not inculpable herein, who either describing naturalls as they are,
or actions as they have been, have oftentimes erred in their delineati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which being the bookes that all can read, are fruitfull advancers of
these conceptions, especially in common and popular appr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, Poets and Poeticall Writers have in this point exceeded
others, leaving unto us the notions of Harpes, Centaurs, Gryphins, and
divers others. Now how ever to make use of fictions, Apologues and
fables be not unwarrantable, and the intent of these inventions might
point at laudable ends: Yet doe they afford to our junior capacities a
frequent occasion of error, setling impressions in our tender memories,
which our advanced judgements, doe generally neglect to expunge.
This way the vaine and idle fictions of the Gentils, did first insinuate
into the heads of Christians, and thus are they continued even unto our
dayes: Our first and literary apprehensions being commonly instructed
in Authors which handle nothing else; wherewith our memories be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stuffed, our inventions become Pedantick, and cannot avoid their
allusions, driving at these as at the highest elegancies, which are but the
frigidities of wit, and become not the genius of our more manly inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities.
It were therefore no losse like that of Galens study; if these
had found the same fate, and would in some way requite the neglect of
solid Authors, if they were lesse pursued. For surely were a pregnant
wit educated in ignorance hereof, receiving only impressions from
realities, from such solid foundations, it must needs raise more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
superstructions, and fall upon very many excellent straynes,
which have been jusled off by their intrusions.</p>

               <p>BUt beside the infirmities of humane nature, the seed of error with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our selves, and the severall wayes of delusion from each other,
there is an invisible Agent, and secret promoter without us, whose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity
is undiscerned, and playes in the darke upon us, and that is the
first contriver of Error, and professed opposer of Truth, the Divell.
For though permitted unto his proper principles, Adam perhaps would
have sinned, without the suggestion of Satan, and from the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
infirmities of himselfe might have erred alone, as well as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

there now in our natures a confessed sufficiency unto corruption; and
the frailty of our owne O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>conomie, were able to betray us out of
truth; yet wants there not another Agent, who taking advantage here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
proceedeth to obscure the diviner part, and essace all tract of its
traduction, to attempt a particular of all his wiles, is too bold an Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick
for man, what most considerably concerneth his popular, and
practised wayes of delusion, he first deceiveth mankinde infive maine
points concerning God and himselfe.</p>
               <p>And first his endeavours have ever been, and they cease not yet to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50218:29"/>
instill a beleefe in the minde of man, There is no God at all; and this
he specially labours to establish in a direct and literall apprehension,
that is, that there is no such reallity existent, that the necessity of his
entity dependeth upon ours, and is but a politicall Chymera; That
the naturall truth of God is an artificiall erection of man, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
himselfe but a subtile invention of the creature. Where hee suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not thus high, he labours to introduce a secendary and deductive
Atheisme, that although they concede there is a God, yet should they
deny his providence, and therefore assertions have flown about, that he
intendeth only the care of the species or common natures, but letteth
loose the guard of individualls, and single essences therein: That hee
looks not below the Moone, but hath designed the regiment of sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
affaires unto inferiour deputations; to promote which apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or empuzzell their due conceptions, he casteth in the notions of
fate, destiny, fortune, chance and necessity; tearms commonly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived
by vulgar heads, and their propriety sometime perverted by
the wisest. Whereby extinguishing in mindes the compensation of
vertue and vice, the hope and feare of heaven or hell, they comply in
their actions unto the drift of his delusions, and live like creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the capacity of either.</p>
               <p>Now hereby he not only undermineth the Base of religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth
the principle preambulous unto all beliefe, but puts upon us
the remotest error from truth. For Atheisme is the greatest falsity, and
to affirme there is no God the highest lie in Nature: and therefore
strictly taken, some men will say his labour is in vaine; For many there
are, who cannot concive there was ever any absolute Atheist, or such
as could determine there was no God, without all checke from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or contradiction from his own opinions; and therefore those few
so called by elder times, might be the best of Pagans, suffering that
name rather, in relation to the gods of the Gentiles, then the true Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour
of all. A conceit that cannot befall his greatest enemy, or him
that would induce the same in us, who hath a sensible apprehension
hereof, for he beleeveth with trembling. To speake yet more strictly
and conformably unto some opinions, no creature can wish thus much,
nor can the will which hath a power to runne into velleities, and wishes
of impossibilities, have any <hi>utinam</hi> of this. For to desire there were
no God, were plainly to unwish their owne being, which must needes
be anihilated in the substraction of that essence, which substantially
supporteth them, and restraines them from regression into nothing.
And if as some contend, no creature can desire his owne anihilation,
that nothing is not appetible, and not to be at all, is worse then to bee
in the miserable condition of something; the divell him selfe could not
embrace that motion, nor would the enemy of God be freed by such
a Redemption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:50218:29"/>
But coldly thriving in this designe, as being repulsed by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of humanity, and the Dictates of that production, which cannot
deny its originall, he fetcheth a wider cirle, and when he cannot make
men conceive there is no God at all, hee endeavours to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
there is not one but many; wherein he hath been so successefull
with common heads, that hee hath lead their beliefe thorow all the
workes of Nature.</p>
               <p>Now in this latter attempt, the subtilty of his circumvension, hath
indirectly obtained the former. For although to opinion there be many
gods, may seem an excesse in Religon, and such as cannot at all consist
with Atheisme, yet doth it diductively and upon inference include the
same: for unity is the inseparable and essentiall attribute of Deitie;
And if there be more then one God, it is no Atheisme to say there is no
God at all. And herein though Socrates onely suffered, yet were Plato
and Aristotle guilty of the same truth, who demonstratively under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the simplicity of perfection, and the indivisible condition of

which were indeed a fruitlesse attempt, and inferreth absurdities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

                  </gap>vacs, and such as made good the genealogie of Jupiters
braines, who although they had divers styles for God, yet under many
appellations acknowledged one divinity: rather conceiving thereby the
evidence or acts of his power in severall wayes and places, then a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
of Essence, or reall distraction of unity in any one.</p>
               <p>Againe, to render our errors more monstrous, (and what unto mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
sets forth the patience of God) hee hath endeavored to make the
world beleeve, that he was God himselfe, and fayling of his first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to be but like the highest in heaven, he hath obtained with men
to be the same on earth, and hath accordingly assumed the annexes of
divinity, and the prerogatives of the Creator, drawing into practise the
operation of miracles, and the prescience of things to come. Thus
hath he in a specious way wrought cures upon the sick: played over
the wondrous acts of Prophets, and counterfeited many miracles of
Christ and his Apostles. Thus hath he openly contended with God;
And to this effect his insolency was not ashamed to play a solemne
prize with Moses, wherein although his performance was very speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

which makes no regression from privations. The Stoicks that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned

fooles wandred about the earth, advantaged the conceit of this effect,
wherein the Epicureans, who held that death was nothing, nor nothing
after death, must contradict their principles to be deceived. Nor could
the Pythagorian or such as maintained the transmigration of souls give
easie admittance hereto: for holding that separated soule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

commandeth the fetters of the dead, and dwelling in the bottomlesse

the credulity of elder times to take up their lodging before his temple,

answers, whose accomplishments were in his power, or not beyond

               <p>Lastly, to lead us farther into darknesse, and quite to lose us in this
maze of error, he would make men beleeve there is no such creature as
himselfe, and that hee is not onely subject unto inferiour creatures
but in the ranke of nothing: Insinuating into mens mindes there is no
divell at all and contriveth accordingly, many wayes to conceale or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitate
his existency: wherein beside that hee anihilates the blessed
Angels and spirits in the ranke of his creation, hee begets a security of
himselfe and a carelesse eye unto the last remunerations. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hereto he inveigleth, not only the Sadduces and such as retaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church of God, but is also content that Epicurus Democritus or
any of the heathen should hold the same. And to this effect he maketh
men beleeve that apparitions, and such as confirme his existence are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deceptions of sight, or melancholy depravements of phancy: Thus
when he had not only appeared but spake unto Brutus, Cassius, the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curian
was ready at hand to perswade him it was but a mistake in his
weary imagination, and that indeed there were no such realities in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Thus he endeavours to propagate the unbelief of witches, whose
concession infers his coexistency, and by this means also he advanceth
the opinion of totall death, and staggereth the immortality of the soul:
for those which deny there are spirits subsistent without bodies, will
with more difficulty affirme the separated existence of their own.</p>
               <p>Now to induce and bring about these falsities he hath laboured to
destroy the evidence of truth, that is the revealed verity and written
word of God. To which intent he hath obtained with some to repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
the books of Moses, others those of the Prophets, and some both
to deny the Gospell and authentick histories of Christ, to reject that of
John, and receive that of Judas, to disallow all and erect another of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50218:31"/>
Thomas. And when neither their corruption by Valentinus and Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
their mutilation by Marcion, Manes and Ebion could satisfie his
designe, he attempted the ruine and totall destruction thereof, as he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulously
endeavoured, by the power and subtilty of Julian, Maximinus
and Dioclesian.</p>
               <p>But the longevity of that peece, which hath so long escaped the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fate, and the providence of that Spirit which ever waketh over it,
may at last discourage such attempts; and if not, make doubtfull its
mortality, at least indubitably declare, this is a stone too bigge for
Saturnes mouth, and a bit indeed Oblivion cannot swallow.</p>
               <p>And thus how strangely hee possesseth us with errors may clearely
be observed, deluding us into contradictory and inconsistent falsities,
whilest he would make us beleeve: That there is no God. That there
are many. That he himselfe is God. That he is lesse then Angels or
Men. That he is nothing at all. Nor hath hee onely by these wiles
depraved the conception of the Creator, but with such riddles hath
also entangled the Nature of our Redeemer. Some denying his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
and that he was one of the Angels, as Ebion; that the Father
and Sonne were but one person, as Sabellius. That his body was
phantasticall, as Manes, Basilides, Priscillian, Jovinianus; that hee
onely passed through Mary, as Eutichus and Valentinus. Some
deny his Divinity, that he was begotten of human<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> principles, and
the seminall sonne of Joseph, as Carpocras, Symmachus, Photinus.
That hee was Seth the sonne of Abraham, as the Sethians. That hee
was lesse then Angells, as Cherinthus. That hee was inferiour unto
Melchisedech, as Theodotus. That he was not God, but God dwelt
in him, as Nicolaus. And some embroyled them both. So did they
which converted the Trinity into a quaternity, &amp; affirmed two persons
in Christ, as Paulus Samosatenus; that held he was man without a soul,
and that the word performed that office in him, as Apollinaris. That
he was both Sonne and Father, as Montanus. That Jesus suffered, but
Christ remained impatible, as Cherinthus. And thus he endeavours
to entangle truths: And when he cannot possibly destroy its substance
he cunningly confounds its apprehensions, that from the inconsistent
and contrary determinations thereof, collective impieties, and hopefull
conclusion may arise, there's no such thing at all.</p>

               <p>NOw although these wayes of delusions, most Christians have esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
yet are there many other whereunto we are dayly betrayed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and these we meet with in visible and obvious occurrents of the world,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50218:32"/>
wherein he induceth us, to ascribe effects unto causes of no cognation,
and distorting the order and theorie of causes perpendicular to their
effects, he drawes them aside unto things whereto they runne parallel,
and in their proper motions would never meet together.</p>
               <p>Thus doth he sometime delude us in the conceits of Starres and
Meteors, beside their allowable actions ascribing effects thereunto of
independent causations. Thus hath he also made the ignorant sort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that naturall effects immediatly and commonly proceed from su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
powers, and these he usually derives from heaven; and his
owne principality the ayre, and meteors therein, which being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the effects of naturall and created causes, and such as upon a due
conjunction of actives and passives, without a miracle must arise unto
what they appeare, are alwayes looked on by the ignorant spectators
as supernaturall spectacles, and made the causes or signs of most succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
contingencies. To behold a Rain-bow in the night, is no prodigie
unto a Philosopher. Then eclipses of Sun or Moon, nothing is more
naturall. Yet with what superstition they have been beheld since the
Tragedy of Niceas, and his Army, many examples declare.</p>
               <p>True it is, and we will not deny it, that although these being naturall
productions from second and setled causes, we need not alway looke
upon them as the immediate hands of God, or of his ministring
Spirits, yet doe they sometimes admit a respect therein, and even in
their naturalls, the indifferencie of their existences contemporised unto
our actions, admits a farther consideration.</p>
               <p>That two or three Suns or Moons appeare in any mans life or reign,
it is not worth the wonder, but that the same should fall out at a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
time, or point of some decisive action, that the contingencie of its
appearance should be confined unto that time. That those two should
make but one line in the booke of fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and stand together in the great
Ephemerides of God, beside the Philosophical assignment of the cause,
it may admit a Christian apprehension in the signality.</p>
               <p>But above all he deceiveth us when wee ascribe the effects of things
unto evident &amp; seeming causalities which arise from the secret &amp; undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
action of himself. Thus hath he deluded many Nations in his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guriall
and Extispicious inventions, from casuall and uncontrived con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingences
divining events succeeding. Which Fuscan superstition first
ceasing upon Rome hath since possessed all Europe. When Augustus
found two galls in his sacrifice, the credulity of the City concluded a
hope of peace with Anthony, and the conjunctions of persons in cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
with each other. Because Brutus and Cassius met a Blackmore, and
Pompey had on a darke or sad coloured garment at Pharsalia; these
were presages of their overthrow, which notwithstanding are scarce
Rhetoricall sequells, concluding metaphors from realities, and from
conceptions metaphoricall inferring realities again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:50218:32"/>
Now these divinations concerning events being in his power, to
force, contrive, prevent or further, they must generally fall out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
unto his predictions. When Graceus was slaine, the same
day the Chickens refused to come out of the coope. And Claudius
Pulcher underwent the like successe, when he contemned the Tripu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary
Augurations. They dyed not because the Pullets would not
feed, but because the devill foresaw their death, he contrived that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
in them. So was there no naturall dependance of the event up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the signe, but an artificall contrivance of the signe unto the event.
An unexpected way of delusion, and whereby he more easily led away
the incercumspection of their beliefe. Which fallacy he might excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
have acted, before the death of Saul, which being in his power
to foretell, was not beyond his ability to foreshew, and might have
contrived signes thereof through all the creatures, which visibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the event, had proved authentick unto those times, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
the Art ever after.</p>
               <p>He deludeth us also by Philters, Ligatures, Charmes, ungrounded
Amulets, Characters, and many superstitious wayes in the cure of
common diseases, seconding herein the expectation of men with events
of his owne contriving: which while some unwilling to fall directly
upon Magick, impute unto the power of imagination, or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fficacy of
hidden causes, he obtaines a bloody advantage; for thereby he begets
not onely a false opinion, but such as leadeth the open way of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
In maladies admitting naturall reliefes, making men rely on
remedies, neither of reall operation in themselves, nor more then
seeming efficacy in his concurrence, which whensoever he pleaseth
to withdraw, they stand naked unto the mischiefe of their diseases, and
revenge the contempt of the medicines of the earth which God hath
created for them. And therefore when neither miracle is expected, nor
connexion of cause unto effect from naturall grounds concluded; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be sometime successefull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it cannot be safe to rely on such pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
and desert the knowne and authentick provisions of God. In
which ranke of remedies, if nothing in our knowledge or their proper
power be able to relieve us, wee must with patience submit unto that
restraint, and expect the will of the Restrainer.</p>
               <p>Now in these effects although he seeme oft times to imitate, yet
doth hee concurre unto their productions in a different way from that
spirit which sometime in naturall meanes produceth effects above Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
For whether he worketh by causes which have relation or none
unto the effect, he maketh it out by secret and undiscerned wayes of
Nature. So when Caius the blinde, in the reigne of Antonius, was
commanded to passe from the right side of the Altar unto the left, to
lay five fingers of one hand thereon, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive of the other upon his
eyes, although the cure succeeded and all the people wondered, there
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50218:33"/>
was not any thing in the action which did produce it, nor any thing in
his power that could enable it thereunto. So for the same infirmity,
when Aper was counselled by him to make a collyrium or ocular me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
with the bloud of a white Cock, and honey, and apply it to his
eyes for three dayes. When Julian for his haemoptysis or spitting of
bloud, was cured by hony and pine Nuts taken from his Altar. When
Lucius for the paine in his side, applyed thereto the ashes from his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
with wine, although the remedies were somewhat rationall, and not
without a naturall vertue unto such intentions, can we beleeve that by
their proper faculties they produced these effects?</p>
               <p>But the effects of powers Divine flow from another operation, who
either proceeding by visible meanes, or not unto visible effects, is able
to conjoyne them by his cooperation. And therefore those sensible
wayes which seeme of indifferent natures, are not idle ceremonies, but
may be causes by his command, and arise unto productions beyond
their regular activities. If Nahaman the Syrian had washed in Jordan
without the command of the Prophet, I beleeve he had beene cleansed
by them no more then by the waters of Damascus. I doubt if any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
Elisha had cast in salt, the waters of Jericho had not bin made
wholesome thereby. I know that a decoction of wilde gourd or Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthis,
though somewhat qualified, will not from every hand be dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
unto aliment by an addition of flower or meale. There was some
naturall vertue in the plaster of figs applyed unto Ezechias; we finde
that gall is very mundificative, and was a proper medicine to cleere the
eyes of Tobit; which carrying in themselves some action of their
owne, they were additionally promoted by that power which can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their natures unto the production of effects beyond their created
efficiencies. And thus may he operate also from causes of no power
unto their visible effects; for he that hath determined their actions unto
certaine effects, hath not so emptied his own but that he can make them
effectuall unto any other.</p>
               <p>Againe, although his delusions run highest in points of practise,
whose errors draw on offensive or penall enormities, yet doth he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
deale in points of speculation, and things whose knowledge termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
in themselves, whose cognition although it seemes independent,
and therefore its aberration directly to condemne no man; Yet doth he
hereby preparatively dispose us unto errors, and deductively deject us
into destructive conclusions.</p>
               <p>That the Sun, Moone and Stars are living creatures, endued with
soule and life, seemes an innocent error, and a harmelesse digression
from truth; yet hereby he confirmed their Idolatry, and made it more
plausibly embraced. For wisely mistrusting that reasonable spirits
would never firmely be lost in the adorement of things inanimate, and
in the lowest forme of Nature, he begat an opinion that they were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50218:33"/>
creatures, and could not decay for ever.</p>
               <p>That spirits are corporeall, seemes at first view a conceit derogative
unto himselfe, and such as he should rather labour to overthrow; yet
hereby he establisheth the doctrine of Lustrations, Amulets and
Charmes, as we have declared before.</p>
               <p>That there are two principles of all things, one good, and another
evill; from the one proceeding vertue, love, light, and unity; from the
other division, discord, da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>knesse and deformity, was the speculation
of Pythagoras, Empedocles, and many ancient Philosophers, and was
no more then Oromasdes and Arimanius of Zoroaster; yet hereby he
obtained the advantage of Adoration, and as the terrible principle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more dreadfull then his Maker, and therefore not willing to let it
fall, he furthered the conceit in succeeding Ages, and raised the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es to maintaine it.</p>
               <p>That the feminine sex have no generative emission, affording rather
place then principles of conception, was Aristotles opinion of old,
maintained still by some, and will be countenanced by him for ever.
For hereby he disparageth the fruit of the Virgin, and frustrateth the
fundamental<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Prophesie, nor can the seed of the woman then breake the
head of the Serpent.</p>
               <p>Nor doth he onely sport in speculative errors, which are of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
impieties, but the unquietnesse of his malice hunts after simple
lapses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and such whose falsities do onely condemne our understandings.
Thus if Xenophanes will say there is an other world in the Moone; If
Heraclitus with his adherents will hold the Sunne is no bigger then it
appeareth; If Anaxagoras affirme that Snow is black; If any other
opinion there are no Antipodes, or that the Stars do fall, shall he want
herein the applause or advocacy of Satan. For maligning the tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of truth, he delighteth to trouble its streames, and being a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
enemy unto God, (who is truth it selfe) he promoteth any error
as derogatory to his nature, and revengeth himselfe in every deformity
from truth. If therefore at any time he speake or practise truth it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
designe, and a subtile inversion of the precept of God, to doe good
that evill may come of it. And therefore sometimes wee meet with
wholesome doctrines from hell, <hi>Nossete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>psum:</hi> The Motto of Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos
was a good precept in morality, That a just man is beloved of the
gods, an uncontroulable verity. Twas a good deed, though not well
done, which he wrought by Vespasian, when by the touch of his foot
he restored a lame man, and by the stroake of his hand another that
was blinde; but the intention hereof drived at his owne advantage, for
hereby hee not onely confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>med the opinion of his power with the
people, but his integrity with Princes, in whose power he knew it
lay to overthrow his Oracles, and silence the practise of his delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50218:34"/>
But indeed of such a diffused nature, and so large is the Empire of
truth, that it hath place within the walles of hell, and the divels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are dayly forced to practise it; not only as being true themselves
in a Metaphysicall verity, that is, as having their essence conformable
unto the Intellect of their maker, but making use of Morall and Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
verities, that is, whether in the conformity of words unto things,
or things unto their owne conceptions, they practise truth in common
among themselves. For although without speech they intuitively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
each other, yet doe their apprehensions proceed through reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and they conceive each other by species, which carry the true and
proper notions of things conceived. And so also in Morall veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
although they deceive us, they lye not unto each other; as well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
that all community is continued by truth, and that of hell
cannot consist without it.</p>
               <p>To come yet nearer to the point and draw into a sharper angle;
They doe not onely speake and practise truth, but may bee said well-wisher
thereunto, and in some sense doe really desire its enlargement.
For many things which in themselves are false, they doe desire were
true; Hee cannot but wish hee were as he professeth, that hee had the
knowledge of future events, were it in his power, the Jewes should be
in the right, and the Messias yet to come. Could his desires effect it,
the opinion of Aristotle should be true, the world should have no end,
but be as Immortall as himselfe. For thereby hee might evade the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of those afflictions, he now but gradually endureth, for
comparatively unto those flames hee is but yet in Balneo, then begins
his <hi>Ignis Rotae,</hi> and terrible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ire, which will determine his disputed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie,
and hazard his immortality.</p>
               <p>But to speake strictly, hee is in these wishes no promoter of verity,
but if considered some wayes injurious unto truth, for (besides that if
things were true, which now are false, it were but an exchange of their
natures, and things must then be false, which now are true) the setled
and determined order of the world would bee perverted, and that
course of things disturbed, which seemed best unto the wise contriver.
For whilest they murmure against the present disposure of things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating
their determined realityes unto their private optations, they
rest not in their established natures, but unwishing their unalterable ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
doe tacitely desire in them a difformitie from the primitive rule,
and the Idea of that minde that formed all things best. And thus hee
offended truth even in his first attempt; For not content with his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nature, and thinking it too low, to be the highest creature of God,
he offended the ordainer thereof, not onely in the attempt, but in the
wish and simple volition thereof.</p>

               <p>Now besides authoritie against it, there may be many reasons dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from their severall differences which seeme to overthrow it. And
first, a difference is probable in their concretion. For if Crystall be a
stone, (as in the number thereof it is confessedly received) it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
concreted by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fficacy of cold, but rather by a Minerall
spirit, and lapid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ficall principles of its owne, and therefore while it lay
<hi>in solutis principiis,</hi> and remained in a fluid body, it was a subject very
unapt for proper conglaceation; for Minerall spirits, doe generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
and scarce submit thereto. So wee observe that many waters and
springs will never freez, and many parts in rivers and lakes, where there
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Minerall eruptions, will still persist without congelation; as we also
visibly observe, in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or any Minerall solution, either of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioll,
Alum, Salpeter, Ammoniac, or Tartar; which although to some
degree exhaled and placed in cold conservatories, will Crystallise and
shoot into white and glacious bodyes; yet is not this a congelation pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
effected by cold, but an intrinsecall induration from themselves,
and a retreat into their proper solidityes, which were absorbed by the
licour, and lost in a full imbibition thereof before. And so also when
wood and many other bodies doe petrifie, either by the sea, other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or earths abounding in such spirits, doe wee usually ascribe their
induration to cold, but rather unto salinous spirits, concretive juyces,
and causes circumj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cent, which doe assimilate all bodyes not indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for their impressions.</p>
               <p>But Ice is only water congealed by the frigidity of the ayre, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it acquireth no new forme, but rather a consistence or determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of its diffluency, and amitteth not its essence, but its condition of
fluidity; neither doth there any thing properly conglaciate but water,
or watery humidity; for the determination of quick-silver is properly
fixation, that of milke coagulation, and that of oyle and unctious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
onely incrassation; And therefore Aristotle makes a triall of the
fertility of humane seed, from the experiment of congelation, for that
sayth hee, which is not watery and improlificall will not conglaciate,
which perhaps must not be taken strictly, but in the germe and spirited
particles: for egges I observe will freeze, in the generative and albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous
part thereof. And upon this ground Paracelsus in his Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxis,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50218:35"/>
extracteth the magistery of wine, after foure moneths dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
in horsedunge, exposing it unto the extremity of cold, whereby
the aqueous parts will freeze, but the Spirit retyre and be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congealed
in the center.</p>
               <p>Againe, the difference of their concretion is not without reason,
collectible from their dissolution, which being many wayes perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in Ice, is not in the same manner effected in Crystall. Now the
causes of liquation are contrary to those of concretion, and as the atoms
and indivisible parcels are united, so are they in an opposite way dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.
That which is concreted by exsiccation or expression of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
wil be resolved by humectation, as earth, dirt, and clayi; that which
is coagulated by a fiery siccity, will suffer colliquation from an aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
humidity, as salt and sugar, which are easily dissoluble in water,
but not without difficulty in oyle, and well rectified spirits of wine.
That which is concreated by cold, will dissolve by a moist heat, if it
consist of watery parts, as Gums, Arabick, Tragacanth, Ammoniac,
and others, in an ayrie heat or oyle, as all resinous bodies, Turpentine,
Pitch, and Frankincense; in both as gummy resinous bodies, Masticke,
Camphire, and Storax; in neither, as neutralls and bodies anomalous
hereto, as Bdellium, Myrrhe and others. Some by a violent dry heat,
as mettalls, which although corrodible by waters, yet will they not
suffer a liquation from the powerfullest heat, communicable unto that
element. Some will dissolve by this heat although their ingredients
be earthy, as glasse, whose materialls are fine sand, and the ashes of
Chali or Fearne; and so will salt runne with fire, although it bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
by heat, and this way alone may bee effected a liquation in
Crystall, but not without some difficulty; that is, calcination or redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it by Arte, into a subtile powder, by which way and a vitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
commixture, glasses are sometime made hereof, and it becomes the
chiefe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t ground for artificiall and factitious gemmes; but the same way
of solution is common also unto many stones, and not only Berylls and
Cornelians, but flints and pebbles, are subject unto fusion, and will
runne like glasse in fire.</p>
               <p>But Ice will dissolve in any way of heat, for it will dissolve with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ire, it will colliquate in water, or warme oyle; nor doth it only submit
to an actuall heat, but not endure the potentiall calidity of many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
for it will presently dissolve in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> sp. of vitrioll, salt or
tartar, nor will it long continue its fixation in spirits of wine, as may
be observed in Ice injected therein.</p>
               <p>Againe, the concretion of Ice will not endure a dry attrition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
liquation; for if it be rubbed long with a cloth it melteth, but
Crystall will calefy unto electricity, that is a power to attract strawes
or light bodies, and convert the needle freely placed; which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarement
of very different parts, wherein wee shall not at present
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50218:36"/>
inlarge, as having discoursed at full concerning such bodies in the
Chap of Electricks.</p>
               <p>They are differenced by supernatation or floating upon water, for
Chrystall will sinke in water as carrying in its owne bulke a greater
ponderosity, then the space in any water it doth occupy, and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
only swim in molten mettall, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Quicksilver. But Ice will swim in
water of what thinnesse soever; and though it sinke in oyle, will float
in spirits of wine or <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi> And therefore it may swim in water, not
only as being water it selfe, and in its proper place, but perhaps as
weighing no more then the water it possesseth. And therefore as it
will not sinke unto the bottome, so will it neither float above like ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bodies, but being neare, or inequality of weight, lye superficially
or almost horizontally unto it. And therefore also an Ice or congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of salt or sugar, although it descend not unto the bottome, yet will
it abate, and decline below the surface in thin water, but very sensibly
in spirits of wine. For Ice although it seemeth as transparent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
as Chrystall, yet is it short in either, for its atoms are not concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into continuity, which doth diminish its translucency; it is also full
of spumes and bubbles, which may abate its gravity. And therefore
waters frozen in pans, and open glasses, after their dissolution do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
leave a froth, and spume upon them.</p>
               <p>They are distinguisht into substance of parts and the accidents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that is in colour and figure; for Ice is a similary body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
concretion, whose materiall is properly water, and but acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
exceeding the simplicity of that element; but the body of Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall
is mixed, its ingredients many, and sensibly containeth those prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
into which mixt bodies ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> reduced; for beside the spirit and
mercuriall principle, it containeth a sulphur or inflamable part, and
that in no small quantity; for upon collision with steele, it will actually
send forth its sparkes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not much inferior unto a flint. Now such bodies
only strike fire as have a sulphur or ignitible parts within them. For as
we elsewhere declare, these scintillations are not the accension of the
ayre, upon the collision of two hard bodies, but rather the inflamable
effluencies discharged from the bodies collided. For diamonds, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
heliotropes, and agaths, though hard bodies, will not strike fire,
nor one steele easily with another, nor a flint easily with a steele, if they
both be wet, for then the sparkes are quenched in their eruption.</p>
               <p>It containeth also a salt, and that in some plenty which may occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its fragility, as is also observable in corall. This by the art of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry
is separable unto the operations whereof it is lyable, with other
concretions, as calcination, reverberation, sublimation, distillation:
And in the preparation of Crystall, Paracelsus hath made a rule for
that of Gemms, as he declareth in his first <hi>de praeparationibu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it consisteth of such parts so far from an Ici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

menstruums are made for its emolition, whereby it may receive the
tincture of minerals, and so resemble Gemms, as Boetius hath declared
in the distillation of Urine, spirits of wine, and turpentine, and is not
onely triturable, and reduceable into powder, by contrition, but will
subsist in a violent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ire, and endure a vitrification: Wherby are testified
its earthy and fixed parts. For vitrification is the last worke of fire,
and when that arriveth, humidity is exhaled, for powdered glasse emits
no fume or exhalation although it bee laid upon a red hot iron. And
therefore when some commend the powder of burnt glasse against the
stone, they fall not under my comprehension, who cannot conceive
how a body should be farther burned, which hath already passed the
extr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amest teste of fire.</p>
               <p>As for colour although crystall in his pellucide body seems to have
none at all, yet in its reduction into powder, it hath a vaile and shadow
of blew, and in its courser peeces, is of a sadder hue, then the powder
of Venice glasse, which complexion it will maintaine although it long
endure the fire; which notwithstanding needs not move us unto won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for vitrified and pellucide bodyes, are of a clearer complexion in
their continuities, then in their powders and Atomicall divisions. So
<hi>Stibium</hi> or glasse of Antimony, appears somewhat red in glasse, but in
its powder yellow; so painted glasse of a sanguine red will not ascend in
powder above a murrey.</p>
               <p>As for the figure of crystall (which is very strange, and forced
Plinie to the despaire of resolution) it is for the most part hexagonall
or six cornerd, being built upon a confused matter from whence as it
were from a root angular figures arise, as in the Amethists and Basaltes,
which regular figuration hath made some opinion, it hath not its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
from circumscription or as conforming unto contiguities,
but rather from a seminall root, and formative principle of its owne, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as we observe in severall other concretions. So the stones which
are sometime found in the gall of a man, are most triangular, and py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramidall,
although the figure of that part seems not to cooperate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

                     </gap>,</hi> that famous remedy for the stone, hath circular
lines in length all downe its body, and equidistant, as though they had
been turned by Art. So that we call a Fayrie stone, and is often found
in gravell pits amongst us, being of an hemisphericall figure, hath five
double lines arising from the center of its basis, which if no accretion
distract them doe commonly concur and meet in the pole thereof. The
figures are regular in many other stones, as in the Belemnites, <hi>Lapis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinus,
Cornu Amn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onis,</hi> and divers beside, as by those which have not
the experience hereof may be observed in their figures expressed by
Mineralogistes. But Ice receiveth its figure according unto the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
wherein it concreteth or the circumamb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50218:37"/>
it. So is it plaine upon the surface of water, but round in hayle,
(which is also a glaciacion) and figured in its guttulous descent from
the ayre. And therefore Aristotle in his Meteors concludeth that haile
which is not round is congealed nearer the earth, for that which falleth
from an high, is by the length of its journey corraded, and descendeth
therefore in a lesser magnitude, but greater rotundity unto us.</p>
               <p>They are also differenced in the places of their generation; for though
Crystall be found in cold countries, and where Ice remaineth long,
and the ayre exceedeth in cold, yet is it also found in regions, where
Ice is seldome seen or soon dissolved, as Plinie and Agricola relate of
Cyprus, Caramania and an Island in the Red-sea; it is also found in the
veynes of Mineralls, in rocks, and sometime in common earth. But as
for Ice it will not concrete but in the approachment of the ayre, as we
have made tryall in glasses of water, covered halfe an inche with oyle,
which will not easily freeze in the hardest frosts of our climate; for
water concreteth first in its surface, and so conglaciates downward, and
so will it doe although it be exposed in the coldest mettall of lead;
which well accordeth with that expression of God, Job 38. The
waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</p>
               <p>They have contrary qualities elementall, and uses medicinall; for
Ice is cold and moyst, of the quality of water: But Crystall is cold
and dry, according to the condition of earth, the use of Ice is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by most Physitians; that of Chrystall commended by many. For
although Dioscorides and Galen, have left no mention thereof; yet
hath Mathiolus, Agricola, and many other commended it in disenteries
and fluxes; all for the encrease of milke, most Chymistes for the stone,
and some as Brassavolus and Boetius, as an antidote against p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oyson:
Which occult and specificall operations, are not expectible from Ice;
for being but water congealed, it can never make good such qualities,
nor will it reasonably admit of secret proprieties, which are the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of formes, and compositions at distance from their elements.</p>
               <p>Having thus declared what Chrystall is not, it may afford some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to manifest what it is. To deliver therefore what with the
judgement of approved Authors, and best reason consisteth, It is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
body in the difference of stones, and reduced by some unto that
subdivision, which comprehendeth gemmes; transparent and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

                  </gap>cy, but not its immediate
determination and efficiency, which are wrought by the hand of its
concretive spirit, the seeds of petrification and Gorgon within it selfe;
as we may conceive in stones and gems, as Diamonds, Beryls, Saphires
and the like, whose generation we cannot with satisfaction confine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the remote activity of the Sun, or the common operation of cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50218:37"/>
in the earth, but may more safely referre it unto a lapidificall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and congelitive principle which determines prepared materials
unto specificall concretions. And therefore I feare we commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
subterranities not in contemplations sufficiently respective unto
the creation. For though Moses have left no mention of minerals, nor
made any other description then sutes unto the apparent and visible
creation; yet is there unquestionably, a very large Classis of creatures
in the earth farre above the condition of elementarity: And although
not in a distinct and indisputable way of vivency, or answering in all
points the properties or affections of plants, yet in inferiour and descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
constitutions, they do like these containe specificall distinctions,
and are determined by seminalities; that is created, and defined seeds
committed unto the earth from the beginning. Wherein although they
attaine not the indubitable requisites of Animation, yet have they a
neere affinity thereto. And though we want a proper name and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
appellation, yet are they not to be closed up in the generall name of
concretions, or lightly passed over as onely Elementary, and Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>xtions.</p>
               <p>The principle and most gemmary affection is its Tralucency; as
for irradiancy or sparkling which is found in many gems it is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
in this, for it commeth short of their compactnesse and duri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and therefore it requireth not the Eme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry, as Diamonds or Topaze,
but will receive impression from steele, more easily then the Turchois.
As for its diaphanity or perspicuity, it enjoyeth that most eminently,
and the reason thereof is its continuity, as having its earthly &amp; salinous
parts so exactly resolved, that its body is left imporous and not discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by atomicall terminations. For, that continuity of parts, is the
cause of perspicuity, is made perspicuous by two wayes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xperiment,
that is either in effecting transparency in those bodyes which were not
so before, or at least far short of the additionall degree. So snow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
transparent upon liquation, so hornes and bodyes resolveable
into continued parts or gelly. The like is observable in oyled paper,
wherein the interstitial divisions being continuated by the accession of
oyle, it becommeth more transparent, and admits the visible rayes
with lesse umbrosity. Or else by rendring those bodies opacus which
were before pellucide and perspicuous. So glasse which was before
diaphanous, being by powder reduced into multiplicity of superficies,
becomes an opacus body, and will not transmit the light: and so it is
in crystall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owdered, and so it is also evident before; for if it be made
hot in a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>usible, and presently projected upon water, it will grow dim,
and abate its diaphanity, for the water entring, the body begets a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of parts, and a termination of Atoms united before unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity.</p>
               <p>The ground of this opinion might be, first the conclusions of some
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50218:38"/>
men from experience, for as much as Crystall is found sometimes in
rockes, and in some places not much unlike the stirious or stillicidious
dependencies of Ice; which notwithstanding may happen either in
places which havee been forsaken or left bare by the earth, or may be
petrifications, or Minerall indurations, like other gemmes proceeding
from percolations of the earth disposed unto such concretions.</p>
               <p>The second and most common ground is from the name <hi>Crystallus,</hi>
whereby in Greeke, both Ice and Crystall are expressed, which many
not duly considering, have from their community of name, conceived a
community of nature, and what was ascribed unto the one, not unsitly
appliable unto the other. But this is a fallacy of Aequivocation, from a
society in name inferring an Identity in nature. By this fallacy was he
deceived that drank <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> for strong water: By this are they delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
who conceive <hi>sperma Coeti</hi> (which is a bituminous superfluitance
on the Sea) to be the spawne of the Whale; Or take <hi>sanguis draconis,</hi>
(which is the gumme of a tree) to be the blood of a Dragon. By the
same Logick we may inferre, the Crystalline humor of the eye, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Crystalline heaven above, to be of the substance of Crystall
below; Or that Almighty God sendeth downe Crystall, because it is
delivered in the vulgar translation, Psal. 47. <hi>Mittit Crystallum suum

in a secret and invisible way what we evidently behold effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

And this will sufficiently appeare from the observations that
are to follow, which can no better way bee made out then this wee

do flye by streated Atomes and winding particles as <hi>Renatus
des Cartes</hi> conceaveth, or glide by streames attracted from either pole
and hemispheare of the earth unto the Aequator, as Sir Kenelme Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
excellently declareth, it takes not away this vertue of the earth,
but more distinctly sets downe the gests and progresse thereof, and are
conceits of eminent use to salve magneticall phenomena's. And as in
Astronomy those hypotheses though never so strange are best estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
which best do salve apparencies, so surely in Philosophy those
principles (though seeming monstrous) may with advantage be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
which best confirme experiment, and afford the readiest reason
of observation. And truly the doctrine of effluxions, their penetrating
natures, their invisible paths, and insuspected effects, are very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
for besides this magneticall one of the earth, severall effusions
there may be from divers other bodies, which invisibly act their parts
at any time, and perhaps through any medium, a part of Philosophy
but yet in discovery, and will I feare prove the last leafe to be turned
over in the booke of Nature.</p>
               <p>First, therefore it is evidently true and confirmable by every experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that steele and good Iron never excited by the Loadstone, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
in themselves a verticity; that is, a directive or polary faculty,
whereby conveniently they do septentrionate at one extreme, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stralize
at another; &amp; this is manifestible in long and thin plates of steel
perforated in the middle and equilibrated, or by an easier way in long
wires equiponderate with untwisted silke and soft wax; for in this
manner pendulous they will conforme themselves Meridionally, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
one extreame unto the North, another to the South. The
same is also manifest in steele wires thrust through little spheres or
globes of Corke and floated on the water, or in naked needles gently
let fall thereon, for so disposed they will not rest untill they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound
out the Meridian, and as neere as they can lye parallell unto the axis of
the earth: Sometimes the eye, sometimes the point Northward in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Needles, but the same point alwayes in most, conforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto the whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> earth, in the same manner as they doe unto every
Loadstone; For if a needle untoucht be hanged above a Loadstone, it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50218:39"/>
will convert into a parallel position thereto; for in this situation it can
best receive its verticity and be excited proportionably at both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes:
now this direction proceeds not primitively from themselves,
but is derivative and contracted from the magneticall effluxions of the
earth, which they have winded in their hammering and formation, or
else by long continuance in one position, as wee shall declare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>It is likewise true what is delivered of Irons heated in the fire, that
they contract a verticity in their refrigeration; for heated red hot and
cooled in the meridian from North to South, they presently contract a
polary power, and being poysed in ayre or water convert that part unto
the North which respected that point in its refrigeration; so that if they
had no sensible verticity before it may be acquired by this way, or if
they had any, it might be exchanged by contrary position in the coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
for by the fire they omit not onely many drossie and scorious
parts, but whatsoever they had received either from the earth or load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
and so being naked and despoiled of all verticity, the magneticall
Atomes invade their bodies with more effect and agility.</p>
               <p>Neither is it onely true what Gilbertus first observed, that Irons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerated
North and South acquire a Directive faculty, but if they be
cooled upright and perpendicularly they will also obtaine the same;
that part which is cooled toward the North on this side the Aequator,
converting it selfe unto the North, and attracting the South point of
the Needle: the other and highest extreme respecting the South, and
attracting the Northerne according unto the Laws Magneticall: for
(what must be observed) contrary poles or faces attract each other, as
the North the South, and the like decline each other, as the North the
North. Now on this side of the Aequator, that extreme which is next
the earth is animated unto the North, and the contrary unto the South;
so that in Coition it applyes it selfe quite oppositely, the coition or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
being contrary to the verticity or Direction. Contrary if wee
speake according unto common use, yet alike if we conceave the virtue
of the North pole to diffuse it self and open at the South, and the South
at the North againe.</p>
               <p>This polarity Iron refrigeration upon extremity and in defect of a
Loadstone might serve to invigorate and touch a needle any where;
and this, allowing variation, is also the truest way at any season to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the North or South; and surely farre more certaine then what is
affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>med of the graines and circles in trees, or the figure in the roote of
Ferne. For if we erect a red hot wire untill it coole, then hang it up
with wax and untwisted silke, where the lower end and that which
cooled next the earth doth rest, that is the Northerne point; and this
we affirme will still be true, whether it be cooled in the ayre or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
in water, oyle of vitrioll, Aqua fortis, or Quicksilver. And this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50218:40"/>
is also evidenced in culinary utensils and Irons that often feele the force
of fire, as tongs, fireshovels, prongs and Andirons; all which acquire
a magneticall and polary condition, and being suspended, convert their
lower extremes unto the North, with the same attracting the Southerne
point of the Needle. For easier experiment if wee place a Needle tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
at the foote of tongues or andirons, it will obvert or turne aside
its lyllie or North point, and conforme its cuspis or South extreme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the andiron. The like verticity though more obscurely is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by brickes and tiles, as wee have made triall in some taken out
of the backs of chimneys. Now to contract this Direction, there needs
not a totall ignition, nor is it necessary the Irons should bee red hot all
over. For if a wire be heated onely at one end, according as that end is
cooled upward or downeward, it respectively acquires a verticity, as
we have declared before in wires totally candent. Nor is it absolutely
requisite they should be exactly cooled perpendicularly, or strictly lye
in the meridia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, for whether they be refrigerated inclinatorily or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
Aequinoxially, that is toward the Easterne or Westerne points
though in a lesser degree, they discover some verticity.</p>
               <p>Nor is this onely true in Irons but in the Loadstone it selfe; for if a
Loadstone be made red hot in the fire it amits the magneticall vigour
it had before in it selfe, and acquires another from the earth in its refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration;
for that part which cooleth toward the earth will acquire the
respect of the North, and attract the Southerne point or cuspis of the
Needle. The experiment hereof we made in a Loadstone of a parallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logram
or long square figure, wherein only inverting the extremes as
it came out of the fire, wee altered the poles or faces thereof at
pleasure.</p>
               <p>It is also true what is delivered of the Direction and coition of Irons
that they contract a verticity by long and continued position; that is,
not onely being placed from North to South, and lying in the meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
but respecting the Zenith and perpendicular unto the center of the
earth, as is most manifest in barres of windowes, casements, hindges
and the like; for if we present the Needle unto their lower extremes,
it wheeles about it and turnes its Southerne point unto them. The same
condition in long time doe bricks contract which are placed in walls,
and therefore it may be a fallible way to finde out the meridian by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Needle on a wall for some bricks therein which by a long and
continued position, are often magnetically enabled to distract the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of the Needle.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Irons doe manifest a verticity not only upon refrigeration
and constant situation, but (what is wonderfull and advanceth the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall
hypothesis) they evidence the same by meer position accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as they are inverted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their extreams disposed respectively un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the earth. For if an iron or steele not formerly excited, be held per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50218:40"/>
or inclinatorily unto the needle, the lower end thereof
will attract the <hi>cuspis</hi> or southerne point; but if the same extream be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and held under the needle, it will then attract the lilly or nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
point; for by inversion it changeth its direction acquired before,
and receiveth a new and southerne polarity from the earth as being the
upper extreame. Now if an iron be touched before, it varyeth not in
this manner, for then it admits not this magneticall impression, as being
already informed by the Loadstone and polarily determined by its
pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>action.</p>
               <p>And from these grounds may we best determine why the Northern
pole of the Loadstone attracteth a greater weight then the Southerne
on this side the Equator, why the stone is best preserved in a naturall
and polary situation; and why as Gilbertus observeth, it respecteth that
pole out of the earth which it regarded in its minereall bed and subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
position.</p>
               <p>It is likewise true and wonderfull what is delivered of the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Declination of the Loadstone; that is, the descent of the
needle below the plaine of the Horizon: for long needles which
stood before upon their <hi>axis parallell</hi> unto the Horizon, being vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
excited, incline and bend downeward, depressing the North
extreame below the Horizon; that is the North on this, the South
on the other side of the Equator, and at the very Lyne or middle
circle of the Earth stand parallell, and deflecteth neither. And
this is evidenced not only from observations of the needle in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
parts of the earth, but sundry experiments in any part thereof, as in
a long steele, wires equilibrated or evenly ballanced in the ayre; for
excited by a vigorous Loadstone it will somewhat depresse its anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
extreme, and interest the horizontall circumference. It is also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in a needle pierced through a globe of Cork so cut away and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by degrees that it will swim under water, yet sinke not unto the
bottome, which may be well effected; for if the corke bee a thought
too light to sinke under the surface, the body of the water may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated
with spirits of wine; if too heavy, it may be incrassated with
salt; and if by chance too much be added, it may againe be thinned by
a proportionable addition of fresh water: if then the needle be taken
out, actively touched and put in againe, it will depresse and bow down
its northerne head toward the bottome, and advance its southerne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
toward the brim. This way invented by Gilbertus may seem
of difficulty; the same with lesse labour may be observed in a needled
sphere of corke equally contiguous unto the surface of the water; for if
the needle be not exactly equiponderant, that end which is a thought
too light, if touched becommeth even; that needle also which will but
just swim under water if forcibly touched will sinke deeper, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
unto the bottome. If likewise that inclinatory vertue be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50218:41"/>
by a touch from the contrary pole, that end which before was eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
will then decline; &amp; this perhaps might be observed in some scales
exactly ballanced, and in such needles which for their bulke can hardly
be supported by the water. For if they be powerfully excited &amp; equally
let fall, they commonly sink down and break the water at that extream
wherat they were septentrionally excited, &amp; by this way it is conceived
there may be some fraud in the weighing of precious commodities, and
such as carry a value in quarter grains, by placing a powerfull Loadstone
above or below, according as we intend to depres or elevate one extrem.</p>
               <p>Now if these magneticall emissions bee only qualities, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of bodyes incline them only unto the earth; surely that which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
other bodyes to descent carryeth not the stroak in this, but rather
the magneticall alliciency of the earth, unto which alacrity it applyeth
it selfe, and in the very same way unto the whole earth, as it doth unto
a single Loadstone: for if an untouched needle be at a distance suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
over a Loadstone, it will not hang parallel, but decline at the
north extreme, and at that part will first salute its Director. Again, what
is also wonderfull, this inclination is not invariable; for as it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
just under the line the needle lyeth parallel with the Horizon, but
sayling north or south it beginneth to incline, and increaseth according
as it approacheth unto either pole, and would at last endeavour to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
it selfe; and this is no more then what it doth upon the Loadstone,
and that more plainly upon the Terrella or sphericall magnet geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically
set out with circles of the Globe. For at the Aequator there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the needle will stand rectangularly, but approaching northward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the tropick it will regard the stone obliquely; &amp; when it attaineth
the pole directly, and if its bulk be no impediment, erect it self and stand
perp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndicularly thereon. And therefore upon strict observation of this
inclination in severall latitudes &amp; due records preserved, instruments are
made whereby without the help of Sun or Star, the latitude of the place
may be discovered; and yet it appears the observations of men have not
as yet been so just &amp; equall as is desirable, for of those tables of declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which I have perused, there are not any two that punctually agree,
though som have been thoght exactly calculated, especially that which
<hi>Ridley</hi> received fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mr. <hi>Brigs</hi> in our time Geometry Professor in <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is also probable what is delivered concerning the variation of the
compasse that is the cause and ground thereof, for the manner as being
confirmed by observation we shall not at all dispute. The variation of
the compasse is an Arch of the Horizon intercepted between the true
and magneticall meridian, or more plainly, a deflexion and siding East
and West from the true meridian. The true meridian is a major circle
passing through the poles of the world, and the Zenith or Vertex of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
place, exactly dividing the East from the West. Now on this lyne
the needle exactly lyeth not, but diverts and varieth its point, that is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50218:41"/>
the North point on this side the Aequator, the South on the other; som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
unto the East, sometime toward the West, and in some few pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
varieth not at all. First, therfore it is observed that betwixt the shore
of Ireland, France, Spaine, Guinie and the Azores, the North point
varieth toward the East, and that in some variety; at London it varieth
eleven degrees, at Antwerpe nine, at Rome but five, at some parts of
the Azores it deslecteth not, but lyeth in the true meridian on the other
side of the Azores; and this side the Equator the north point of the
needle wheeleth to the West, so that in the latitude of 36. neare the
shore, the variation is about eleven degrees; but on the other side the
Equator, it is quite otherwise: for about Capo Frio in Brasilia, the south
point varieth twelve degrees unto the West, and about the mouth of
the Straites of Magellan five or six; but elongating from the coast of
Brasilia toward the shore of Africa it varyeth Eastward, and ariving at
Capo de las Agullas, it resteth in the Meridian, and looketh neither
way.</p>
               <p>Now the cause of this variation may be the inequalitie of the earth,
variously disposed, and differently intermixed with the Sea: withall
the different disposure of its magneticall vigor in the eminencies and
stronger parts thereof; for the needle naturally endeavours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
unto the Meridian, but being distracted driveth that way where
the greater &amp; most powerfuller part of the earth is placed, which may
be illustrated from what hath been delivered before, and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by any that understands the generalities of Geographie. For
whereas on this side the Meridian, or the Isles of Azores, where the
first Meridian is placed, the needle varieth Eastward, it may bee occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
by that vast Tract of earth, that is, Europe, Asia, and Africa,
seated toward the East, and disposing the needle that way: For arriving
at some part of the Azores, or Islands of Saint Michaels, which have a
middle situation betweene these continents, and that vast and almost
answerable Tract of America, it seemeth equally distracted by both,
and diverting unto neither, doth parallell and place it self upon the true
Meridian. But sayling farther it <hi>veers</hi> its Lilly to the West, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
that quarter wherein the land is nearer or greater; and in the
same latitude as it approacheth the shoare augmenteth its variation.
And therefore as some observe, if Columbus or whosoever first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coved
America, had apprehended the cause of this variation, having
passed more then halfe the way, he might have been confirmed in the
discovery, and assuredly foretold there lay a vast and mighty continent
toward the West. The reason I confesse, and inference is good, but
the instance perhaps not so. For Columbus knew not the variation of
the compasse, whereof Sebastian Cabot first took notice, who after
made discovery in the Northern parts of that continent. And it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
indeed that part of America was first discovered, which was on

Thus also by reason of the great continent of Brasilia, Peru, and

unto the true Meridian, and is not distract by the vicinity of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacencyes.
And this is the generall and great cause of variation. But
if in certaine creekes and valleys the needle prove irregular, and vary
beyond expect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

earth, or Magneticall eminence not far distant. And this was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gilbert not many yeeres past, a Physition in London.
And therefore although some assume the invention of its direction, and
others have had the glory of the Carde, yet in the experiments,
grounds, and causes thereof, England produced the Father Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
and discovered more in it, then Columbus or Americus did
ever by it.</p>
               <p>It is also probable what is conceived of its Antiquity, that the
knowledge of its polary power and direction unto the North was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
unto the Ancients, and though Levinus Lemnius, and Caelius
Calcagninus, are of another beliefe, is justly placed with new inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

antiquity of this invention, it is not improbable they were performed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50218:42"/>
by the helpe of starres; and so might the Phaenicean navigators, and also
Vlysses saile about the Mediterranean, by the flight of birds, or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near the shore, and so might Hanno coast about Africa, or by the
helpe of oares as is expressed in the voyage of Jonah. And whereas it
is contended that this ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ticity was not unknowne unto Salomon, in
whom is presumed a universality of knowledge, it will as forcibly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
he knew the Arte of Typography, powder and gunnes, or had the
Philosophers stone, yet sent unto Ophir for gold. It is not to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that beside his politicall wisdome; his knowledge in Philosophie
was very large, and perhaps from his workes therein, the ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
especially Aristotle, who had the assistance of Alexanders
acquirements, collected great observables, yet if he knew the use of the
Compasse, his ships were surely very s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

voyage from Eziongeber in the red Sea unto Ophir, which is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be Taprobana or Malaca in the Indies, not many moneths sayle,
and since in the same or lesser time, Drake and Candish performed
their voyage about the earth.</p>
               <p>And as the knowledge of its verticity is not so old as some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
so is it more ancient then most beleeve; nor had its discovery
with gunnes, printing, or as many thinke, some yeers before the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of America; for it was not unknowne unto Petrus Peregrinus a
French man, who two hundred yeeres since hath left a Tract of the
Magnet &amp; a perpetual motion to be made thereby preserved by Gasse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.
Paulus Venetus and about five hundred yeers past, Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
make mention hereof, and quoteth for it a book of Aristotle <hi>de la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide,</hi>
which book although we find in the Catalogue of Laertius, yet
with Cabeus I rather judge it to be the work of some Arabick writer,
not many years before the dayes of Albertus.</p>
               <p>Lastly, It is likewise true what some have delivered of <hi>Crocus mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
that is, steele corroded with vineger, sulphur, or otherwise, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reverberated by fire. For the Loadstone will not at all attract it,
nor will it adhere, but lye therein like sand. This is to be understood of
<hi>Crocus martis</hi> well reverberated, and into a violet colour: for common
chalybs <hi>praeparatus,</hi> or corroded and powdered steele, the Loadstone
attracts like ordinary filings of iron, and many times most of that which
passeth for <hi>Crocus martis.</hi> So that this way may serve as a test of its
preparation, after which it becommeth a very good medicine in fluxes.
The like may be affirmed of Flakes of iron that are rusty and begin to
tend unto earth; for their cognation then expireth, and the Loadstone
will not regard them.</p>

it will seeme, and of great absurdity unto obstinate eares, if wee
say attraction is unjustly appropriated unto the Loadstone, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
we speake not properly, when wee say vulgarly the Loadstone
draweth Iron, and yet herein we should not want experiment and great
authority. The words of Renatus <hi>des Cartes</hi> in his principles of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
are very plain. <hi>Praeterea magnes trahet ferrum, sive potius mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
&amp; ferrum ad invicem accedunt, neque enim ulla ibi tractio est,</hi> The
same is solemnly determined by Cabius. <hi>Nec magnes trahit proprie fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>luunt.</hi> Concordant hereto is the assertion of Doctor Ridley,
Physition unto the Emperour of Russia in his Tract of Magnetical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
defining Magneticall attraction to be a naturall incitation and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
conforming unto contiguitie, an union of one Magneticall
body with an other, and no violent haling of the weak unto the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
And this is also the doctrine of Gilbertus, by whom this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is termed coition, and that not made by any faculty attractive of
one, but a Syndrome and concourse of each; a coition alway of their
vigours, and also of their bodies, if bulke or impediment prevent not,
and therefore those contrary actions which slow from opposite poles
or faces, are not so properly expulsion and attraction, as Sequela
and Fuga a mutuall flight and following.</p>
               <p>The same is also confirmed by experiment; for if a piece of iron be
fastened in the side of a bowle or bason of water, a Loadstone swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
freely in a boat of cork, will presently make unto it. And so if a
steele or knife untouched be offered toward the needle that is touched,
the needle nimbly moveth toward it, and conformeth unto union with
the steele that moveth not. Againe, If a Loadstone be finely filed, the
atoms or dust thereof will adheare unto iron that was never touched,
even as the powder of iron doth also unto the Loadstone. And lastly,
If in two skiphs of cork, a Loadstone and steele be placed within the
orbe of their activities, the one doth not move, the other standing still,
but both hoise sayle and steere unto each other; so that if the Loadstone
attract, the steele hath also its attraction; for in this action the Allicien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is reciprocall, which joyntly felt, they mutually approach and run
into each others armes.</p>
               <p>And therefore surely more moderate expressions become this
action, then what the Ancients have used, which some have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

               <p>Many relations are made, and great expectations are raised from
the Magnes Carneus, or a Loadstone, that hath a faculty to attract not
onely Iron but flesh; but this upon enquiry, and as Cabeus hath also
observed, is nothing else but a weake an inanimate kinde of Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
veyned here and there with a few magneticall and ferreous
lines, but chiefly consisting of a bolary and clammy substance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it adheres like Haematites, or Terra Lemnia, unto the Lipps, and this
is that stone which is to be understood, when Physitions joyn it with
Aetites or the Eagle stone, and promise therein a vertue against abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>There is sometime a mistake concerning the variation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
and therein one point is taken for another. For beyond the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
some men account its variation by the diversion of the Northerne
point, whereas beyond that circle the Southerne point is soveraigne,
and the North submits his preheminency. For in the Southerne coast
either of America or Africa, the Southerne point deflects and varieth
toward the land, as being disposed and spirited that way by the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dionall
and proper Hemisphere. And therefore on that side of the
earth the varying point is best accounted by the South. And therefore
also the writings of some, and Maps of others, are to be enquired, that
make the needle decline unto the East twelve degrees at Capo Frio,
and sixe at the straits of Magellan, accounting hereby one point
for another, and preferring the North in the liberties and province of
the South.</p>
               <p>But certainely false it is what is commonly affirmed and beleeved,
that Garlick doth hinder the attraction of the Loadstone; which is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
delivered by grave and worthy Writers; by Pliny, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Ptolomy, Plutarch, Albertus, Mathiolus, Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

many more. An effect as strange as that of Homers Moly, and the
Garlick the gods bestowed upon Ulysses. But that it is evidently f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lse,
many experiments declare. For an Iron wire heated red hot and
quenched in the juyce of Garlick, doth notwithstanding contract a
verticity from the earth, and attracteth the Southerne point of the
Needle. If also the tooth of a Loadstone be covered or stuck in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik,
it will notwithstanding attract and animate any Needles excited
and fixed in Garlick untill they begin to rust, doe yet retaine their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
and polary respects.</p>
               <p>Of the same stampe is that which is obtruded upon us by Authors
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50218:44"/>
ancient and moderne, that an Adamant or Diamond prevents or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spends
the attraction of the Loadstone, as is in open termes delivered
by Pliny. <hi>Adam as dissidet cum Magnete Lapide ut juxta positus ferru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non
patiatur abstrahi, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t si admotus magnes apprehenderit, rapiat atque aufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi>
For if a Diamond be placed betweene a needle and a Loadstone,
there will neverthelesse ensue a Coition even over the body of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond:
and an easie matter it is to touch or excite a needle through a
Diamond, by placing it at the tooth of a Loadstone, and therefore the
relation is false, or our estimation of these gems untrue; nor are they
Diamonds which carry that name amongst us.</p>
               <p>It is not suddenly to be received what Paracelsus in his booke <hi>De ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratione
rerum,</hi> affirmeth, that if a Loadstone be annointed with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiall
oyle, or onely put into Quicksilver, it omitteth its attraction for
ever. For we have found that Loadstones and touched needles which
have laid long time in Quicksilver have not amitted their attraction,
and we also finde that red hot needles or wires extinguished in quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver,
do yet acquire a verticity according to the Laws of position in
extinction. Of greater repugnancy unto reason is that which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
concerning its graduation, that heated in fire &amp; often extinguished
in oyle of Mars or Iron, it acquires an ability to extract or draw forth a
naile fastened in a wall; for, as we have declared before, the vigor of
the Loadstone is destroyed by fire, nor will it be reimpregnated by
any other Magnete then the earth.</p>
               <p>True it is, and we shall not deny, that besides fire some other wayes
there are of its destruction, as Age, Ruste, and what is least dreamt on
an unnaturall or contrary situation; for being impolarily adjoyned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a more vigorous Loadstone, it will in a short time exchange it poles,
or being kept in undue position, that is, not lying on the meridian or
with its poles inverted, it receaves in longer time impaire in activity
exchange of faces, and is more powerfully preserved by site then by
the dust of steele. But the sudden and surest way is fire, as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
before: that is, fire not onely actuall but potentiall; the one
surely and suddenly, the other slowly and imperfectly; the one chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
the other destroying the figure. For if distilled Vinegar or Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortis
be powred upon the powder of Loadstone, the subsiding pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
dryed, retaines some magneticall vertue, and will be attracted by
the Loadstone: but if the menstruum or dissolvent be evaporated to a
consistence, and afterward doth shoote into Icycles or crystalls, the
Loadstone hath no power upon them, and if in a full dissolution of
steele a separation of parts be made by precipitation or exhalation, the
exsiccated powder hath lost its wings and ascends not u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.
And though a Loadstone fired do presently omit its proper ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and according to the position in cooling contracts a new verticity
from the earth, yet if the same be laid a while in Aqua fortis or other
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50218:44"/>
corrosive water, and taken out before a considerable corrosion, it still
reserves its attraction, and will convert the Needle according to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
polarity.</p>
               <p>It is improbable what Pliny affirmeth concerning the object of its
attraction, that it attracts not only ferreous bodies, but also <hi>liquorem vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri,</hi>
for in the body of glasse there is no serreous or magneticall nature
which might occasion attraction. For of the glasse we use, the purest is
made of the finest sand and the ashes of Chali or Glasseworte, and the
courser or greene sort of the ashes of brake or other plants. Beside, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trification
is the last or utmost fusion of a body vitrifiable, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by a strong and violent fire, which keeps the melted glasse red
hot. Now certaine it is, and we have shewed it before, that the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
will not attract even steele it selfe that is candent, much lesse the
incongenerous body of glasse being fired. For fire destroyes the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
and therefore it declines it in its owne defence, and seekes no uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with it. But that the Magnet attracteth more then common Iron, we
can affirme. It attracteth the Smyris or Emery in powder, It draweth
the shining or glassie powder brought from the Indies, and usually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in writing dust. There is also in Smiths ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Iron whereby they appeare as it were glazed, sometime to bee
found a magneticall operation, for some thereof applyed have power
to move the Needle.</p>
               <p>It is also improbable and something singular what some conceive,
and Eusebius Nierembergius a late writer and Jesuit of Spain delivers,
that the body of man is magneticall, and being placed in a boate, the
vessell will never rest untill the head respecteth the North; if this be
true, the bodies of Christians doe lye unnaturally in their graves, and
the Jews have fallen upon the natural position, who in the reverence of
their Temple, do place their beds from North to South. This opinion
confirmed would much advance the microcosmicall conceite, and
commend the Geography of Paracelsus; who according to the cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
points of the world divideth the body of man, and therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
upon humane ordure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by long preparation rendring it odife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
he termes it <hi>Zibeta Occidentalis,</hi> Westerne Civet; making the
face the East, but the posteriors the America or Westerne part of his
microcosme. The verity or rather falsity hereof, might easily be tried
in Wales, where there are portable boats, and made of leather, which
would convert upon the impulsion of any verticity, and seeme to bee
the same whereof in his description of Brittaine, Caesar hath left some
mention.</p>
               <p>Another kinde of verticity,<note place="margin">Anagram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically.</note> is that which Angelus <hi>doce mihi jus, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
Michael Sundevogis, in a Tract <hi>de sulphure,</hi> discovereth in Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,
from sticks let fall or depressed under water; which equally

that which was verticall in its vegetation, wherein notwithstanding, as
yet, we have not found satisfaction; although perhaps too greedy of
magnallities, we are apt to make but favourable experiments concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
welcome truths, and such desired verities.</p>
               <p>It is also wondrous strange and untrue what Laelius Bisciola repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
that if unto ten ounces of Loadstone one of Iron be added, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
not unto eleven, but weighs ten ounces still: a relation inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
in the title of his worke, <hi>Horae subsecivae,</hi> or leasureable howres:
the examination being as ready as the relation, and the falsity tryed as
easily as delivered: nor is it to be omitted what is taken up by Caesius
Bernardus a late Mineralogist, and originally confirmed by Porta, that
needles touched with a Diamond contract a verticity, even as they doe
with a Loadstone, which will not consist with experiment. And
therefore, as Gilbertus obse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>veth, he might be deceived, in touching
such needles with Diamonds, which had a verticity before, as we have
declared most needles to have, and so had he touched them with gold
or silver, he might have concluded a magneticall vertue therein.</p>
               <p>In the same forme may we place Fracastorius his attraction of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Philostratus his Panturbes, Apollodorus, and Beda his relation of
the Loadstone that attracted onely in the night: but most inexcusable
is Franciscus Rueus, a man of our own profession, who in his Discourse
of gemmes mentioned in the Apocalyps, undertakes a Chapter of the
Loadstone; wherein substantially and upon experiment he scarce deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
any thing, making enumeration of its traditionall qualities,
whereof he seemeth to beleeve many, and some of those above, convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by experience, he is fain to salve as impostures of the Devill. But
Boetius de Boot Physi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this defect; and in his Tract, <hi>de lapidibus &amp; gemmis,</hi> speakes
very materially hereof, and his discourse is consonant unto experience
and reason.</p>
               <p>As for relations Historicall, though many there be of lesse account,
yet two alone deserve consideration; the first concerneth magneticall
rockes, and attractive mountaines in severall parts of the earth. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the tombe of Mahomet and bodies suspended in the aire. Of
rocks magneticall there are likewise two relations; for some are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be in the Indies, and some in the extremity of the North, and
about the very pole; the Northerne account is commonly ascribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Olaus Magnus Archbishop of Upsale, who out of his predecessour
Joannes, Saxo, and others, compiled a history of some Northerne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
but this assertion we have not discovered in that worke of his
which passeth among us, and should beleeve his Geographie herein no
more then that in the first line of his booke, when he affirmeth that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armia
(which is not seventy degrees in latitude) hath the pole for its
Zenith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Equinoctiall for the Horizon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:50218:45"/>
Now upon this foundation how uncertaine soever men have erected
mighty illations, ascribing thereto the cause of the needles direction,
and conceiving the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffluxions from these mountaines and rockes invite
the lilly toward the north; which conceit though countenanced by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men, is not made out either by experience or reason; for no man hath
yet attained or given a sensible account of the pole by some degrees;
it is also observed the needle doth very much vary as it approacheth the
pole, whereas were there such direction from the rocks, upon a nearer
approachment it would more directly respect them. Beside were there
such magneticall rocks under the pole, yet being so far removed they
would produce no such effect; for they that saile by the Isle of Flua
now called Elba in the Thuscan sea which abounds in veynes of Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
observe no variation or inclination of the needle, much lesse
may they expect a direction from rocks at the end of the earth. And
lastly, men that ascribe thus much unto rocks of the north must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
or discover the like magneticalls at the south: For in the southern
seas and far beyond the Aequator, variations are large, and declinations
as constant as in the northerne Ocean.</p>
               <p>The other relation of Loadstone, mines, and rocks, in the shore of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia
is delivered of old by Plinie; wherein saith he, they are so placed
both in abundance and vigor, that it proves an adventure of hazard to
passe those coasts in a ship with Iron nailes. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rapion the Moore an Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor of good esteeme and reasonable antiquity, confirmeth the same,
whose expression in the word <hi>magnes</hi> in this. The mine of this stone is
in the Sea coast of India, whereto when Ships approach, there is no Iron
in them which flyes not like a bird unto these mountains, and therefore
their Ships are fastened not with Iron but wood, for otherwise they
would bee torne to peeces. But this assertion how positive soever is
contradicted by all Navigators that passe that way, which are now
many and of our owne Nation, and might surely have been controuled
by Nearchus the Admirall of Alexander, who not knowing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
was faine to coast that shore.</p>
               <p>For the relation concerning Mahomet, it is generally beleeved his
tombe at Medina Talnabi, in Arabia, without any visible supporters
hangeth in the ayre betweene two Loadstones artificially contrived
both above and below, which conceit is very fabulous, and evidently
false from the testimony of ocular Testators; who affirme his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Maronites in their relations hereof. Of such intention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and attempt by
Mahometans we read in some relators, and that might be the occasion
of the fable; which by tradition of time and distance of place enlarged
into the story of being accomplished: and this hath been promoted by
attemps of the like nature; for we read in Plinie that one Dinocrates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50218:46"/>
to Arche the Temple of Arsinoe in Alexandria with Loadstone,
that so her statue might be suspended in the ayre to the amazement of
the beholders; and to lead on our credulity, herein confirmation may
be drawne from History and Writers of good authority: so is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by Ruffinus, that in the Temple of Serapis there was an iron
chariot suspended by Loadstones in the ayre, which stones removed,
the chariot fell and dashed into peeces. The like doth Beda report of
Bellerophons horse which framed of iron, and placed betweene two
Loadstones with winges expansed, hung pendulous in the ayre.</p>
               <p>The verity of these stories we shall not further dispute their possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
we may in some way determine; if we conceive, what no man will
deny, that bodies suspended in the aire have this suspension from one
or many Loadstones placed both above and below it, or else by one
or many placed only above it. Likewise the body to be suspended in
respect of the Loadstone above, is placed first at a pendulous distance
in the medium, or else attracted unto that site by the vigor of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone;
and so we first affirm that possible it is a body may be suspended
between two Loadstones; that is, it being so equally attracted unto
both that it determineth it selfe unto neither: but surely this position
will be of no duration; for if the ayre be agitated or the body waved
either way, it omits the equilibration and disposeth it selfe unto the
nearest attractor. Again, it is not impossible (though hardly fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sible) by
a single Loadstone to suspend an iron in the ayre, the iron being artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
placed, and at a distance guided toward the stone, untill it find the
newtrall point wherein its gravity just equalls the magneticall quality,
the one exactly extolling as much as the other depresseth; and thus
must be interpreted Fracastorius. And lastly, impossible it is that if
an iron rest upon the ground, and a Loadstone be placed over it, it
should ever so arise as to hang in the way or medium; for that vigor
which at a distance is able to overcome the resistance of its gravity
and to lift it up from the earth, will as it approacheth nearer be still
more able to attract it, and it will never remaine in the middle that
could not abide in the extreams; and thus is to be understood Gilbertus.
Now the way of <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> that by a thred fasteneth a needle to a
table, and then so guides and orders the same, that by the attraction of
the Loadstone it abideth in the aire, infringeth not this reason; for this
is a violent retention, and if the thred be loosened, the needle ascends
and adheres unto the Attractor.</p>
               <p>The third consideration concerneth relations Medicall, wherein what
ever effects are delivered, they are derived from its minerall and ferre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
condition, or else magneticall operation. Unto the ferreous and
minerall quality pertaineth what Dioscorides an ancient Writer and
Souldier under Anthony and Cleopatra, affirmeth, that halfe a dram
of Loadstone given with honey and water, proves a purgative medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50218:46"/>
and evacuateth grosse humors; but this is a quality of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
for omitting the vehicle of water and honey, which is of a
laxative power it selfe, the powder of some Loadstones in this dose
doth rather constipate and binde, then purge and loosen the belly.
And if sometimes it cause any laxity it is probably in the same way
with iron and steele unprepared, which will disturbe some bodies, and
worke by purge and vomit. And therefore, what is delivered in a
booke ascribed unto Galen that it is a good medicine in dropsies, and
evacuates the waters of persons so affected: It may I confesse by siccity
and astriction afford a confirmation unto parts relaxed, and such as be
hydropically disposed, and by these qualities it may be usefull in Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias
or Ruptures, and for these it is commended by Aetius, Aegineta
and Orbasius, who only affirme that it containes the vertue of Haema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
and being burnt was sometimes vended for it. To this minerall
condition belongeth what is delivered by some, that wounds which
are made with weapons excited by the Loadstone, contract a maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and become of more difficult cure; which neverthelesse is not to be
found in the incision of Chyrurgions with knives and lancets touched,
which leave no such effect behinde them. Hitherto must we also referre
that affirmative which sayes the Loadstone is poyson, and therefore in
the lists of poysons we finde it in many Authors; but this our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
cannot confirme, and the practice of the King of Zeilan clearly
contradicteth, who as Garcias <hi>ab Horto,</hi> Physitian unto the Spanish
Viceroy delivereth, hath all his meat served up in dishes of Loadstone,
and conceives thereby he preserveth the vigor of youth.</p>
               <p>But surely from a magneticall activity must be made out what is let
fall by Aetius, that a Loadstone held in the hand of one that is podagri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
doth either cure or give great ease in the gou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Or what Marcellus
Empericus affirmeth, that as an amulet it also cureth the head-ach, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
are but additions unto its proper nature, and hopefull enlargements of
its allowed attraction; for perceiving its secret power to draw unto it
selfe magneticall bodies, men have invented a new attraction to draw
out the dolor and paine of any part. And from such grounds it surely
became a philter, and was conceived a medicine of some venereall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
and therefore upon this stone they graved the Image of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
according unto that of Claudian, <hi>Venerem magnetica gemma fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurat.</hi>
Hither must wee also referre what is delivered concerning its
power to draw out of the body bullets and heads of arrows, and for
the like intention is mixed up in plaisters: which course although as
vaine and ineffectuall it be rejected by many good Authors, yet is it not
me thinks so readily to be denyed, nor the practice of many ages and
Physitians which have thus compounded plaisters, thus suddenly to be
condemned, as may be observed in the <hi>Emplastrum divinum Nicolai,</hi>
the <hi>Emplastrum nigrum</hi> of Augspurge, the Opodeldoch and <hi>At<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Paracelsus, with severall more in the Dispensatory of Wecker,
and practise of Sennertus; the cure also of Heurnias, or Ruptures in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,
and the method also of curation lately delivered by Daniel Beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herus,
and approved by the Professors of Leyden in the Tract <hi>de Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivoro
Prussiaco,</hi> 1636. that is, of a young man of Spruceland that casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
swallowed downe a knife about ten inches long, which was cut out
of his stomach and the wound healed up. In which cure to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ituation, there was applyed a plaister made up
with the powder of Loadstone. Now this kinde of practice Libavius,
Gilbertus, and lately Swickardus in his Ars Magnetica, condemne, as
vaine, and altogether unusefull; and their reason is, because a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
in powder hath no attractive power; for in that forme it omits his
polary respects, and looseth those parts which are the rule of its attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
wherein to speake compendiously, if experiment hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
us, we first affirme, that a Loadstone in powder omits not all
attraction. For if the powder of a rich veine be in a reasonable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
presented toward the Needle freely placed, it will not appeare to
be void of all activity, but will be able to stir it; nor hath it only a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to move the Needle in powder and by it selfe, but this will it also
doe, if incorporated and mixed with plaisters, as we have made triall
in the <hi>Emplastrum de Minio,</hi> with halfe an ounce of the masse, mixing a
dram of Loadstone, for applying the magdaleon or roale unto the
Needle it would both stir and attract it; not equally in all parts, but
more vigorously in some, according unto the mine of the stone more
plen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ifully dispersed in the masse. And lastly, in the Loadstone pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
the polary respects are not wholly destroyed; for those diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
particles are not atomicall or meerly indivisible, but consist of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions
sufficient for their conditions, though in obscure effects.
Thus if unto the powder of Loadstone or Iron we admove the North
pole of the Loadstone, the powders or small divisions will erect and
conforme themselves thereto: but if the South pole approach, they
will subside, and inverting their bodies respect the Loadstone with
the other extreame. And this will happen not only in a body of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
together, but in any particle or dust divided from it.</p>
               <p>Now though we affirme not these plaisters wholly ineffectuall, yet
shall we not omit two cautions in their use, that therein the stone bee
not too subtily powdered; for it will better manifest its attraction in a
more sensible dimension; that where is desired a speedy effect, it may
be considered whether it were not better to relinquish the powdered
plaisters, and to apply an entyre Loadstone unto the part: And
though the other be not wholly ineffectuall, whether this way be not
more powerfull, and so might have been in the cure of the young man
delivered by Beckerus.</p>
               <p>The last consideration, concerneth Magicall relations, in which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50218:47"/>
we comprehend effects derived and fathered upon hidden quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
specifical forms, Antipathies and Sympathies, whereof from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
grounds of Art, no reasons are derived. Herein relations are strange
and numerous, men being apt in all ages to multiply wonders, and
Philosophers dealing with admirable bodies as Historians have done
with excellent men, upon the strength of their great atchievements, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing
acts unto them not only false, but impossible, and exceeding
truth as much in their relations, as they have others in their actions.
Hereof we shall briefly mention some delivered by Authors of good
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>steem, whereby we may discover the fabulous inventions of some,
the credulous supinity of others, and the great disservice unto truth by

that are false, whereas wise men are ashamed there are so many
true.</p>
               <p>And first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dioscorides puts upon it a shrewd quality, and such as men

taken up above a thousand years after, &amp; Marbodeus the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
hath continued it the same in Latine verse, which with the notes of
Pictorious is currant unto our dayes. As strange must be the Litholmancy or divination from this stone, whereby as Tzetzes in his Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liads
delivers, Helenus the Prophet foretold the destruction of Troy;
and the Magick thereof, not safely to be beleeved, what was delivered
by Orpheus, that sprinkled with water it will upon a question emit a
voyce not much unlike an Infant. But surely the Loadstone of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius
Guascus the Physitian is never to be matched, wherewith as
Cardane delivereth, whatsoever needles or bodies were touched, the
wounds and punctures made thereby, were never felt at all. And yet
as strange a vertue is that which is delivered by some that a Loadstone
preserved in the salt of a Remora, acquires a power to attract gold out
of the deepest Wells. Certainly a studied absurdity, not casually cast
out, but plotted for a perpetuity: for the strangenesse of the effect
ever to bee admired, and the difficulty of the tryall never to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed.</p>
               <p>These conceits are of that monstrosity that they refute themselves
in their recitements: there is another of better notice, and whispered
thorow the world with some attention; credulous and vulgar auditors
readily beleeving it, and more judicious and distinctive heads, not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50218:48"/>
rejecting it. The conceit is excellent, and if the effect would
follow somwhat divine, whereby we might communicate like spirits,
and conferre on earth with Menippus in the Moone; which is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the sympathy of two needles touched with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For then saith tradition, at what distance of place soever, when one
needle shall be removed unto any letter; the other by a wonderfull
Sympathy will move unto the same. But herein I confesse my experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
can finde no truth; for having expresly framed two circles of
wood, and according to the number of the Latine letters divided each
into twenty three parts, placing therein two stiles or needles compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

that at distance, which nearer hand it cannot at all performe.</p>
               <p>Againe, the conceit is ill contrived, and one effect inferred, whereas
indeed the contrary will ensue. For if the removing of one of the
needls from A to B should have any action or influence on the other, it
would not intice it from A to B but repell it from A to Z: for needles

every distance to be tryed by every head: yet being no ordinary or
Almanack businesse, but a probleme Mathematicall, to finde out the
difference of houres in different places; nor doe the wisest exactly
satisfie themselves in all. For the houres of severall places anticipate
each other, according unto their Longitudes, which are not exactly
discovered of every place, and therefore the triall hereof at a considerable
intervall, is best performed at the distance of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

For unto such Situations it is noone and midnight at the very same

               <p>And therefore the Sympathie of these needles is much of the same
mould, with that intelligence which is pretended from the flesh of one

the Arte of Pythagoras; who could read a reverse in the Moone.</p>
               <p>Now this Magneticall conceit how strange soever, might have
some originall in reason; for men observing no solid body, whatsoever
did interrupt its action, might be induced to beleeve no distance would
terminate the same, &amp; most conceiving it pointed unto the pole of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
might also opinion that nothing between could restrain it. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
was the Author, the Aeolus that blew it about, was Famianus

of this subiect to expresse the stile of Lucretius. But neither <hi>Baptista

they deliver many wayes to communicate our thoughts at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
And this we will not deny may in some manner be effected by
the Loadstone; that is, from one room into an other, by placing a table
in the wall common unto both, and writing thereon the same letters
one against another: for upon the approach of a vigorous Loadstone
unto a letter on this side, the needle will move unto the same on the
other: But this is a very different way from ours at present; and hereof

men say the effect doth generally follow, it might be worth the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>Other Discourses there might be made of the Loadstone, as Morall,

                  </gap>dies Electricall.</head>
               <p>HAving thus spoake of the Loadstone and bodies magneticall, I
shall in the next place deliver somewhat of Electricall, and such as
may seeme to have attraction like the other; and hereof wee shall also
deliver what particularly spoken or not generally knowne is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
or probable true, what generally beleeved is also false or dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Now by Electricall bodies, I understand not such as are Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallicall
mentioned by Pliny, and the Ancients; for their Electrum
was a mixture made of gold, with the addition of the fifth part of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
a substance now as unknowne, as true Aurichalcum, or Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
brasse, and set downe among things lost by Pancirollus. Nor by
Electrick bodies do I conceive such onely as take up shavings, strawes,
and light bodies, in which number the Ancients onely placed Jet and
Amber; but such as conveniently placed unto their objects attract all
bodies palpable whatsoever. I say, conveniently placed, that is, in regard
of the object, that it be not too ponderous, or any way affixed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Agent, that it be not foule or sullied, but wiped, rubbed,
and excitated in regard of both, that they be conveniently distant, and
no impediment interposed. I say all bodies palpable, thereby excluding
fire, which indeed it will not attract, nor yet draw through it, for fire
consumes its effluxions by which it should attract.</p>
               <p>Now although in this ranke but two were commonly mentioned
by the Ancients, Gilbertus discovereth many more, as Diamonds, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyres,
Carbuncles, Iris, Opalls, Amethistes, Berill, Chrystall, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll
stones, Sulphur, Mastick, hard Wax, hard Rosin, Arsenic, Sal
gemme, roch Alume, common Glasse, Stibium, or glasse of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
unto these Cabeus addeth white Wax, Gum Elemi, Gum Guaici,
Pix Hispanica, and Gypsum. And unto these wee adde gum Anime,
Benjamin, Talcum, Chyna dishes, Sandaraca<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Turpentine, Styrax Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quida,
and Caranna dryed into a hard consistence. And the same at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
wee finde not onely in simple bodies, but such as are much
compounded, as the Oxicroceum plaster, and obscurely that <hi>ad Herni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
and <hi>Gratia Dei,</hi> all which smooth and rightly prepared, will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50218:49"/>
a sufficient power to stirre the needle setled freely upon a wel poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
pinne, and so as the Electrick may be applyed unto it without all
disadvantage.</p>
               <p>But the attraction of these Electricks we observe to be very different.
Resinous or unctuous bodies, and such as will flame, attract most vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
and most thereof without f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ication, as Anime, Benjamin and
most powerfully good hard wax, which will convert the needle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as actively as the loadstone; and wee beleeve that all or most of
this substance if reduced to hardnesse tralucency or cleerenesse, would
have some attractive quality; but juyces concrete, or gums easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
in water, draw not at all, as Aloe, Opium, Sanguis Draconis,
Lacca, Galbanum, Sagapenum. Many stones also both precious and
vulgar, although terse and smooth have not this power attractive; as
Emeralds, Pearle, Jaspis, Corneleans, Agathe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heliotropes, Marble,
Alablaster, Touchstone, Flint and Bezoar. Glasse attracts but weakely
though cleere, some slick stones and thick glasses indifferently: Arsenic
but weakely, so likewise glasse of Antimony, but Crocus Metallorum
not at all. Saltes generally but weakely, as Sal Gemma, Alum and also
Talke; nor very discoverably by any frication: but if gently warmed
at the fire, and wiped with a dry cloth, they will better discover their
Electricities.</p>
               <p>No mettall attracts, nor any concretian Animall wee know, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
polite and smoothe; as wee have made triall in Elkes hooves,
Hawkes talons, the sword of a Sword fish, Tortoyse shels, Sea-horse
and Elephants teeth, in bones, in Harts horne, and what is usually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Unicornes horne, no wood though never so hard and polished,
although out of some Electricks proceed, as Ebony, Box, Lignum
vitae, Cedar, &amp;c. And although Jet and Amber be reckoned among
Bitumens, yet neither doe we finde Asphaltus, that is, Bitumen of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,
nor Seacole, nor Camphire, nor Mummia to attract, although we
have tried in large and polished pieces. Now this attraction have wee
tried in strawes and paleous bodies, in needles of Iron equilibrated,
powders of wood and Iron, in gold and silver foliate, and not onely
in solid but fluent and liquid bodies, as oyles made both by expression
and distillation, in water, in spirits of wine, vitrioll and Aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>But how this attraction is made is not so easily determined; that
tis performed by effluviums is plaine and granted by most; for Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctricks
will not commonly attract, except they grow hot or be perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.
For if they be foule and obnubilated, it hinders their effluxion;
nor if they be covered though but with Linnen or Sarsenet, or if a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
be interposed, for that intercepts the effluvium. If also a powerfull
and broad Electrick of wax or Anime be held over fine powder, the
Atomes or small particles will ascend most numerously unto it; and if
the Electrick be held unto the light, it may be observed that many
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50218:50"/>
thereof will flye, and be as it were discharged from the Electrick to the
distance sometime of two or three inches, which motion is performed
by the breath of the effluvium issuing with agility; for as the Electrick
cooleth, the projection of the Atomes ceaseth.</p>
               <p>The manner hereof Cabeus wittily attempteth, affirming that this
effluvium attenuateth and impelleth the neighbour ayre, which retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
home in a gyration, carrieth with it the obvious bodies unto the
Electrick, and this he labours to confirme by experiments; for if the
strawes be raised by a vigorous electrick, they doe appeare to wave
and turne in their ascents; if likewise the Electrick be broad and the
strawes light and chaffy, and held at a reasonable distance, they will
not arise unto the middle, but rather adhere toward the verge or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
thereof. And lastly, if many strawes be laid together and a nimble
Electrick approach, they will not all arise unto it, but some will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
start aside and be whirled a reasonable distance from it. Now
that the ayre impelled returnes unto its place in a gyration or whirling,
is evident from the Atomes or moates in the Sun. For when the Sunne
so enters a hole or window, that by its illumination the Atomes or
moates become perceptible, if then by our breath the ayre bee gently
impelled, it may be perceived that they will circularly returne, and in
a gyration unto their places againe.</p>
               <p>Another way of their attraction is also delivered, that it is made by a
tenuous emanation or continued effluvium, which after some distance
retracteth into it selfe, as is observable in drops of syrups, oyle and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall
viscosities, which spun at length retire into their former dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
Now these effluviums advancing from the body of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrick,
in their returne doe carry back the bodies which they have laid
hold within the spheare or circle of their continuities, and these they
do not onely attract but with their viscous armes, hold fast a good
while after. And if any shall wonder why these effluviums issuing forth
impell and protrude not the straw before they can bring it back, it is
because Effluvium passing out in a smaller thred and more enlengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
filament, it stirreth not the bodies interposed but returning unto its
originall it falls into a closer substance, and carrieth them back unto it
selfe. And this way of attraction is best received, embraced by Sir Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelme
Digby in his excellent Treaty of bodies, allowed by <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
in his principles of Philosophy, as farre as concerneth fat and resinous
bodies, and with exception of glasse, whose attraction he also deriveth
from the recesse of its effluxion. And this in some manner the words
of Gilbertus will beare. <hi>Effluvia illa tenuior a concipiunt &amp; amplectuntur
corpora, quibus uniuntur, &amp; Electris tanquam extensis brachiis &amp; ad fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,
propinquitate invalescentibus effluviis, deducuntur.</hi> And if the
ground were true that the earth were an Electrick body, and the ayre
but the effluvium thereof, wee might perhaps beleeve that from this
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50218:50"/>
attraction and by this effluxion that bodies tended to the earth, and
could not remaine aboue it.</p>
               <p>Our other discourse of Electricks concerneth a generall opinion
touching Jet and Amber, that they attract all light bodies, except O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cymum
or B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sil, and such as be dipped in oyle or oyled, and this is
urged as high as Theophrastus: but Scaliger acquitteth him; And had
this bin his assertion, Pliny would probably have taken it up, who
herein stands out, and delivereth no more but what is vulgarly known.
But Plutarch speakes positively in his Symposiacks, that Amber at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth
all bodies, excepting Basil and oyled substances. With Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch
consent many Authors both ancient and moderne, but the most
inexcusable are Lemnius, and Rueus, whereof the one delivering the
nature of minerals, mentioned in Scripture the infallible fountaine of
truth, confirmeth their vertues with erroneous traditions; the other
undertaking the occult and hidden miracles of Nature, accepteth this
for one, and endeavoureth to alledge a reason of that which is more
then occult, that is not existent.</p>
               <p>Now herein, omitting the Authority of others, as the doctrine of
experiment hath informed us we first affirme, that Amber attracts not
Basil, is wholly repugnant unto truth; for if the leaves thereof or dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
stalkes be stripped into small strawes, they arise unto Amber, Wax,
and other Electries no otherwise then those of Wheate or Rye; nor is
there any peculiar fatnesse or singular viscosity in that plant that might
cause adhesion and so prevent its ascension. But that Jet and Amber
attract not strawes oyled, is in part true and false, for if the strawes be
much wet or drenched in oyle, true it is that Amber draweth them not,
for then the oyle makes the straw to adhere unto the part whereon
they are placed, so that they cannot rise unto the Attractor; and this is
true not onely if they be soaked in oyle, but spirits of wine or water.
But if we speake of strawes or festucous divisions lightly drawen over
with oyle, and so that it causeth no adhesion, or if we conceive an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
betweene oyle and Amber, the doctrine is not true; for Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
will attract strawes thus oyled, it will attract or convert the Needls
of Dials made either of Brasse or Iron, although they be much oyled;
for in these Needls consisting free upon their center there can be no
adhesion; it will likewise attract oyle it selfe, and if it approacheth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a drop thereof, it becommeth conicall and ariseth up unto it, for
oyle taketh not away his attraction, although it be rubbed over it. For
if you touch a piece of wax already excitated with common oyle, it
will notwithstanding attract<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though not so vigorously as before. But
if you moysten the same with any chymicall oyle, water or spirits of
wine, or onely breath upon it, it quite omits its Attraction, for either
its effluences cannot get through or will not mingle with those sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:50218:51"/>
It is likewise probable the Ancients were generally mistaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
its substance and generation, they conceiving it a vegetable
concretion made of the gums of trees, especially, Pine and Poplar fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into the water, and after indurated or hardened, whereunto accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the fable of Phaetons sisters: but surely the concretion is mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
according as is delivered by Boetius; for either it is found in
mountaines and mediterraneous parts, and so it is a fat and unctuous
sublimation in the earth concreted and fixed by salt and nitrous spirits
wherewith it meeteth; or else, which is most usuall, it is collected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the sea shore, and so it is a fat and bituminous Juice coagulated by
the saltnesse of the sea. Now that salt spirits have a power to congele
and coagulate unctuous bodies, is evident in chymicall operations, in
the distillations of Arsenick, sublimate and Antimony, in the mixture
of oyle of Juniper, with the salt and acide spirit of Sulphur, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ensueth a concretion unto the consistence of Birdlime; as also in
spirits of salt, or Aqua fortis powred upon oyle of Olive, or more
plainly in the manufacture of Soape. And many bodies will coagulate
upon commixture whose separated natures promise no concretion.
Thus upon a solution of Tinne by Aqua fortis, there will ensue a coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation,
like that of whites of egges. Thus the volatile salt of urine
will coagulate Aqua vitae, or spirits of wine; and thus perhaps (as Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont
excellently declareth) the stones or calculous concretions in
Kidney or bladder may be produced: the spirits or volatile salt of urine
conjoyning with the Aqua vitae potentially lying therein; as he illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strateth
from the distillation of fermented urine. From whence ariseth
an Aqua vitae or spirit, which the volatile salt of the same urine will
congele, and finding an earthy concurr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nce strike into a lapideous
substance.</p>
               <p>Lastly, we will not omit what Bellabonus upon his own experiment
writ from Dantzich unto Mellichius, as hee hath left recorded in his
Chapter, <hi>De succino,</hi> that the bodies of Flies, Pismires, and the like,
which are said oft times to be included in Amber, are not reall but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
and representative, as he discovered in severall pieces broke
for that purpose; if so, the two famous Epigrams hereof in Martiall
are but poeticall, the Pismire of Brassavolus Imaginary, and Cardans
Mousoleum for a flye, a meere phancy. But hereunto we know not
how to assent in the Generall, as having met with some whose Reals
made good their representations.</p>

ordered that the Goat should be fed with saxifragous herbes, and such
as are conceived of power to breake the stone. However it were as
the effect is false in the one, so is it surely very doubtfull in the other.
For although inwardly received it may be very diuretick, and expulse
the stone in the kidnyes; yet how it should dissolve or breake that in the
bladder, will require a further dispute, and perhaps would be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
tryed by a warme injection thereof, then as it is commonly
used. Wherein notwithstanding, we should rather relie upon the urine
in a Castlings bladder, a resolution of Crabs eyes, or the second distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of urine, as Helmont hath commended; or rather, if any such
might be found a Chylifactory menstruum or digestive preparation
drawne from species or individualls, whose stomacks peculiarly
dissolve lapideous bodies.</p>

not how to grant not only from the innocency of its ingredients, that is
fine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>and, and the ashes of glasse-wort or fearne, which in themselves
are harmelesse and usefull: or because I finde it by many commended
for the stone, but also from experience, as having given unto dogs
above a dram thereof, subtilly powdered in butter or paste, without any
visible disturbance. And the tryall thereof we the rather did make in
that animall, because Grevinus in his Treaty of poysons, affirmeth that
dogges are inevitably destroyed thereby.</p>
               <p>The conceit is surely grounded upon the visible mischiefe of glasse
grossely or coursely powdered; for that indeed is mortally noxious, and
effectually used by some to destroy myce and rats; for that by reason
of its acutenesse and augularity, commonly excoriates the parts
through which it passeth, and sollicits them unto a continuall expulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Whereupon there ensues fearfull symptomes, not much unlike
those which attend the action of poyson. From whence notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
we cannot with propriety impose upon it that name, either
by occult or elementary quality; which he that concedeth will much
enlarge the catalogue or listes of poysons; for many things, neither
deleterious by substance or quality, (are yet destructive by figure, or)
some occasionall activity. So are leeches destructive, and by some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
poyson; not properly, that is by temperamentall contrariety,
occult forme, or so much as elementall repugnancy; but because being
inwardly taken they fasten upon the veines, and occasion an effusion of
bloud, which cannot be easily stanched. So a sponge is mischievous,
not in it selfe, for in its powder it is harmlesse, but because being
recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the stomack it swelleth, and occasioning a contiuall disten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
induceth at last a strangulation. So pins, needls, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ares of Rye or
Barley, may be poyson. So Daniel destroyed the Dragon by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of three things, whereof neither was poyson alone, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
altogether, that is pitch, fat and haire, according as is expressed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50218:52"/>
in the History. Then Daniel tooke pitch, and fat, and haire, and did
seeth them together and made lumps thereof, these he put in the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
mouth, and so he bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st asunder; that is the fat and pitch being
cleaving bodies, and the haire continually extimulating the parts, by
the action of the one, nature was provoked to expell, but by the tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the other forced to retaine: so that there being left no passage
in or out, the Dragon brake in peeces. It must therefore bee taken of
grossely powdered glasse what is delivered by Grevinus, and from the
same must that mortall dissentery proceed which is related by Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;
and in the same sense shall we onely allow a Diamond to be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and whereby as some relate Paracelsus himselfe was poysoned.
And so also even the precious fragments and cordiall gems which are
of frequent use in Physicke, and in themselves confessed of usefull
faculties, received in grosse and angular powders, may so offend the
bowells, as to procure desperate languors, or cause most dangerous
fluxes.</p>
               <p>3. That Gold inwardly taken, and that either in substance, infusion,
decoction or extinction is a speciall cordiall of great efficacy, in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
medicall uses, although a practice much used is also much questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and by no man determined beyond dispute. There are hereof I
perceive two extream opinions; some excessively magnifying it, and
probably beyond its deserts; others extreamly vilifying it, and perhaps
below its demerits. Some affirming it is a powerfull medicine in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diseases, others averring that so used it is effectuall in none; and in
this number are very eminent Physitians, Erastus, Dur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tus, Rondele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Brassavolus, and many other; who beside the strigments and sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
adhesions from mens hands, acknowledge that nothing procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from gold in the usuall decoction thereof. Now the capitall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that led men unto this opinion was their observation of the insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
nature of gold; it being excluded in the same quantity as it was
received without alteration of parts, or diminution of its gravity.</p>
               <p>Now herein to deliver somewhat which in a middle way may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained;
we first affirm &amp; few I beleeve will deny it, that the substance
of gold is indeed invincible by the powerfullest action of naturall heat,
and that not only alimentally in a substantiall mutation, but also medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentally
in any corporeall conversion; as is very evident, not only in
the swallowing of golden bullets but in the lesser and foliate divisions
thereof; passing the stomack and guts even as it doth the throat, that is
without abatement of weight or consistence; so that it entereth not the
veynes with those electuaries, wherein it is mixed, but taketh leave of
the permeant parts, at the mouthes of the miseraicks, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
the inconvertible portion unto the siege; nor is its substantiall
conversion expectible in any composition or aliment wherein it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
And therefore that was truly a starving absurdity, which befell
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50218:53"/>
the wishes of Midas. And little credit there is to be given to the golden
Hen, related by Wendlerus. And so likewise in the extinction of
gold, we must not conceive it parteth with any of its salt or dissoluble
principle thereby, as we may affirme of Iron, for the parts thereof are
fixed beyond division; nor will they seperate upon the strongest test
of fire. And this we affirme of pure gold, for that which is currant
and passeth in stampe amongst us, by reason of its allay, which is a
proportion of copper mixed therewith, it is actually dequantitated
by fire, and possibly by frequent extinction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, although the substance of gold be not sensibly immuted
or its gravity at all decreased, yet that from thence some vertue may
proceed either in substantiall reception or infusion, we cannot safely
deny. For possible it is that bodyes may emit a vertue and operation
without abatement of weight, as is most evident in the Loadstone,
whose effluencies are both continuall and communicable without a
minoration of gravity. And the like is observable in bodies electricall,
whose emissions are lesse subtile. So will a Diamond or Saphire emit
an effluvium sufficient to move the needle or a straw without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of weight. Nor will polished amber although it send forth a
grosse and corporall exhalement be found a long time defective upon
the exactest scales.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if amulets doe worke by Aporrhoias, or emanations from
their bodies, upon those parts whereunto they are appended, and are
not yet observed to abate their weight; if they produce visible and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
effects by imponderous and invisible emissions, it may be unjust to
deny all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fficacie of gold in the non omission of weight, or deperdition
of any ponderous particles.</p>
               <p>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stly, since Stibium or glasse of Antimony, since also its Regulus
will manifestly communicate unto water, or wine, a purging and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory
operation; and yet the body it selfe, though after iterated infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
cannot be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>luences unto the
infusion which carry with them the subtiler nature, and separable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of its body.</p>
               <p>That therefore this mettall thus received, hath any undeniable effect
upon the body either from experience in others or my selfe, I cannot
satisfactorily affirm. That possibly it may have I not wil at all deny. But
from power unto act, from a possible unto an actuall operation, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is not reasonable. And therefore since the point is dubious,
and not yet authentically decided, it will be discretion not to depend
on disputable remedies; but rather in cases of knowne danger, to have
recourse unto medicines of knowne and approved activity; for beside
the benefit accruing unto the sicke, hereby may be avoyded a grosse
and frequent error, commonly committed in the use of doubtfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50218:53"/>
conjoyntly with those which are of approved vertue. That is,
to impute the cure unto the conceited remedy, or place it on that
whereon they place their opinion, whose operation although it be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or its concurrence not considerable, yet doth it obtaine the name
of the whole cure, and carryeth often the honour of the capitall ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
which had no finger in it.</p>
               <p>4. That a pot full of ashes, will still containe as much water as it
would without them, although by Aristotle in his problems taken for
granted, and so received by most, is surely very false, and not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctible
upon the strictest experiment I could ever make. For when the
ayery intersticies are filled, and as much of the salt of the ashes as the
water will imbibe is dissolved, there remaines a grosse and terreous
portion at the bottome which will possesse a space by it selfe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
whereto there will remaine a quantity of water not receiveable,
and so will it come to passe in a pot of salt, although decrepitated; and
so also in a pot of snow. For so much it will want in reception, as its so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
taketh up, according unto the bulke whereof, there will remaine
a portion of water not to be admitted. So a glasse stuffed with peeces
of spunge, will want about a sixt part of what it would receive without it. So suger will not dissolve beyond the capacity of the water, nor a
mettall in Aqua-fortis bee corroded beyond its reception. And so a
pint of salt of tartar exposed unto a moist aire untill it dissolve, will
make far more liquor, or as some tearm it oyle, then the former mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
will contain.</p>
               <p>Nor is it only the exclusion of ayre by water, or repletion of cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
possessed thereby which causeth a pot of ashes to admit so great a
quantity of water, but also the solution of the salt of the ashes into the
body of the dissolvent; so a pot of ashes will receive somewhat more
of hot water then of cold, for as much as the warme water imbibeth
more of the salt, and a vessell of ashes more then one of pindust or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of Iron, and a glasse full of water, will yet drinke in a proportion
of salt or suger without overflowing.</p>
               <p>5. Of white powder and such as is discharged without report, there is
no small noise in the world: but how far agreeable unto truth, few I
perceive are able to determine. Herein therefore to satisfie the doubts
of some, and amuse the credulity of others, We first declare; that gun-powder
consisteth of three ingredients, that is, Salt-peter, Smal-coale,
and Brimstone. Salt-peter, although it be also naturall and found in
severall places, yet is that of common use an artificiall salt, drawn from
the infusion of salt earth, as that of Stals, Stables, Dovehouses, Cellers,
and other covered places, where the raine can neither dissolve, nor the
sunne approach to resolve it. Brimstone is a Minerall body of fat and
inflamable parts, and this is used crude, and called sulpher vive, and is
of a sadder colour; or after depuration, such as we have in magdeleons
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50218:54"/>
or rolls, of a lighter yellow: Smal-coale is commonly known unto all,
and for this use is made of Sallow, W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which three proportionably mixed, tempered and formed into granu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
bodies, doe make up that powder which is in use for gunnes.</p>
               <p>Now all these although they bear a share in the discharge, yet have
they distinct intentions, and different offices in the composition: from
brimstone proceedeth the continued and durable firing, for Small coal
and peter together will onley spit, nor easily continue the ignition.
From Small-coale ensueth the black colour and quicke accension; for
neither brimstone nor peter, although in powder, will take fire like
Small-coale, nor will they easily kindle upon the sparks of a flint, as
neither will Camphire a body very inflamable, but small-coal is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent
to tinder, and serveth to light the sulphur: from salt-peter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
the force and the report, for sulphur and small-coale mixed
will not take fire with noise, or exilition, and powder which is made of
imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

report, and therefore in the three sorts of powder, the strongest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
most salt-peter, and the proportion thereof is at the least ten
parts of peter, unto one of coale and sulphur.</p>
               <p>But the immediate cause of the report, is the vehement commotion
of the ayre upon the sudden and violent eruption of the powder; for
that being suddenly fired, and almost altogether, being thus ratified it
requireth by many degrees a greater space then before its body oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied;
but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

concussion of the aire, occasioneth the report. Now with what vigour

whereupon requiring a larger place, they force out their way, not only
with the breaking of the cloud, but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

When if the matter be spirituous, and the cloud compact, the noise is
great and terrible: If the cloud be thinne, and the materials weake, the
eruption is languide, and ending in corrus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

although but at the distance of two miles, which is esteemed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest
distance of clouds; and therefore such lightnings doe seldome
any harme. And therefore also it is prodigious to have thunder in a
cleare skye, as is observably recorded in some Histories.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, he that would destroy the report of Powder, must
worke upon the peter, he that would exchange the colour, must thinke
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50218:54"/>
how to alter the small coale. For the one, that is, to make white pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it is surely many wayes feasible: The best I know is by the pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der of rotten willowes, spunck, or touchwood prepared, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
make it russet: and some as Beringuccio in his Pyrotechny affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
have promised to make it red. All which notwithstanding doth
little concerne the report: for that as wee have shewed depends on an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other ingredient; and therefore also under the colour of blacke; this
principle is very variable, for it is made not onely by Willow, Aller,
Hazell, &amp;c. But some above all commend the coales of Flaxe and
Rushes, and some also contend the same may bee effected with
Tinder.</p>
               <p>As for the other, that is, to destroy the Report, it is reasonably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
but two wayes; that is, either by quite leaving out, or else by
silencing the Salt-peter. How to abate the vigour thereof, or silence
its bombulation, a way is promised by Porta, and that not onely in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
termes by some fat bodies, but in particular by Borax and Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mixed in a due proportion; which sayeth he, will so goe off as scarce to
be heard by the discharger; and indeed plentifully mixed, it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
take off the reporr, and also the force of the charge. That it may
be thus made without Salt-peter, I have met with but one example,
that is, of Alphonsus Duke of Ferrara, who in the relation of Brassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volus
and Cardan invented such a Powder, as would discharge a bullet
without report.</p>
               <p>That therefore white Powder there may be, there is therein no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity,
that also such a one as may give no report, wee will not deny a
possibility. But this however, contrived either with or without Salt-peter,
will surely be of little force, and the effects thereof no way to
be feared: For as it omits of report, so will it of effectuall exclusion;
for seeing as we have delivered the strength and report, do necessarily
depend upon the violent exclusion, where there is no report there will
be no violent exclusion, and so the charge of no force which is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
For thus much is reported of that famous powder of Alphonsus,
which was not of force enough to kill a chicken, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of Brassavolus. <hi>Iam<expan>

               <p>It is very true and not to bee denyed, there are wayes to discharge a
bullet, not only with powder that makes no noise, but without any
powder at all, as is done by water and windegunnes; but these afford
no fulminating report, and depend on single principles, and even in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
powder there are pretended other wayes, to alter the noise and
strength of the discharge, and the best, if not onely way consists in the
quality of the Nitre: for as for other wayes which make either addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

That vineger, spirits of wine, or the distilled water of Orange pilles,
wherewith the powder is tempored, are more effectuall unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

like sulphur, as in the preparation of <hi>Sal prunellae,</hi> And lastly, though
many wayes may be found to light this powder, yet is there none I
know to make a strong and vigorous powder of Salt-peter, without
the admixion of sulphur. Arsenick red and yellow, that is, Orpement
and Sandarach may perhaps doe something, as being inflamable and
containing sulphur in them, but containing also a salt, and hydra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And this antipathy or contention between saltpeter and sulphur
upon an actuall fire, and in their compleat &amp; distinct bodies, is also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
in their preparations, and bodies which invisibly containe
them. Thus is the preparation of Crocus Metallorum, the matter kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
and flusheth like Gunpowder, wherein notwithstanding, there is
nothing but Antimony and Saltpeter, but this proceedeth from the
sulphur of Antimony, not enduring the society of saltpeter; for after
three or foure accensions, through a fresh addition of peter, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will flush no more; for the sulphur of the Antimony is quite exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Thus Iron in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> will fall into ebullition, with noise and

from so sudden a petrifaction and strange induration, not easily made

returning brought in each hand a branch of Corall, affirming it was as
hard at the bottome, as in the ayre where he delivered it. The same
was also confirmed by a triall of his owne, handling it a fathome under
water before it felt the ayre. <hi>Beotius de Boote</hi> in his accurate Tract <hi>De

which entring the parts of that plant, overcomes its vegetability, and
converts it into a lapideous substance, and this, saith he, doth happen
when the plant is ready to decay; for all Corall is not hard, and in
many concreted plants some parts remaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

dishes, that according to common beliefe they are made of earth,
which lyeth in preparation about an hundred yeares under ground, for
the relations thereof are not onely divers, but contrary, and Authors
agree not herein. Guido Pancirollus will have them made of Egge
shells, Lobster shells, and Gypsum layed up in the earth the space of

that they are made out of earth, not laid under ground, but hardened

the finest dishes, saith he, are made; out of the residence thereof
the courser; which being formed, they gild or paint, and not after an

he, is knowne by experience, and more probable then what Odoardus
Barbosa hath delivered, that they are made of shels, and buried under
earth of hundred yeares: And answerable unto all points hereto, is the
relation of Linschotten, a very diligent enquirer in his Orientall Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>

               <p>Now what ever encouraged the first invention, there have not bin
wanting many wayes of its promotion. The first a Catacresticall and
farre derived similitude, it holds with man; that is, in a byfurcation or
division of the roote into two parts, which some are content to call
thighes, whereas notwithstanding they are oft times three, and when
but two commonly so complicated and crossed, that men for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
are faine to effect their designe into other plants; And as faire a

others. There are, I confesse, divers plants which carry about them,
not onely the shape of parts, but also of whole animals, but surely not
all thereof, unto whom this conformity is imputed. Whoever shall

               <p>The received distinction and common notation by sexes, hath also
promoted the conceit; for true it is, that Herbalists from ancient times,
have thus distinguished them; naming that the masle, whose leaves are
lighter, and fruit and apples rounder, but this is properly no generative
division, but rather some note of distinction in colour, figure or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

               <p>But the Atlas or maine axis, which supported this opinion, was
daily experience, and the visible testimony of sense; for many there
are in severall parts of Europe who carry about, and sell rootes unto

woman, but these are not productions of Nature, but contrivances of
Art, as divers have noted, and Mathiolus plainly detected, who learned

which ingnorant people, and simple women beleeve; for the

are made of the roots of Canes, Bryony, and other plants, for in

Authors bee admitted, which for this opinion are introduced by
Drusius, as David Camius, Moses <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The second assertion concerneth its production, That it naturally
groweth under gallowses and places of execution, arising from fat or
urine that drops from the body of the dead; a story somewhat agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto the fable of the Serpents teeth sowed in the earth by Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
or rather the birth of Orion from the urine of Jupiter, Mercurie,
and Neptune: Now this opinion seems grounded on the former, that
is a conceived similitude it hath with man; and therefore from him in
some way they would make out its production. Which conceit is not
only erroneous in the foundation, but injurious unto Philosophy in the
superstruction, making putrifactive generations, correspondent unto
seminall productions, and conceiving in equivocall effects and univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
conformity unto the efficient; which is so far from being verified
of animalls in their corruptive mutations into plants, that they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
not this similitude in their nearer translation into animalls. So
when the Oxe corrupteth into Bees, or the Horses into hornets, they
come not forth in the image of their originalls. So the corrupt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementous
humors in man are animated into lyce; and we may observe
that hogs, sheep, goats, hawkes, hens, and divers other, have one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar

to seminall conditions, it carrying a setled and confined habitude
unto their corruptive originalls; and therefore come not forth in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
erraticall, or different from each other, but seem specifically
and in regular shapes to attend the corruption of their bodyes, as doe
more perfect conceptions, the rule of seminall productions.</p>
               <p>The third affirmeth the roots of Mandrakes doe make a noyse or
give a shreeke upon eradication, which is indeed ridiculous, and false
below confute; arising perhaps from a small and stridulous noyse,
which being firmely rooted, it maketh upon divulsion of parts. A slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foundation for such a vast conception: for such a noyse we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time

observe in other plants, in parsenips, liquorish, eri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and others.</p>
               <p>The last concerneth the danger ensuing, that there followes an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of life to them that pull it up, that some evill fate pursues them,
and they live not very long after; therefore the attempt hereof among
the Ancients, was not in ordinary way, but as Pliny informeth, when
they intended to take up the root of this plant, they tooke the wind
thereof, and with a sword describing three circles about it they digged
it up, looking toward the West, a conceit not only injurious unto truth,
and confutable by dayly experience, but somewhat derogatory unto
the providence of God, that is not only to impose so destructive a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
on any plant, but conceive a vegetable whose parts are usefull unto
many, should in the only taking up prove mortall unto any. To think
he suffereth the poyson of Nubia to be gathered, Nap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Thora to be eradicated, yet this not to be moved. That hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
Arsenick and minerall poysons to be forced from the bowells
of the earth, yet not this from the surface thereof. This were to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a second forbidden fruit, and inhance the first malediction; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it not only mortall for Adam to taste the one, but capitall unto his
posterity to eradicate or dig up the other.</p>
               <p>Now what begot, at least promoted so strange conceptions might
be the magicall opinion hereof; this being conceived the plant so much
in use with Circe, and therefore named Circea, as Dioscorides and
Theophrastus have delivered; which being the eminent soceres of
elder story, and by the magicke of simples beleeved to have wrought
many wonders, some men were apt to invent, others to beleeve any
tradition or magicall promise thereof.</p>
               <p>Analogus relations concerning other plants, and such as are of neare
affinity unto this, have made its currant smooth, and passe more easily
among us; for the same effect is also delivered by Josephus, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the root Baaras, by Aelian of Cynospastus, and we read in Homer
the very same opinion concerning Moly.</p>

               <p>Now parallels or like relations alternately releeve each other; when
neither will passe asunder, yet are they plausible together, and by their
mutuall concurrences support their solitary instablilities.</p>
               <p>Signaturists have somewhat advanced it, who seldome omitting
what Ancients delivered, drawing into inference received distinctions
of sex, not willing to examine its humane resemblance, and placing it
in the forme of strange and magicall simples, have made men suspect
there was more therein, then ordinary practice allowed, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

such conceptions.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the conceit promoteth it selfe: for concerning an effect
whose triall must cost so deare, it fortifies it selfe in that invention,
and few there are whose experiment it need to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

is most contemptible) although not only the reason of any head,
but experience of every hand may well convict it, yet will it not by
divers bee rejected, for prepossessed heads will ever doubt it, and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous

               <p>2. That Cinamon, Ginger, Clove, Mace and Nutmeg, are but the

as Lobelius since affirmed, very common in many parts of India, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either from root or seed, which in December and January they
take up, and gently dryed, role it up in earth, whereby occluding the
pores, they conserve the naturall humidity, and so prevent corruption.</p>
               <p>Cinnamon is the inward barke of a Cinnamon tree, whereof the
best is brought from Zeilan; this freed from the outward barke, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto the Sun, contracts into those folds wherein we commonly
receive it. If it have not a sufficient insolation it looketh pale, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
not its laudable colour, if it be sunned too long it suffereth a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction,
and descendeth somewhat below it.</p>
               <p>Clove is the rudiment or beginning of a fruit growing upon the
Clove tree, to be found but in few Countries. The most commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
is that of Isles of Molucca; it is first white, afterward green, which
beaten downe, and dryed in the Sun becommeth blacke, and in the
complexion we receive it.</p>
               <p>Nutmeg is the fruit of a tree differing from all these, and as Garcias
describeth it, somewhat like a Peach, growing in divers places, but
fructifying in the Isle of Banda. The fruit hereof, consisteth of foure
parts; the first or outward part is a thick and carnous covering like that
of a Walnut. The second a dry and flosculous coat, commonly called
Mace. The third a harder tegument or shell, which lyeth under
the Mace. The fourth a kernell included in the shell, which is the
same we call Nutmeg; all which both in their parts and order of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure,
are easily discerned in those fruits, which are brought in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
unto us.</p>
               <p>Now if because Mace and Nutmegs proceed from one tree, the
rest must beare them company, or because they are all from the East-Indies,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50218:59"/>
they are all from one plant, the Inference is precipitous, nor
will there such a plant be found in the Herball of Nature.</p>
               <p>3. That Viscus Arboreus of Misseltoe is bred upon trees, from seeds
which birds, especially Thrushes and Ringdoves let fall thereon, was
the creed of the Ancients, and is still beleeved among us, is the account
of its production, set downe by Pliny, delivered by Virgil, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by many more. If so, some reason must be assigned, why it
groweth onely upon cert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine trees, and not upon many whereon these
birds do light. For as Exotick observers deliver, it groweth upon Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
trees, Chesnut, Apples, Oakes, and Pine trees, as wee observe
in England, very commonly upon Apple, Holly, Bayes, Crabs, and
White thorne, sometimes upon Sallow, Hasell, and Oake, never upon
Bayes, Holly, Ashes, Elmes, and many others. Why it groweth not in
all countries and places where these birds are found, for so Brassavolus
affirmeth, it is not to be found in the territorie of Ferrara, and was
faine to supply himselfe from other parts of Italy. Why if it ariseth
from a seed, if sowne it will not grow againe, as Pliny affirmeth, and as
by setting the berryes thereof, wee have in vaine attempted its produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
why if it commeth from seed that falleth upon the tree, it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
often downewards and puts forth under the bough, where seed
can neither fall, nor yet remaine. Hereof beside some others, the Lord
Verulam hath taken notice. And they surely speake probably who
make it an arboreous excrescence, or rather superplant, bred of a vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
and superfluous sappe the tree it selfe cannot assimilate, and
therefore sprouteth not forth in boughs and surcles of the same
shape and similary unto the tree that beareth it, but in a different
forme, and secondary unto its specificall intention, wherein once fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
another forme succeedeth, and in the first place that of Misseltoe,
in plants and trees disposed to its production. And therefore also
where ever it groweth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is of constant shape, and maintaines a vegular
figure like other supercrescenses, and such as living upon the stock of
others, are termed Parasiticall plants, as Polypody, Mosse, the smaller
Capillaries, and many more.</p>
               <p>Now what begot this conceit, might be the enlargement of that
part of truth conteined in its story. For certaine it is, that some birdes
doe feed upon the berries of this vegetable, and we meet in Aristotle
with one kind of thrush called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the missell thrush or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeder
upon misseltoe. But that which hath most promoted it, is a received
proverb. <hi>Turdus sibi malum cac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Appliable unto such men as are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of their owne misfortune: For according unto ancient tradition
and Plinies relation, the bird not able to digest the fruit whereon shee
feedeth, from her inconverted muting, ariseth this plant, of the berries
whereof birdlime is made, wherewith she is after entangled. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
proverbs bee popular principles, yet is not all true that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbiall;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50218:59"/>
and in many thereof there being one thing delivered, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intended, though the verball expression be false, the proverbe is
true enough in the veritie of its intention.</p>
               <p>As for the Magicall vertues in this plant, and conceived efficacie
unto veneficiall intentions, it seemeth unto me a Pagan relique derived
from the ancient D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uides, the great admirers of the Oake, especially
the Misseltoe that grew thereon; which according unto the particular
of Plinie, they gathered with great solemnitie. For after sacrifice the
priest in a white garment, ascended the tree, cut downe the Misseltoe
with a golden hooke, and received it in a white coat, the vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was to resist all poysons, and make fruitfull any that used it. Vertues
not expected from Classicall practise; And did they answer their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
which are so commended, in Epilepticall intentions, wee would
abate these qualities. Countrey practise hath added another, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the after-birth, and in that case the decoction is given unto
Cowes. That the berries are poison as some conceive, we are so far
from averring, that we have safely given them inwardly, and can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the experiment of Brassavolus, that they have some purgative
quality.</p>
               <p>4. The Rose of Jerico, that flourishes every yeer just upon Christmas
Eve is famous in Christian reports, which notwithstanding wee have
some reason to doubt; and we are plainely informed by Bellonius, it is
but a Monasticall imposture, as hee hath delivered in his observations,
concerning the plants in Jericho. That which promoted the conceit,
or perhaps begot its continuance, was a proprietie in this plant. For
though it bee dry, yet will it upon imbibition of moisture dilate its
leaves, and explicate its flowers contracted, and seemingly dryed up.
And this is to bee effected not onely in the plant yet growing, but
in some manner also in that which is brought exuccous and dry unto
us. Which quality being observed, the subtilty or contrivers did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
play this shew upon the Eve of our Saviours Nativitie, and by
drying the plant againe, it closed the next day, and so pretended a
double mystery. That is the opening and closing of the wombe of
Mary.</p>

Rosae in Iericho:</hi> I was exalted like a Palme tree in Engaddi, and as a
Rose in Jericho. The sound whereof in common eares, begat an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
opinion of the Rose of that denomination. But herein
there seemeth a great mistake; for by the Rose in the text, is implyed
the true and proper Rose <gap reason="foreign">

rendreth it. But that which passeth under this name, and by us
is commonly called the Rose of Jericho, is properly no Rose, but a
small thorny shrub or kinde of heath, bearing little white flowers, far
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50218:60"/>
differing from the Rose, whereof Bellonius a very inquisitive Herba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list
could not finde any in his travells thorow Jericho. A plant so
unlike a Rose, it hath been mistaken by some good Simplist for Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,
which truely understood is so unlike a Rose, that as D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

delivers, the flowers thereof, are like the white violet, and its leaves
resemble Bryonie; sutable unto this relation almost in all points is that
of the thorne at Glassenbury, and perhaps the daughter thereof; herein
our endeavours as yet have not attained satisfaction, and cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
enlarge. Thus much in generall we may observe, that strange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
are naturally taken for miracles by weaker heads, and artificially
improved to that apprehension by wiser.</p>
               <p>5. That <hi>ferrum Equinum,</hi> or <hi>Sferra Cavallo</hi> hath a vertue attractive of
Iron, a power to breake lockes, and draw off the shooes of a horse that
passeth over it. Whether you take it for one kinde of Secu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at Mathiolus, who upon a parallell in Plinie was staggered into
suspension; who notwithstanding in the imputed vertue to open things,
close and shut up, could laugh himselfe at that promise from Aethiopis,
and condemne the judgement of Scipio, who having such a picklock,
would spend so many years in battering the gates of Carthage. Which
strange and Magicall conceit, seemes unto me to have no deeper root in
reason, then the figure of its seed; for therein indeed it somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles
an horseshooe, which notwithstanding <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> hath
thought too low a signation, and raised the same unto a Lunarie repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation.</p>
               <p>6. That Bayes will protect from the mischief of lightning and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
is a qualitie ascribed thereto, common with the figtree, Aegle, and
skin of a Seale. Against so famous a quality, Vicomer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atus produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
experiment of a Bay tree blasted in Italy, and therefore although
Tiberius for this intent, did weare a Laurell about his temples. Yet did
Augustus take a more probable course, who fled under arches and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
vautes for protection. And though Porta conceive, becasue in
a streperous eruption, it riseth against fire, it doth therefore resist
lightning, yet is that no emboldning Illation: And if wee consider the
threefold effect of Jupiters Trisulke, to burne, discusse and terebrate;
and if that be true which is commonly delivered, that it will melt the
blade, yet passe the scabbard, kill the childe, yet spare the mother, dry
up the wine, yet leave the hogshead intire; though it favour the amulet
it may not spare us; it will be unsure to rely on any preservative, tis no
security to be dipped in Styx, or clad in the armour of Ceneus. Now
that beer, wine, and other liquors, are spoyled with lightning and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
we conceive it proceeds not onely from noyse and concussion of
the ayre, but also noxious spirits, which mingle therewith, and draw
them to corruption, whereby they become not onely dead themselves,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50218:60"/>
but sometime deadly unto others, as that which Seneca mentioneth,
whereof whosoever dranke, either lost his life, or else his wits upon it.</p>
               <p>7. It hath much deceived the hopes of good fellowes, what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
expected of bitter Almonds, and though in Plutarch confirmed
from the practise of Claudius his Physitian, that Antidote against
ebriety hath commonly failed. Surely men much verst in the practice
doe erre in the theory of inebriation, conceaving in that disturbance
the braine doth onely suffer from exhalations and vaporous ascentions
from the stomack, which fat and oylie substances may suppresse,
whereas the prevalent intoxication is from the spirits of drink dispersed
into the veynes and arteries, from whence by common conveyances
they creep into the braine, insinuate into its ventricles, and beget those
vertigoes, accompanying that perversion. And therefore the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
may be produced by a Glister, the head may be intoxicated by a
medicine at the heele. And so the poysonous bytes of Serpents, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
on parts at distance from the head, yet having entered the
veynes, disturbe the animall faculties, and produce the effects of drink,
or poyson swallowed. And so as the head may bee disturbed by the
skin, it may the same way be relieved, as is observable in balneations,
washings, and fomentations, either of the whole body, or of that part
alone.</p>
               <p>8. That every plant might receive a name according unto the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
it cureth, was the wish of Paracelsus; a way more likely to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
Empericks then Herbalists, yet what is practised by many is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
unto neither; that is, relinquishing their proper appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to re-baptise them by the name of Saints, Apostles, Patriarcks and
Martyres, to call this the herbe of John, that of Peter, this of James or
Joseph, that of Mary or Barbara, for hereby apprehensions are made
additionall unto their proper natures; whereon superstitious practises
ensue, and stories are framed accordingly to make good their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
               <p>9. We cannot omit to declare the grosse mistake of many in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall
apprehension of plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s; to instance but in few. An herbe there
is commonly called Betonica Pauli, or Pauls Betony, hereof the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have some conceit in reference to S. Paul, whereas indeed that
name is derived from Paulus Aegineta, an ancient Physitian of Aegina,
and is no more then speed well, or Fluellen. The like expectations
are raised from <hi>Herba Trinitatis,</hi> which notwithstanding obtaineth that
name onely from the figure of its leaves, and is one kinde of liverworte
of Hepatica. In <hi>Milium Solis,</hi> the epithite of the Sun hath enlarged its
opinion, which hath indeed no reference thereunto, it being no more
then Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hospermon, or grummell, or rather <hi>milium Soler,</hi> which as
Serapion from Aben Juliel hath taught us, because it grew plentifully
in the mountaines of Solar, received that appellation. In Jews eares
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50218:61"/>
some thing is conceived extraordinary from the name, which is in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
but <hi>Fungus sambucinus,</hi> or an excrescence about the roots of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and concerneth not the Nation of the Jews, but Judas Iscariot,
upon a conceit, he hanged on this tree, and is become a famous medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
in Quinses, sore throats, and strangulations ever since. And so are
they deceived in the name of Horse-raddish, Horse-mint, Bull-rush<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
many more: conceiving therein some prenominall consideration,
whereas indeed that expression is but a Grecisme, by the prefix of Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos
and Bous, that is, Horse and Bull, intending no more then great.
According whereto the great dock is called Hippolapathum; and hee
that calls the horse of Alexander great head, expresseth the same which
the Greeks do in Bucephalus.</p>
               <p>10. Lastly, many things are delivered and believed of other plants,
wherin at least we cannot but suspend. That there is a property in Basil
to propagate Scorpions, and that by the smell thereof they are bred in
the braines of men, is much advanced by Hollerius, who found this
insect in the braines of a man that delighted much in this smel. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
beside that wee finde no way to conjoyne the effect unto the cause
assigned; herein the Modernes speake but timerously, and some of the
Ancients quite contrarily. For, according unto Oribasius, Physition
unto Julian, The Affricans, men best experienced in poysons, affirme
whosoever hath eaten Basil, although hee be stung with a Scorpion,
shall feele no paine thereby: which is a very different effect, and rather
antidotally destroying then seminally promoting its production.</p>
               <p>That the leaves of Cataputia or spurge being plucked upward or
downeward respectively performe their operations by purge or vomit,
as some have written, and old wives still do preach, is a strange conceit,
and indeed somewhat magneticall, aseribing unto plants positionall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
and after the manner of the Loadstone, upon the pole where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
if a knife be drawne from the handle unto the poynt, it will take up
a neele, but if drawne againe from the point to the handle, it will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
it no more.</p>
               <p>That an Ivy cup will separate wine from water, if filled with both,
the wine soaking through, but the water still remaining, as after Pliny
many have averred wee know not how to affirme, who making tryall
thereof, found both the liquors to soake indistinctly through the
bowle.</p>
               <p>That Ros solis which rotteth sheepe hath any such cordiall vertue
upon us, we have some reason to doubt.</p>
               <p>That Flos Affricanus is poyson, and destroyeth dogs, in two expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
we have not found.</p>
               <p>That Yew and the berries thereof are harmelesse we know.</p>
               <p>That a Snake will not endure the shade of an Ashe we can deny.</p>
               <p>That Cats have such delight in the herbe Nepeta, called therefore
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50218:61"/>
Cattaria, our experience cannot discover. Nor is it altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
what is affirmed by Bellonius; for if his assertion bee true in
the first of his observations, our apprehension is oftentimes wide in
ordinary simples, and in common use wee mistake one for another.
We know not the true thime, the savory in our Gardens is not that
commended of old, and that kinde of hysop the Ancients used, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
unto us who make great use of another.</p>
               <p>Wee omit to recite the many vertues, and endlesse faculties ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
unto plants, which sometime occure in grave and serious Authors,
and wee shall make a bad composition for truth to concede a verity
in halfe. To reckon up all, it were imployment for Archimedes,
who undertooke to write the number of the sands. Swarmes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
there are, some whereof our future endeavours may discover;
common reason I hope will save us a labour in many, whose absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
stand naked unto every eye, errours not able to deceive the
Emblem of Justice, and need no Argoes to descry them. Herein
there surely wants expurgatory animadversions, whereby wee might

generally passeth an opinion it hath no joynts;
and this absurdity is seconded with another, that
being unable to lye downe, it sleepeth against a
tree, which the Hunters observing doe saw al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
asunder; whereon the beast relying, by the
fall of the tree falls also down it selfe, and is able
to rise no more; which conceit is not the
daughter of latter times, but an old and gray-headed errour, even in the
dayes of Aristotle, as he delivereth in his booke, <hi>de incessu animalium,</hi>
and stands successively related by severall other Authors, by Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
Siculus, Strabo, Ambrose, Cassiodore, Solinus, and many more:
Now herein me thinks men much forget themselves, not well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the absurditie of such assertions.</p>
               <p>For first, they affirme it hath no joynts, and yet concede it walks
and moves about; whereby they conceive there may be a progression
or advancement made in motion without the inflexion of parts: Now
all progression or animall locomotion being (as Aristotle teacheth) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<hi>tractu &amp; pulsu;</hi> that is by drawing on, or impelling forward
some part which was before in station, or at quiet; where there are
no joynts or flexures neither can there be these actions; and this is true,
not only in Quadrupedes, Volatills and Fishes, which have distinct and
prominent organs of motion, legs, wings, and fins; but in such also as
performe their progression by the truncke, as serpents, wormes and
leeches; whereof though some want bones, and all extended articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet have they arthriticall analogies, and by the motion of fibrous
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50218:62"/>
and musculous parts, are able to make progression; which to conceive
in bodies inflexible, and without all protrusion of parts, were to expect
a race from Hercules his pillars, or hope to behold the effects of
Orpheus his ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

musicke.</p>
               <p>Againe, while men conceive they never lye downe, and enjoy not
the position of rest, ordained unto all pedestrious animalls whatsoever,
hereby they imagine (what reason cannot conceive) that an animall of
the vastest dimension and longest duration should live in a continuall
motion, without that alternity and vicissitude of rest whereby all
others continue; and yet must thus much come to passe, if wee opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
they lye not downe and enjoy no decumbence at all; for station is
properly no rest, but one kinde of motion, relating unto that which
Physitians (from Galen) doe name extensive or tonicall, that is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
of the muscles and organs of motion maintaining the body at
length or in its proper figure, wherein although it seem to be immoved
is neverthelesse without all motion, for in this position the muscles are
sensibly ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ended, and labour to support the body, which permitted
unto its proper gravity would suddenly subside and fall unto the earth,
as it happeneth in sleep, diseases and death; from which occult action
and invisible motion of the muscles in station (as Galen declareth)
proceed more offensive lassitudes then from ambulation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Tyranny of some have tormented men, with long and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
station, and though Ixion and Sisiphus which alwaies moved, doe
seem to have the hardest measure, yet was not Titius favoured, that lay
extended upon Caucasus, and Tantalus suffered somewhat more then
thirst, that stood perpetually in hell; and thus Mercurialis in his Gym
nasticks justly makes standing one kinde of exercise, and Galen when
we lye downe, commends unto us middle figures; that is, not to lye
directly, or at length, but somewhat inflected, that the muscles may
be at rest; for such as he termeth Hypobolemaioi or figures of excesse,
either shrinking up or stretching out, are wearisome positions, and
such as perturbe the quiet of those parts.</p>
               <p>Moreover men herein doe strangely forget the obvious relations of
history, affirming they have no joynts, whereas they dayly read of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
actions which are not performable without them. They for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
what is delivered by Xiphilinus, and also by Suetonius in the lives of
Nero and Galba, that Elephants have been instructed to walke on
ropes, and that in publicke shews before the people; which is not easily
performed by man, and requireth not only a broad foot, but a plyable
flexure of joynts, and commandible disposure of all parts of progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
they passe by that memorable place in Curtius, concerning the

not to minde that memorable shew of Germanicus, wherein twelve
Elephants danced unto the sound of musick, and after laid them down
in the Tricliniums, or places of festivall Recumbency.</p>
               <p>Lastly, they forget or consult not experience, whereof not many
yeares past, we have had the advantage in England, by an Elephant
shewne in many parts thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only in the posture of standing, but
kneeling and lying downe; whereby although the opinion at present
be reasonable well suppressed, yet from the strings of tradition and
fruitfull recurrence of error, it is not improbable, it may revive in the
next generation againe; for this was not the first that hath been seen in
England, for (besides some others since) as Polydore Virgil relateth,
Lewis the French King sent one to Henry the third; and Emanuel of
Portugall another unto Leo the tenth into Italy, where notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the errour is still alive and epidemicall, as with us.</p>
               <p>The hint and ground of this opinion might be the grosse and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
Cylindricall composure of the legs, the equality and lesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
disposure of the joynts, especially in the fore legs of this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall,
they appearing when he standeth like pillars of flesh, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
evidence of articulation: the different flexure and order of the joynts
might also countenance the same, being not disposed in the Elephant,
as they are in other quadrupedes, but carry a nearer conformity into
those of man, that is the bought of the fore legs not directly backward,
but laterally and somewhat inward, but the hough or suffraginous
flexure behinde rather outward, contrary unto many other Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and such as can scratch the care with the hinder foot, as Horses,
Camells, Deere, Sheep and Dogs, for their fore legs bend like our
legs, and their hinder legs like our armes, when we move them to our
shoulders; but quadrupedes oviparous, as Frogs, Lizards, Crocodiles,
have their joynts and motive flexures more analogously framed unto
ours; and some among viviparous, that is such thereof as can bring their
forefeet and meat therein into their mouths, as most can doe that have
the clanicles or coller-bones, whereby their breasts are broader, and
their shoulders more asunder, as the Ape, the Monkey, the Squirrell,
and some others: If therefore any shall affirme the joynts of Elephants

we shall find it to be otherwise then as is commonly presumed,
by sawing away of trees; the accounts whereof are to be seen at large
in <hi>Iohannes Hugo, Edwardus Lopez, Garcias ab Horto, Cadamustus,</hi> and
many more: other concernments there are of the Elephant, which
might admit of discourse, and if we should question the teeth of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,

be called hornes, it were no new enquiry of mine, but a paradox
as old as Oppianus: whether as Pliny and divers since affirme, that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
are terrified, and make away upon the grunting of Swine, <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias
ab Horto</hi> may decide, who affirmeth upon experience they enter
their stalles, and live promiscuously in the woods of Malavar; That
the situation of the genitalls is averse, and their copulation like that of
Camells, as Pliny hath also delivered, is neither to be received, for we
have beheld that part in a different position, and their coition is made
by supersaliency like that of horses, as we are informed by some who
have beheld them in that act. That some Elephants have not only writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
whose sentences, as Aelian ocularly testifieth, but have also spoken,
as Oppianus delivereth, and Christophorus a Costa particularly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
although it sound like that of Achilles horse in Homer, wee doe
not conceive impossible; nor beside the affinity of reason in this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
any such intolerable incapacity in the organs of divers other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedes,
whereby they might not be taught to speake, or become
imitators of speech like birds; and indeed strange it is how the curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of men that have been active in the instruction of beasts, have never
fallen upon this artifice, and among those many paradoxicall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of imitations, should not attempt to make one speak; the Serpent
that spake unto Eve, the Dogs &amp; Cats, that usually speak unto Witches,
might afford some encouragement, and since broad and thick chops
are required in birds that speake, since lips and teeth are also organs of
speech; from these there is also an advantage in quadrupedes, and a
proximity of reason in Elephants and Apes above them all.</p>

should want a proper conveyance for choler, or have no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
for that humor, then the veynes, and generall masse of bloud.</p>
               <p>It is againe controulable by experience; for we have made some
search and enquiry herein, encouraged by Absyrtus a Greek Author,
in the time of Constantine, who in his Hippiaticks, obscurely assigneth
the gall a place in the liver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but more especially by Ruino the Bononi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
who in his <hi>Anatomia del Cavallo,</hi> hath more plainly described it,
and in a manner as I found it; for in the dissections of Horses, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
enquiry into that part, in the concave or simous part of the liver,
whereabout the gall is usually seated in quadrupeds, I discover an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
long and membranous substance of a yellow colour without, and
lined with choler and gall within; which part is by branches diffused
into the lobes and severall parcells of the liver, from whence receiving
the firie superfluity, or cholericke remainder, upon the second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
by a manifest and open passage, it conveyeth it into the duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
or upper gut, thence into the lower bowells, which is the manner
of its derivation in man and other animalls; and therefore although
there be no eminent and circular follicle, no round bagge or vesicle
which long containeth this humor, yet is there a manifest receptacle
and passage of choler, from the liver into the guts; which being not so
shut up, or at least not so long detained, as it is in other animalls, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
that frequent excretion, and occasions the horse to dung more
often then many other; for choler is the naturall glister, or one excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereby nature excludeth another, which descending daily into
the bowells, extimulates those parts, and excites them unto expulsion;
and so when this humor aboundeth or corrupteth, there succeeds oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a <hi>cholerica passio,</hi> that is a sudden and vehement purgation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and downward; and so when the passage of gall becomes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
the body grows costive, and the excrements of the belly
white, as it happeneth oft-times in the Jaundice.</p>
               <p>If any therefore affirme an horse hath no gall, that is, no receptacle,
or part ordained for the separation of choller, or not that humour at all,
he hath both sence and reason to oppose him; but if he saith it hath no
bladder of gall, and such as is observed in many other animals, we shall
oppose our sense if we gainesay him; and thus must Aristotle be made
out when he denyeth this part, and by this distinction wee may relieve
Pliny of a contradiction; who in one place affirming an horse hath no
gall, delivereth yet in another, that the gall of an horse was accounted
poyson, and therefore at the sacrifices of horses in Rome, it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
for the Flamen but to touch it; but with more difficulty, or
hardly at all is that reconcilable which is delivered by our Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50218:64"/>
and received veterinarian, whose words in his master-piece, and
Chapter of diseases from the gall, are somewhat too strict, and scarce
admit a Reconciliation. The fallacy therefore of this conceit is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the former, <hi>A dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter,</hi> because
they have not a bladder of gall, like those we usually observe in others,
they have no gall at all; which is a Paralogisme not admittible, a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
that dwels not in a cloud, and needs not the Sun to scatter it.</p>

               <p>THe third Assertion is somewhat like the second, That a Dove or

for as Pierius observeth, from this consideration the Aegyptians did
make it the Hieroglyphick of meekenesse; it hath beene averred by
many holy Writers, commonly delivered by Postillers and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators,
who from the frequent mention of the Dove in the Canticles,
the precept of our Saviour to bee wise as Serpents, and innocent as
Doves, and especially the appearance of the holy Ghost in the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude

of the Dove, and what doth most commend it, is that it hath no
Gall; and hereof have made use not onely inferiour and minor Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
but Cyprian, Austin, Isidore, Beda, Rupertus, Jansenius, and
many more.</p>
               <p>Whereto notwithstanding we know not how to assent, it being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
unto the Authority and positive determination of ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy;
the affirmative of Aristotle in his history of Animals is very

to the guts, as the Crow, the Swallow, Sparrow, and the Dove,
the same is also attested by Pliny, and not without some passion by
Galen, who in his booke <hi>de Atra bile,</hi> accounts him ridiculous that
denyes it.</p>
               <p>It is not agreeable to the constitution of this Animall, nor can we so
reasonably conceive there wants a gall; that is, the hot and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iery hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in a body so hot of temper, which phlegme or melancholy could
not effect: Now of what complexion it is, Julius Alexandrinus decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
when he affirmeth, that some upon the use thereof, have fallen
into Feavers and Quinsies; the temper also of their dung and intestinall
excretions do also confirme the same, which Topically applyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Phaenigmus or Rubifying medicine, and are of such fiery parts,
that as we reade in Galen, they have of themselves conceived fire, and
burnt a house about them, and therefore when in the famine of Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
(wherein the fourth part of a cab of Pigeons dung was sold for five
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50218:65"/>
pieces of silver) it is delivered by Josephus, that men made use here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
instead of common slat, although the exposition seeme strange, it is
more probable then many other, for that it containeth very much salt;
beside the effects before expressed, it is discernable by taste, and the
earth of Columbaries or Dovehouses, so much desired in the artifice
of Salt-peter; and to speake generally, the excrements of birds which
want both bladder and kidneys, hath more of salt and acrimony, then
that of other animals, who beside the guts have also those conveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for whereas in these, the salt and lixiviated serosity with some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of choler, is divided betweene the guts and bladder, it remaines
und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vided in birds, and hath but a single descent, by the guts, with
the exclusions of the belly. Now if because the Dove is of a milde and
gentle nature, wee cannot conceive it should be of an hot temper, our
apprehensions are not distinct in the measure of constitutions, and the
several parts which evidence such conditions: for the Irascible passions
doe follow the temper of the heart, but the concupiscible distractions
the crasis of the liver; now many have not livers, which have but coole
and temperate hearts, and this was probably the temper of Paris, a
contrary constitution to that of Aiax, and in both but short of Medea,
who seemed to exceed in either.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it is repugnant to experience, for Anatomicall enquirie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth
in them a gall, and that according to the determination of
Aristotle, not annexed unto the Liver, but adhering unto the guts; nor
is the humour contained in smaller veines, or obscure capillations, but
in a vesicle or little bladder, though some affirme it hath no cystis or
bag at all, and therefore the Hieroglyphick of the Aegyptians, though
allowable in the sence, is weake in the foundation, who expressing
meeknesse and lenity by the portract of a Dove with the taile erected,
affirmed it had no gall in the inward parts, but onely in the rumpe, and
as it were out of the body, and therefore if they conceived their gods
were pleased with the sacrifice of this Animall, as being without gall,
the ancient Heathen were surely mistaken in the reason, and in the very
oblation, whereas in the holocaust or burnt offerings of Moses the gall
was cast away; for as Ben Maimon instructeth, the inwards whereto
the gall adhereth were taken out with the crop, according unto the
Law, Levit. 1. which the Priest did not burne, but cast unto the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st,
that is, behinde his back, and readiest place to be carried out of the
Sanctuary. And if they also conceived that for this reason, they were
the birds of Venus, and wanting the furious and discording part, were
more acceptable unto the Deity of Love; they surely added unto the
conceit, which was at first venereall, and in this animall may be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
made out from that conception.</p>
               <p>The ground of this conceit is partly like the former, that is, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
situation of the gall, and out of the Liver, wherein it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50218:65"/>
enquired, but this is a very injust illation, not well considering with
what variety this part is seated in birds; in some both at the stomack
and the liver, as in the Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iceps, in some at the liver only, as in Cocks,
Turkeys, and Phasiants, in others at the guts and Liver, as in Hawkes
and Kites; in some at the guts alone, as Crowes, Doves, and many
more, and these perhaps may take up all the wayes of situation, not
onely in birds, but also other animals, for what is said of the Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that answerable unto its name, it carrieth the gall
in the head, is further to be enquired; and though the discoloured par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
in the skin of an Heron, be commonly termed Galls, yet is not
this animall deficient in that part; and thus when it is conceived that
the eyes of Tobias were cured by the gall of the fish Callyonimus or
<hi>Scorpius marinus,</hi> commended to that effect by Dioscorides, although
that part were not in the liver, were there reason to doubt that proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and whatsoever animall it was, it may be received without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
when tis delivered, the married couple as a testimony of future
concord, did cast the gall of the sacrifice behinde the Altar?</p>
               <p>A strict and literall acception of a loose and tropicall expression
was a second ground hereof; for while some affirmed it had no gall,
intending onely thereby no evidence of anger or fury, others have
construed it anatomically, and denied that part at all; by which illati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we may inferre, and that from sacred Text, a Pigeon hath no heart,
according to that expression, Hosea 7. <hi>Factus est Ephraim sicut Colum
ba seducta non habens cor;</hi> and so from the letter of Scripture wee may
conclude it is no milde, but a fiery and furious animall, according to
that of Jeremy, chap. 25. <hi>Facta est terra in desolationem à facie irae Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbae:</hi>
and againe, chap. 46. <hi>Revertamur ad terram nativitatis nostrae
à facie gladii columbae,</hi> where notwithstanding the Dove is not literally
intended, but thereby are implyed the Babylonians whose Queene Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis
was called by that name, and whose successors did beare the
Dove in their standard: so is it proverbially said, <hi>Formicae sua bilis inest,
habet &amp; musca splenem,</hi> whereas wee all know Philosophy denyeth
these parts, nor hath Anatomy discovered them in insects.</p>
               <p>If therefore any shall affirme a Pigeon hath no gall, implying no
more thereby then the lenity of this animall, wee shall not controvert
his affirmation; and thus may wee make out the assertions of ancient
Writers, and safely receive the expressions of those great Divines and
worthy Fathers; but if by a transition from Rhetorick to Logick, hee
shall contend, it hath no such part, or humour, he committeth an open
fallacy, and such as was probably first committed concerning Spanish
Mares, whose swiftnesse tropically expressed from their generation by
the wind, might after be grosly taken, and a reall truth conceived in
that conception.</p>

Writers, for though some have made use hereof in a Morall or
Tropicall way, yet have the professed discoursers by silence deserted,
or by experience rejected this assertion. Thus was it in ancient times
discovered, and experimentally refuted by one Sestius a Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The originall of the conceit was probably Hieroglyphicall, which
after became Mythologicall unto the Greeks, &amp; so set down by Aesop,

by place or situation; they having one office in all, but different seats in
many; for beside that no serpent or fishes oviparous, have any stones
at all; that neither biped nor quadruped oviparous have any exteriorly,
or prominent in the groyne, some also that are viviparous contain these
parts within, as beside this animall the Elephant, and the Hedge-hog.</p>

assented unto by most who have the opportunity to behold and hunt
them dayly; which notwithstanding upon enquiry I finde repugnant
unto the three determinators of truth, Authority, Sense and Reason:
For first, Albertus <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gnus</hi> speaks dubiously, confessing he could not

                  </gap>ity hereof, but Aldrovand affirmeth plainly, there can
be no such inequality observed; and for my own part, upon indifferent
enquiry, I cannot discover this difference, although the regardible side
be defined, and the brevity by most imputed unto the left.</p>
               <p>Againe, it seems no easie affront unto reason, and generally repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
unto the course of nature; for if we survey the totall set of animals,
we may in their legs, or organs of progression, obse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve an equality of
length, and parity of numeration; that is, not any to have an odde leg,
or the supporters and movers of one side not exactly answered by the
other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although the hinder may be unequall unto the fore and middle
legs, as in Frogs, Locusts and Grafhoppers, or both unto the middle,
as in some beetles, and spiders, as is determined by Aristotle <hi>de incessu
animalium;</hi> perfect and viviparous quadrupeds, so standing in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of pronenesse, that the opposite joynts of neighbour legs consist

right angles the axis of the earth: It happeneth often I confesse that a
Lobster hath the chely or great claw of one side longer then the other,
but this is not properly their leg, but a part of apprehension, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they hold or seize upon their prey; for in them the legs and proper
parts of progression are inverted backward, and stand in a position op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unto these.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the monstrosity is ill contrived, and with some disadvantage,
the shortnesse being affixed unto the legs of one side, which might have
been more tolerably placed upon the thwart or Diagoniall movers; for
the progression of quadrupeds being performed <hi>per Diametrum,</hi> that is
the crosse legs moving or resting together, so that two are alwayes in
motion, and two in station at the same time, the brevity had been more
tolerable in the crosse legs; for then the motion and station had beene
performed by equall legs, whereas herein they are both performed by
unequall organs, and the imperfection becomes discoverable at every
hand.</p>

               <p>THat a Bear brings forth her young informous and unshapen, which

vulgar, and common with us at present, but hath been of old delivered
by ancient Writers upon this foundation, it was a Hieroglyphicke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the Aegyptians; Aristotle seems to countenance it, Solinus, Plinie
and Aelian directly affirme it, and Ovid smoothly delivereth it—

                  </q>
Which opinion notwithstanding is not only repugnant unto the sense
of every one that shall with diligence enquire into it, but the exact and
deliberate experiment of three authenticke Philosophers; the first of
Mathiolus in his Comment on Dioscorides, whose words are to this
effect. In the valley of Anania about Trent, in a Beare which the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
eventerated, I beheld the young ones with all their parts distinct,
and not without shape, as many conceive, giving more credit unto
Aristotle and Plinie, then experience and their proper senses. Of the
same assurance was Julius Scaliger in his Exercitations, <hi>Vrsam faetus

from the testimony of his owne eyes affirmeth, that in the cabinet of
the Senate of Bononia, there was preserved in a glasse a Cub dissected
out of a Beare perfectly formed, and compleat in every part.</p>
               <p>It is moreover injurious unto reason, and much impugneth the course
and providence of nature, to conceive a birth should be ordained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is a formation; for the conformation of parts is necessarily
required not only unto the prerequisites and previous conditions of
birth, as motion and animation, but also unto the parturition or very
birth it selfe; wherein not only the Dam, but the younglings play their
parts, and the cause and act of exclusion proceedeth from them both:
for the exclusion of animals is not meerly passive like that of egges, nor
the totall action of delivery to be imputed unto the mother; but the
first attempt beginneth from the Infant, which at the accomplished pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
attempteth to change his mansion, and strugling to come forth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacerates
and breaks those parts which restrained him before.</p>
               <p>Beside (what few take notice of) men hereby doe in a high measure
vilifie the workes of God, imputing that unto the tongue of a beast,
which is the strangest artifice in all the acts of nature, that is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50218:68"/>
of the Infant in the womb, not only in mankind, but all vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
animals whatsoever, wherin the plastick or formative faculty, from
matter appearing homogeneous, and of a similary substance erecteth
bones, membranes, veynes and ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eries, and out of these contriveth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part in number, place and figure, according to the law of its species,
which is so far from being fashioned by any outward agent, that once
omitted or perverted by a slip of the inward Phidias, it is not reducible
by any other whatsoever; and therefore, <hi>mirè me plasmaverunt manus
tuae,</hi> though it originally respected the generation of man, yet is it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable
unto that of other animalls, who entring the wombe in indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
and simple materialls, returne with distinction of parts, and the
perfect breath of life; he that shall consider these alterations without,
must needs conceive there have been strange operations within, which
to behold it were a spectacle almost worth ones being, a sight beyond
all, except that man had been created first, and might have seen the
shew of five dayes after.</p>
               <p>Now as the opinion is repugnant both unto sense and reason, so hath
it probably been occasioned from some slight ground in either; thus in
regard the cub comes forth involved in the Chorion, a thick and tough
membrane obscuring the formation, and which the Dam doth after
bite, and tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e asunder, the beholder at first sight conceives it a rude
and informous lumpe of flesh, and imputes the ensuing shape unto the
mouthing of the Dam; which addeth nothing thereunto, but onely
drawes the curtaine, and takes away that vaile which conceded the
piece before; and thus have some endeavoured to enforce the same
from reason; that is, the small and slender time of the Beares gestation,
or going with her young, which lasting but few dayes (a month some
say) the exclusion becomes precipitous, and the young ones conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
informous; according to that of Solinus, <hi>Trigesimus dies ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
liberat ursae, unde evenit ut praecipitata faecundita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> informes creet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi>
but this will overthrow the generall method of nature, in the
works of generation; for therein the conformation is not only antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
but proportionall unto the exclusion, and if the period of the birth
be short, the terme of conformation will be as sudden also, there may I
confesse from this narrow time of gestation ensue a minority or smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the exclusion, but this however inferreth no informity, and it
still receiveth the name of a naturall and legitimate birth; whereas if
we affirme a totall informity, it cannot admit so forward a terme as
an Abortment; for that supposeth conformation, and so wee must call
this constant and intended act of nature, a slip, an <gap reason="foreign">

of the Ancients, whereof such wonders are delivered. For this of ours
is generally described with legs, wings, a serpentine and winding taile,
and a crist or combe somewhat like a Cock; but the Basilisk of elder
times was a proper kinde of Serpent, not above three palmes long, as
some account, and differenced from other Serpents by advancing his
head, and some white markes or coronary spots upon the crowne, as
all authentick Writers have delivered.</p>
               <p>Nor is this Cockatrice onely unlike the Basiliske, but of no reall
shape in nature, and rather an Hieroglyphicall fancy, to expresse their
different intentions, set forth in different fashions; sometimes with the
head of a man, sometimes with the head of an Hawke, as Pierius hath
delivered, and as with addition of legs the Heralds and Painters
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50218:69"/>
still describe it; nor was it onely of old a symbolicall and allowable
invention, but is now become a manuall contrivance of Art, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
imposture, whereof besides others, Scaliger hath taken notice:
<hi>Basilisci f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rmam mentiti sunt vulgo Gallinaceo similem, &amp; pedibus binis,
neque enim absimiles sunt caeteris serpentibus, nisi maculâ quasi in vertice
candidâ, unde illi nomen Regium,</hi> that is, men commonly counterfeit the
forme of a Basilisk, with another like a Cock, and with two feet,
whereas they differ not from other Serpents, but in a white speck upon
their crowne; now although in some manner it might be counterfeited
in Indian Cocks, and flying Serpents, yet is it commonly contrived
out of the skins of Thornebacks, Scaites or Maids, as Aldrovand hath
observed, and also graphically described in his excellent booke of
Fishes.</p>
               <p>Nor is onely the existency of this animall considerable, but many
things delivered thereof, particularly its poyson, and its generation.
Concerning the first, according to the doctrine of the Ancients, men
still affirme, that it killeth at a distance, that it poysoneth by the eye,
and that by priority of vision; now that deleterious it may bee at some
distance and destructive without a corporall contaction, what uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
soever there be in the effect, there is no high improbability in the
relation; for if plagues or pestilentiall Atomes have beene conveyed
in the ayre from different Regions, if men at a distance have infected
each other; if the shaddowes of some trees be noxious, if Torpedoes
deliver their opium at a distance, and stupifie beyond themselves; we
cannot reasonably deny, that, beside our grosse and restrained poysons
requiring contiguity unto their actions, there may proceed from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiler
seeds, more agile emanations, which will contemne those Laws,
and invade at distance unexpected.</p>
               <p>That this venenation shooteth from the eye, and that this way a
Basil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sk may empoyson, although thus much be not agreed upon by
Authors, some imputing it unto the breath, others unto the bite, it is
not a thing impossible; for eyes receive offensive impressions, from their
objects, and may have influences destructive to each other; for the
visible species of things strike not our senses immaterally, but strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in corporall rayes, do carry with them the qualities of the object
from whence they flow, and the medium through which they passe:
Thus through a greene or red glasse all things wee behold appeare of
the same colours; thus sore eyes affect those which are sound, and
themselves also by reflection, as will happen to an inflamed eye that
beholds it selfe long in a glasse; thus is fascination made out, and thus
also it is not impossible, what is affirmed of this animall, the visible
rayes of their eyes carrying forth the subtilest portion of their poyson,
which received by the eye of man, or beast, infecteth first the braine,
and is from thence communicated unto the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:50218:70"/>
But lastly, that this destruction should be the effect of the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder,
or depend upon priority of aspection, is a point not easily to be
granted, and very hardly to be made out upon the principles of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,

which objectively move his sense; but how powerfull soever his owne

as held the contrary opinion of sight by extramission, as did Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,
Plato, Empedocles, Hipparchus, Galen, Macrobius, Proclus,
Simplic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>us, with most of the Ancients, and is the postulate of Euclide
in his Opticks: and of this opinion might they be, who from this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
of the Basilisk and man, expressed first the enmity of Christ and
Sathan, and their mutuall dest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lesh, and so he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by the Serpent, but Elder then Sathan in his Divinity, and so

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st he destroyed the old Basilisk, and overcame the
effects of his poyson, sin, death, and hell.</p>
               <p>As for the generation of the Basilisk, that it proceedeth from a
Cocks egge hatched under a Toad or Serpent, it is a conceit as mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
as the brood it selfe: for if wee should grant that Cocks grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
old, and unable for emission, amasse within themselves some semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
matter, which may after conglobate into the forme of an egge, yet
will this substance be unfruitfull, as wanting one principle of generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a commixture of the seed of both sexes, which is required un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
production, as may be observed in the egges of hens not trodden,
and as we have made triall in some which are termed Cocks egges; It
is not indeed impossible that from the sperme of a Cock, Hen, or other
animall being once in putrescence, either from incubation, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
some generation may ensue, not univocall and of the same spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
but some imperfect or monstrous production; even as in the body
of man from putred humours, and peculiar wayes of corruption, there
have succeeded strange and unseconded shapes of wormes, whereof we
have beheld some our selves, and reade of others in medicall observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
and so may strange and venemous Serpents be severall wayes
engendered; but that this generation should be regular, and alway
produce a Basilisk, is beyond our affirmation, and we have good reason
to doubt.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is unreasonable to ascribe the equivocacy of this forme
unto the hatching of a Toade, or imagine that diversifies the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
for Incubation alters not the species, nor if wee observe it so
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50218:70"/>
much as concurres either to the sex or colour, as evidently appeares in
the eggs of Ducks or Partridges hatched under a Hen, there being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
unto their exclusion, onely a gentle and continued heate, and
that not particular or confined unto the species or parent; so have I
knowne the seed of silke-wormes hatched on the bodies of women,
and so Pliny reports that Livia the wife of Augustus hatched an egge
in her bosome; nor is onely an animall heate required hereto, but an
elementall and artificiall warmth will suffice; for as Diodorus delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
the Aegyptians were wont to hatch their eggs in ovens, and many
eye witnesses confirme that practise unto this day: and therefore this
generation of the Basilisk, seemes like that of Castor and Helena,
he that can credit the one, may easily beleeve the other; that is, that
these two were hatched out of the egge, which Jupiter in the forme
of a Swan, begat on his Mistris Leda.</p>
               <p>The occasion of this conceit might be an Aegyptian tradition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the bird Ibis, which after became transferred unto Cocks; for
an old opinion it was of that Nation, that the Ibis feeding upon Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
that venemous food so inquinated their ovall conceptions, or
egges within their bodies, that they sometimes came forth in Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
shapes, and therefore they alwayes brake their egges, nor would
they endure the bird to sit upon them; but how causelesse their feare
was herein, the daily Incubation of Ducks, Peahens, and many other
testifie, and the Sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ke might have informed them, which bird they
honoured and cherished, to destroy their Serpents.</p>
               <p>That which much promoted it, was a misapprehension in holy
Scripture upon the Lati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe common opinion concerning the long life of Animals, is very
ancient, especially of Crowes, Chaughes and Deere; in moderate
accounts exceeding the age of man, in some the dayes of Nestor, and
in others surmounting the yeares of Artephius, or Methuselah; from
whence Antiquity hath raised proverbiall expressions, and the reall
conception of their duration, hath been the hyperbolicall expression of
others. From all the rest we shall single out the Deere, upon conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
a long lived Animal, and in longaevity by many conceived to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
unto hundreds; wherein permitting every man his owne beliefe,
we shall our selves crave libertie to doubt, and our reasons are these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing.</p>
               <p>The first is that of Aristole, drawne from the increment and gestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this animal, that is, it's sudden arrivance unto growth and matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and the small time of it's remainder in the wombe; his words in
the translation of Scaliger, are these; <hi>Deejus vitae longitudine fabulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
neque enim aut gestatio aut incrementum hinnulorum ejusmodi sunt,
ut praestent argumentum longaevi animalis,</hi> that is, fables are raised con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the vivassity of Deere; for neither are their gestation or incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
such as may afford an argument of long life; and these saith Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,
are good mediums conjunctively taken, that is, not one without
the other; For of animalls viviparous such as live long, goe long with
young, and attaine but slowly to their maturitie and stature; so the
Horse that liveth about thirty, arriveth unto his stature about six years,
and remaineth above nine moneths in the wombe; so the Camell that
liveth unto fifty, goeth with young no lesse then ten moneths, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not to grow before seaven; and so the Elephant that liveth an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
beareth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'s young above a yeare, and arriveth unto perfection at
twenty; on the contrary, the Sheep and Goat, which live but eight or
ten yeares, goe but five moneths, and attaine to their perfection at two
yeares; and the like is observable in Cats, Hares, and Conies; and so
the Deere that endureth the wombe but eight moneths, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
at six yeares, from the course of nature, wee cannot expect to live
an hundred, nor in any proportionall allowance much more then thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as having already passed two generall motions observable in all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
that is, it's beginning and encrease, and having but two more
to runne thorow, that is, it's state and declination, which are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
set out by nature in every kinde, and naturally proceeding ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of inference from each other.</p>
               <p>The other ground that brings it's long life into suspition, is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
salacity, and almost unparalleld excesse of venerie, which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50218:72"/>
every September may be observed in this Animall, and is supposed to
shorten the lives of Cockes, Partridges, and Sparrowes; certainely a
confessed and undeniable enemie unto longaeuitie, and that not onely
as a signe in the complexionall desire, and impetuositie, but also as a
cause in the frequent act, or iterated performance thereof; For though
we consent not with that Philosopher, who thinks a spermaticall emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
unto the waight of one dragme, is aequivalent unto the effusion of
sixtie ounces of blood, yet considering the resolution and languor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
that act in some, the extenuation and marcour in others, and the
visible acceleration it maketh of age in most, wee cannot but thinke it
much abridgeth our dayes: although we also concede that this exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is naturall, that nature it selfe will finde a way hereto without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
act or object; And although it be placed among the sixe non na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals,
that is, such as neither naturally constitutive, nor meerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive,
doe preserve or destroy according unto circumstance; yet
do we sensibly observe an impotencie or totall privation thereof, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
life, and they live longest in every kinde that exercise it not at
all, and this is true not onely in Eunuches by nature, but spadoes by
Art; For castrated animals in every species are longer lived then they
which retaine their virilities: For the generation of bodies is not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
as some conceive, of soules, that is, by Irradiation, or answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
unto the propagation of light, without its proper diminution; but
therein a transmission is made materially from some parts, and Ideally
from every one, and the propagation of one, is in a strict acception,
some minoration of another; and therefore also that axiome in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
that the generation of one thing, is the corruption of another,
although it be substantially true concerning the forme and matter, is
also dispositively verified in the efficient or producer.</p>
               <p>As for more sensible arguments, and such as relate unto experiment,
from these we have also reason to doubt its age, and presumed vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for where long life is naturall, the markes of age are late, and when
they appear, the journey unto death cannot be long. Now the age of
a Deere (as Aristotle long agoe observed) is best conjectured, by the
view or the hornes and teeth; from the hornes there is a particular and
annuall account unto six yeares, they arising first plaine, and so succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
branching, after which the judgement of their yeares by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
markes becomes uncertaine; but when they grow old, they grow
lesse branched, and first doe lose their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>propugnacula;</hi> that is,
their brow Antlers, or lowest furcations next the head, which Aristotle
saith the young ones use in fight, and the old as needles have them not
at all. The same may be also collected from the losse of their Teeth,
whereof in old age they have few or none before in either jaw. Now
these are infallible markes of age, and when they appeare, wee must
confesse a declination, which notwithstanding (as men informe us in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50218:72"/>
England) where observations may well be made, will happen between
twenty and thirty: As for the bone or rather induration of the roots of
the arterial veyn, and great artery, which is thought to be found only in
the heart of an old Deere, and therefore becomes more precious in its
rarity, it is often found in Deere, much under thirty, and wee have
knowne some affirme they have found it in one of halfe that age; and
therefore in that account of Plinie of a Deere with a collar about his
necke, put on by Alexander the Great, and taken alive a hundred years
after, with other relations of this nature we much suspect imposture or
mistake; and if we grant their verity, they are but single relations, and
very rare contingencies in individualls, not affording a regular didu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon the species: For though U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so hard to be made out, that many have deserted the common and

to take the word Genea, that is a generation consisting of many

the remarkable measure of time, and within the compasse whereof we

yeares of a Deere should be but thirty six, as is discoursed at large in

               </p>
               <p>The third ground was Philosophicall and founded upon a probable
reason in nature, and that is the defect of a Gall, which part (in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Aristotle and Plinie) this animall wanted, and was conceived a
cause and reason of their long life, according (say they) as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
unto some few men, who have not this part at all; but this asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is first defective in the verity concerning the animall alleadged: for
though it be true, a Deere hath no gall in the liver like many other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls,
yet hath it that part in the guts as is discoverable by taste and
colour: and therefore Plinie doth well correct himselfe, when having
affirmed before, it had no gall, he afterward saith, some hold it to bee
in the guts, and that for their bitternesse, dogs will refuse to eat them.
It is also deficient in the verity of the Induction or connumeration of
other annimalls conjoyned herewith, as having also no gall; that is, as
Plinie accounteth, <hi>Equ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Boars, Camells, Dolphins, have no gall; concerning Horses, what
truth there is herein we have declared before; as for Goats wee finde
not them without it, what gall the Camell hath, Aristotle declareth,
that Hogs also have it, we can affirm, and that not in any obscure place,
but in the liver, even as it is seated in man.</p>
               <p>That therefore the Deere is no short lived animall, we will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

animalls, but that it attaineth unto hundreds, or the years delivered
by Authors, since we have no authentick experience for it, since wee
have reason and common experience against it, since the grounds are
false and fabulous which doe establish it, wee know no ground to
assent.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Deere there also passeth another opinion, that the
males thereof doe yearly lose their pizzell; for men observing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence
of their hornes, doe fall upon the like conceit of this part that
it annually rotte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ground hereof, was surely the observation of this part in Deere after
immoderate venery, and about the end of their Rutt, which sometimes
becomes so relaxed and pendulous, it cannot be quite retracted; and
being often beset with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>yes, it is conceived to rot, and at last to fall
from the body; but herein experience will contradict us: for those
Deere which either dye or are killed at that time, or any other, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
found to have that part entire; and reason also will correct us,
for spermaticall parts, or such as are framed from the seminall prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples

respect and constant habitude thereto: For although in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
animalls, we deny not a kinde of naturall Astrologie, or innate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention
both of wind and weather; yet that proceeding from sense re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
impressions from the first mutation of the ayre, they cannot in
reason retaine that apprehension after death, as being affections which
depend on life, and depart upon disanimation, and therefore with more
favourable reason may we draw the same effect, or sympathie upon
the Hedgehog, whose presention of winds is so exact, that it stoppeth
the north or southerne hole of its nest, according to prenotion of these
winds ensuing, which some men unexpectedly observing, have beene
able to make predictions which way the wind would turne, and have
been esteemed hereby wise men in point of weather. Now this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from sense in the creature alive, it were not reasonable to hang
up an Hedgehog dead, and to expect a conformable motion unto its
living conversion: and though in sundry plants their vertues doe live
after death, and we know that Scammonie, Rhubarbe, and Senna will
purge without any vitall assistance; yet in animals or sensible creatures,
many actions are mixt, and depend upon their living forme, as well as
that of mistion, and though they wholly seeme to retaine unto the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
depart upon disunion: Thus Glowewormes alive, project a lustre
in the darke, which fulgour notwithstanding ceaseth after death; and
thus the Torpedo which being alive stupifies at a distance, applied af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death, produceth no such effect, which had they retained, in places
where they abound, they might have supplyed Opium, and served as
frontalls in Phrensies.</p>
               <p>As for experiment we cannot make it out by any we have attempted,
for if a single Kingfisher be hanged up with untwisted silke in an open
roome, and where the ayre is free, it observes not a constant respect
unto the mouth of the wind, but variously converting doth seldome
breast it right; if two be suspended in the same roome, they will not
regularly conforme their breasts, but oft-times respect the opposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e
points of heaven; and if we conceive that for the exact exploration
they should be suspended where the ayre is quiet and unmoved, that
clear of impediments, they may more freely convert upon their naturall
verticity, we have also made this way of inquisition in suspending
them in large and capacious glasses closely stopped; wherein neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we observed a casual station, and that they rested irregularly upon
conversion, wheresoever they rested remaining inconverted, and
poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bird and beast, as we finde the Bat to be, yet are their parts so confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and set together that we cannot define the beginning or end of
either, there being a commixtion of both in the whole, rather then an
adaptation, or cement of the one unto the other.</p>
               <p>Now for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Gryps, sometimes mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and frequently in humane Authors, properly understood, it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
some kinde of Eagle or Vulture, from whence the Epithite
Grypus for an hooked or Aquiline nose. Thus when the Septuagint
makes use of this word in the eleventh of Leviticus, Tremellius and
our Translation hath rendred it the Ossifrage, which is one kinde of
Eagle, although the Vulgar translation, and that annexed unto the
Septuagint retaine the word <hi>Grips,</hi> which in ordinary and schoole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
is commonly rendred a Griffin; yet cannot the Latin assume
any other sence then the Greek, from whence it is borrowed; and
though the Latine <hi>Gryphes</hi> be altered somewhat by the addition of an
h, or aspiration of the letter <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet is not this unusuall; so what the
Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Latins will call <hi>Trophaeum,</hi> and that person
which in the Gospel is named <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Latins will render <hi>Cleophas,</hi>
and therefore the quarrell of Origen was injust and his conception er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
when he conceived the food of Griffins forbidden by the
Law of Moses, that is, poeticall animals, and things of no existence:
and therefore when in the Hecatombs and mighty oblations of the
Gentiles, it is delivered they sacrificed Gryphes or Griffins, hereby
we may understand some stronger sort of Eagles; and therefore also
when it said in Virgil of an improper match, or Mopsus marrying Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,
<hi>Iungentur jam gryhes equis,</hi> we need not hunt after other sense, then
that strange unions shall be made, and differing natures be conjoyned
together.</p>
               <p>As for the testimonies of ancient Writers, they are but derivative,
and terminate all in one Aristeus a Poet of Proconesus; who affirmed
that neere the Arimaspi, or one eyed Nation, Griffins defended the
mines of gold: but this as Herodotus delivereth, he wrote by heresay;
and Michovius who hath expresly written of those parts plainly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
there is neither gold nor Griffins in that countrey, nor any such
animall extant, for so doth he conclude, <hi>Ego vero contra veteres autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,

               </p>
               <p>Lastly, concerning the Hieroglyphicall authority, although it
neerest approacheth the truth, it doth not inferre its existency; the
conceit of the Griffin properly taken being but a symbolicall phancy,
in so intolerable a shape including allowable morality. So doth it well
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50218:75"/>

and testified also in their records; but after all concludeth, <hi>Sed quae fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa

contrarily, or contradictorily delivered themselves, that no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative
from thence can reasonably be deduced; for most have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
denyed it, and they which affirme and beleeve it, assigne this
name unto many, and mistake two or three in one. So hath that bird
beene taken for the Phaenix which liveth in Arabia, and buildeth its
nest with Cinnamon, by Herodotus called <hi>Cinnamulgus,</hi> and by Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
<hi>Cinnamomus,</hi> and as a fabulous conceit is censured by Scaliger;
some have conceived that bird to be the Phaenix, which by a Persian
name with the Greeks is called Rhyntace; but how they made this

that this is a little bird brought often to their tables, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aenix;
which though promoted by rariety with us, the Easterne travellers
will hardly admit, who know they are common in those parts, and the
ordinary plume of Janizaries among the Turks. And lastly, the bird
Semenda hath found the same appellation, for so hath Scaliger ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and refuted; nor will the solitude of the Phaenix allow this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination,
for many there are of that species, &amp; whose trifistulary bill
and crany we have beheld our selves; nor are men onely at variance in
regard of the Phaenix it selfe, but very disagreeing in the accidents
ascribed thereto: for some affirme it liveth three hundred, some five,
others six, some a thousand, others no lesse then fifteene hundred
yeares; some say it liveth in Aethiopia, others in Arabia, some in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
others in India, and some I thinke in Utopia, for such must that
be which is described by Lactantius, that is, which neither was singed
in the combustion of Phaeton, or overwhelmed by the inundation of
D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Lastly, many Authors who have made mention hereof, have so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
themselves, and with such intentions we cannot from thence
deduce a confirmation: For some have written Poetically as Ovid,
Mantuan, Lactantius, Claudian, and others: Some have written my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically,
as Paracelsus in his booke <hi>de Azoth,</hi> or <hi>de ligno &amp; linea vitae;</hi>
and as severall Hermeticall Philosophers, involving therein the secret
of their Elixir, and enigmatically expressing the nature of their great
worke: Some have written Rhetorically, and concessively not contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50218:76"/>
but assuming the question, which taken as granted advantaged
the illation: So have holy men made use hereof as farre as thereby to
confirme the Resurrection; for discoursing with heathens who granted
the story of the Phaenix, they induced the Resurrection from principles
of their owne, and positions received among themselves. Others have
spoken Emblematically and Hieroglyphically, and so did the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
unto whom the Phaenix was the Hieroglyphick of the Sunne; and
this was probably the ground of the whole relation, succe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ding ages
adding fabulous accounts, which laid together built up this singularity,
which every pen proclaimeth.</p>
               <p>As for the Texts of Scripture, which seem to confirme the conceit
duly perpended, they adde not thereunto; For whereas in that of Job,
according to the Septuagint or Greeke Translation we finde the word
Phaenix, yet can it have no ani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all signification; for therein it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the truncke of the Palme tree, which is
also called Phaenix, and therefore the construction will be very hard,
if not applyed unto some vegetable nature; nor can we safely insist upon
the Greek expression at all: for though the Vulgar translates it <hi>Palma,</hi> &amp;
som retain the Phaenix, others do render it by a word of a different sense;
for so hath Tremellius delivered it: <hi>Dicebam quod apud nidum meum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirabo,
&amp; sicut arena multiplicabo d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es;</hi> so hath the Geneva and ours
translated it, I said I shall dye in my nest, and shall multiply my dayes,
as the sand: as for that in the booke of Psalmes, <hi>Vir justus ut Phaenix
florebit,</hi> as Epiphanius and Tertullian render it, it was only a mistake
upon the homonymy of the Greeke word Phaenix, which signifies
also a Palme tree; which is a fallacy of equivocation, from a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in name, inferring a common nature, and whereby we may as firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conclude, that Diaphaenicon a purging electuary hath some part of
the Phaenix for its ingredient, which receiveth that name from D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes,
or the fruit of the Palme tree, from whence as Plinie delivers, the
Phenix had its name.</p>
               <p>Nor doe we only arraigne the existence of this animall, but many
things are questionable which are ascribed thereto, especially its unity,
long life, and generation: As for its unity or conceit there should bee
but one in nature, it seemeth not onely repugnant unto Philosophy, but
also the holy Scripture, which plainly affirmes, there went of every
sort two at least into the Arke of Noah, according to the text, Gen. 7.
Every fowle after his kinde, every bird of every sort, they went into
the Arke, two and two of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lesh, wherein there is the breath of life,
and they that went in, went in both male and female of all flesh; it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringeth
the Benediction of God concerning multiplication, Gen. 1.
God blessed them saying, Be fruitfull and multiply, and fill the waters
in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth; and again, Chap. 8. Bring
forth with thee, every living thing that they may breed abundantly in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50218:77"/>
the earth, and be fruitfull, and multiply upon the earth, which termes
are not applyable unto the Phaenix, whereof there is but one in the
world, and no more now living then at the first benediction, for the
production of one, being the destruction of another, although they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
and generate, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ncrease not, and must not be said to multiply,
who doe not transcend an unity.</p>
               <p>As for longaevity, as that it liveth a thousand yeares, or more, beside
that from imperfect observations and rarity of appearance, no confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
can be made, there may be probably a mistake in the compute;
for the tradition being very ancient and probably Aegyptian, the
Greeks who dispersed the fable, might summe up the account by their
owne numeration of yeares, whereas the conceit might have its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
in times of shorter compute; for if we suppose our present calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
the Phaenix now in nature will be the sixt from the Creation, but
in the middle of its years,<note place="margin">That the world should last but six thousand years.</note> and if the Rabbines prophesie succeed shall
conclude its dayes, not in its owne, but the last and generall flames,
without all hope of Reviviction.</p>
               <p>Concerning its generation, that without all conjunction, it begets
and reseminates it selfe, hereby we introduce a vegetable production
in animalls, and unto sensible natures, transferre the propriety of plants,
that is to multiply among themselves, according to the law of the
Creation, Gen. 1. Let the earth bring forth grasse, the herbe yeelding
seed, and the tree yeelding fruit, whose seed is in it selfe; which way
is indeed the naturall way of plants, who having no distinction of sex,
and the power of the species contained in every <hi>individuum,</hi> beget and
propagate themselves without commixtion, and therefore their fruits
proceeding from simpler roots, are not so unlike, or distinguishable
from each other, as are the off-springs of sensible creatures and prolifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
descending from double originalls; but animall generation is
accomplished by more, and the concurrence of two sexes is required to
the constitution of one; and therefore such as have no distinction of
sex, engender not at all, as Aristotle conceives of Eles, and testaceous
animalls; and though plant animalls doe multiply, they doe it not by
copulation, but in a way analogous unto plants; so Hermophrodites al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they include the parts of both sexes, and may be sufficiently po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in either, yet unto a conception require a seperated sex, and cannot
impregnate themselves; and so also though Adam included all humane
nature, or was (as some opinion) an Hermaphrodite, yet had hee no
power to propagate himselfe; and therefore God said, It is not good
that man should be alone, let us make him an help meet for him, that is,
an help unto generation; for as for any other help, it had been fitter to
have made another man.</p>
               <p>Now whereas some affirme that from one Phaenix there doth not
immediatly proceed another, but the first corrupteth into a worme,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50218:77"/>
which after becommeth a Phaenix, it will not make probable this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction;
For hereby they confound the generation of perfect animalls
with imperfect, sanguineous, with exanguious, vermiparous, with
oviparous, and erect Anomalies, disturbing the lawes of Nature; Nor
will this corruptive production be easily made out, in most imperfect
generations; for although we deny not that many animals are vermipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
begetting themselves at a distance, &amp; as it were at the second hand,
as generally insects, and more remarkably Butterflies and Silkwormes;
yet proceeds not this generation from a corruption of themselves, but
rather a specificall, and seminall diffusion, retaining still the Idea of
themselves, though it act that part a while in other shapes: and this will
also hold in generations equivocall, and such are not begotten from
Parents like themselves; so from Frogs corrupting, proceed not Frogs
againe; so if there be anatiferous trees, whose corruption breaks forth
into Bernacles, yet if they corrupt, they degenerate into Maggots,
which produce not themselves againe; for this were a confusion of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptive
and seminall production, and a frustration of that seminall
power committed to animalls at the creation. The probleme might
have beene spared, Why wee love not our Lice as well as our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Noahs Arke had beene needlesse, the graves of animals would
be the fruitfullest wombs; for death would not destroy, but empeople
the world againe.</p>
               <p>Since therefore we have so slender grounds to confirm the existence
of the Phaenix, since there is no ocular witnesse of it, since as we have
declared, by Authors from whom the Story is derived, it rather stands
rejected, since they who have seriously discoursed hereof, have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
themselves negatively, diversly or contrarily, since many others
cannot be drawne into Argument as writing Poetically, Rhetorically,
Enigmatically, Hieroglyphically, since holy Scripture alleadged for it
duely prepended, doth not advantage it, and lastly since so strange a
generation, vnity and long life hath neither experience nor reason to
confirme it, how farre to rely on this tradition, wee referre unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
               <p>But surely they were not wel-wishers unto <gap reason="foreign">

remedies that are not recoverable under a thousand yeares, or propose
the prolonging of life by that which the twentieth generation may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
behold; more veniable is a dependance upon the Philosophers
stone, potable gold, or any of those Arcana's, whereby Paracelsus that
dyed himselfe at 47. gloried that he could make other men immortall;
which secrets, although extreamly difficult, and <hi>tantum non</hi> infesible,
yet are they not impossible, nor do they (rightly understood) impose

any violence on Nature, and therefore if strictly taken for the Phaenix
very strange is that which is delivered by Plutarch, <hi>De sanitate tuenda,</hi>
That the braine thereof is a pleasant bit, but that it causeth the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach;
which notwithstanding the luxurious Emperour could never tast,
though he had at his table many a Phaenicopterus, yet had he not one
Phaenix; for though he expected and attempted it, wee reade not in
Lampridius that he performed it; and considering the unity thereof
it was a vaine designe, that is, to destroy any species, or mutilate the
great accomplishment of six dayes; and although some conceive, and
it may seeme true, that there is in man a naturall possibility to destroy
the world in one generation, that is, by a generall conspire to know no
woman themselves and disable all others also; yet will this never bee
effected, and therefore Cain after he had killed Abel, were there no
other woman living, could not have also destroyed Eve; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had a naturall power to effect, yet the execution thereof, the
providence of God would have resisted, for that would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
another creation upon him, and to have animated a second rib

               <p>COncerning the venemons urine of Toads, of the stone in a Toads
head, and of the generation of Frogges, conceptions are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
which require consideration; And first, that a Toad pisseth, and
this way diffuseth its venome, is generally received, not onely with us,
but also in other parts; for so hath Scaliger observed in his Comment,
<hi>Aversum urinam reddere ob oculos persecutoris perniciosam ruricolis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasum
est;</hi> and Mathiolus hath also a passage, that a Toad communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
its venom, not onely by vrine, but by the humiditie and slaver of
its mouth; which notwithstanding strictly understood, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with truth; For to speak properly, a Toad pisseth not, nor doe they
containe those urinary parts which are found in other animals, to avoid
that serous excretion; as may appeare unto any that exenterats or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects
them; for therein will be found neither bladder, kidneyes, or ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
any more then they are in birds, which although they eat &amp; drink,
yet for the moist and dry excretion, have but one vent and common
place of exclusion; and with the same proprietie of language, we may
ascribe that action unto Crowes and Kites; and this is verified not only
in Frogs and Toades, but for ought I can discover, that may bee true
which Aristotle assumeth, that no oviparous animall, that is, which
either spawne or lay egges doth urine, except the Tortois.</p>
               <p>The ground or occasion of this expression might from hence arise,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50218:78"/>
that Toades are sometimes obse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

liquid matter behinde, which indeed we have observed to be true, and
a venemous condition there may bee perhaps therein, but it cannot bee
called their urine; not onely because they want those parts of secretion;
but because it is emitted aversly or backward, by both sexes.</p>
               <p>As for the stone commonly called a Toad-stone, which is presumed
to be found in the head of that animall, we first conceive it not a thing
impossible, nor is there any substantiall reason, why in a Toade, there
may not be found such hard and lapideous concretions; for the like we
daily observe in the heads of fishes, as Codds, Carpes, and Pearches,
the like also in Snailes, a soft and exosseous animall, whereof in the na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Againe, though it be not impossible, yet is it surely very rare, as we
are induced to beleeve from some enquiry of our owne, from the triall
of many who have beene deceived, and the frustated search of Porta,
who upon the explorement of many, could never finde one; Nor is it
onely of rarity, but may be doubted whether it be of existency, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

               <p>Lastly, if any such thing there be, yet must it not for ought I see, be
taken as we receive it, for a loose and moveable stone, but rather a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion

Concerning the generation of Froggs, wee shall briefly deliver that
account which observation hath taught us. By Frogges I understand
not such as arising from putrifaction, are bred without copulation, and
because they subsist not long, are called <hi>Temporariae;</hi> nor doe I meane
hereby the little Frogge of an excellent Parrat-green, that usually sits
on trees and bushes, and is therefore called <hi>Ravunculus viridis,</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boreus;</hi>
but hereby I understand the aquatile or water Frogge whereof
in ditches and standing plashes, wee may behold many millions every
Spring in England; Now these doe not as Plini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> conceiveth, exclude
blacke pieces of flesh, which after become Frogges, but they let fall
their spawne in the water, which is of excellent use in Physicke, and
scarce unknowne unto any; in this spawne of a lentous and transparent
body, are to be discerned many gray specks, or little conglobations,
which in a little time become of deepe blacke; a substance more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
and terrestrious then the other, for it riseth not in distillation,
and affords a powder, when the white and aqueous part is exhaled.
Now of this blacke or duskie substance is the Frogge at last formed,
as we have beheld, including the spawne with water in a glasse, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it unto the Sunne; for that blacke and round substance, in a few
dayes began to dilate and grow ovall, after a while the head, the eyes,
the taile to be discerneable, and at last to become that which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
called Gyrinus, wee a Porwigle or Tadpole, and this in some
weekes after, becomes a perfect Frogge, the legs growing out before,
and the tayle wearing away, to supply the other behinde, as may bee
observed in some, which have newly forsaken the water: for in such,
some part of the tayle will be seen but curtal'd and short, not long and
finny as before; a part provided them a while to swim and move in the
water, that is, untill such time as nature excluded legs, whereby they
might be provided not only to swim in the water, but move upon the
land, according to the amphibious and mixt intention of nature, that is
to live in both. And because many affirme, and some deliver, that in
regard it hath lungs and breatheth a Frogge may bee easily drowned,
though the reason be probable, I finde not the experiment answerable;
for making triall, and fastning one about a span under water, it lived al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
six dayes.</p>

               <p>THat a Salamander is able to live in flames, to endure and put out
fire is an assertion, not only of great Antiquitie, but confirmed by
frequent, and not contemptible testimonie; The Aegyptians have
drawne it into their Hieroglyphicks; Aristotle seemeth to embrace it,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50218:79"/>
more plainely Nicander, Serenus, Sammonicus, Aelian, and Plinie, who
assignes the cause of this effect. An animall (saith he) so cold that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisheth
the fire like Ice; all which notwithstanding, there is on the
negative Authoritie and experience; Sex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ius a Physition, as Plinie deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth,
denied this effect, Dioscorides affirmed it a point of folly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it, Galen that it endureth the fire a while, but in continuance is
consumed therein; For experimentall conviction Mathiolus affirmeth,
he saw a Salamander burnt in a very short time; and of the like asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is Amatus Lusitanus, and most plainly Pierius, whose words in his
Hieroglyphicks are these; Whereas it is commonly said, that a Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
extinguisheth fire, wee have found by experience, that 'tis
so farre f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om quenching hot coales; that it dieth immediatly therein;
As for the contrary assertion of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>istotle, it is but by hearesay, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
opinion beleeveth, <hi>Haec enim (ut aiunt) ignem ingrediens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguit;</hi>
and therefore there was no absurdity in Galen when as a Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
medicine he commended the ashes of a Salamander, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
in vaine from the power of this tradition, at the burning of towns
or houses expect a reliefe from Salamanders.</p>
               <p>The ground of this opinion might be some sensible resistance of
fire observed in the Salamander, which being as Galen determineth,
cold in the fourth, and moist in the third degree, and having also a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
humidity above and under the skinne, by vertue thereof may a
while endure the flame, which being consumed it can resist no more.
Such an humidity there is observed in Newtes, or water-Lizards, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if their skinnes be prickt or perforated. Thus will Frogges and
Snailes endure the flame, thus will whites of egges, vitreous or glassey
flegme extinguish a coal, thus are unguents made which protect a while
from the fire, and thus beside the Hirpini, there are later stories of
men that have pass'd untoucht through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ire, and therefore some trueth
we allow in the tradition; truth according unto Galen, that it may for
a time resist a fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me, or as Scaliger avers, extinguish or put out a coale;
for thus much will many humide bodies performe, but that it perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veres
and lives in that destructive element, is a fallacious enlargement;
nor doe we reasonably conclude, because for a time it endureth fire, it
subdueth and extinguisheth the same, because by a cold and aluminous
moisture, it is able a while to resist it, from a peculiarity of nature it
subsisteth and liveth in it.</p>
               <p>It hath beene much promoted by Stories of incombustible napkins
and textures which endure the fire, whose materialls are call'd by the
name of Salamanders wooll; which many too literally apprehending,
conceive some investing part, or tegument of the Salamander; wherein
beside that they mistake the condition of this animal, which is a kinde
of Lizard, a quadruped corticated and depilous, that is without wooll,
furre, or haire, they observe not the method and generall rule of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50218:80"/>
whereby all Quadrupeds oviparous, as Lizards, Froggs, Tortois,
Chameleons, Crocodiles, are without any haire, and have no covering
part or hairy investment at all; and if they conceive that from the skin
of the Salamander, these incremable pieces are composed, beside the
experiments made upon the living, that of Brassavolus will step in, who
in the search of this truth, did burne the skin of one dead.</p>
               <p>Nor is this Salamanders wooll desumed from any animal, but a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
substance Metaphorically so called from this received opinion;
For beside Germanicus his heart, and Pyrrhus his great Toe, there are
in the number of Mineralls, some bodies incombustible; more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
that which the Ancients named Asbeston, and Pancirollus
treats of in the chapter of <hi>Linum vivum:</hi> whereof by Art were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
napkins, shirts, and coats inconsumable by fire, and wherein in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times, to preserve their ashes pure, and without commixture, they
burnt the bodies of Kings; a napkin hereof Plinie reports that Nero
had, &amp; the like saith Paulus Venetus, the Emperour of Tartarie sent unto
Pope Alexander; and affirms that in some parts of Tartarie, there were
Mines of Iron whose filaments were weaved into incombustible cloth,
which rare manufacture, although delivered for lost by Pancirollus, yet
Salmuth delivereth in his comment that one Podocaterus a Cyprian,
had shewed the same at Venice, and his materialls were from Cyprus,
where indeed Dioscorides placeth them; the same is also ocularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by Vives upon Austin and Maiolus in his colloquies; and thus
in our daies do men practise to make long lasting Snasts or Elychinons
parts for lampes, out of Alumen plumosum; and by the same wee read
in Pausanias, that there alwayes burnt a Lampe before the Image of
Minerva.</p>

               <p>THat the Amphisbaena, that is, a smaller kinde of Serpent, which
moveth forward and backward, hath two heads, or one at either

conceit of Chimera and Hydra unto fables, hath set downe this as an
undeniable truth.</p>
               <p>Whereunto while men assent, and can beleeve a bicipitous confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in any continued species, they admit a gemination of principall
parts, which is not naturally discovered in any animall; true it is that
other parts in animals are not equall, for some make their progression
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50218:80"/>
with many legs, even to the number of an hundred, as Juli Scolopen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ae,
or such as are termed centipedes; some flye with two wings, as
birds and many insests, some with foure, as all farinaceous or mealy
winged animals, as Butter-flies, and Moths, all vaginipennous or
sheathwinged insects, as Beetles and Dorrs; some have three Testicles,
as Aristotle speakes of the Buzzard, and some have foure stomacks, as
horned and ruminating animals; but for the principall parts, the liver,
heart, and especially the braine, regularly it is but one in any kinde or
species whatsoever.</p>
               <p>And were there any such species or naturall kinde of animall, it
would be hard to make good those six positions of body, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the three dimensions are ascribed unto every animall, that
is, <hi>infra, supra, ante, retro, dextrorsum, sinistrorsum;</hi> for if (as it is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined)
that be the anterior and upper part wherein the sences are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and that the posterior and lower part which is opposite thereunto,
there is no inferiour or former part in this animall, for the senses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
placed at both extreames, doe make both ends anteriour, which is
impossible, the termes being Relative, which mutually subsist, and
are not without each other, and therefore this duplicity was ill contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to place one head at both extreames, and had beene more tolerable
to have setled three or foure at one, and therefore also Poets have been
more reasonable then Philosophers, and Geryon or Cerberus, lesse
monstrous then Amphisbaena.</p>
               <p>Againe, if any such thing there were, it were not to be obtruded by
the name of Amphisbaena, or as an animall of one denomination; for
properly that animall is not one, but multiplicious or many, which
hath a duplicity or gemination of principle parts; and this doth Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
define, when he affirmeth a monster is to be esteemed one or
many, according to its principle, which he conceived the heart, whence
he derived the originall of Nerves, and thereto ascribe many acts
which Physitians assigne unto the braine; and therefore if it cannot be
called one, which hath a duplicity of hearts in his sence, it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that appellation with a plurality of heads in ours; And this the
practise of Christians hath acknowledged, who have baptized these
geminous births, and double connascencies with severall names, as
conceiving in them a distinction of soules, upon the devided execution
of their functions; that is, while one wept, the other laughing, while
one was silent, the other speaking, while one awaked, the other sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as is declared by three remarkable examples in Petrach, Vincenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
and the Scottish history of Buchanan.</p>
               <p>It is not denyed there have beene bicipitous Serpents with the head
at each extreme, for an example hereof we finde in Aristotle, and in
the like forme in Aldrovand wee meet with the Icon of a Lizzard;
which double formations do often happen unto multiparous generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50218:81"/>
more especially that of Serpents, whose conceptions being nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and their Eggs in chaines or links together, (which sometime
conjoyne and inoculate into each other) they may unite into various
shapes, and come out in mixed formations; but these are monstrous
productions, and beside the intention of Nature, and the statutes of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
neither begotten of like parents, nor begetting the like againe,
but irregularly produced do stand as Anomalies, and make up the <hi>Quae genus,</hi> in the generall booke of Nature; which being the shifts and
forced pieces, rather then the genuine and proper effects, they afford
us no illation, nor is it reasonable to conclude, from a monstrosity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a species, or from accidentall effects, unto the regular workes of
Nature.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the ground of the conceit was the figure of this animall,
and motion oft times both wayes; for described it is to bee like a
worme, and so equally framed at both extremes, that at an ordinary
distance it is no easie matter, to determine which is the head; and
therefore some observing them to move both wayes, have given the
appellation of heads unto both extreames, which is no proper and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
denomination, for many animals with one head do ordinarily
performe both different and contrary motions; Crabs move sideling,
Lobsters will swim swiftly backward, Wormes and Leeches wil move
both wayes; and so will most of those animals, whose bodies consist of
round and annulary fibers, and move by undulation, that is, like the
waves of the Sea, the one protruding the other, by inversion whereof
they make a backward motion.</p>
               <p>Upon the same ground hath arisen the same mistake concerning the

transcribed relations and conjectures, upon enquiry we finde the
some repugnant unto experience and reason.</p>
               <p>And first it seemes not only injurious unto the providence of Nature,
to ordaine a way of production which should destroy the producer, or
contrive the continuation of the species by the destruction of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuator;
but it overthrowes and frustrates the great Benediction of God,
which is expressed Gen. 1. God blessed them saying, Be fruitfull and
multiply. Now if it be so ordained that some must regularly perish
by multiplication, and these be the fruits of fructifying in the Viper;
it cannot be said that God did blesse, but curse this animall; upon thy
belly shalt thou goe, and dust shalt thou eat all thy life, was not so great
a punishment unto the Serpent after the fall, as encrease, be fruitfull and
multiply, was before. This were to confound the maledictions of
God, and translate the curse of the Woman upon the Serpent; that is,
<hi>in dolore paries,</hi> in sorrow shalt thou bring forth, which being proper
unto the women, is verified best in the Viper, whose delivery is not only
accompanied with paine, but also with death it self. And lastly, it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
the carefull course, and parentall provision of nature, whereby
the young ones newly excluded are sustained by the Dam, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
untill they grow up to a sufficiencie for themselves; all which is
perverted in this eruptive generation, for the Dam being destroyed,
the younglings are left to their owne protection, which is not conceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
they can at all performe, and whereof they afford us a remarkable
confirmance many dayes after birth; for the young ones supposed to
breake through the belly of the Dam, will upon any fright for protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
run into it; for then the old one receives them in at her mouth, which
way the fright b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sh Physitian of Alcala <hi>de</hi>
Henares, whose words in his third <hi>de Animantibus Scripturae</hi> are these:
<hi>Cum vero per me &amp; per alios haec ipsa disquisissem servata Vip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rina pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie,
&amp;c.</hi> that is, when by my selfe and others I had enquired the
truth hereof, including Vipers in a glasse, and feeding them with cheese
and branne, I undoubtedly found that the Viper was not delivered by
the tearing of her bowels, but I beheld them excluded by the passage
of generation neare the orifice of the seidge.</p>
               <p>Now although the Tradition be untrue, there wanted not many
grounds which made it plausibly received. The first was a favourable
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dulgence and speciall contrivance of nature, which was the conceit
of Herodotus who thus delivereth himselfe: Fearfull animalls, and such
as serve for food, nature hath made more fruitfull, but upon the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and noxious kinde, she hath not conferred fertility: So the Hare
that becommeth a prey unto man, unto beasts, and fowles of the ayre,
is fruitfull even to superfae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation, but the Lyon a fierce and ferocious
animall hath young ones but seldome, and also but one at a time; Vipers
indeed, although destructive, are fruitfull; but lest their number should
encrease, providence hath contrived another way to abate it, for in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
the female bites off the head of the male, and the young ones
destroy the mother; but this will not consist with reason, as wee have
declared before: And if wee more nearly consider the condition of
Vipers and noxious animalls, we shall discover another provision of
nature; how although in their paucity shee hath not abridged their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity,
yet hath she notoriously effected it by their secession or lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie;
for not only offensive insects as Hornets, waspes, and the like;
but sanguineous corticated animals, as Serpents, Toads and Lizards, do
lye hid and betake themselves to coverts in the Winter; whereby most
Countries enjoying the immunity of Ireland and Candie, there ariseth
a temporall security, from their venome, and an intermission of their
mischiefes, mercifully requiting the time of their activities.</p>
               <p>A second ground of this effect, was conceived the justice of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50218:82"/>
whereby she compensates the death of the father by the matricide
or murder of the mother, and this was the expression of Nicander; but
the cause hereof is as improbable as the effect, and were indeed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident
revenge in the young ones, whereby in consequence, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
defect of provision they must destroy themselves; and whereas he
expresseth this decollation of the male by so full a terme as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
that is, to cut or lop off, the act is hardly conceiveable; for the female
Viper hath but foure considerable teeth, and those so disposed so slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and needle-pointed, that they are ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er for puncture then any act of
incision; and if any like action there be, it may be onely some fast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
or sudden compression in the Orgasmus or fury of their lust,
according as that expression of Horace is construed concerning
Lydia and Telephus

                  </q>
Others ascribe this effect unto the numerous conception of the Viper,
and this was the opinion of Theophrastus, who though he denieth the
exesion or forcing through the belly, conceiveth neverthelesse that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a full and plentifull impletion there may perhaps succeed a disrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the matrix, as it happeneth sometimes in the long and slender fish
Acus: Now although in hot Countries, and very numerous concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Viper or other animalls, there may sometimes ensue a dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration
of the genitall parts, yet is this a rare and contingent effect, and
not a naturall and constant way of exclusion; for the wise Creator
hath formed the organs of animalls unto their operations, and in whom
hee ordaineth a numerous conception, in them he hath prepared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
receptacles, and a sutable way of exclusion.</p>
               <p>Others doe ground this disruption upon their continued or protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
time of delivery, presumed to last twenty dayes, whereat, excluding
but one a day, the latter brood impatient, by a forcible prorup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their period of exclusion, and this was the assertion of Plinie,

which are literally thus translated, <hi>Paret

be thus Englished, She bringeth forth in one day one by one and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

dayes, which in the textuary sense is fully accomplished in one.</p>
               <p>But what hath most advanced it, is a mistake in another text of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,

                  </gap>uption of the membranes or skins,
which include the young ones, conceiving a dilaceration of the matrix
and belly of the viper, and concluding from a casuall dilaceration, a
regular and constant disruption.</p>
               <p>As for the Latin word <hi>Vipera,</hi> which in the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ymologie of Isidore
promoteth this conceit, more properly it may imply <hi>vivipera;</hi> for
whereas other Serpents lay egges, the Viper excludeth living animalls;
and though the Cerastes be also viviparous, and we have found formed
Snakes in the belly of the Cecilia or slow-worme, yet may the Viper
emphatically beare that name; for the notation or Etymologie is not of
necessity adequate unto the name; and therefore though animall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from <hi>anima,</hi> yet are there many animations beside, and plants
will challenge a right therein as well as sensible creatures.</p>
               <p>As touching the Text of Scripture, and compellation of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
by generation of Vipers, although constructions bee made hereof
conformable to this Tradition, and it may be plausibly expounded, that
out of a viperous condition, they conspired against their Prophets, and
destroyed their spirituall parents; yet (as Jansenius observeth) Gregory
and Jerome, doe make another construction, apprehending thereby
what is usually implyed by that Proverb, <hi>Mali corvi malum ovum;</hi> that
is, of evill parents, an evill generation, a posterity not unlike their
majority, of mischievous progenitors, a venemous and destructive
progenie.</p>
               <p>And lastly, concerning the Hieroglyphicall account, according to
the Vulgar conception set downe by Orus Apollo, the authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is only Emblematicall, for were the conception true or false, to their
apprehensions, it expressed filiall impiety; which strictly taken, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
received for truth, might perhaps begin, but surely promote this
conception.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Hares.</head>
               <p>THat Hares are both male and female, beside the Vulgar opinion,
was the affirmative of Archelaus, of Plutarch, Philostratus, and
many more; nor are there hardly any who either treat of mutation or
mixtion of sexes, who have not left some mention of this point; some
speaking positively, others dubiously, and most resigning it unto the
enquiry of the Reader: now hereof to speake distinctly, they must be
male and female by mutation and succession of sexes, or else by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
by mixture or union thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:50218:83"/>
As for the mutation of sexes, or transition into one another, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny it in Hares, it being observable in man: for hereof beside
Empedocles or Tiresias, there are not a few examples; and though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few, or rather none which have emasculated or turned women, yet
very many who from an esteem or reallity of being women have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
proved men: some at the first point of their menstruous erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
some in the day of their marriage, others many yeares after, which
occasioned disputes at Law, and contestations concerning a restore of
the dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y; and that not only mankinde, but many other animalls,
may suffer this transexion, we will not deny, or hold it at al impossible;
although I confesse by reason of the posticke and backward position
of the feminine parts in quadrupeds, they can hardly admit the substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of a protrusion effectuall unto masculine generation, except it be
in Retromingents, and such as couple backward.</p>
               <p>Nor shall we only concede the succession of sexes in some, but shall
not dispute the transition of reputed species in others; that is, a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation,
or (as Paracelsians terme it) the Transplantation of one into
another; hereof in perfect animalls of a congenerous seed, or neare affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of natures, examples are not unfrequent, as Horses, Asses, Dogs,
Foxes, Phaisants, Cocks, &amp;c. but in imperfect kindes, and such where
the discrimination of sexes is obscure, these transformations are more
common: and in some within themselves without commixtion, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in Caterpillers or Silk-wormes, wherein there is visible and
triple transfiguration: but in Plants wherein there is no distinction of
sex, these transplantations are yet more obvious then any; as that of
barley into oates, of wheat into darnell, and those graines which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
arise among corne, as cockle, Aracus, Aegilops, and other dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
which come up in unexpected shapes, when they want the
support and maintenance of the primary and master-formes: And the
same do some affirm concerning other plants in lesse analogy of figures,
as the mutation of Mint into Cresses, Basill into Serpoile, and Turneps
into Radishes; in all which as Severinus conceiveth there may be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocall
seeds and Hermaphroditicall principles, which contain the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality
and power of different formes; thus in the seed of wheat there ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
obscurely the seminality of Darnell, although in a secondary or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
way, and at some distance of production; which neverthelesse
if it meet with convenient promotion, or a conflux and conspiration of
causes more powerfull then the other, it then beginneth to edifie in
chiefe, and contemning the superintendent forme, produceth the signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of its selfe.</p>
               <p>Now therefore although we deny not these severall mutations, and
doe allow that Hares may exchange their sex, yet this we conceive
doth come to passe but sometimes, and not in that vicissitude or annuall
alternation as is presumed; that is, from imperfection to perfection, from
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50218:84"/>
perfection to imperfection, from female unto male, from male to fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
againe, and so in a circle to both without a permansion in either;
for beside the inconceiveable mutation of temper, which should yearly
alternate the sex, this is injurious unto the order of nature, whose opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
doe rest in the perfection of their intents; which having once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
they maintaine their accomplished ends, and relapse not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
into their progressionall imperfections: so if in the minority of
naturall vigor, the parts of feminality take place, when upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
or growth thereof the masculine appeare, the first designe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is atchieved, and those parts are after maintained.</p>
               <p>But surely it much impeacheth this iterated transexion of Hares, if
that be true which Cardan and other Physitians affirm, that Transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sex is only so in opinion, and that these transfeminated persons
were really men at first, although succeeding yeares produced the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesto
or evidence of their virilities; which although intended and
formed, was not at first excluded, and that the examples hereof have
undergone no reall or new transexion, but were Androgynally borne,
and under some kind of Hermaphrodites: for though Galen do favour
the opinion, that the distinctive parts of sexes are onely different in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that is inversion or protrusion, yet will this hardly be made out
from the Anatomy of those parts, the testicles being so seated in the
female that they admit not of protrusion, and the necke of the matrix
wanting those parts which are discoverable in the organ of virility.</p>
               <p>The second and most received acception, is, that Hares are male and
female by conjunction of both sexes, and such are sound in mankinde,
Poetically called Hermaphrodites, supposed to be formed from the
equality, or <hi>non victorie</hi> of either seed, carrying about them the parts
of man and woman; although with great variety in perfection, site and
ability; not only as Aristotle conceived, with a constant impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in one; but as latter Observers affirme, sometimes with ability of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
venery: and therefore the providence of some Laws have thought
good, that at the yeares of maturity, they should elect one sex, and the
errors in the other should suffer a severer punishment; whereby endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to prevent incontinencie, they unawares enjoyned perpetuall
chastity; for being executive in both parts, and confined unto one, they
restrained a naturall power, and ordained a partiall virginity. Plato
and some of the Rabbines proceeded higher, who conceived the first
man an Hermaphrodite; and Marcus Leo the learned Jew, in some sense
hath allowed it, affirming that Adam in one suppositum without divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
contained both male and female; and therefore whereas it is said
in the Text, that God created man in his owne Image, in the Image of
God created he him, male and female created he them, applying the
singular and plurall unto Adam, it might denote that in one substance,
and in himselfe he included both sexes which was after divided, and

the female called Woman. The opinion of Aristotle extendeth far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from whose assertion all men should be Hermaphrodites; for
affirming that women do not spermatize, and conferre a place or recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
rather then essentiall principles of generation, he deductively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
both sexes in mankinde; for from the father proceed not only
males and females, but from him also must Hermaphroditicall and
masculo-feminine generations be derived, and a commixtion of both
sexes arise from the seed of one: But the Schoolmen have dealt with
that sex more hardly then any other, who though they have not much
disputed their generation, yet have they controverted their Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and raysed a query whether any at the last day should arise in the
sex of women, as may be observed in the supplement of Aquinas.</p>
               <p>Now as we must acknowledge this And<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ogynall condition in man,
so can we not deny the like doth happen in beasts. Thus doe we read in
Plinie that Neroes Chariot was drawne by foure Hermaphroditicall
Mares, and Cardan affirmes he also beheld one at Antwerpe; and thus
may we also concede, that Hares have been of both sexes, and some
have ocularly confirmed it; but that the whole species or kinde should
be bisexous we cannot affirme, who have found the parts of male and
female respectively distinct and single in any wherein we have enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and whereas it is conceived, that being an harmlesse animall and
delectable food unto man, nature hath made them with double sexes,
and that actively and passively performing they might more numerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encrease; we forget an higher providence of nature whereby shee
especially promotes the multiplication of Hares, which is by superfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
that is, a conception upon a conception, or an improvement of a
second fruit before the first be excluded, preventing hereby the usuall
intermission and vacant time of generation, which is very common and
frequently observable in Hares, mentioned long agoe by Aristotle,
Herodotus, and Pliny; and we have often observed that after the first
cast, there remaine successive conceptions, and other younglings very
immature, and far from their terme of exclusion.</p>
               <p>Nor need any man to question this in Hares, for the same wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
doth sometime happen in women; for although it be true that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conception, the inward orifice of the matrix exactly closeth, so that
it commonly admitteth nothing after; yet falleth it out sometime, that
in the act of coition, the avidity of that part dilateth it selfe, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
a second burden, which if it happen to be neare in time unto the
first, they commonly doe both proceed unto perfection, and have legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
exclusions, and periodically succeed each other: but if the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfetation
be made with considerable intermission, the latter most
commonly proves abortive; for the first being confirmed, engrosseth
the aliment from the other: However therefore the project of Julia
seem very plausible, and that way infallible when she received not her
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50218:85"/>
passengers, before she had taken in her lading, there was a fallibility
therein; nor indeed any absolute securitie in the policy of adultery after
conception; for the Matrix (which some have called another animall
within us, and which is not subjected unto the law of our will) after
reception of its proper Tenant, may yet receive a strange and spurious
inmate, as is confirmable by many examples in Plinie, by Larissaea in
Hippocrates, and that merry one in Plautus urged also by Aristotle,
that is of Iphicles and Hercules, the one begat by Jupiter, the other by
Amphitryon upon Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>maena; as also in those superconceptions where
one childe was like the father, the other like the adulterer, the one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
the servant, the other resembled the master.</p>
               <p>Now the grounds that begat, or much promoted the opinion of a
double sex in hares might bee some little bags or tumors, as first
glance representing stones or Testicles, to be found in both sexes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the parts of generation; which men observing in either sex, were
induced to beleeve a masculine sex in both; but to speak properly these
are no Testicles or parts officiall unto generation, but glandulous sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
that seeme to hold the nature of Emunctories; for herein may
be perceived slender perforations, at which may be expressed a blacke
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oeculent matter; if therefore from these we shall conceive a mixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sexes in Hares, with fairer reason we may conclude it in Bevers,
whereof both sexes containe a double bagge or tumor in the groine,
commonly called the Cod of Castor, as we have delivered before.</p>
               <p>Another ground were certaine holes or cavities observeable about
the siedge; which being perceived in males, made some conceive there
might be also a faeminine nature in them, and upon this very ground,
the same opinion hath passed upon the Hyaena, as is declared by Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,
and thus translated by Scaliger; <hi>Quod autem aiunt utrius<expan>
                        <am>

habere genitalia falsum est, quod videtur esse foemineum sub cauda, est si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile
sigur a foeminino verum pervinum non est;</hi> and thus is it also in Hares,
in whom these holes, although they seeme to make a deepe cavity, yet
doe they not perforate the skin, nor hold a community with any part
of generation, but were (as Plinie delivereth) esteemed the marks
of their age, the number of those decyding their number of yeares;
what verity there is herein, we shall not contend; for if in other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
there be authentick notations, if the characters of yeares be found
in the hornes of Cowes, or in the Antlers of Deere, if we conjecture
the age of Horses from joynts in their dockes, and undeniably presume
it from their teeth; we cannot affirme, there is in their conceit, any
affront unto nature, although, who ever enquireth shall finde no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
therein.</p>
               <p>The last foundation was Retromingency or pissing backward, for
men observing both sexes to urine backward, or aversly between their
legges, they might conceive there was a foeminine part in both;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50218:85"/>
wherein they are deceived by the ignorance of the just and proper site
of the Pizell or part designed unto the Excretion of urine, which in
the Hare holds not the common position, but is aversly seated, and in
its distention enclines unto the coccix or scut. Now from the nature
of this position, there ensueth a necessitie of Retrocopulation, which
also promoteth the conceit; for some observing them to couple with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ascension, have not beene able to judge of male or female, or to
determine the proper sex in either, and to speake generally this way
of copulation, is not appropriate unto Hares, nor is there one, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wayes of Coition, according to divers shapes and different confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
for some couple laterally or sidewise as wormes, some circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
or by complication as Serpents, some pronely, that is by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taction
of prone parts in both, as Apes, Porcupines, Hedgehogges, and
such as are termed Mollia, as the Cuttlefish and the Purple; some mixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that is, the male ascending the female, or by application of the
prone parts of the one, unto the postick parts of the other, as most Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupes;
Some aversely, as all Crustaceous animals, Lobsters, Shrimps,
and Crevises, and also Retromingents, as Panthers, Tigers, and Hares:
This is the constant Law of their Coition, this they observe and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
not: onely the vitiositie of man hath acted the varieties hereof;
nor content with a digression from sex or species, hath in his own kinde
runne thorow the Anomalies of venery, and been so bold, not onely to
act, but represent to view, the Irregular wayes of lust.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Molls.</head>
               <p>THat Molls are blinde and have no eyes, though a common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is received with much variety; some affirming onely they have
no sight, as Oppianus, the Proverbe Talpa Caecior, and the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Talpitas, which in Hesichius is made the same with Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as:
some that they have eyes, but no sight, as the text of Aristotle seems
to imply, some neither eyes nor sight, as Albertus, Plinie, and the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
opinion; some both eyes &amp; sight as Scaliger, Aldrovandus, &amp; some
others. Of which opinions the last with some restriction, is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
unto truth: for that they have eyes in their head is manifest unto
any, that wants them not in his own, and are discoverable, not onely in
old ones, but as we have observed in yong and naked conceptions, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the belly of the dam; and he that exactly enquires into the
cavitie of their cranies, may discover some propagation of nerves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
unto these parts; but that the humors together with their
coats are also distinct, (though Galen seeme to affirme it) transcendeth
our discovery; for separating these little Orbes, and including them in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50218:86"/>
magnifying glasses, wee discerned no more then Aristotle mentions,
that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is; <hi>humorem nigrum,</hi> nor any more if
they bee broken: that therefore they have eyes we must of necessitie
affirme, but that they be comparativly incomplete wee need not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie:
So Galen affirmes the parts of generation in women are imperfect,
in respect of those of men, as the eyes of Molls in regard of other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
So Aristotle termes them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which Gaza translates <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laesos,</hi>
and Scaliger by a word of Imperfection, <hi>inchoatos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as that they have eyes is manifest unto sense, so that they have
sight not incongruous unto reason, if wee call not in question the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of this provision, that is, to assigne the organs, and yet deny
the office, to grant them eyes and withold all manner of vision: for as
the inference is faire, affirmatively deduced from the action to the
organ, that they have eyes because they see, so is it also from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to the action, that they have eyes, therefore some sight designed;
if we take the intention of Nature in every species, and except the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
impediments, or morbosities in individuals; but as their eyes are
more imperfect then others, so do we conceive of their sight, or act of
vision; for they will runne against things, and hudling forwards fall
from high places; so that they are not blinde, nor yet distinctly see,
there is in them no cecity, yet more then a cecutiency; they have sight
enough to discerne the light, though not perhaps to distinguish of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
or colours; so are they not exactly blinde, for light is one object
of vision; and this (as Scaliger observeth) might be as full a sight as
Nature first intended; for living in darkenesse under the earth, they had
no further need of eyes then to avoid the light, and to be sensible when
ever they lost that darkenesse of earth, which was their naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement;
and therefore however Translators doe render the word of
Aristotle, or Galen, that is, <hi>imperfectos, oblaesos,</hi> or <hi>inchoatos,</hi> it is not
much considerable; for their eyes are sufficiently begun to finish this
action and competently perfect, for this imperfect Vision.</p>
               <p>And lastly, although they had neither eyes nor sight, yet could they
not be termed blinde; for blindenesse being a privative terme unto
sight, this appellation is not admittible in propriety of speech, and
will overthrow the doctrine of privations, which presuppose positive
formes or habits, and are not indefinite negations, denying in all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
but such alone wherein the positive habits are in their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and placed without repugnancy. So do we improperly say a Moll
is blinde, if we deny it the organs or a capacity of vision from its crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nature; so when the Text of John had said, that man was blinde
from his nativity, whose cecity our Saviour cured, it was not warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in Nonnus to say he had no eyes at all, as he describeth in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase,
and as some ancient Fathers affirme, that by this miracle they
were created in him; and so though the sence may be accepted, that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50218:86"/>
proverbe must be candidly interpreted which maketh fishes mute, and
call them silent which have no voyce in Nature.</p>
               <p>Now this conceit is erected upon a misapprehension or mistake in
the symptomes of vision, men confounding abolishment, diminution
and depravement, and naming that an abolition of sight, which indeed
is but an abatement. For if vision be abolished, it is called <hi>caecitas,</hi> or
blindnesse, if depraved and receive its objects erroneously, Hallucina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if dimished, <hi>hebetudo visus, caligati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a diminution or imperfect vision in the Moll, we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>irme an abolition
or totall privation, in stead of caligation or dimnesse, wee conclude a
cecity or blindnesse, which hath beene frequently committed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
other animals; so some affirme the water Rat is blinde, so Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicus
and Nicander do call the Mus-Aran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us the shrew or Ranny,
blinde; And because darkenesse was before light, the Aegyptians wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
the same: So are slow-Wormes accounted blinde, and the like
we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>irme proverbially of the Beetle, although their eyes be evident,
and they will flye against lights, like many other insects, and though
also Aristotle determines, that the eyes are apparent in all flying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects,
though other senses be obscure, and not perceptible at all; and if
from a diminution wee may inferre a totall privation, or affirme that
other animals are blinde which doe not acutely fee or comparatively
unto others, wee shall condemne unto blindenesse many not so estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
for such as have corneous or horney eyes, as Lobsters and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staceous
animals, are generally dim sighted, all insects that have <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennae,</hi>
or long hornes to feele out their way, as Butter-flies and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs,
or their fore legs so disposed, that they much advance before
their heads, as may be observed in Spiders; and if the Aegle were
judge, wee might be blinde our selves; the expression therefore of
Scripture in the story of Jacob is surely with circumspection, And it
came to passe when Jacob was old, and his eyes were dimme, <hi>quando
caligarunt oculi,</hi> saith Jerom and Tremellius, which are expressions of
diminution, and not of absolute privation.</p>

of divers cavities or holes on either side, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome call eyes
that carelesly behold them, and is not onely refutable by experience,
but also repugnant unto reason; for beside the monstrosity they fasten
unto Nature, in contriving many eyes, who hath made but two unto
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50218:87"/>
any animall, that is, one of each side, according to the division of the
braine, it were a superfluous and inartificiall act to place and settle so
many in one place; for the two extremes would sufficiently performe
the office of sight without the help of the intermediate eyes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
as much as all seven joyned together; for the visible base of the
object would be defined by these two, and the middle eyes although
they behold the same thing, yet could they not behold so much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
as these; so were it no advantage unto man to have a third eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
those two he hath already; and the fiction of Argus seemes
more reasonable then this; for though he had many eyes, yet were they
placed in circumference and positions of advantage.</p>
               <p>Againe, these cavities which men call eyes are seated out of the
head, and where the Gils of other fish are placed, containing no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of sight, nor having any communication with the braine; now all
sense proceeding from the braine, and that being placed (as Galen ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth)
in the upper part of the body, for the fitter situation of the
eyes, and conveniency required unto sight, it is not reasonable to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that they are any where else, or deserve that name which are sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in other parts; and therefore we relinquish as fabulous what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
of Sternopthalmi, or men with eyes in their breast; and when it
is said by Solomon, A wise mans eyes are in his head, it is to be taken
in second sence, and affordeth no objection: True it is that the eyes of
animals are seated with some difference, but all whatsoever in the head,
and that more forward then the eare or hole of hearing. In quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes,
in regard of the figure of their heads, they are placed at some
distance, in latirostrous and flat-bild birds they are more laterally sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and therefore when they looke intently they turne one eye upon
the object, and can convert their heads to see before and behinde, and
to behold two opposite points at once; but at a more easie distance are
they situated in man, and in the same circumference with the eare, for
if one foote of the compasse be placed upon the Crowne, a circle
described thereby will intersect, or passe over both the eares.</p>
               <p>The error in this conceit consists in the ignorance of these cavities,
and their proper use in nature; for this is a particular disposure of parts,
and a peculiar conformation whereby these holes and sluces supply the
defect of Gils, and are assisted by the conduit in the head; for like ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taceous
animals and Whales, the Lamprey hath a fistula spout or pipe
at the back part of the head, whereat they spirt out water: Nor is it
onely singular in this formation, but also in many other, as in defect
of bones, whereof it hath not one, and for the spine or back-bone, a
cartilagineous substance without any spondyles, processes, or protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
whatsoever; as also in the provision which Nature hath made
for the heart, which in this animall is very strangely secured, and lyes
immured in a cartilage or gristly substance; and lastly, in the colour
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50218:87"/>
of the liver, which is in the male of an excellent grasse greene, but of

               <p>THat Snayles have two eyes, and at the end of their hornes, beside
the assertion of the people, is the opinion of some learned men;
which notwithstanding Scaliger tearmes but imitation of eyes, which
Pliny contradicts, and Aristotle upon consequence denyes, when he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
that testaceous animals have no eyes at all; And for my owne
part after much inquiry, I am not satisfied that these are eyes, or that
those black and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ramentous spots which seeme to represent them are
any ocular reallities; for if any object be presented unto them, they
will sometime seeme to decline it, and sometime run against it; if also
these black extremities, or presumed eyes be clipped off, they will not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
make use of their protrusions or hornes, and poke out
their way as before: Againe, if they were eyes or instruments of visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they would have their originals in the head, and from thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
their motive and optick organs, but their roots and first extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are seated low upon the sides of the back, as may be perceived in
the whiter sort of Snayles when they retract them: And lastly, if wee
concede they have two eyes, wee must also grant, they have no lesse
then foure, for not onely the two greater extensions above have these
imitations of eyes, but also the two lesser below, as is evident unto any,
and if they be dextrously dissected, there will be found on either side
two black filaments or membranous strings which extend into the
long and shorter cornicle upon protrusion; and therefore if they have
two eyes, they have also foure, which will be monstrous, and beyond
the affirmation of any.</p>
               <p>Now the reason why we name these black strings eyes, is because
we know not what to call them else, and understand not the proper
use of that part, which indeed is very obscure, and not delivered by
any, but may probably be said to assist the protrusion, and retraction of
their hornes, which being a weake and hollow body, require some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
establishment, to confirme the length of their advancement,
which we observe they cannot extend without the concurrence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
for if with your finger you apprehend the top of the horne, and
draw out this black, and membranous emission, the horne will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
no more; but if you clip off the extremity, or onely sindge the
top thereof with <hi>Aqua f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rtis,</hi> or other corrosive water, leaving a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
part behinde, they will neverthelesse exclude their hornes,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50218:88"/>
and therewith explorate their way as before; and indeed the exact
sense of these extremities is very remarkable; for if you dip a pen in
<hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> oyle of vitriol, or Turpentine, and present it towards
these points, they will at a reasonable distance, decline the acrimony
thereof, retyring or distorting them to avoid it; and this they will
nimbly performe if objected to the extremes, but slowly or not at all,
if approached unto their rootes.</p>
               <p>What hath beene therefore delivered concerning the plurality, pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
or anomalous situation of eyes, is either monstrous, fabulous, or
under things never seene includes good sense or meaning: and so may
we receive the figment of Argus, who was an Hieroglyphick of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
in those centuries of eyes expressing the stars; and their alternate
wakings, the vicissitude of day and night; which strictly taken cannot
be admitted, for the subject of sleep is not the eye, but the common
sense, which once asleep, all eyes must be at rest: And therefore what
is delivered as an Embleme of vigilancy, that the Hare and Lion doe
sleep with one eye open, doth not evince they are any more awake then
if they were both closed; for the open eye beholds in sleepe no more
then that which is closed, and no more one eye in them then two in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
animals that sleep with both open, as some by disease, and others
naturally which have no eye lids at all.</p>
               <p>As for Polyphemus although his story be fabulous, the monstrosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is not impossible; for the act of Vision may be performed with one
eye, and in the deception and fallacy of sight, hath this advantage of
two, that it beholds not objects double, or sees two things for one;
for this doth happen when the axis of the visive coves, diffused from
the object, fall not upon the same plane, but that which is conveyed
into one eye, is more depressed or elevated then that which enters the
other. So if beholding a candle we protrude either upward or downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the pupill of one eye, the object will appeare double; but if wee
shut the other eye, and behold it but with one, it will then appeare but
single, and if we abduce the eye unto either corner, the object will not
duplicate, for in that position the axes of the coves remaine in the same
plane, as is demonstrated in the opticks, and delivered by Galen, in his
tenth <hi>De usa partium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Relations also there are of men that could make themselves invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which belongs not to this discourse, but may serve as notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of wise and prudent men, who so contrive their affaires, that
although their actions be manifest, their designes are not discoverable:
in this acception there is nothing left of doubt, and Giges ring remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
still among us; for vulgar eyes behold no more of wise men then
doth the Sun, they may discover their exteriour and outward wayes,
but their interiour and inward pieces he onely sees, that sees beyond
their beings.</p>

               <p>COncerning the Chameleon there generally passeth an opinion
that it liveth onely upon ayre, and is sustained by no other ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Thus much is in plaine termes affirmed by Solinus, Pliny, and
divers other, and by this periphrasis is the same described by Ovid;
All which notwithstanding upon enquiry, I finde the assertion mainly
controvertible, and very much to faile in the three inducements of
beliefe.</p>
               <p>And first for its verity, although asserted by some, and traditionally
delivered by others, yet is it very questionable. For beside Aelian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
is seldome defective in these accounts; Aristotle distinctly treating
hereof, hath made no mention of this remarkeable propriety; which
either suspecting its verity, or presuming its falsity hee surely omitted;
for that he remained ignorant of this account it is not easily concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
it being the common opinion, and generally received by all men:
Some have positively denyed it, as <hi>Augustinus, Niphus, Stobaeus, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lechampius,
Fortunius, L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cetus,</hi> with many more; others have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
refuted it, as namely <hi>Iohannes Landius,</hi> who in the relation of
Scaliger, observed a Chameleon to lick up a flye from his breast; But
<hi>Bellonius</hi> hath beene more satisfactorily experimentall, not onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
they feede on Flyes, Caterpillers, Beetles, and other insects,
but upon exenteration he found these animals in their bellies; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we have not had the advantage of our owne observation, yet
have we received the like confirmation from many ocular spectators.</p>
               <p>As touching the verisimility or probable truth of this relation, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
reasons there are which seeme to overthrow it; For first, there are
found in this animall, the guts, the stomack, and other parts officiall
unto nutrition, which were its aliment the empty reception of ayre,
their provisions had beene superfluous; Now the wisdome of Nature
abhorring super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>luities, and effecting nothing in vaine, unto the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these operations, respectively contriveth the organs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
where we finde such Instruments, wee may with strictnesse expect
their actions, and where we discover them not, wee may with saf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty
conclude the non-intention of their operations: So when we observe
that oviperous animals, as Lizards, Frogs, Birds, and most Fishes
have neither bladder nor kidnies, we may with reason inferre they do
not urine at all: But whereas in this same kinde we discover these parts
in the Tortoys beyond any other, wee cannot deny he exerciseth that
excretion; Nor was there any absurdity in Pliny, when for medicinall
uses he commended the urine of a Tortoise: so when we perceive that
Bats have teats, it is not unreasonable to infer they suckle their young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50218:89"/>
with milke; but whereas no other flying animall hath these parts,
we cannot from them expect a viviparous exclusion, but either a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of egges, or some vermiparous separation, whose navell is
within it selfe at first, and its nutrition after not inwardly dependent of
its originall.</p>
               <p>Againe, nature is so farre from leaving any one part without its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
action, that she oft-times imposeth two or three labours upon one;
so the pizell in animals is both officiall unto urine and to generation,
but the first and primary use is generation; for many creatures enjoy
that part which urine not, as fishes, birds, and quadrupeds oviparous;
but not on the contrary, for the secondary action subsisteth not alone,
but in concommitancie with the other; so the nostrills are usefull both
for respiration and smelling, but the principall use is smelling; for many
have nostrills which have no lungs, as fishes, but none have lungs or
respiration, which have not some shew, or some analogy of nostrills:
And thus we perceive the providence of nature, that is the wisdome of
God, which disposeth of no part in vaine, and some parts unto two or
three uses, will not provide any without the execution of its proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
nor where there is no digestion to be made, make any parts inservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to that intention.</p>
               <p>Beside the teeth, the tongue of this animall is a second argument to
overthrow this ayrie nutrication, and that not only in its proper nature,
but also in its peculiar figure; for indeed of this part properly taken
there are two ends; that is, the formation of the voice, and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of taste; for the voice, it can have no office in Camelions, for they
are mute animals, as, beside fishes, are most other sort of Lizards: As
for their taste, if their nutriment be ayre, neither can it be an instrument
thereof; for the body of that element is ingustible, void of all sapidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and without any action of the tongue, is by the rough artery or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
conducted into the lungs: and therefore Plini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> much forgets the
strictnesse of his assertion, when he alloweth excrements unto that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall,
that feedeth only upon ayre, which notwithstanding with the
urine of an Asse, hee commends as a magicall medicine upon our
enemies.</p>
               <p>The figure of the tongue seems also to overthrow the presumption
of this aliment, which according to the exact delineation of Aldrovand,
is in this animall peculiar, and seemeth contrived for prey; for in so
little a creature it is at the least halfe a palme long, and being it self ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
slow of motion, hath in this part a very great agility; withall its food
being slyes and such as suddenly escape, it hath in the tongue a spongy
and mucous extremity, whereby upon a sudden emission, it inviscates
and tangleth those insects: And therefore some have thought its name
not unsutable unto its nature; the nomination is Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is
a little Lion, not so much for the resemblance of shape, but affinity of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50218:89"/>
condition, that is for the vigilancy in its prey and sudden rapacity
thereof, which it performeth not like the Lion with its teeth, but a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and unexpected ejaculation of the tongue. This exposition is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by some, especially the old glosse upon Leviticus, whereby in
the Translation of Jerome and the Septuagint, this animall is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
what ever it be, it seems more reasonable then that of Isidore, who
derives this name, a <hi>Camelo &amp; Leone,</hi> as presuming herein some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
with a Camell; for this derivation offendeth the rules of Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology,
wherein indeed the notation of names should be Orthogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall,
not exchanging dipthongs for vowells, or converting conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
into each other.</p>
               <p>As for the possibility hereof, it is not also unquestionable, and many
wise men are of opinion, the bodies of animalls cannot receive a proper
aliment from ayre: for beside that taste being (as Aristotle termes it)
a kinde of touch, it is required the aliment should be tangible, and fall
under the palpable affections of touch; beside also that there is some
sapor in all aliments, as being to be distinguished and judged by the
guste, which cannot be admitted in ayre; Beside these, I say, if wee
consider the nature of aliment, and the proper use of ayre in respiration,
it will very hardly fall under the name hereof, or properly attaine the
act of nutrication.</p>
               <p>And first concerning its nature, to make a perfect nutrition into the
body nourished, there is required a transmutation of the nutriment; now
where this conversion or aggeneration is made, there is also required
in the aliment a familiarity of matter, and such a community or vicinity
unto a living nature, as by one act of the soule may be converted into
the body of the living, and enjoy one common soule; which indeed
cannot be effected by the ayre, it concurring only with our flesh in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
principles, which are at the largest distance from life, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
also unto inanimated constitutions; and therefore when it is said
by Fernelius, and asserted by divers others, that we are only nourished
by living bodies, and such as are some way proceeding from them,
that is the fruits, effects, parts, or seeds thereof, they have laid out an
object very agreeable unto assimulation; for these indeed are sit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a quick and immediate conversion, as holding some community
with our selves, and containing approximate disposition unto ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>Secondly (as is argued by Aristotle against the Pythagoreans)
whatsoever properly nourisheth, before its assimulation, by the action
of naturall heat it receiveth a compulency or incrassation progressionall
unto its conversion; which notwithstanding it cannot be effected upon
the ayre, for the action of heat doth not condense but rarifie that
body, and by attenuation, rather then for nutrition, disposeth it for
expulsion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:50218:90"/>
Thirdly (which is the argument of Hippocrates) all aliment received
into the body, must be therein a considerable space retained, and not
immediatly expelled: now ayre but momentally remaining in our
bodies, it hath no proportionable space for its conversion, that being
only of length enough to refrigerate the heart, which having once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
lest being it selfe heated againe, it should suffocate that part,
it maketh no stay, but hasteth backe the same way it passed in.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the proper use of ayre attracted by the lungs, and without
which there is no durable continuation in life, is not the nutrition of
parts, but the contemperation of that fervour in the heart, and the ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tilation
of that fire alwayes maintained in the forge of life; whereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in some manner it concurreth unto nutrition, yet can it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the proper name of nutriment; and therefore by Uippocrites <hi>de
alimento,</hi> it is tetmed <hi>Alimentum non Alimentum,</hi> a nourishment and no
nourishment; that is in a large acception, but not in propriety of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
conserving the body, not nourishing the same, not repairing it by
assimulation, but preserving it by ventilation; for thereby the naturall
flame is preserved from extinction, and so the individuum sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in some way like nutrition: And so when it is said by the same
Author, <hi>Pulmo contrarium corpori alimentum trahit, reliqua omnia idem,</hi>
it is not to be taken in a strict and proper sense, but the quality in the
one, the substance is meant in the other; for ayre in regard of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
heat is cold, and in that quality contrary unto it, but what is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aliment, of what quality soever, is potentially the same, and in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
identity unto it.</p>
               <p>And although the ayre attracted may be conceived to nourish that
invisible flame of life, in as much as common and culinary flames are
nourished by the ayre about them; I confesse wee doubt the common
conceit, which affirmeth that aire is the pabulous supply of fire, much
lesse that flame is properly aire kindled: And the same before us, hath
been denyed by the Lord of Verulam, in his Tract of life and death, &amp;
also by Dr. Jorden in his book of Minerall waters: For that which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
maintaineth the fire, is the combustible matter in the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
body, and not the ambient ayre, which affordeth exhalation to its
fuliginous atomes, nor that which causeth the flame properly to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ayre, but rather as he expresseth it, the accention of fuliginous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations,
which containe an unctuosity in them, and arise from the
matter of fuell; which opinion is very probable, and will salve many
doubts, whereof the common conceit affordeth no solution.</p>
               <p>As first, how fire is stricke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of flints, that is not by kindling the aire
from the collision of two hard bodies; for then Diamonds and glasse
should doe the like as well as slint, but rather from the sulphur and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamable
effluviums contained in them. The like saith Jorden we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in canes and woods, that are unctuous and full of oyle, which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50218:90"/>
will yeeld <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ire by frication, or collision, not by kindling the ayre about
them, but the inflamable oyle with them: why the fire goes out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ayre? that is because the fuligenous exhalations wanting evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
recoyle upon the flame and choake it, as is evident in cupping glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and the artifice of charcoals, where if the ayre be altogether exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

burned many hundred yeares, as that discovered in the sepulchre of
Tullia the sister of Cicero, and that of Olibius many yeares after,
neare Padua; because what ever was their matter, either a preparation
gold, or Naptha, the duration proceeded from the puritie of their
oyle which yeelded no fuligenous exhalations to suffocate the fire; For
if ayre had nourished the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lame, it had not continued many minutes, for
it would have been spent and wasted by the fire: Why a piece of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

further, then indeed it is visible, being at some distance from the

self: why mettals in their Equation, although they intensly heat the

               <p>Lastly, the Element of aire is so far from nourishing the bodie, that
some have questioned the power of water; many conceiving it enters
not the body in the power of aliment, or that from thence, there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
a substantiall supply: For beside that some creatures drinke not
at all, unto others it performs the common office of ayre, and se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ving
for refrigeration, dilution of solid aliment, and its elixation in the sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>macke,
which from thence as a vehicle it conveighs through lesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible
cavities into the liver, from thence into the veines, and so in a

                  </gap>oride substance through the capillarie cavities into every part; which
having performed, it is afterward excluded by urine, sweat and serous
separations. And this opinion surely possessed the Ancients, for when
they so highly commended that water which is suddenly hot and cold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:50218:91"/>
which is without all favour, the lightest, the thinnest, and which will
soonest boile Beanes or Pease, they had no consideration of nutrition;
whereunto had they had respect, they would have surely commended
grosse and turbid streames, in whose confusion at the last, there might
be contained some nutriment; and not jejune or limpid water, and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the simplicity of its Element.</p>
               <p>All which considered, severer heads will be apt enough to conceive
the opinion of this animal, not much unlike unto that of the Astomi, or
men without mouthes in Pliny, sutable unto the relation of the Mares
in Spaine, and their subventaneous conceptions, from the westerne
winde; and in some way more unreasonable then the figment of Rabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
the famous horse in Ariosto, which being conceived by flame, and
wind never tasted grasse, or fed on any grosser provender then ayre; for
this way of nutrition was answerable unto the principles of his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which being not ayrie, but grosse and seminall in the Chameleon,
unto its conservation there is required a solid pasture, and a food con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
unto the principles of its nature.</p>
               <p>The grounds of this opinion are many, The first observed by Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus,
was the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lation or swelling of the body made in this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
upon inspiration or drawing in its breath, which people observing,
have thought it to feed upon ayre. But this effect is rather occasioned
upon the greatnes of its lungs, which in this animal are very large, and
by their backward situation, afford a more observable dilatation, and
though their lungs bee lesse, the like inflation is also observable in
Toads.</p>
               <p>A second is the continuall hiation or holding open its mouth, which
men observing conceive the intention thereof to receive the aliment of
ayre; but this is also occasioned by the greatnes of its lungs, for repleti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof not having a sufficient or ready supply by its nostrils, it is
enforced to dilate and hold open the jawes.</p>
               <p>The third is the paucitie of blood observed in this animal, scarce at
all to be found but in the eye, and about the heart; which defect being
observed, inclined some into thoughts, that the ayre was a sufficient
maintenance for these exauguious parts. But this defect or rather
paucity of blood, is also agreeable unto many other animals, whose
solid nutriment wee doe not controvert, as may bee observed in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sorts of Lizards, in Frogges, and divers Fishes, and therefore an
Horse-leech will hardly be made to fasten upon a fish, and wee doe not
read of much blood that was drawn from Frogges by Mice in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
battaile of Homer.</p>
               <p>The last and most common ground which begat or promoted this
opinion, is the long continuation hereof without any visible food,
which some precipitously observing, conclude they eate not any at all.
It cannot be denyed it is (if not the most of any) a very abstemious
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50218:91"/>
animall, and such as by reason of its frigidity, paucity of blood, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the winter, (about which time the observations are often
made) will long subsist without a visible sustentation: But a like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
may bee also observed in many other animals, for Lizards and
Leeches, as we have made triall, will live some months without suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and wee have included Snailes in glasses all winter, which have
returned to feed againe in the spring: Now these notwithstanding, are
not conceived to passe all their lives without food; for so to argue is
fallacious, that is, <hi>A minori ad majus, A dicto secundum quid ad dictum
simpliciter,</hi> and is moreover sufficiently convicted by experience, and
therefore probably other relations are of the same verity, which are of
the like affinity, as is the conceit of the Rhin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To assigne a reason of this abstinence in animals, or declare how
without a supply there ensueth no destructive exhaustion, exceedeth
the limits of my intention, and intention of my discourse. Fortunius
Licetus in his excellent Tract, <hi>De his qui diu vivunt sine alimento,</hi>
hath very ingeniously attempted it, deducing the cause hereof from an
equall conformity of naturall heat and moisture, at least no considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
exuperancy in either; which concurring in an unactive proportion,
the naturall heat consumeth not the moisture (whereby ensueth no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustion)
and the condition of naturall moisture is able to resist the
slender action of heat, (whereby it needeth no reparation) and this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
in Snakes, Lizards, Snails, and divers other insects latitant many
moneths in the yeare; which being cold creatures, containing a weak

               <p>THe common opinion of the Oestridge, Struthiocamelus, or Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-Camell conceives that it digesteth Iron; and this is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the affirmations of many; beside swarmes of others, Rhodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
in his prelections taketh it for granted, Johannes Langius in his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50218:92"/>
Epistles pleadeth experiment for it, the common picture also confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it which usually describeth this animall, with an horshooe in its
mouth; notwithstanding upon enquiry we finde it very questionable,
and the negative seemes most reasonably entertained; whose verity
indeed wee doe the rather desire, because hereby wee shall relieve our
ignorance of one occult quality; for in the list thereof it is accounted,
and in that notion imperiously obtruded upon us: For my owne part,
although I have had the sight of this animall, I have not had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of its experiment, but have received great occasions of doubt,
from learned discoursers thereon.</p>
               <p>For Aristotle and Oppianus who have particularly treated hereof
are silent in this singularity, either omitting it as dubious, or as the
Comment saith, rejecting it as fabulous; Pliny speaketh generally,
affirming onely, the digestion is wonderfull in this animall; Aelian
delivereth, that it digesteth stones, without any mention of Iron; Leo
Africanus, who lived in those Countries wherein they most abound,
speaketh diminutively, and but halfe way into this assertion, <hi>Surdum ac
simplex animal est, quicquid invenit, absque delectu, usque ad ferrum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorat:</hi>
Fernelius in his second booke <hi>De abditis rerum causis,</hi> extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
it, and Riolanus in his Comment thereof positively denyes it:
Some have experimentally refuted it, as <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> and most
plainly of all other <hi>Vlysses Aldrovandus,</hi> whose words are these, <hi>Ego
ferri frusta devorare, dum Tridenti essem, observavi, sede quae in cocta
rursus excerneret,</hi> that is, at my being at Trent, I observed the Oestridge
to swallow Iron, but yet to exclude it undigested againe.</p>
               <p>Now beside experiment, it is in vaine to attempt against it by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall
argument, it being an occult quality, which contemnes the
law of Reason, and defends it selfe by admitting no reason at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As
for its possibility, we shall not at present dispute, nor will we affirme
that Iron ingested, receiveth in the stomack of the Oestridge no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whatsoever; but if any such there be, we suspect this effect rather
from some way of corrosion, then any of digestion; not any liquid
reduction or tendance to chilification by the power of naturall heate,
but rather some attrition from an acide and vitriolous humidity in the
stomack, which may absterse, and shave the scorious parts thereof; so
rusty Iron crammed downe the throate of a Cock, will become terse
and cleare againe in its gizard: So the Counter, which according to
the relation of <hi>Amatus,</hi> remained a whole yeare in the body of a youth,
and came out much consumed at last; might suffer this diminution,
rather from sharpe and acide humours, then the strength of naturall
heate, as he supposeth. So silver swallowed and retained some time in
the body will turne black, as if it had beene dipped in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or
some corrosive water; but Lead will remaine unaltered, for that mettall
containeth in it a sweet salt and manifest sugar, whereby it resisteth
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50218:92"/>
ordinary corrosion, and will not easily dissolve even in <hi>Aqua fortis:</hi> So
when for medicall uses, wee take downe the filings of Iron or steele<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we must not conceive it passeth unaltered from us; for though the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
parts be excluded againe, yet are the volatile and dissoluble parts
extracted, whereby it becomes effectuall in deopilations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for speedier operation we make extinctions, infusions, and the like,
whereby we extract the salt and active parts of the medicine, which
being in solution, more easily enter the veynes. And this is that the
Chymists mainely drive at in the attempt of their <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> that
is, to reduce that indigestible substance into such a forme as may not
be ejected by seidge, but enter the cavities, and lesse accessible parts of
the body, without corrosion.</p>
               <p>The ground of this conceit is its swallowing downe fragments of
Iron, which men observing, by a forward illation, have therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it digesteth them; which is an inference not to be admitted, as
being a fallacy of the consequent, that is, concluding a position of the
consequent, from the position of the antecedent: For many things are
swallowed by animals, rather for condiment, gust, or medicament,
then any substantiall nutriment. So Poultrey, and especially the
Turkey, do of themselves take downe stones, and wee have found at
one time in the gizard of a Turkey no lesse then seven hundred: Now
these rather concurre unto digestion, then are themselves digested, for
we have found them also in the guts, and excrements, but their discent
is very slow, for we have given them in paste, stones and final pieces of
Iron, which eighteene dayes after we have found remaining in the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard;
and therefore the experiment of Langius and others might bee
mistaken, whilst after the taking they expected it should come downe
within a day or two after: Thus also we swallow cherry-stones, but
void them unconcocted, and we usually say they preserve us from sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,
for being hard bodies they conceive a strong and durable heate
in the stomack, and so prevent the crudities of their fruit; And upon
the like reason do culinary operators observe that flesh boyles best,
when the bones are boyled with it: Thus dogs will eate grasse, which
they digest not: Thus Camels to make the water sapide do raise the
mud with their feet: thus horses will knabble at walls, Pigeons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in salt stones, Rats will gnaw Iron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and Aristotle saith the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
swalloweth stones; and thus may also the Oestridge swallow
Iron, not as his proper aliment, but for the ends above expressed, and
even as we observe the like in other animals.</p>
               <p>What effect therefore may bee expected from the stomack of an
Oestridge by application alone to further digestion in ours, beside the
experimentall refute of Galen, wee referre it unto the considerations
above alledged; or whether there be any more credit to be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the medicine of Aelian, who affirmes the stones they swallow have
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50218:93"/>
a peculiar vertue for the eyes, then that of Hermolaus and Pliny
drawne from the urine of this animall, let them determine who can
swallow so strange a transmission of qualities, or beleeve that any Bird

               <head type="sub">Of Vnicornes hornes.</head>
               <p>GReat account and much profit is made of Unicornes horne, at least
of that which beareth the name thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein notwithstanding,
many I perceive suspect an Imposture, and some conceive there is no
such animall extant: herein therefore to draw up our determinations,
beside the severall places of Scripture mentioning this animall (which
some perhaps may contend to be onely meant of the Rhinoceros) wee
are so farre from denying there is any Unicorne at all, that wee affirme
there are many kinds thereof, in the number of Quadrupedes, wee will
concede no lesse then five; that is, the Indian Oxe, the Indian Asse,
the Rhinoceros, the Oryx, and that which is more eminen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly termed
<hi>Monoceros,</hi> or <hi>Vnicornis:</hi> Some in the list of fishes, as that described
by Olaus, Albertus, and many other: and some Unicornes wee will
allow even among insects, as those foure kinds of nasicornous Beetles
described by Muffetus.</p>
               <p>Secondly, although we concede there by many Unicornes, yet are
we still to seeke; for whereunto to affixe this horne in question, or to
determine from which thereof we receive this magnified medicine, we
have no assurance, or any satisfactory decision: for although we single
out one,<note place="margin">More especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</note> and Antonomastically thereto assigne the name of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne,
yet can we not be secure what creature is meant thereby, what
constant shape it holdeth, or in what number to be received: For as
far as our endeavours discover, this animall is not uniformely descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
but differently set forth by those that undertake it: Pliny affirmeth
it is a fierce and terrible creature, <hi>Vartomannus</hi> a tame and mansuete
animall: those which <hi>Garcias ab Horto</hi> described about the cape of
good hope, were beheld with heads like horses; those which Varto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus
beheld, he described with the head of a Deere; Pliny, Aelian
Solinus, and after these from ocular assurance <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> affirmeth
the feet of the Unicorne are undivided, and like the Elephants: But
those two which Vartomannus beheld at Mecha, were as he descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
footed like a Goate: As Aelian describeth, it is in the bignesse of
an horse, as Vartomannus of a Colt, That which Thevet speaketh of
was not so big as an Heifer; But <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> affirmeth, they are but
little lesse then Elephants; which are discriminations very materiall,
and plainly declare, that under the same name Authors describe not the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50218:93"/>
same animall: So that the Unicornes horne of the one, is not that of
another, although we proclaime an equall vertue in either.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, although we were agreed what animall this was, or differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not in its description, yet would this also afford but little satisfaction,
for the horne we commonly extoll, is not the same with that of the
Ancients; For that in the description of Aelian and Pliny was blacke,
this which is shewed amongst us is commonly white, none black; and
of those five which Scaliger beheld, though one spadiceous, or of a
light red, and two inclining to red, yet was there not any of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
among them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what hornes soever they be which passe amongst us, they
are not surely the hornes of any one kinde of animall, but must proceed
from severall sorts of Unicornes; for some are wreathed, some not:
That famous one which is preserved at S. Dennis neere Paris, hath aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractuous
spires, and chocleary turnings about it, which agreeth with
the description of the Unicornes horne in Aelian; Those two in the
treasure of S. Mark are plaine, and best accord with those of the Indian
Asse, or the descriptions of other Unicornes: <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
one ten foote long, and at the base about thirteene inches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe;
And that of Antwerpe which <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> describeth, is
not much inferiour unto it; which best agree unto the descriptions of
the Sea-Unicornes, for these, as Olaus affirmeth, are of that strength
and bignesse, as able to penetrate the ribs of ships; the same is more
probable, in that it was brought from Island, from whence, as <hi>Becan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi>
affirmeth, three other were brought in his dayes; And we have heard
of some which have beene found by the sea side, and brought unto us
from America: So that while we commend the Unicornes horne, and
conceive it peculiar but unto one animall, under apprehension of the
same virtue, wee use very many, and commend that effect from all,
which every one confineth unto some one, hee hath either seene or
described.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, although there be many Unicornes, and consequently
many hornes, yet many there are which beare that name, and currant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passe among us, which are no hornes at all; and such are those frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and pieces of <hi>Lapis Ceratites,</hi> commonly termed <hi>Cornufossile,</hi>
whereof <hi>Boetius</hi> had no lesse then twenty severall sorts presented him
for Unicorns horn: hereof in subterraneous cavities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; under the earth
there are many to be found in severall parts of Germany, which are
but the Lapidescencies, and petrifactive mutations of hard bodies,
sometime of horne, of teeth, of bones, and branches of trees, whereof
there are some so imperfectly converted, as to retaine the odor and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of their originals, as he relateth of pieces of Ashe and Wallnut.
Againe, in most if not all which passe amongst us, and are extolled for
precious hornes, wee discover not one affection common unto other
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50218:94"/>
hornes, that is, they mollifie not with fire, they soften not upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
or infusion, nor will they afford a jelly, or muccilaginous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
in either; which notwithstanding wee may effect in Goates
hornes, Sheepes, Cows, and Harts horne, in the horne of the Rhino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceros,
the horne of the Pristis or Sword-fish. Briefly that which is
commonly received, and whereof there be so many fragments preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in England, is not onely no horne, but a substance harder then a
bone, that is, the tooth of a Morse or Sea-horse, in the midst of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lider
part containing a curdled graine, which is not to be found in Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
this in Northerne regions is of frequent use for hafts of knives, or
hilts of swords, and being burnt becomes a good remedy for fluxes:
but antidotically used, and exposed for Unicornes horne, it is an insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
delusion, and with more veniable deceit, it might have beene
practised in Harts horne.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, although we were satisfied we had the Unicornes horne, yet
were it no injury unto reason to question the efficacy thereof, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
those virtues which are pretended do properly belong unto it; for
what we observe (and it escaped not the observation of <hi>Paulus Iovius</hi>
many years past) none of the Ancients ascribed any medicinall or anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotall
virtue unto the Unicornes horne; and that which Aelian extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
who was the first and onely man of the Ancients who spake of the
medicall virtue of any Unicorne, was the horne of the Indian Asse,
whereof, saith he, the Princes of those parts make boales and drinke
therein, as preservatives against poyson, Convulsions, and the Falling-sicknesse;
Now the description of that horne is not agreeable unto
that we commend; for that (saith he) is red above, white b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>low, and
black in the middle, which is very different from ours, or any to bee
seene amongst us; And thus, though the description of the Unicorne
be very ancient, yet was there of old no virtue ascribed unto it, and
although this amongst us receive the opinion of the same virtue, yet is
it not the same horne whereunto the Ancients ascribed it.</p>
               <p>Lastly, although we allow it an Antidotall efficacy, and such as the
Ancients commended, yet are there some virtues ascribed thereto by
Modernes not easily to be received; and it hath surely falne out in this
as other magnified medicines, whose operations effectuall in some
diseases, are presently extended unto all: That some antidotall quality
it may have wee have no reason to deny; for since Elkes hoofes and
hornes are magnified for Epilepsies, since not onely the bone in the
heart, but the horne of a Deere is Alexipharmacall, and ingredient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the confection of Hyacinth, and the Electuary of Maximilian, wee
cannot without prejudice except against the efficacy of this: But when
we affirme it is not onely Antidotall to proper venomes, and substances
destructive by qualities, we cannot expresse; but that it resisteth also
Sublimate, Arsenick, and poysons which kill by second qualities, that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50218:94"/>
is, by corrosion of parts, I doubt we exceed the properties of its nature,
and the promises of experiment will not secure the adventure: And
therefore in such extremities, whether there be not more probable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
from fat and oylie substances, which are the open tyrants of salt
and corrosive bodies, then precious and cordiall medicines which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
by secret and disputable proprieties; or whether he that swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Lime, and dranke downe Mercury water, did not more reasonably
place his cure in milke, butter, or oyle, then if he had recurred unto
Pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le and Bezoar, common reason at all times, and necessity in the
like case would easily determine.</p>
               <p>Since therefore there be many Unicornes, since that whereto wee
appropriate a horne is so variously described, that it seemeth either
never to have beene seene by two persons, or not to have beene one
animall; Since though they agreed in the description of the animall,
yet is not the horne wee extoll the same with that of the Ancients;
Since what hornes soever they be that passe among us, they are not the
hornes of one but severall animals: Since many in common use and
high esteeme are no hornes at all: Since if they were true hornes, yet
might their vertues be questioned: Since though we allowed some vir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tues,
yet were not others to be received, with what security a man may
rely on this remedy, the mistresse of fooles hath already instructed
some, and to wisdome (which is never too wise to learne) it is not too
late to consider.</p>

               <p>THat all Animals of the Land, are in their kinde in the Sea, although
received as a principle, is a tenent very questionable, and will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of restraint; for some in the Sea are not to be matcht by any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
at Land, and hold those shapes which terrestrious formes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
not; as may be observed in the Moone fish, or Orthragoriscus,
the severall sorts of Raia's, Torpedo's, Oysters, and many more; and
some there are in the Land which were never maintained to be in the
Sea, as Panthers, Hyaena's, Camels, Sheep, Molls, and others which
carry no name in Icthyologie, nor are to be found in the exact descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of Rondeletius, Gesner, or Aldrovandus.</p>
               <p>Againe, though many there be which make out their nominations,
as the Hedg-hog, Sea-serpents, and others; yet are there also very
many that beare the name of animals at Land, which hold no resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
in corporall configuration; in which account we compute <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecula,
Canis, Rana, Passer, Cuculus, Asellus, Turdus, Lepus, &amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
while some are called the Fox, the Dog, the Sparrow, or Frog-fish,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50218:95"/>
and are knowne by common names with those at land; as their descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
attest, they receive not these appellations, as we conceive, from a
totall similitude in figure, but any concurrence in common accidents,
in colour, condition, or single conformation: as for Sea-horses which
much confirme this assertion, in their common descriptions, they are
but Crotesco deliniations which fill up empty spaces in Maps, and
meere pictoriall inventions, not any Physicall shapes: sutable unto
those which (as Plinie delivereth) Praxiteles long agoe set out in the
Temple of Domitius: for that which is commonly called a Sea-horse
is properly called a Morse, and makes not out that shape: That which
the Ancients named Hippocampus is a little animall about six inches
long, and not preferred beyond the classis of Insects: that they tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Hippopotamus an amphibious animall, about the River Nile, so
little resembleth an horse, that as Mathiolus observeth in all, except the
seet, it better makes out a swine: that which they tearmed a Lion, was
but a kinde of Lobster: and that they called the Beare, was but one
kinde of Crab, and that which they named Bos marinus, was not as we
conceive a fish resembling an Oxe, but a Skaite or Thornbacke, so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from its bignesse, expressed by the Greek word <hi>Bous,</hi> which is a
prefixe of augmentation to many words in that language.</p>
               <p>And therefore although it be not denied that some in the water doe
carry a justifiable resemblance to some at the Land, yet are the major
part which beare their names unlike; nor doe they otherwise resemble
the creatures on earth, then they on earth the constellations which
passe under animall names in heaven: nor the Dog-fish at sea much
more make out the Dog of the land, then that his cognominall or
name-sake in the heavens. Now if from a similitude in some, it bee
reasonable to infer a correspondency in all, we may draw this analogie
of animalls upon plants; for vegetables there are which carry a neare
and allowable similitude unto animals, as we elsewhere declare: wee
might also presume to conclude that animall shapes were generally
made out in mineralls: for severall stones there are that beare their
names in relation to animals parts, as Lapis anguinus, Conchites, Echi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
Eucephalites, Aegopthalmus, and many more, as will appeare in
the writers of Mineralls, and especially in Boetius.</p>
               <p>Moreover if we concede, that the animalls of one Element, might
beare the names of those in the other, yet in strict reason the watery
productions should have the prenomination: and they of the land ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
derive their names, then nominate those of the sea: for the watery
plantations were first existent, and as they enjoyed a priority in forme,
had also in nature precedent denominations: but falling not under that
nomenclature of Adam, which unto terrestrious animalls assigned a
name appropriate unto their natures, from succeeding spectators they
received arbitrary appellations, and were respectively denominated
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50218:95"/>
unto creatures knowne at land, which in themselves had independent
names, and not to bee called after them, which were created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, by this assertion wee restraine the hand of God, and
abridge the variety of the creation; making the creatures of one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but an acting over those of an other, and conjoyning as it were
the species of things which stood at distance in the intellect of God,
and though united in the Chaos, had several seeds of their creation: for
although in that indistinguisht masse, all things seemed one, yet separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the voyce of God, according to their species they came out in
incommunicated varieties, and irrelative seminalities, as well as divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
places; and so although we say the world was made in sixe dayes,
yet was there as it were a world in every one, that is, a distinct creation
of distinguisht creatures, a distinction in time of creatures divided in
nature, and a severall approbation, and survey in every one.</p>

               <p>1. ANd first from times of great Antiquity, and before the Melodie
of Syrens, the Musicall notes of Swans hath been commended,
and that they sing most sweetly before their death. For thus we read in
Plato <hi>de Legibus,</hi> that from the opinion of Melempsuchosis, or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration
of the soules of men into the bodies of beasts most sutable
unto their humane condition, after his death, Orpheus the Musician be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Swan. Thus was it the bird of Apollo the god of Musicke by
the Greekes, and a Hieroglyphick of Musick among the Aegyptians,
from whom the Greeks derived the conception, hath been the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many Latines, and hath not wanted assertors almost from every
Nation.</p>
               <p>All which notwithstanding we find this relation doubtfully received
by Aelian, as an hearsay account by Bellonius, as a false one by Pliny,
expresly refuted by Myndius in Athenaeus, &amp; severely rejected by Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,
whose words unto Cardan are these. <hi>De Cygni vero cantu suavis
simo quem cum parente mendaciorum Graecia jactare ausus es, ad Luciani
tribunal, apud quem novi aliquid dicas, statuo.</hi> Authors also that counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
it, speak not satifactorily of it. Some affirming they sing not till
they die; some that they sing, yet die not; some speake generally, as
though this note were in all; some but particularly, as though it were
only in some; some in places remote, and where we can have no trial of
it; others in places where every experience can refute it, as Aldrovand
upon relation, delivered, concerning the Musicke of the Swans on the
river of the Thames neer London.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:50218:96"/>
Now that which countenanceth,<note place="margin">This figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be fonnd in Elkes, and not in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Swans.</note> and probably confirmeth this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
is the strange and unusuall conformation of the winde pipe, or
vocall organ in this animall: observed first by Aldrovandus, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by some contrived for this intention: for in its length it far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
the gullet, and hath in the chest a sinuous revolution, that is,
when it ariseth from the lunges, it ascendeth not directly unto the
throat, but ascending first into a capsulary reception of the breast bone,
by a Serpentine and Trumpet recurvation it ascendeth againe into the
neck, and so by the length thereof a great quantity of ayre is received,
and by the figure thereof a musicall modulation effected. But to speak
indifferently (what Aldrovand himself acknowledgeth) this formation
of the Weazon, is not peculiar unto the Swan but common also, unto
the Platea or Shovelard, a bird of no Musicall throat; And as himselfe
confesseth may thus be contrived in the Swan to contain a larger stock
of ayre, whereby being to feed on weeds at the bottom, they might
the longer space detain their heads under water. And indeed were this
formation peculiar, or had they unto this effect an advantage from this
part: yet have they a knowne and open disadvantage from an other,
which is not common unto any singing bird wee know, that is a flat
bill: For no Latirostrous animal (whereof neverthelesse there are no
slender numbers) were ever commended for their note, or accounted
among those animals which have been instructed to speake.</p>
               <p>When therefore we consider the dissention of Authors, the falsity
of relations, the indisposition of the Organs, and the immusicall note
of all we ever beheld or heard of, if generally taken and comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Swans, or of all places, we cannot assent thereto. Surely he that
is bit with a Tarantula, shall never be cured by this Musicke, and with
the same hopes we expect to hear the harmony of the Spheres.</p>
               <p>2. That there is a speciall proprietie in the flesh of Peacocks rost or
boiled, to preserve a long time incorrupted, hath been the assertion of
many, stands yet confirmed by Austine, <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> by Gygas
Sempronius, in Aldrovand, and the same experiment we can confirme
our selves, in the brawne or fleshy parts of Peacocks so hanged up with
thred, that they touch no place whereby to contract a moisture; and
hereof we have made triall both in the summer and winter. The reason
some I perceive, attempt to make out from the siccity and drines of its
flesh, and some are content to rest in a secret propriety thereof. As for
the siccity of the flesh, it is more remarkable in other animals, as Aegles,
Hawkes, and birds of prey; And that it is a propriety, or agreeable
unto none other, we cannot with reason admit: for the same preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or rather incorruption we have observed in the flesh of Turkeys,
Capons, Hares, Partridge, Venison, suspended freely in the ayre, and
after a yeare and a halfe, dogs have not refused to eat them.</p>
               <p>As for the other conceit that a Peacocke is ashamed when he lookes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50218:96"/>
on his legges, as is commonly held, and also delivered by Cardan, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
what hath been said against it by Scaliger, let them beleeve that
hold specificall deformities, or that any part can seeme unhansome to
their eyes, which hath appeared good and beautifull unto their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.
The occasion of this conceit, might first arise from a common
observation, that when they are in their pride, that is, advance their
traine, if they decline their necke to the ground, they presently demit
and let fall the same: which indeed they cannot otherwise doe, for
contracting their body, and being forced to draw in their foreparts, to
establish the hinder in the elevation of the traine, if the foreparts depart
and incline to the ground, the hinder grow too weake, and suffer the
traine to fall. And the same in some degree is also observeable in
Turkyes.</p>
               <p>3. That Storkes are to be found and will onely live in Republikes
or free States, is a pretty conceit to advance the opinion of popular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies,
and from Antipathies in nature, to disparage Monarchicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
But how far agreeable unto truth, let them consider who
read in Plinie, that among the Thessalians who were governed by
Kings, and much abounded with Serpents, it was no lesse then capitall
to kill a Storke. That the ancient Aegyptians honoured them, whose
government was from all times Monarchicall. That Bellonius affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
men make them nests in France. And lastly, how Jeremy the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
delivered himselfe unto his countreymen, whose government was
at that time Monarchicall. <hi>Milvus in Coel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Turtur Hirundo &amp; Ciconia custodierunt tempus adventus sui.</hi> Wherein
to exprobrate their Stupiditie, he induceth the providence of Storkes.
Now if the bird had been unknown, the illustration had been obscure,
and the exprobation but improper.</p>
               <p>4. That a Bittor maketh that mugient noyse, or as we terme it Bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
by putting its bill into a reed as most beleeve, or as Bellonius and
Aldrovand conceive, by putting the same in water or mud, and after a
while retaining the ayre by suddenly excluding it againe, is not so easily
made out. For my own part though after diligent enquiry, I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
behold them in this motion; Notwithstanding by others whose
observations we have expresly requested, we are informed, that some
have beheld them making this noise on the Shore, their bills being far
enough removed from reed or water; that is, first strongly attracting
the aire, and unto a manifest distention of the neck, and presently after
with great Contention and violence excluding the same againe. As
for what others affirme of putting their bill in water or mud, it is also
hard to make out. For what may bee observed from any that walketh
the Fenns, there is little intermission, nor any observable pawse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the drawing in and sending forth of their breath. And the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or breathing forth doth not onely produce a noise, but the inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50218:97"/>
or haling in of the ayre, affordeth a sound that may bee heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a flight shoot.</p>
               <p>Now the reason of this strange and peculiar noise, is well deduced
from the conformation of the windepipe, which in this birde is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from other volatiles. For at the upper extream it hath no Larinx,
or throttle to qualifie the sound, and at the other end, by two branches
deriveth it selfe into the Lunges. Which division consisteth onely of
Semicircular fibers, and such as attaine but half way round the part; By
which formation they are dilatable into larger capacities, and are able
to containe a fuller proportion of ayre, which being with violence sent
up the weazon, and finding no resistance by the Larinx, it issueth forth
in a sound like that from cavernes, and such as sometimes subterraneous
eruptions, from hollow rocks afford; As Aristotle observeth in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of the 25. Section, and is observable in pichards, bottles, and that
instrument which Aponensis upon that probleme describeth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
in Aristotles time Gardiners affrighted birdes.</p>
               <p>5. That whelps are blinde nine dayes and then begin to see, is the
common opinion of all, and some will be apt enough to descend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
oathes upon it. But this I finde not answerable unto experience;
for upon a strict observation of many, I have not found any that see the
ninth day, few before the twelfth, and the eyes of some will not open
before the fourteenth day. And this is agreeable unto the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Aristotle: who computeth the time of their anopsie or invision
by that of their gestation; for some saith he do go with their yong, the
sixt part of a yeer, a day or two over or under, that is, about sixty dayes
or nine weekes, and the whelps of these see not till twelve dayes; some
goe the fifth part of a yeer, that is, 71. dayes, and these saith he see not
before the fourteenth day. Others doe goe the fourth part of a yeer,
that is, three whole months, and these saith hee are without sight no
lesse then seventeen dayes: wherein although the accounts be different,
yet doth the least thereof exceed the terme of nine dayes which is so
generally receaved. And this compute of Aristotle doth generally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow,
the common cause alleadged for this effect, that is, a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation
or over hasty exclusion before the birth be perfect, according
unto the vulgar Adage. <hi>Festinans canis coecos parit catulos:</hi> for herein
the whelps of longest gestation, are also the latest in vision. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
hereof is this. At the first littering their eyes are fastly closed, that
is, by coalition or joyning together of the eyelids, and so continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
about the twefth day, at which time they begin to separate, and
may be easily divelled or parted asunder; they open at the inward can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this,
or greater angle of the eye, and so by degrees dilate themselves
quite open. An effect very strange, and the cause of much obscurity,
wherein as yet mens enquiries are blinde, and satisfaction acquirable
from no man. What ever it be, thus much we may observe, those ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50218:97"/>
are onely excluded without sight, which are multiparous and
multifidous, that is, which have many at a litter, and have also their
feet divided into many portions; for the Swine although multiparous,
yet being bisulcous, and onely cloven hoofed, is not excluded in this
manner, but farrowed with open eyes, as other bisulcous animals.</p>
               <p>6. The Antipathy between a Toad and a Spider, and that they poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonously
destroy each other is very famous, and solemne Stories have
been written of their combats, wherein most commonly the victory is
given unto the Spider. Of what Toades and Spiders it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
would be considered. For the Phalangium, and deadly Spiders,
are different from those we generally behold in England. How ever
the verity hereof, as also of many others, wee cannot but desire; for
hereby wee might be surely provided of proper Antidotes in cases
which require them; But what we have observed herein, wee cannot
in reason conceale, who having in a glasse included a Toad with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Spiders, wee beheld the Spiders without resistance to sit upon his
head, and passe over all his body, which at last upon advantage hee
swallowed down, and that in few houres to the number of seven. And
in the like manner will Toades also serve Bees, and are accounted an
enemy unto their Hives.</p>
               <p>7. Whether a Lyon be also afraid of a Cock, as is related by many,
and beleeved by most, were very easie in some places to make tryall.
Although how far they stand in feare of that animal, we may sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand, from what is delivered by Camerarius, whose words in
his Symbola are these. <hi>Nostris temporibus in Aula serenissimi Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis
Bavariae, unus ex Leonibus miris saltibus in vicinam cujusdam domu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
aream sese dimisit, ubi Gallinaciorum cantum aut clampres nihil reformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans
ipsos una cum plurimis gallinis devoravit.</hi> That is, in our time in
the court of the Prince of Bavaria, one of the Lyons leaped downe into
a neighbous yard, where nothing regarding the crowing or noise of the
Cocks, hee eat them up with many other Hens. And therefore a very
unsafe defensative it is against the fury of this animal, and surely no
better then Virginity, or blood Royall, which Pliny doth place in
Cock broth: For herewith, saith he, who ever is anoynted (especially
if Garlick be boiled therein) no Lyon or Panther will touch him.</p>
               <p>8. It is generally conceived, an earewigge hath no wings, and is
reckoned amongst impennous insects by many, but hee that shall nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
observe them, or shall with a needle put aside the short and shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
cases on their backe, may extend and draw forth two winges of a
proportionable length for flight, and larger then many flyes. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
of Pennius is yet more perfect, who with a rush or bristle so
pricked them as to make them flie.</p>
               <p>9. That wormes are exanguious animalls, and such as have no blood
at all, is the determination of Philosophy, the generall opinion of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50218:98"/>
and I know not well to dissent from thence my selfe: if so, surely
wee want a proper terme whereby to expresse that humor in them
which so strictly resembleth blood: and we refer it unto the discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others what to determine of that red and sanguineous humor,
found more plentifully about the Torquis or carneous circle of great
wormes in the spring, affording in linnen or paper an indiscernable
tincture from blood; or wherein that differeth from a veyne, which in
an apparent blew runneth along the body, and if dexterously pricked
with a lancet emitteth a red drop, which pricked on either side it will
not readily afford.</p>
               <p>In the upper parts of wormes, there are likewise found certaine
white and ovall glandulosities which Authors terme egs, and in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
glasses, they also represent them: how properly may also bee
enquired; since if in them there be distinction of sexes, these egs are to
be found in both. For in that which is presumed to bee their coition
that is their usuall complication, or rather laterall adhesion above the
ground, dividing suddenly with two knives the adhering parts of
both, I have found these egges in either.</p>
               <p>10. That Flyes, Bees, &amp;c. doe make that noise or humming sound
by their mouth, or as many beleeve with their wings only, would be
more warily asserted, if we consulted the determination of Aristotle,
who as in sundry other places, so more expressely, in his booke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,
affirmeth this sound to be made, by the allision of an inward
spirit upon a pellicle, or little membrane about the precinct or pectorall
division of their body. If we also consider that a Bee or Flye, so it be
able to move the body, will buz though its head be off; that it will do
the like if deprived of wings reserving the head whereby the body
may be the better moved. And that some also which are big and lively
will humme without either head or wing.</p>
               <p>Nor is it only the brating upon this little membrane, by the inward
and connaturall spirit as Aristotle determines, or the outward ayre as
Scaliger conceiveth which affordeth this humming noise, but perhaps
most of the other parts may also concurre hereto, as will be manifest
if while they humme we lay our finger on the backe or other parts; for
thereupon will be felt a serrous or jarring motion like that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
while we blow on the teeth of a combe through paper; and so
if the head or other parts of the trunke be touched with oyle, the sound
will be much impaired, if not destroyed: for those being also dry and
membranous parts, by attrition of the spirit doe helpe to advance the
noyse: And therefore also the sound is strongest in dry weather, and
very weake in rainy season, and toward winter; for then the ayre is
moyst, and the inward spirit growing weake, makes a languid and
dumbe allision upon the parts.</p>
               <p>11. There is found in the Summer a kind of spider called a Tainct of a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50218:98"/>
red colour, and so little of body that ten of the largest will hardly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
a graine; this by Country people is accounted a deadly poyson
unto cowes and horses, who, if they suddenly dye, and swell thereon,
ascribe their death hereto, and will commonly say, they have licked a
Tainct. Now to satisfie the doubts of men, we have called this traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto experiment; we have given hereof unto dogs, chickens, calves
and horses, and not in the singular number, yet never could finde the
least disturbance ensue. There must be therefore other causes enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the sudden death, and swelling of cattell, and perhaps this insect
is mistaken, and unjustly accused for some other; for some there are
which from elder times, have been observed pernicious unto cattell, as
the Buprestis or burst cow, the Pityocampe or cruca Pinuum, by Dios<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides,
Galen and Aetius, the Staphilinus described by Aristotle and
others, or those red Phalangious spiders like Cantharides mentioned
by Muffetus. Now although the animall may be mistaken and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
also false, yet in the ground and reason which makes men most to
doubt the verity hereof there may be truth enough, that is the small
inconsiderable quantity of this insect. For that a poyson cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
in so small a bulke, we have no reason to affirme. For if as Leo
Africanus reporteth, the tenth part of a graine of the poyson of Nubia
will dispatch a man in two houres, if the bite of a Viper and sting of a
Scorpion, is not conceived to impart so much, if the bite of an Aspe
will kill within an houre, yet the impression scarce visible, and the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
communicated not ponderable, we cannot as impossible reject this
way of destruction; or deny the power of death in so narrow a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.</p>
               <p>12. Wondrous things are promised from the Glow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>worme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereof
perpetuall lights are pretended, and waters said to be distilled which
afford a lustre in the night; and this is asserted by Cardan, Albertus,
Gaudentius, Mizaldus and many others. But hereto we cannot with
reason assent: for the light made by this animall depends upon a living
spirit, and seems by some vitall irradiation to be actuated into this
lustre. For when they are dead they shine not, nor alwayes while they
live, but are obscure or light according to the diffusion of this spirit, and
the protrusion of their luminous parts, as observation will instruct us;
for this flammeous light is not over all the body, but only visible on
the inward side, in a small white part neare the tayle. When this is full
and seemeth protruded, there ariseth a double flame of a circular figure
and Emerald green colour, which is discernable in any darke place in
the day; but when it falleth and seemeth contracted, the light disappea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
and the colour of the part only remaineth. Now this light, as it
appeareth and disappeareth in their life, so doth it goe quite out at their
death. As we have observed in some, which preserved in fresh grasse
have lived and shined eighteen dayes, but as they declined their light
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50218:99"/>
grew languid, and at last went out with their lives. Thus also the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedo
which alive hath a power to stupifie at a distance, hath none upon
contaction being dead, as Galen and Rondoletius particularly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented.
And this hath also disappointed the mischiefe of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
which study the advancement of poysons, and fancie destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
compositions from Aspes or Vipers teeth, from Scorpions or
Hornet stings; for these omit their efficacy in the death of the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall,
and act but dependantly on their formes. And thus far also those
Philosophers concur with us which held the Sun and Stars were living
creatures, for they conceived their lustre depended on their lives;
but if they ever dyed their light must perish also.</p>
               <p>True it is, and we have observed it, that a Glow-worme will afford
a faint light, almost a dayes space when many will conceive it dead, but
this is a mistake in the compute of death, and terme of disanimation;
for indeed, it is not then dead, but if it be distended will slowly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
it selfe againe, which when it cannot doe it ceaseth to shine any
more. And to speak strictly it is no easie matter to determine the point
of death in insects and creatures who have not their vitalities radically
confined unto one part; for these are not dead when they cease to move
or afford the visible evidencies of life; as may be manifestly observed
in flyes, who when they appear even desperate and quite forsaken of
their formes, by vertue of the sun or warme ashes will be revoked unto
life, and performe its functions againe.</p>
               <p>13. The wisdom of the Pismire is magnified by all, and in the Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks
of their providence we alwayes meet with this, that to prevent
the growth of corne which they store up they bite off the end thereof:
And some have conceived that from hence they have their name in
Hebrew: From whence ariseth a conceit that corne will not grow if
the extreams be cut or broken. What other provision they make for
this intention we know not, but herein we finde no security to prevent
its germination, as having made tryall in graines whose ends cut off
have notwithstanding suddenly sprouted, and according to the law of
their kindes, that is the roots of barley and oates at contrary ends, of
wheat and rye at the same. And therefore some have delivered that
after rainy weather they dry these graines in the Sun, which if effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
we must conceive to be made in a high degree and above the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of Malt, for that Malt will grow this yeare hath informed us,

onely, saith he, have an erect figure, whose spine and thigh bone are
carried in right lines, and so indeed of any we yet know, Man only is
erect; for the thighes of other animals doe stand at angles with their
spine, and have rectangular positions in birds, and perfect Quadrupedes;
nor doth the Frog, though stretched out, or swimming, attaine the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude
of man, or carry its thigh without all angularity: and thus is it
also true that man onely sitteth, if we define sitting to be a firmation of
the body upon the Ischias; wherein if the position be just and naturall
the thigh bone lyeth at right angles to the spine, and the leg bone or
tibia to the thigh; for others when they seeme to sit, as Dogs, Cats, or
Lions, doe make unto their spine acute angles with their thigh, and
acute to the thigh with their shanke: Thus is it likewise true, what

or suffereth pollutions in the night; that is, because man onely lyeth
upon his back, if we define not the same by every supine position, but
when the spine is in rectitude with the thigh, and both with the
armes lye parallell to the Horizon, that a line through their navel will
passe through the Zenith and centre of the earth, and so cannot other
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50218:100"/>
animals lye upon their backs; for though the spine lye parallel with
the Horizon, yet will their legs incline, and lye at angles unto it; And
upon these three divers positions in man wherein the spine can only be
at right lines with the thigh, arise those remarkeable postures, prone,
supine, and erect, which are but differenced in sight, or inaugular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
upon the back, the belly and the feet.</p>
               <p>But if erectnesse be popularly taken, and as it is largely opposed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
pronenesse, or the posture of animals looking downewards, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their venters or opposite part to the spine directly towards the
earth, it must not be strictly taken; for though in Serpents and Lizards
we may truly allow a pronenesse, yet Galen acknowledgeth that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Quadrupedes, as Horses, Oxen, and Camels, are but partly prone,
and have some part of erectnesse; and birds or flying animals, are so
farre from this kinde of pronenesse, that they are almost erect, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the head and breast in their progression, and onely prone in the act
of their volitation; and if that be true which is delivered of the Penguin
or <hi>Anser Magellanicus,</hi> and often described in Maps about those
Straits, that they goe erect like men, and with their breast and belly
do make one line perpendicular unto the axis of the earth; it will make
up the exact erectnesse of man; nor will that insect come very short
which we have often beheld, that is, one kinde of Locust which stands
not prone, or a little inclining upward, but in a large erectnesse, eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
alwayes the two fore legs, and susteining it selfe in the middle of

               <p>As for the end of this erection, to looke up toward heaven, though
confirmed by severall testimonies, and the Greek E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ymology of man,
it is not so readily to be admitted; and as a popular and vaine conceit
was anciently rejected by Galen; who in his third, <hi>De usu partium,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines,
that man is erect because he was made with hands, and was
therewith to exercise all Arts which in any other figure he could not
have performed, as he excellently declareth in that place where he also
proves that man could have beene made neither Quadruped, nor
Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>taur.</p>
               <p>The ground and occasion of this conceit was a literall apprehension
of a figurative expression in Plato, as Galen plainely delivers, the effect
of whose words is this: To opinion that man is erect to looke up and
behold the heavens, is a conceit onely fit for those that never saw the
fish Uranoscopus, that is, the Beholder of heaven; which hath its eyes
so placed, that it lookes up directly to heaven, which man doth not,
except he recline, or bend his head backward; and thus to looke up to
heaven agreeth not onely unto men, but Asses; to omit birds with long
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50218:100"/>
necks, which looke not onely upwards, but round about at pleasure;
and therefore men of this opinion understood not Plato when he said
that man doth <hi>Sursum aspicere,</hi> for thereby was not meant to gape or
looke upward with the eye, but to have his thoughts sublime, and not
onely to behold, but speculate their nature with the eye of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
               <p>Now although Galen in this place makes instance but in one, yet
are there other fishes, whose eyes regard the heavens, as Plane, and
cartilagineous fishes as pectinals, or such as have the Apophyses of
their spine made laterally like a combe, for when they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to sleepe or rest upon the white side, their eyes on the other side
looke upward toward heaven: for birds, they generally carry their
heads erectly like man, and some have advantage in that they move not
their upper eyelid; and many that have long necks, and bear their heads
somewhat backward, behold farre more of the heavens, and seeme to
look above the aequinoxiall circle; and so also in many Quadrupeds, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their progression be partly prone, yet is the sight of their eye
direct, not respecting the earth but heaven, and makes an higher arch
of altitude then our owne. The position of a Frogge with his head
above water exceedeth these; for therein hee seemes to behold a large
part of the heavens, and the acies of his eye to ascend as high as the
Tropick; but he that hath beheld the posture of a Bitour, will not deny
that it beholds almost the very Zenith.</p>

               <p>THat the heart of man is seated in the left side, is an asseveration

Diall, although the extreams may respect the North or South and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

               <p>The ground of this mistake is a generall observation from the pulse
or motion of the heart, which is more sensible on this side; but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hereof is not to be drawne from the situation of the heart, but the
site of the left ventricle wherein the vitall spirits are laboured, and also
the great Artery that conveyeth them out, both which are situated on
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50218:101"/>
the left, and upon this reason epithems or cordial applications are justly
applyed unto the left brest, and the wounds under the fist rib may bee
more suddenly destructive if made on the sinister side; and the speare
of the souldier that pierced our Saviour, is not improperly described
when Painters direct it a little towards the left.</p>
               <p>The other ground is more particular and upon inspection; for in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

its sinistrous gravity is drawne that way by the great arterie,

taken, the heart is seated in the middle of the chest; but after a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and inconsiderate aspection, or according to the readiest sense of
pulsation, wee shall not quarrell if any affirme it is seated toward the
left; and in these considerations must Aristotle be salved, when hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
the heart of man is placed in the left side, and thus in a popular
acception may wee receive the periphrasis of Persius when hee taketh
the part under the left pappe for the heart;<note place="margin">Lavâ in parte ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millae.</note> and if rightly apprehended,
it concerneth not this controversie, when it is said in Ecclesiastes, The
heart of a wiseman is in the right side, but that of a fool in the left.</p>
               <p>That assertion also that man proportionally hath the largest brain, I
did I confesse somewhat doubt, and conceived it might have failed in
birds, especially such as having little bodies, have yet large cranies,
and seeme to containe much brain, as Snipes, Woodcoks, &amp;c. but upon
triall I finde it very true. The braines of a man Archangelus and
Bauhinus, observe to weigh four pound, and sometime five and an half,
if therefore a man weigh one hundred and forty pounds, and his braine
but five, his waight is 27. times as much as his braine, deducting the
waight of that five pound which is allowed for it; now in a Snype
which waighed foure ounces two dragmes, I find the braines to waigh
but half dragme, so that the weight of the body (allowing for the brain)
exceeded the waight of the brain, sixtie seven times and an half.</p>

               <p>AN opinion there is, which magnifies the condition of the fourth

observed by the heathens, as Alexander <hi>ab Alexandro,</hi> Gellius, Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,
and Pierius haue delivered, as lately Levinus Lemnius hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
who affirmes this peculiar vessell to bee an Arterie, and not a
nerve, as antiquitie conceived it; adding moreover that rings hereon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
affect the heart; that in Lipothymis or swoundings he used the
frication of this finger with saffron and gold; that the ancient Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
mixed up their Medicines herewith; that this is seldome or last of

continue not long after: notwithstanding all which we remaine unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
nor can we thinke the reasons alledged sufficiently establish the
priviledge of this finger.</p>
               <p>For first, concerning the practice of antiquity the custome was not
generall to weare their rings either on this hand or finger; for it is said,
and that emphatically in Jeremiah, <hi>Si fuerit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50218:102"/>
hand, yet would I pluck thee thence: So is to observed by Pliny that
in the portraits of their Gods the rings were worne on the finger next
the thumb, that the Romans wore them also upon their little finger, as
Nero is described in Petronius: some wore them on the middle fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
as the ancient Gaules and Britans, and some upon the forefinger, as
is deduceable from Julius Pollux, who names that ring Corionos.</p>
               <p>Againe, that the practice of the Ancients had any such respect of
cordiality or reference unto the heart will much be doubted if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
their rings were made of Iron; such was that of Prometheus who
is conceived the first that brought them in use; so, as Pliny affirmeth,
for many yeares the Senators of Rome did not weare any rings of
Gold: but the slaves wore generally Iron rings untill their manumissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or preferment to some dignity; That the Lacedemonians continued
their Iron rings unto his dayes, Pliny also delivereth; and surely they
used few of Gold, for beside that Lycurgus prohibited that mettall,
we read in Athenaeus that having a desire to guild the face of Apollo,
they enquired of the oracle where they might purchase so much gold,
and were directed unto Craesus King of Lydia.</p>
               <p>Moreover whether the Ancients had any such intention, the grounds
which they conceived in veyne, nerve, or artery, are not to be justified,
nor will inspection confirm a peculiar vessell in this finger: for as Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
informeth, the Basilica veyne dividing into two branches below
the cubit, the outward sendeth two surcles unto the thumb, two unto
the forefinger, and one unto the middlefinger in the inward side; the
other branch of the Basilica sendeth one surcle unto the outside of the
middlefinger, two unto the Ring, and as many unto the little fingers; so
that they all proceed from the Basilica, and are in equall numbers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
unto every one: In the same manner are the branches of the axil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
artery distributed into the hand, for below the cubit it divideth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two parts, the one running along the Radius, and passing by the wrest
or place of the pulse, is at the fingers subdivided into three branches,
whereof the first conveyeth two surcles unto the thumb, the second as
many to the forefinger, and the third one unto the middle finger; the
other or lower division of the artery descendeth by the ulna, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
the other fingers, that is the middle with one surcle, and the
ring and little fingers with two; as for the nerves they are disposed
much after the same maner, and have their originall from the brain, and
not the heart, as many of the Ancients conceived; which is so farre
from affording nerves unto other parts, that it receiveth very few it self
from the sixt conjugation, or paire of nerves in the brain.</p>
               <p>Lastly, these propagations being communicated unto both hands,
we have no greater reason to weare our rings on the left, then on the
right, nor are there cordiall considerations in the one, more then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and therefore when Forestus for the stanching of blood makes
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50218:102"/>
use of Topicall applications unto the fourth finger, he consines not that
practice unto the left, but varieth the side according to the nostrill
bleeding: and so in fevers, where the heart primarily suffereth, we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
medicines unto the wrests of either arme; and so we touch the pulse
of both, and judge of the affections of the heart by the one as well as
the other: and although in indispositions of liver or spleene consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
are made in Phlebotomy respectively to their situation; yet
when the heart is affected men have thought it as effectuall to bleed on
the right as the left; and although also it may be thought, a nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
is to be had of the left, because the great artery proceeds from the
left ventricle, and so is nearer that arme, it admits not that considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for under the channell bones the artery divideth into two great
branches, from which trunke or point of division the distance unto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand is equall, and the consideration answerable.</p>
               <p>And therefore Macrobius discussing the point, hath alleadged ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason, affirming that the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>station of rings upon this hand and
finger, might rather be used for their conveniency and preservation
then any cordiall relation; for at first (saith he) it was both free and
usuall to weare rings on either hand, but after that luxury encreased,
when pretious gems and rich insculptures were added, the custome of
wearing them on the right hand was translated unto the left, for that
hand being lesse employed, thereby they were best preserved; and for
the same reason they placed them on this finger, for the thumb was too
active a finger, and is commonly imployed with either of the rest: the
Index or forefinger was too naked whereto to commit their pretiosities
and hath the tuition of the thumbe scarce unto the second joynt: the
middle and little finger they rejected as extreams, and too big or too
little for their rings, and of all chose out the fourth as being least used of
any, as being guarded on either side, and having in most this peculiar
condition that it cannot be extended alone and by it selfe, but will bee
accompained by some finger on either side: and to this opinion assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

               <p>Now that which begat or promoted the common opinion, was the
common conceit that the heart was seated on the left side, but how far
this is verified, we have before declared. The Aegyptian practice hath
much advanced the same, who unto this finger derived a nerve from
the heart, and therefore the Priest anointed the same with pretious oyls
before the altar; but how weake Anatomists they were, which were
so good Embalmers we have already shewed; and though this reason
tooke most place, yet had they another which more commended that
practice, and that was the number whereof this singer was an Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick:
for by holding downe the fourth finger of the left hand,
while the rest were extended, they signified the perfect and magnified
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50218:103"/>
number of six; for as Pierius hath graphically declared, Antiquity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
numbers by the fingers of either hand; on the left they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their digits and articulate numbers unto an hundred, on the right
hand hundreds &amp; thousands; the depressing this finger which in the left
hand implied but six, in the right indigitated six hundred: In this way
of numeration may we construe that of Juvenal concerning Nestor.

               <p>As for the observation of Lemnius an eminent Physitian, concerning
the gowt, how ever it happened in his country, wee may observe it
otherwise in ours; that is, that chiragricall persons doe suffer in this
finger as well as in the rest, and sometimes first of all, and sometimes
no where else; and for the mixing up medicines herewith, it is rather
an argument of opinion then any considerable effect, and we as highly

or aberration from that way which nature generally intendeth;
and truly we do not deny that almost all Nations have used this hand,
and ascribed a preheminence thereto: hereof a remarkable passage
there is in the 48. of Genesis, And Joseph tooke them both, Ephraim
in his right hand towards Israels left hand, and Manasses in his left
hand towards Israels right hand, and Israel stretched out his right
hand and laid it upon Ephraims head, who was the younger, and his
left hand upon Manasses head guiding his hands wittingly, for Manasses
was the first borne; and when Joseph saw that his father laid his right
hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he held up his
fathers hand to remove it from Ephraims head unto Manasses head,
and Joseph said not so my father, for this is thy first borne, put thy
right hand upon his head: And the like appeareth from the ordinance
of Moses in the consecration of their Priests, Then shalt thou kill the
Ram, and take of his bloud, and put it upon the tip of the right eare of
Aaron, and upon the tip of the right eare of his sonnes, and upon the

sprinkle the bloud on the Altar round about: That the Persians were
wont herewith to plight their faith, is testified by Diodorus: That the
Greeks and Romans made use hereof, beside the testimony of divers
Authors, is evident from their custome of discumbency at their
meales, which was upon their left side, for so their right hand was free,
and ready for all service; nor was this onely in use with divers Nations

the other, wherein notwithstanding in submission to future informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we are unsatisfied unto great dubitation.</p>
               <p>For first, if there were a determinate prepotency in the right, and
such as ariseth from a constant roote in nature, wee might expect the
same in other animals, whose parts are also differenced by dextrality,
wherein notwithstanding we cannot discover a distinct and complying
account, for we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inde not that Horses, Buls, or Mules, are generally
stronger on this side; and as for animals whose forelegs more sensibly
supply the use of armes, they hold if not an equality in both, a preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
oft times in the other, as Squirrels, Apes, and Monkeys, and the
same is also discernible in Parrets, and men observe that the eye of a
Tumbler is biggest not constantly in one, but in the bearing side.</p>
               <p>That there is also in men a naturall prepotency in the right we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
with constancy affirme, if we make observation in children, who
permitted the freedome of both, do oft times confine unto the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, and
are not without great difficulty restrained from it: and therefore this
prevalency is either uncertainly placed in the laterallity, or custome
determines its indifferency: which is the resolution of Aristotle in that
Probleme, which enqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es why the right side being better then the
left, is equall in the senses? because, saith he, the right and left do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
by use and custome which have no place in the senses: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is allowable; for right and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t as parts inservient unto the motive
faculty are differenced by degrees from use and assuefaction, according
whereto the one grows stronger, and oft times bigger then the other;
but in the senses it is otherwise; for they acquire not their perfection
by use or custome, but at the first we equally heare and see with one
eye, as well as with another: and therefore, were this indifferency per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
or did not institution, but Nature determine dextrality, there
would be many more Scevolaes then are delivered in story; not should
we wonder at seven thousand in one Army, as wee reade concerning
the Benjamites. True it is, that although there be an indifferency in
either, or a prevalency indifferent in one, yet is it most reasonable for
uniformity, and sundry respective uses, that men should apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the constant use of one, for there will otherwise arise anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50218:104"/>
disturbances in manuall actions, not onely in Civill and artificiall,
but also in Military affaires, and the severall actions of warre.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the grounds and reasons alleadged for the right are not
satisfactory, and afford no rest in their decision: Scaliger finding a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the reason of Aristotle, introduceth one of no lesse deficiency
himselfe, <hi>Ratio materialis</hi> (saith he) <hi>sanguinis crassitud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi>
that is, the reason of the vigour of this side is the crassitude and
plenty of bloud; but this is no way sufficient, for the crassitude or
thicknesse of bloud, affordeth no reason why one arme should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
before the other, and the plenty thereof, why both not enabled
equally: Fallopius is of another conceit, deducing the reason from the
Azygos or <hi>vena sine par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> a large and considerable veine arising out of
the cava or hallow veine, before it enters the right ventricle of the
heart, and placed onely in the right side; but neither is this perswasory,
for the Azygos communicates no branches unto the armes or legs on
either side, but disperseth into the ribs on both, and in its descent doth
furnish the left Emulgent with one veyne, and the first veyne of the
loynes on the right side with another; which manner of derivation
doth not conferre a peculiar addition unto either. <hi>Caelius Rodiginus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
to give a reason of Ambidexters and left handed men, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
a third opinion: Men, saith he, are Ambidexters, and use both
hands alike, when the heat of the heart doth plentifully disperse into
the left side, and that of the Liver into the right, and the spleene be also
much dilated; but men are left handed when ever it happeneth that
the heart and Liver are seated on the left side, or when the Liver
is on the right side, yet so obducted and covered with thick skins, that
it cannot diffuse its virtue into the right: which reasons are no way sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory;
for herein the spleene is injustly introduced to invigorate
the sinister side, which being dilated it would rather infirme and debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate;
as for any tunicles or skins which should hinder the Liver from
enabling the deutrall parts, we must not conceive it diffuseth its virtue
by meere irradiation, but by its veines and proper vessels, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
skins and teguments cannot impede, and as for the seate of the
heart and Liver in one side whereby men become left handed, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
too rarely to countenance an effect so common; for the seat of
the Liver on the left side is very monstrous, and scarce at all to be met
with in the observations of Physitians. Others not considering ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dextrous
and left handed men, doe totally submit unto the efficacy of
the Liver, which though it be seated on the right side, yet by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavian
division doth equidistantly communicate its activity unto either
arme, nor will it salve the doubts of observation, for many are right
handed whose Livers are weakely constituted, and many use the left,
in whom that part is strongest; and we observe in Apes and other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
whose Liver is in the right, no regular prevalence therein, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50218:104"/>
therefore the Braine, especially the spinall marrow, which is but the
braine prolonged, hath a fairer plea hereto, for these are the principles
of motion wherein dextrality consists, and are bipartited within and
without the Crany; by which division transmitting nerves respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto either side, according to the indifferency or originall and native
prepotency, there ariseth an equality in both, or prevalency in either
side; and so may it be made out, what many may wonder at, why
some most actively use the contrary arme and leg, for the vigour of the
one dependeth upon the upper part of the spine, but the other upon the
lower.</p>
               <p>And therefore many things are Philosophically delivered concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
right and left, which admit of some suspension; that a woman up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a masculine conception advanceth her right leg, will not be found to
answer strict observation; That males are conceived in the right side
of the wombe, females in the left, though generally delivered, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by ancient testimony, will make no infallible account; it hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pening
oft times that males and females doe lye upon both sides, and
Hermaphrodites for ought we know on either: It is also suspicious
what is delivered concerning the right and left testicle, that males are
begotten from the one, and females from the other; for though the
left seminall veine proceedeth from the Emulgent, and is the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>efore
conceived to carry downe a serous and feminine matter, yet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Arteryes which send forth the active materials, are both derived
from the great Artery: Beside this originall of the left veine was thus
contrived, to avoid the pulsation of the great Arterie over which it
must have passed to attaine unto the Testicle: Nor can we easily inferre
such different effects from the divers situation of parts which have one
end and office; for in the kidneys which have one office, the right is
seated lower then the left, whereby it lyeth free, and giveth way unto
the Liver, and therefore also that way which is delivered for masculine
generation, to make a straite ligature about the left Testicle, thereby
to intercept the evacuation of that part, deserveth consideration; for
one sufficeth unto generation, as hath beene observed in semicastration,
and oft times in carnous ruptures: beside the seminall ejaculation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not immediately from the Testicle, but from the spermatick
glandules; and therefore Aristotle affirmes, (and reason cannot deny)
that although there be nothing diffused from the Testicles, an Horse or
Bull may generate after castration, that is, from the stock and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of seminall matter, already prepared and stored up in the Prostates
or glandules of generation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, although wee should concede a right and left in Nature,
yet in this common and received account we may aberre from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
acception, mistaking one side for another, calling that in man and
other animals the right which is the left, and that the left which is the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50218:105"/>
right, and that in some things right and left, which is not properly
either.</p>
               <p>For first the right and left, are nor defined by Philosophers accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to common acception, that is, respectively from one man unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
or any constant site in each; as though that should bee the right
in one, which upon confront or facing stands a thwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

use of the right; now unto these that hand is properly the right,
and not the other estemed so by situation: Thus may Aristotle
bee made out, when hee affirmeth the right claw of Crabbes and

not regard the relative situation; for the one is generally bigger then
the other, yet not alwayes upon the same side: so may it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Hippocrates saith, that women are not ambidexterous, that is, not so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

and so may Aristotle say, that only man is Ambidexter; of this consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution

               <p>Lastly, these lateralities in man are not onely fallible, if relatively

make the right in the South, which was also observed by the Hebrews

we call that the right side of heaven which is seated Easterly unto us,

               <p>And thus have we at large declared that although the right be most

that man should swim naturally, because we observe it is no lesson unto
others we cannot well conclude; for other animalls swim in the same
manner as they goe, and need no other way of motion, for natation in
the water, then for progression upon the land; and this is true whether
they move <hi>per latera,</hi> that is two legs of one side together, which is
Tollutation or ambling, or <hi>per diametrum,</hi> which is most generall, lifting
one foot before, and the crosse foot behinde, which is succussation or
trotting, or whether <hi>per fron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they are able to support and impell themselves in the water, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
addition or alteration in the stroake of their legs, or position of
their bodies.</p>
               <p>But with man it is performed otherwise; for in regard of site he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

all sorts of Angles: and lastly, in progressive motion, the armes and
legs doe move successively, but in natation both together; all which
aptly to performe, and so as to support and advance the body, is a point
of art, and such as some in their young and docile yeares could never
attaine. But although it be acquired by art, yet is there somewhat more
of nature in it then we observe in other habits, nor will it strictly fall

                  </gap>loat the ninth day when

and cause, for the time of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>loating it is uncertain according to the time
of putrefaction, which will retard or accelerate according to the subject
and season of the year; for as we have observed cats and mice will arise
unequally and at different times, though drowned at the same; such as
are fatted doe commonly float soonest, for their bodies soonest fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that substance approacheth nearest unto ayre: and this is
one of Aristotles reasons why dead E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>les will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he, they have but slender bellies, and little fat.</p>
               <p>As for the cause it is not so reasonably imputed unto the breaking of
the gall as the putrefaction of the body, whereby the unnaturall heat
prevailing the putrifying parts do suffer a turgescence and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lation, and
becomming airy and spumous affect to approach the ayre, and ascend
unto the surface of the matter: and this is also evidenced in egges
wherof the sound ones sink, &amp; such as are addled swim, as do also those
which are tearmed hypenemia or wind-egges, and this is also a way to
separate seeds, whereof such as are corrupted and sterill swim; and this
agreeth not only unto the seed of plants lockt up and capsulated in
their husks, but also unto the sperme and seminall humor of man, for
such a passage hath Aristotle upon the Inquisition and test of its fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility.</p>
               <p>That the breaking of the gall is not the cause hereof experience hath
informed us, for opening the abdomen, and taking out the gall in
cats and mice, they did notwithstanding arise: and because wee had
read in Rhodiginus of a Tyrant, who to prevent the emergencie of
murdered bodies did use to cut off their lungs, and found mens minds
possessed with this reason, we committed some unto the water without
lungs, which notwithstanding floated with the others: and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the experiment, although we tooke out the guts and bladder, and
also perforated the Cranium, yet would they arise, though in a longer
time: from these observations in other animalls, it may not be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to conclude the same in man, who is too noble a subject on
whom to make them expressely, and the casuall opportunity too rare
almost to make any. Now if any shall ground this effect from gall or
choler, because it is the highest humor and will be above the rest; or
being the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iery humor will readiest surmount the water, wee must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse

                  </gap>scence it may promote elevation, which the
breaking of the bladder of gall so small a part in man, cannot conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

               <p>Lastly, that women drowned float prone, that is with their bellies
downward, but men supine or upward is an assertion wherein th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50218:107"/>
point it selfe is dubious; and were it true the reason alleadged for it, is
of no validity. The reason yet currant was first expressed by Pliny,
<hi>veluti pudori defunctarum parcente naturâ,</hi> nature modestly ordaining
this position to conceale the shame of the dead, which hath been taken
up by Solinus, Rhodiginus, and many more: This indeed (as Scaliger
tearmeth it) is <hi>ratio civilis non philosophica,</hi> strong enough for morality
or Rhetoricks, not for Philosophy or Physicks: for first, in nature the
concealment of secret parts is the same in both sexes and the shame of
their reveale equall: so Adam upon the taste of the fruit was ashamed
of his nakednesse as well as Eve: and so likewise in America and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
unacquainted with habits, where modesty conceales these parts in
one sex, it doth it also in the other; and therefore had this been the
intention of nature, not only women, but men also had swimmed
downwards, the posture in reason being common unto both where
the intent is also common.</p>
               <p>Againe, while herein we commend the modesty, we condemne the
wisdome of nature: for that prone position we make her contrive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the woman, were best agreeable unto the man in whom the secret
parts are very anterior and more discoverable in a supine and upward

Nor was
this onely an ancient custome among the Greeks and Romanes, and is
still in force with us, but is received at this day in remotest parts of
Africa; for so we read in Codignus, that upon a sneeze of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of Monomotapa, there passed acclamations successively through
the city.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:50218:110"/>
Now the ground of this ancient custome was probably the opinion
the ancients held of Sternutation: which they generally conceived to
be a good signe or a bad, and so upon this motion accordingly used, a
Salve or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as a gratulation for the one, and a deprecation
from the other: Now of the wayes whereby they enquired and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
it signality; the first was naturall arising from Physicall causes,
and consequencles of times naturally succeeding this motion; and so it
might be justly esteemed a good signe; for sneezing being properly a
motion of the braine, suddenly expelling through the nostrils what is
offensive unto it, it cannot but afford some evidence of its vigour; and
therefore saith Aristotle in his Problems, they that heare it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
they honour it as somewhat Sacred, and a signe of Sanity in the
diviner part; and this he illustrates from the practice of Physitians, who
in persons neere death doe use Sternutatories, or such as provoke unto
sneezing; when if the faculti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> arise and Sternutation ensue, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
hopes of life, and with gratulation receive the signes of safetie;
and so is it also of good signality in lesser considerations, according to
that of Hippocrates, that sneezing cureth the hickett, and is profitable
unto women in hard labour; and so is it of good signality in Lethargies,
Apoplexies, Catalepsies, and Coma's: and in this naturall way it is
somtime likewise of bad effects or signes, and may give hints of depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it as too much exagitating in the beginning of Catarrhs according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Avicenna as hindering concoction, in new and tender conceptions,
(as Pliny observeth) for then it endangers abortion.</p>
               <p>The second way was superstitious and Augurial, as Caelius Rhodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
hath illustrated in testimonies, as ancient as Theocritus and Homer;
as appears from the Athenian mast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>stimony of Austine, that the Ancients
were wont to goe to bed againe if they sneezed while they put on their
shooe; and in this way it was also of good and bad signification; so
Aristotle hath a Probleme, why sneezing from noon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> unto midnight
was good, but from night to noon unlucky? So Eustathius upon Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
observes, that sneezing to the left hand was unlucky, but prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
unto the right; and so as Plutarch relateth, when Themistocles
sacrificed in his galley b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus wee may perceive the custome is more ancient then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

admit; although we concede many questionable points, and dispute
not the verity of sundry opinions which are of affinity hereto: we will
acknowledge that certaine odours attend on animalls, no lesse then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
colours; that pleasant smels are not confined unto vegetables, but
found in divers animalls, and some more richly then in plants: and
though the Probleme of Aristotle enquire why none smells sweet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the parde? yet later discoveries adde divers sorts of Monkeys, the
Civet cat, and Gazela, from which our muske proceedeth: we confesse
that beside the smell of the species, there may be Individuall odours,
and every man may have a proper and peculiar savour; which although
not perceptible unto man, who hath this sense, but weake, yet sensible
unto dogges, who hereby can single out their Masters in the dark: wee
will not deny that particular men have sent forth a pleasant savour, as
Theophrastus and Plutark report of Alexander the great, and Tzetzes
and Cardan doe testifie of themselves; That some may also emit an
unsavoury odour, we have no reason to deny, for this may happen from
the qualitie of what they have taken, the Faetor whereof may discover
it self by sweat and urine, as being unmasterable by the naturall heat of
man, nor to be dulcified by concoction beyond an unsavoury conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
the like may come to passe from putrid humors, as is often discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

bodies even in the latitude of sanity; the naturall heat of the parts
being insufficient for a perfect and through digestion, and the errors of

               <p>The tribes that returned to India, were afterward widely dispersed;
for beside sixteene thousand which Titus sent to Rome unto the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
of his father Vespasian, hee sold no lesse then an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
for slaves; not many yeeres after Adrian the Emperour, who rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the whole Countrey, transplanted many thousands into Spaine,
from whence they dispersed into divers Countreys, as into France, and
England, but were banished after from both: from Spaine they disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into Africa, Italy, Constantinople, and the dominions of the Turke,
where they remaine as yet in very great numbers, and if (according to
good relations) where they may freely speake it, they forbeare not to
boast that there are at present many thousand Jewes in Spaine, France,
and England, and some dispensed withall, even to the degree of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
it is a matter very considerable, and could they be smelled out,
would much advantage, not onely the Church of Christ, but also the
coffers of Princes.</p>
               <p>Now having thus lived in severall Countreyes, and alwayes in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
they must needs have suffered many commixtures, and wee are
sure they are not exempted from the common contagion of Venerie
contracted first from Christians; nor are fornications unfrequent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them both, there commonly passing opinions of invitement, that
their women desire copulation with them, rather then their owne
nation, and affect Christian carnality above circumcised venery. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore acknowledged, that some are lost, evident that others
are mixed, and scarce probable that any are distinct, it will be hard to
establish this quality upon the Iews, unlesse we also transferre the same,
unto those whose generations are mixed, whose genealogies are Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,
and naturally derived from them.</p>
               <p>Againe, if we concede a nationall unsavourinesse in any people, yet
shall we finde the Iewes lesse subject hereto then any, and that in those
regards which most powerfully concurre to such effects, that is, their
diet and generation; As for their diet, whether in obedience unto the
precepts of reason, or the Injunctions of parsimony, therein they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
temperate, seldome offending inebrietie or excesse of drink, nor er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in gulosity or superfluity of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ats; whereby they prevent indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
and crudities, and consequently putrescence of humors; they
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50218:111"/>
have in abomination all flesh maymed, or the inwards any way vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and therefore eate no meate but of their owne killing. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
not onely fasts at certaine times, but are restrained unto very few
dishes at all times; so few, that whereas S. Peters sheet will hardly
cover our tables, their Law doth scarce permit them to set forth a
Lordly feast, nor any way to answer the luxurie of our times, or those
of our forefathers; for of flesh their Law restraines them many sorts,
and such as compleate our feasts: That animal, <hi>Propter convivianatum,</hi>
they touch not, not any of its preparations, or parts so much in request
at Roman tables; nor admit they unto their board, Hares, Conies,
Herons, Plovers, or Swans: Of Fishes, they onely taste of such as
have both sinnes and scales, which are comparatively but few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
such onely, saith Aristotle, whose egge or spawne is arenaceous
and friable, whereby are excluded all cetaceous and cartilagineous
fishes, many pectinall, whose ribs are rectilineall, many costall, which
have their ribs embowed, all spinall, or such as have no ribs, but onely
a back bone, or somewhat analogous thereto, as E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>les, Congers, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pries;
all that are testaceous, as Oysters, Cocles, W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lks, Schollops,
Muscles, and likewise all crustaceous, as Crabs, Shrimps, and Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
So that observing a spare and simple dyet, whereby they prevent
the generation of crudities, and fasting often, whereby they might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
digest them, they must be lesse inclinable unto this infirmity then
any other Nation, whose proceedings are not so reasonable to avoid it.</p>
               <p>As for their generations and conceptions, (which are the purer from
good dyet) they become more pure and perfect by the strict observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Law; upon the injunctions whereof, they severely observe
the times of Purification, and avoid all copulation, either in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse
of themselves, of impurity of their women; A rule, I feare
not so well observed by Christians, whereby not onely conceptions
are prevented, but if they proceed, so vitiated and defiled, that durable
inquinations, remaine upon the birth, which when the conception
meets with these impurities, must needs be very potent, since in the
purest and most faire conceptions, learned men derive the cause of Pox
and Meazels, from principles of that nature, that is, the menstruous
impurities in the mothers bloud, and the virulent tinctures contracted
by the Infant, in the nutriment of the wombe.</p>
               <p>Lastly, experience will convict it, for this offensive odor is no way
discoverable in their Synagogues where many are, and by reason of
their number could not be concealed; nor is the same discernible in
commerce or conversation with such as are cleanly in apparell, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
in their houses; surely the Viziars and Turkish Basha's are not of
this opinion, who as Sir Henry Blunt informeth, doe generally keepe
a Jew of their private Counsell; and were this true, the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do not strictly make out the intention of their Law, for in vaine
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50218:112"/>
do they scruple to approach the dead, who livingly are cadaverous, or
feare any outward pollution, whose temper pollutes themselves. And
lastly, were this true, our opinion is not impartiall, for unto converted
Jews who are of the same seed, no man imputeth this unsavoury odor;
as though Aromatized by their conversion, they admitted their sent
with their Religion, and they smelt no longer then they savoured of
the Jew.</p>
               <p>Now the ground that begat or propagated this assertion might be
the distastfull aversenesse of the Christian from the Jew, from their
corruptnesse, and the villany of that fact, which made them abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and stinck in the nostrils of all men; which reall practise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but was a fraudulent illation; for such an evill savour their father Jacob

Now how dangerous it is in sensible things to use metaphoricall
expressions unto the people, and what absurd conceits they will swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in their literals, an impatient example wee have in our owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,

common apprehension conceives a reality therein, and against our

               <p>The nastinesse of that Nation, and sluttish course of life hath much
promoted the opinion, occasioned by their servile condition at first,
and inferiour wayes of parsimony ever since; as is delivered by
Mr. Sandys, They are generally fat, saith he, and ranck of the savours

Greeks, and the reason thereof occasioned a Probleme in Aristotle.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if all were true, and were this savour conceded, yet are the
reasons alleadged for it no way satisfactory: Hucherius in his Tract <hi>de
sterilitate,</hi> and after him Alsarius Crucius in his medicall Epistles, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
this effect unto their abstinence from salt or salt meats; which
how to make good in the present dyet of the Jews we know not, nor
shall we conceive it was observed of old, if we consider they seasoned
every sacrifice, and all oblations whatsoever, whereof we cannot deny
a great part was eaten by the Priests; and if the offering were of flesh it
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50218:112"/>
was salted no lesse then thrice, that is, once in the common chamber of
salt, at the footestep of the Altar, and upon the top thereof, as is at large
delivered by Maimonides: nor if they refrained all salt, is the illation
very urgent; for many there are not noted for ill odors, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate no
salt at all, as all carnivorous animals, most children, many whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and probably our Fathers after the Creation; there being indeed
in every thing we eat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, a naturall and concealed salt, which is separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by digestions, as doth appeare in our teares, sweat and urines, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

               <p>Another cause is urged by Campegius, and much received by

then in any other point which wise men have cast into the list of

and confirmed testimonies, our strictest enquiry receaves no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>I say, exact testimonies, first, in regard of the Authors from whom
we derive the account, for though wee meet herewith in Herodotus,
Philostratus, Mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Pliny, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>linus, and many more; yet were they
derivative Relators, and the primitive Author was Homer; who, not
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50218:113"/>
onely intending profit but pleasure, and using often similies, as well to
delight the eare, as to illustrate his matter, in the third of his Iliads,
compareth the Trojanes unto the Cranes, when they discend against
the Pigmies; which was more largely set out by Oppian, Juvenall,
Mantuan, and many Poets since; and being onely a pleasant similitude
in the fountaine, became a solemne story in the streame, and current
still among us.</p>
               <p>Againe, many professed enquirers have rejected it; Strabo an exact
and judicious Geographer, hath largely condemned it as a fabulous
story in the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st of his Geographie. Julius Scaliger a diligent enquirer,
accounts thereof, but as a Poeticall fiction; Vlysses Aldrovandus a
most exact Zoographer in an expresse discourse hereon, concludes the
story fabulous, and a poetical account of Homer; and the same was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
conceived by Eustathius his excellent commentator, <hi>Albertus
Magnus</hi> a man oftimes too credulous, herein was more then dubious,
for he affirmeth, if any such dwarfes were ever extant, they were sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
some kinde of Apes; which is a conceit allowed by Cardan, and not
esteemed improbable by many others.</p>
               <p>There are I confesse two testimonies, which from their authority
admit of consideration. The first of Aristotle, whose words are these,
in the eighth of his History of animals, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c. That is, <hi>Hic
locus est quem incolunt Pygmei, non enim id fabula est sed pusillum genus,
ut aiunt.</hi> Wherein indeed Aristotle playes the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>istotle, that is, the
wary and evading assertor; For though with <hi>non est in fabula,</hi> he seem
at first to confirme it, yet at the last he claps in, <hi>Sic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t aiunt,</hi> and shakes
the beliefe he put before upon it; and therefore I observe Scaliger hath
not translated the first, perhaps supposing it surreptitious, or unworthy
so great an assertor: and truely for those bookes of animals, or worke of
eight hundred talents, as Atheneus termes it, although it bee ever
to bee admired, and containe most excellent truths, yet are many
things therein delivered upon relation, and some things repugnant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the history of our senses; as wee are able to make out in some, and
Scaliger hath observed in many more, as he hath freely declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in his Comment upon that peece.</p>
               <p>The second testimony is deduced from holy Canonicall Scripture;
that is, Ezech. 27. verse 11. thus rendred in the vulgar translation, <hi>Sed
&amp; Pygmaei qui erant in turribus tuis pharetras suas suspenderunt in muris
tuis per gyrum:</hi> from whence notwithstanding we cannot inferre this
assertion; for first the Translatours accord not, and the Hebrew word
<hi>Gamadim</hi> is very variously rendred: Though Aquila, Vatablus and
Lyra will have it Pygmaei, yet in the Septuagint, it is not more then
Watchmen; in the Chaldie, Cappadocians; in Symmachus, Medes;
Theodotion of old, and Tremellius of late, have retained the Textua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
word, and so have the Italian, French, and English Translatours,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50218:113"/>
that is, the men of Arvad were upon thy walles round about, and the
Gammadims were in thy towers.</p>
               <p>Nor doe men onely dissent in the Translation of the word, but in the
exposition of the sense and meaning thereof, for some by Gamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dims
understand a people of Syria, so called from the city Gamala;
some hereby understand the Cappadocians, many the Medes, and
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reof Forerius hath a singular exposition, conceivng the watchmen
of Tyre, who might well bee called Pigmies, the towers of that City
being so high, that unto men below they appeared in a cubitall stature;
others expounded it quite contrary to common acception that is not
men of the least, but of the larg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st size; so doth Cornelius construe
<hi>Pygmaei</hi> or <hi>viri cubitales,</hi> that is not men of a cubit high, but of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
stature, whose height like that of Giants is rather to be taken by
the cubit then the foot; in which phrase we read the measure of Goliah
whose height is said to be six cubits and a span: of affinity hereto is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the exposition of Jerom, not taking Pygmies for Dwarffes, but
stout and valiant Champions; not taking that sense of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which
signifies the cubit measure, but that which expresseth pugills, that is,
men fit for combat and the exercise of the fist: Thus can there bee no
satisfying illation from this text, the diversity or rather contrariety of
Expositions and Interpretations, distracting more then confirming the
truth of the story.</p>
               <p>Againe, I say exact testimonies in reference unto its circumstantiall
relations so diversly or contrarily delivered; thus the relation of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
placeth above Aegypt towards the head of Nyle in Africa; Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostratus
affirmes they are about Ganges in Asia, and Pliny in a third
place, that is Geravia in Scythia: some write they fight with Cranes,
but Menecles in Atheneus affirmes they fight with Partridges, some
say they ride on Partridges, and some on the backs of Rams.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I say confirmed testimonies; for though <hi>Paulus Iovius</hi> delivers
there are Pygmies beyond Japan, Pigafe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

slow perswasion; and wise men may thinke there is as much reallity in
the Pygmies of Paracelsus; that is, his non-Adamicall men, or middle
natures betwixt men and spirits.</p>
               <p>There being thus no sufficient confirmation of their verity, some
doubt may arise concerning their possibility; wherein, since it is not
defined in what dimensions the soule may exercise her faculties, wee
shall not conclude impossibility, or that there might not be a race of
Pygmies, as there is sometimes of Giants; and so may we take in the
opinion of Austine, and his Comment Ludovicus; but to beleeve they
should be in the stature of a foot or span, requires the preaspection of
such a one as Philetas the Poet in Athenaeus, who was faine to fasten

               <head type="sub">Of the great Climactericall yeare, that is sixty three.</head>
               <p>CErtainly the eyes of the understanding, and those of sense are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
deceived in their greatest objects; the sense apprehending
them in lesser magnitudes then their dimensions require; so it behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the Sunne, the Starres, and the Earth it selfe; but the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quite otherwise, for that ascribeth unto many things far larger ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizons
then their due circumscriptions require, and receiveth them
with amplifications which their reallity will not admit: thus hath it
fared with many Heroes and most worthy persons, who being suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
commendable from true and unquestionable merits, have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
advancement from falshood and the fruitfull stocke of fables:
Thus hath it happened unto the stars and luminaries of heaven, who
being sufficiently admirable in themselves have been set out by effects
no way dependent on their efficiencies, and advanced by amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the questioning of their true endowments: Thus is it not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it hath also fared with number, which though wonderfull in it
selfe, and sufficiently magnifyable from its demonstrable affections,
hath yet received adjections of admiration from the multiplying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
of men, and stands laden with additions which its equity will not
admit.</p>
               <p>And so perhaps hath it happened unto the number 7. and 9. which
multiplyed into themselves doe make up 63. commonly esteemed the
great Climactericall of our lives; for the dayes of men are usually cast
up by septenaries, and every seventh yeare conceived to carry some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
character with it, either in the temper of body, minde, or both;
but among all other, three are most remarkable, that is 7. times 7. or
forty nine, 9. times 9. or eighty one, and 7. times 9. or the yeare of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50218:114"/>
sixty three; which is conceived to carry with it, the most considerable
fatality, and consisting of both the other numbers was apprehended to
comprise the vertue of either, is therefore expected and entertained
with feare, and esteemed a favour of fate to passe it over; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
many suspect to be but a Panick terrour, and men to feare
they justly know not what; and for my owne part, to speake indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
I finde no satisfaction, nor any sufficiency in the received
grounds to establish a rationall feare.</p>
               <p>Now herein to omit Astrologicall considerations (which are but
rarely introduced) the popular foundation whereby it hath continued is
first, the extraordinary power and secret vertue conceived to attend
these numbers, whereof we must confesse there have not wanted not
onely especiall commendations, but very singular conceptions. Among
Philosophers, Pythagoras seemes to have played the leading part,
which was long after continued by his disciples, and the Italicke
Schoole, the Philosophy of Plato, and most of the Platonists abound
in numerall considerations; above all Philo the learned Jew, hath
acted this part even to superstition, bestowing divers pages in summing
up every thing which might advantage this number: All which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
when a serious Reader shall perpend, hee will hardly
finde any thing that may convince his judgement or any further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade,
then the lenity of his belief, or prejudgement of reason inclineth.</p>
               <p>For first, not only the number of 7 and 9 from considerations ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse
have been extolled by most, but all or most of the other digits
have been as mystically applauded by many; or the number of one
and three have not been only admired by the heathens, but from ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
grounds, the untiy of God, and mystery of the Trinity admired
by many Christians. The number of foure stands much admired
not only in the quaternity of the Elements, which are the principles of
bodies, but in the letters of the name of God, which in the Greeke,
Arabian, Persian, Hebrew, and Aegyptian, consisteth of that number;
and was so venerable among the Pythagoreans, that they swore by the
number foure. That of six hath found many leaves in its favour, not
only for the dayes of the Creation, but its naturall consideration, as
being a perfect number, and the first that is compleated by its parts;
that is, the sixt, the half, and the third, 1. 2. 3. which drawn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

make six: The number of ten hath been as highly extolled, as containing
even, odde, long and plaine, quadrate and cubicall numbers; and Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
observed with admiration, that Barbarians as well as Greeks, did
use a numeration unto Ten; which being so generall was not to be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
casuall, but to have a foundation in nature: So that only 7 and 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
all the rest have had their Elogies, as may be observed at large in Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diginus,
and in severall Writers since: every one extolling number, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his subject, &amp; as it advantaged the present discourse in hand.</p>

of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is now demonstrable unto sense, that there are many
more, as Galileo hath declared in his <hi>Nuncius Sydereus;</hi> that is two more

Jupiter: and the like may be said of the Pleiades or 7 Starres, which

are no lesse then forty.</p>
               <p>That the heavens are encompassed with 7 circles, is also the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Summer and Winter Tropicks, the Aequator, Zodiack and the milky
circle, whereas by Astronomers they are received in greater number;
for though we leave out the Lacteous circle (which Aratus, Geminus,
and Proclus out of him hath numbred among the rest) yet are there
more by foure then Philo mentions, that is, the Horizon, Meridian and
both the Colures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> circles very considerable and generally delivered,
not only by Ptolomie and the Astronomers since his time, but such as
flourished long before, as Hipparchus and Eudoxus: So that for ought
I know, if it make for our purpose, or advance the theme in hand, with
equall liberty, we may affirme there were 7 Sybills, or but 7 signes in
the Zodiack circle of heaven.</p>

hee should have tearmed them thrice happy, herein exceeding that

drawne from the motions of the Moone, supposed to bee

measured by sevens, yet will not this advance the same before its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
numbers; for hereby the motion of others are not measured, the
fixed Starres by many thousand yeares, the Sunne by 365. dayes, the
superiour Planets by more, the inferiour by somewhat lesse: and if we
consider the revolution of the first Moveable, &amp; the daily motion from
East to West, common unto all the orbs, we shall find it measured by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
number; for being performed in four &amp; twenty hours, it is made

Againe, months are not onely Lunary, and measured by the Moon,
but also Solary, and determined by the motion of the Sun, that is, the
space wherein the Sun doth passe 30. degrees of the Eccliptick; by
this month Hippocrates computed the time of the Infants gestation in
the wombe, for 9. times 30. that is, 270. dayes, or compleat 9. months
make up forty weeks the common compute of women, and this is to
be understood in his booke <hi>De octimestripartu,</hi> when he saith, 2. dayes
makes the fifteenth, and 3. the tenth part of a month; this was the
month of the ancient Hebrewes before their departure out of Aegypt;
and hereby the compute will fall out right, and the account concurre,
when in one place it is said, the waters of the flood prevayled an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty dayes, and in another it is delivered, that they prevailed
from the seventeenth day of the second month, unto the seventeenth
day of the seventh: and as for weeks, although in regard of their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths
they were observed by the Hebrewes, yet is it not apparent, the
ancient Greeks, or Romans used any, but had another division of their
months into Ides, Nones, and Calends.</p>
               <p>Moreover, months howsoever taken are not exactly divisible into
septuaries or weeks, which fully containe seven dayes, whereof foure
times do make compleatly twenty eight; for, beside the usuall or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendary
month, there are but foure considerable, that is, the month of
Peragration, of Apparition, of Consecution, and the medicall or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretoriall
month, whereof some come short, others exceed this account.
A month of Peragration, is the time of the Moones revolution from
any part of the Zodiack, unto the same againe, and this containeth but
27. dayes, and about 8. howres, which commeth short to compleat the
septenary account. The month of Consecution, or as some will terme
it, of Progression, is the space betweene one conjunction of the Moon
with the Sun unto another, and this containeth 29. dayes and an halfe;
for the Moone returning unto the same point wherein it was kindled
by the Sun, and not finding it there againe,(for in the meane time, by
its proper motion it hath passed through 2. signes) it followeth after,
and attaines the Sun in the space of 2. dayes, and 4. howres more,
which added unto the account of Peragration, makes 29. dayes and an
halfe; so that this month exceedeth the latitude of Septenaries, and

Apparition, is the space wherein the Moone appeareth, (deducting
three dayes wherein it commonly disappeareth; and being in combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
with the Sun, is presumed of lesse activity) and this containeth but
26. dayes, and 12. howres. The Medicall month not much excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
this, consisting of 26. dayes, and 22. howres, and it made up out
of all the other months; for if out of 29. and an halfe, the month of
Consecution, we deduct 3. dayes of disappearance, there will remaine
the month of Apparition 26. dayes, and 12. howres, whereto if wee
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50218:116"/>
adde 27. dayes and 8. howres, the month of Peragration, there will
arise 53. dayes and 10. howres, which divided by 2. makes 26. dayes
and 22. howres, called by Physitians the medicall month; introduced
by Galen against Archigenes, for the better compute of Decretory or
Criticall dayes.</p>
               <p>As for criticall dayes, (such I meane wherein upon a decertation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the disease and nature, there ensueth a sensible alteration, either
to life, or death) the reasons thereof are rather deduced from Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
then Arithmetick; for accounting from the beginning of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
and reckoning on unto the seventh day, the Moone will be in a
Tetragonall or Quadrate aspect, that is, 4. signes removed from that
wherein the disease began; in the 14. day it will bee in an opposite
aspect, and at the end of the third septenary Tetragonall againe, as will
most graphically appeare in the figures of Astrologers, especially Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas
Gauricus, <hi>De diebus decretoriis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, (beside that computing by the medicall month the first
hebdomade or septenary consists of 6. dayes, 17. howres and an halfe,
the second happeth in 13. dayes and eleven howres, and the third but
in the twentieth naturall day) what Galen first, and Aben-Ezra since
observed in his Tract of Criticall dayes, in regard of Eccentricity and
the Epicycle or lesser orbe wherein it moveth, the motion of the
Moone is various and unequall, whereby the criticall account must also
vary: for though its middle motion be equall, and of 13. degrees, yet
in the other it moveth sometimes fifteene, sometimes lesse then twelve;
for moving in the upper part of its orbe, it performeth its motion more
slowly then in the lower, insomuch that being at the height it arriveth
at the Tetragonall and opposite signes sooner, and the Criticall day
will be in 6. and 13. and being at the lowest, the criticall account will
be out of the latitude of 7. nor happen before the 8. or ninth day, which
are considerations not to be neglected in the compute of decretory
dayes, and manifestly declare that other numbers must have a respect
here in as well as 7. and fourteene.</p>
               <p>Lastly, some things to this intent are deduced from holy Scripture;
thus is the yeare of Jubilie introduced to magnifie this number, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a yeare made out of 7. times 7. wherein notwithstanding there may
be a misapprehension; for this ariseth not from 7. times 7. that is, 49.
but was observed the fiftieth yeare, as is expressed, Levit. 25. And you
shall hallow the fiftieth yeare, a Jubilie shall that fiftieth yeare be unto
you; answerable whereto is the exposition of the Jews themselves,
as is delivered by Ben-maimon, that is, the yeare of Jubilie commeth
not into the account of the years of 7. but the forty ninth is the Release,
and the fiftieth the yeare of Jubilie. Thus is it also esteemed no small
advancement unto this number, that the Genealogy of our Saviour is
summed up by 14. that is, this number doubled, according as is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50218:117"/>
Mat. 1. So all the generations from Abraham to David are foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
generations, and from David unto the carrying away into Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
are foureteene generations, and from the carrying away into Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
unto Christ, are fourteene generations, which neverthelesse
must not be strictly understood as numerall relations require; for from
David unto Jeconiah are accounted by Matthew but 14. generations,
whereas according to the exact account in the history of Kings, there
were at least 17. and 3. in this account, that is, Ahazias, Joas, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazias
are left out: for so it is delivered by the Evangelist; And Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
begat Ozias, whereas in the Regall genealogy there are 3. succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
betweene, for Ozias or Uzziah, was the son of Amazias, Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zias
of Joas, Joas of Azariah, and Azariah of Joram, so that in strict
account Joram was the Abavus or grandfather twice removed, and
not the father of Ozias, and these omitted descents made a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
measure of time, in the Royall chronology of Judah; for
though Azariah reigned but one yeare, yet Joas reigned forty, and
Amazias no lesse then nine and twenty: However therefore these were
delivered by the Evangelist, and carry no doubt an incontroulable
conformity unto the intention of his delivery, yet are they not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto precise numerality, nor strictly to be drawne unto the rigid
test of numbers.</p>
               <p>Lastly, though many things have beene delivered by Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
number, and they transferred unto the advantage of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet are they oftimes otherwise to be understood, then as they are
vulgarly received in active and causall considerations; they being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times delivered Hieroglyphically metaphorically, illustratively,
and not with reference unto action, or causality. True it is, that God
made all things in number, weight, and measure, yet nothing by them
or through the efficacy of either; Indeed our dayes, actions, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being measured by time (which is but motion measured) what
ever is observable in any, falls under the account of some number;
which notwithstanding cannot be denominated the cause of those
events; and so doe we injustly assigne the power of Action even unto
Time it self, nor doe they speake properly who say that Time consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
all things; for Time is not effective, nor are bodies destroyed by
it, but from the action and passion of their Elements in it, whose account
it onely affordeth, and measuring out their motion, informes us in their
periods and termes of their duration, rather then effecteth, or physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
produceth the same.</p>
               <p>A second consideration which promoteth this opinion, are confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
drawne from Writers, who have made observations or set
downe favourable reasons for this climacteriall yeare; so have <hi>Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus

                  </gap>sly treating of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mactericall
dayes, hee thus delivereth himselfe: Some maintaine that
7. times 7. that is, 49. is most dangerous of any other, and this is the
most generall opinion, others unto 7. times 7. adde 9. times 9. that is,
the yeare of 81. both which consisting of square and quadrate num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
were thought by Plato and others to bee of great consideration;
as for this year of 63. or 7. times 9. though some esteeme it of most
danger, yet do I conceive it lesse dangerous then the other; for though
it containeth both numbers above named, that is, 7. and 9. yet neither
of them square or quadrate, and as it is different from them both, so is it
not potent in either: Nor is this yeare remarkable in the death of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
famous men. I finde indeed that Aristotle dyed this yeare, but hee
by the vigour of his minde, a long time sustained a naturall infirmitie
of stomack, that it was a greater wonder he attained unto 63. then that
he lived no longer: The Psalme of Moses hath mentioned a yeare of
danger differing from all these: and that is ten times 7. or seventie; for
so it is said, The dayes of Man are threescore and ten; and the very
same is affirmed by Solon, as Herodotus relates in a speech of his unto
C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aesus, <hi>Ego annis septuaginta humanae vitae modum definio:</hi> and surely
that yeare most be of greatest danger, which is the Period of all the
rest, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ewest safely passe thorow that, which is set as a bound for
few or none to passe; and therefore the consent of elder times, setling
their conceits upon Climacters, not onely differing from this of ours,
but an another, though severall nations and ages do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ancy unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
different years of danger, yet every one expects the same event,
and constant veritie in either.</p>
               <p>Againe, though Varro divided the dayes of man into five portions,
Hippocrates into 7. and Solon into ten; yet probably their divisions
were to be received with latitude, and their considerations not strictly
to be confined unto their last unities: So when Varro extendeth <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritia</hi>
unto 15. <hi>Adolescentia</hi> unto 30. <hi>Iuventus</hi> unto 35. there is a large
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50218:118"/>
latitude betweene the termes or Periods of compute, and the veritie
holds good in the accidents of any yeeres betweene them: So when
Hippocrates divideth our life into 7. degrees or stages, and maketh the
end of the first 7. of the second 14. of the third 28. of the fourth 35. of
the fift 47. of the sixt 56. and of the seventh, the last yeare when ever
it happeneth; herein we may observe he maketh not his divisions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
by 7. and 9. and omits the great Climactericall; beside there is
between every one at least the latitude of 7. yeares, in which space or
intervall, that is either in the third or fourth yeere, what ever falleth
out is equally verified of the whole degree, as though it had happened
in the seventh. Solon divided it into ten Septenaries, because in every
one thereof, a man received some sensible mutation, in the first is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentition
or falling of teeth: in the second Pubescence, in the third the
beard groweth, in the fourth strength prevailes, in the fift maturitie for
issue; in the sixth Moderation of appetite, in the seventh, Prud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce, &amp;c.
Now herein there is a tolerable latitude, and though the division pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
by 7 yet is not the totall veritie to be restrained unto the last year,
nor constantly to be expected the beard should be compleat at 21. or
wisedome acquired just in 49. and thus also though 7. times 9. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
one of those septenaries, and doth also happen in our declining
yeares, yet might the events thereof be imputed unto the whole septe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie;
and be more reasonably entertained with some latitude, then
strictly reduced unto the last number, or all the accidents from 56.
imputed unto 63.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, although this opinion many seeme confirmed by observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and men may say it hath been so observed, yet we speake also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
experience, and doe beleeve that men from observation will collect
no satisfaction: that other yeares may be taken against it, especially if
they have the advantage to precede it; as sixty againe 63. and 63. again
66. for fewer attaine to the latter then the former; and so surely in the
first septenarie doe most die, and probably also in the very f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>st yeare,
for all that ever lived were in the account of that yeare; beside the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
that attend it are so many, and the body that receives them so
confirmed, we scarce count any alive that is not past it.</p>
               <p>Franciscus Paduanius in his worke <hi>De catena temporis,</hi> discoursing
of the great Climactericall, attempts a numeration of eminent men,
who dyed in that yeare; but in so small a number, as not sufficient to
make a considerable Induction; he mentioneth but foure, Diogenes
Cynicus, Dionysius Heracleoticus, Xenocrates Platonicus, and
Plato: as for Dionysius, as Censorinus witnesseth, hee famished
himselfe in the 82. yeare of his life; Xenocrates by the testimony
of Laertius fell into a cauldron, and dyed the same yeare; and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes
the Cynicke by the same testimony lived almost unto ninetie:
The date of Platoes death is not exactly agreed on, but all dissent from
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50218:118"/>
this which he determineth; Neanthes in Laertius extendeth his dayes
unto 84. Suidas unto 82. but Hermippus defineth his death in 81. and
this account seemeth most exact; for if, as hee delivereth, Plato was
borne in the 88. Olympiade, and dyed in the first yeare of the 108. the
account will not surpasse the year of 81. and so in his death he verified
the opinion of his life, and of the life of man, whose Period, as Censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus
recordeth, he placed in the Quadrate of 9. or 9. times 9. that is, 81.
and therefore as Seneca delivereth, the Magicians at Athens did sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
unto him, as declaring in his death somewhat above humanity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he dyed in the day of his nativity, and without deduction justly
accomplished the year of eighty one. Bodine I confesse delivers a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
list of men that died in this yeare, whose words in his methode o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thomas Linacer, <hi>codem anno Cicero caesus est:</hi> wherein beside that it
were no difficult point to make a larger Catalogue of memorable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that dyed in other yeares, wee cannot but doubt the verity of his
Induction: as for Silvius and Alexander, which of that name he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
I know not; but for Chrysippus by the testimony of Laertius, hee
dyed in the 73. year, Bocatius in the 62. Linacer the 64. and Erasmus
exceeded 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. as Paulus Jovius hath delivered in his Elogie of learned
men; and as for Cicero, as Plutarch in his life affirmeth, he was slain in
the year of 64. and therefore sure the question is hard set, and we have
no easie reason to doubt, when great and entire Authors shall introduce
injustifiable examples, and authorize their assertions by what is not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they which proceed upon strict numerations, and will by
such regular and determined wayes measure out the lives of men, and
periodically define the alterations of their tempers; conceive a regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in mutations, with an equalitie in constitutions, and forget that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
which Physitians therein discover: For seeing we affirm that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

                  </gap>o reasonably affixe
unto them all one common point of danger, but should rather assigne a
respective fatality unto each: which is concordant unto the doctrine of
the numerists, and such as maintaine this opinion: for they affirme that
one number respecteth men, another women, as Bodin explaining that
of Seneca, <hi>Septimus quis<expan>
                        <am>

               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, since we esteeme this opinion to have some ground in nature,
and that nine times seven revolutions of the Sunne, imprints a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50218:119"/>
Character on such as arive unto it; it will leave some doubt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
in what subjection hereunto were the lives of our forefathers
presently after the flood, and more especially before it, who attaining
unto 8. or 900. yeares, had not their Climacters computable by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gits,
or as we doe account them; for the great Climactericall was past
unto them before they begat children, or gave any Testimony of their
virilitie; for we read not that any begat children before the age of six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
five, and this may also afford a hint to enquire, what are the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macters
of other animated creatures, whereof the lives of some attaine
not so farre as this of ours, and that of others extends a considerable
space beyond.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the imperfect accounts that men have kept of time, and the
difference thereof both in the same and divers common wealths, will
much distract the certainty of this assertion; for though there were a
fatality in this yeare, yet divers were, and others might bee out in their
account, aberring severall wayes from the true and just compute, and
calling that one yeare, which perhaps might be another.</p>
               <p>For first they might be out in the commencement or beginning of
their accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for every man is many moneths elder then he computeth;
for although we begin the same from our nativitie, and conceive that
no arbitrary, but naturall terme of compute, yet for the duration of life,
or existence, wee participate in the wombe the usuall distinctions of
time, and are not to bee exempted from the account of age and life,
where we are subject to diseases, and often suffer death; and therefore
Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Diocles, Avicenna and others, have set upon
us, numerall relations and temporall considerations in the wombe; not
only affirming the birth of the seventh moneth to be vitall, that of the
eighth mortall, but the progression thereto to be measured by rule, and
to hold a proportion unto motion and formation; as what receiveth
motion in the seventh, is perfected in the Triplicities; that is the time of
conformation unto motion is double, and that from motion unto the
birth, treble; So what is formed the 35. day is moved the seaventy, and
borne the 210. day; and therefore if any invisible causalitie there be,
that after so many yeares doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whether its activitie onely set out at our nativitie, and begin not
rather in the womb, wherein we place the like considerations, which
doth not only entangle this assertion, but hath already embroiled the
endeavours of Astrology in the erection of Schemes, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  </gap>e no small difficulty, and if we shall strictly consider it, many
have been and still may bee mistaken; for neither the motion of the
Moone, whereby months are computed, nor of the Sunne whereby
yeares are accounted consisteth of whole numbers, but admits of fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and broken parts, as we have declared of the Moone. That of the
Sunne consisteth of 365. dayes, and almost 6 houres, that is wanting
eleven minutes; which 6 houres omitted, or not taken notice of, will in
processe of time largely deprave the compute; and this is the occasion
of the Bissextile of leapyeare, which was not observed in all times, nor
punctually in all Common-wealths; so that in 63. yeares there may be
lost almost 18. dayes, omitting the intercalation of one day every
fourth yeare, allowed for this quadrant, or 6 houres supernumerary:
and though the same were observed, yet to speake strictly a man may
be somewhat out in the account of his age at 63. for although every
fourth yeare we insert one day, and so fetch up the quadrant, yet those
eleven minutes whereby the yeare comes short of perfect 6 houres,
will in the circuit of those yeares arise unto certaine houres, and in a
larger progression of time unto certaine dayes, whereof at present wee
finde experience in the Calender we observe; for the Julian yeare of
365. dayes being eleven minutes larger then the annuall revolution of
the Sunne, there will arise an anticipation in the Aequinoxes, and as
Junctinus computeth in every 136. yeare they will anticipate almost
one day; and therefore those ancient men and Nestors of old times,
which yearly observed their nativities, might be mistaken in the day;
nor that to be construed without a graine of Salt, which is delivered by
Moses in the Booke of Exodus, At the end of foure hundred yeares,
even the selfe same day, all the hoast of Israell went out of the land of
Aegypt; for in that space of time the Equinoxes had anticipated, and
the eleven minutes had amounted far above a day; and this compute
rightly considered will fall fouler on them who cast up the lives of
Kingdomes, and summe up their duration by particular numbers as
Plato first began, and some have endeavoured since by perfect and
sphericall numbers by the square and cube of 7 and 9 and 12, the great
number of Plato: wherein indeed Bodine hath attempted a particular
enumeration, whereby notwithstanding beside the mistakes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
in the solary compute of yeares, the difference of Chronologie
disturbes the satisfaction and quiet of his computes, some adding, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
detracting, and few punctually according in any one yeare,
whereby indeed such accounts should be made up, for the variation in
one unity destroyes the totall illation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the compute may be unjust not only in a strict acception,
or few dayes or houres, but in the latitude also of some yeares, and this
may happen from the different compute of yeares in divers Nations,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50218:120"/>
and even such as did maintaine the most probable way of account, their
yeare being not only different from one another, but the civill and
common account disagreeing much from the naturall yeare, whereon
the consideration is founded: Thus from the testimony of Herodotus,
Censorinus and others, the Greeks observed the Lunary yeare, that is,
twelve revolutions of the Moone 354. dayes, but the Aegyptians, and
many others adhered unto the Solary account, that is, 365. dayes, that
is eleven dayes longer; now hereby the account of the one would very
much exceed the other: A man in the one would account himselfe 63.
when one in the other would thinke himselfe but 61. and so although
their nativities were under the same houre, yet did they at different
yeares believe the verity of that which both esteemed affixed and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
unto one: The like mistake there is in a tradition of our dayes;
men conceiving a peculiar danger in the beginning dayes of May,
which are set out as a fatall period unto consumptions and Cronicall
diseases; wherein notwithstanding w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> compute by Calenders, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
different from our ancestors, but one another, the compute of the
one anticipating that of the other; so that while wee are in Aprill,
others begin May, and the danger is past unto one, while it beginneth
with another.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, men were not only out in the number of some dayes, the
latitude of a few yeares, but might be wide by whole Olympiades and
divers Decades of yeares; for as Censorinus relateth, the ancient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians
observed a yeare of three months, the Carians of six, the Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
of foure; and as Diodorus and Xenophon, <hi>de Aequivocis</hi> allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,
the ancient Aegyptians have used a yeare of three, two, and one
month, so that the Climactericall was not only different unto those
Nations, but unreasonably distant from ours; for 63. will passe in their
account, before they arive so high as ten in ours.</p>
               <p>Nor if we survey the account of Rome it selfe, may we doubt they
were mistaken, and if they feared climactericall yeares might erre in
their numeration; for the civill yeare whereof the people took notice,
did sometime come short, and sometimes exceed the naturall; for as it
appeares by Varro, Suetonius, and Censorinus, their yeare consisted
first of ten months which comprehended by 304. dayes, that is 61.
lesse then ours containeth; after by Numa or Tarquine from a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
conceit of impariety were added 51. dayes, which made 355.
one day more then twelve revolutions of the Moone; and thus a long
time it continued, the civill compute exceeding the naturall; the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
whereof, and the due ordering of the leap-yeare was referred
unto the Pontifices, who either upon favour or malice, that some
might continue their offices a longer or shorter time, or from the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
of the yeare that men might bee advantaged or endamaged in
their contracts, by arbitrary intercalations they depraved the whole
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50218:120"/>
account; of this abuse Cicero accused Verres, which at last proceeded
so farre that when Julius Caesar came unto that office before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
hereof he was faine to insert two intercalary months unto No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember
and December, when he had already inserted 23. dayes unto
February; so that that year consisted of 445. dayes; a quarter of a year
longer then that we observe, and though at the last the year was refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
yet in the meane time they might be out, wherein notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they summed up Climactericall observations.</p>
               <p>Lastly, one way more there may be of mistake, and that not unusu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
among us, grounded upon a double compute of the yeare; the one
beginning from the 25. of March, the other from the day of our birth
unto the same againe, which is the naturall account: Now hereupon
many men doe frequently miscast their dayes; for in their age they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the account not from the day of their birth, but the yeare of our
Lord, wherein they were borne; so a man that was borne in January,
1582. if hee live to fall sicke in the latter end of March, 2645. will
summe up his age, and say I am now 63. and in my Climactericall and
dangerous yeare, for I was borne in the yeare 1582. and now it is
1645. whereas indeed he wanteth many months of that yeare, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the true and naturall account unto his birth, and accounteth two
months for a year: and though the length of time and accumulation of
yeares doe render the mistake insensible, yet is it all one, as if one
borne in January 1644. should be accounted a yeare old the 25. of
March, 1645.</p>
               <p>All which perpended, it may be easily perceived with what insecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ity
of truth we adhere unto this opinion, ascribing not only effects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on the naturall period of time unto arbitrary calculations, and
such as vary at pleasure, but confirming our tenents by the uncertaine
account of others and our selves; there being no positive or indispute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

might and have been severall wayes mistaken, the best in some lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
others in greater, according to the different compute of divers
states, the short and irreconcilable yeares of some, the exceeding error
in the naturall frame of others, and the lapses and false deductions of

                  </gap>, the Latines <hi>Canis major,</hi> and wee emphatically the Dog-Starre.</p>
               <p>Now from the rising of this starre not cosmically, that is with the
Sun, but Heliacally, that is, its emersion from the rayes of the Sunne,
the Ancients computed their canicular dayes; concerning which there
generally passeth an opinion, that during those dayes, all medication
or use of Physick is to be declined, and the cure committed unto Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore as though there were any feriation in nature or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiums
imaginable in professions, whose subject is naturall, and under
no intermissive, but constant way of mutation; this season is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
termed the Physitians vacation, and stands so received by most men:
which conceit however generall, is not onely erroneous, but unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and subsisting upon foundations either false, uncertaine, mistaken,
or misapplied, deserves not of mankinde that indubitable assent it
findeth.</p>
               <p>For first, which seemes to be the ground of this assertion, and not
to be drawne into question, that is, the magnified quality of this Starre
conceived to cause or intend the heat of this season, whereby these
dayes become more observable then the rest, we finde that wiser An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
was not of this opinion, which seven hundred yeares agoe was
as a vulgar error rejected by Geminus, a learned Mathematician in his
Elements of Astronomy; wherein he plainly affirmeth, that common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
made that a cause, which was at first observed but as a sign. The
rising &amp; setting both of this Star &amp; others being observed by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
to denote &amp; testifie certain points of mutation, rather then concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to induce or effect the same; For our forefathers, saith he, observing
the course of the Sun, and marking certaine mutations to happen in his
progresse through particular parts of the Zodiack, they registred and
set them downe in their Parapegmes, that is, certaine Astronomicall
Canons, as Rhodiginus out of Vitruvius interprets it; and being not
able to designe these times by dayes, months, or yeares, (the compute
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50218:121"/>
thereof, and the beginning of the yeare being different, according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
different Nations) they thought best to settle a generall account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all, and to determine these alterations by some known and invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
signes; and such did they conceave the rising and setting of the
fixed Stars; not ascribing thereto any part of causality, but notice and
signification; and thus much seemes implyed in that expression of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
when speakeing of the Dog-star, he concludeth—<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>Malum autem signum est;</hi> the same as Petavius observeth, is
implyed in the word of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>olomy, and the Ancients, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
that is, of the signification of star<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es. The terme of Scripture also fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
it, as that of Isaiah, <hi>Nolite timere à signis coeli,</hi> and that in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
<hi>Vt sint in signa &amp; tempora:</hi> Let there be lights in the firmament, and
let them be for signes and for seasons.</p>
               <p>But if all were silent, Galen hath explained this point unto the life,
who expounding the reason why Hippocrates declared the affections
of the yeare by the rising and setting of stars, it was saith he, because he
would proceed on signes and principles best knowne unto all Nations;
and upon his words, in the first of the Epidemicks, <hi>In Thaso Autumno
circa Equinoxium &amp; subvirgilias pluviae erant multae,</hi> he thus enlargeth:
I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> (saith he) the same compute of times and months were observed by
all Nations, Hippocrates had never made any mention either of
Arcturus, Pleiades, or the Dog-star, but would have plainely said, In
Macedonia, in the month Dion, thus or thus was the ayre disposed;
but for as much as the month Dion is onely knowne unto the Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
but obscure unto the Athenians, and other Nations, he found
more generall distinctions of time, and instead of naming months,
would usually say, at the Aequinox, the rising of the Pleiades, or the
Dog-star: And by this way did the Ancients devide the seasons of the
yeare, the Autumne, Winter, Spring, and Summer, by the rising of
the Pleiades, denoting the beginning of Summer, and by that of the
Dog-star, the declination thereof; by this way Aristotle through all
his bookes of Animals, distinguisheth their times of generation Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy,
migration, sanity and venation; and this were an allowable and
generall way of compute, and still to be retained, were the site of the
stars as inalterable, and their ascents as invariable as primitive Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
conceaved them: And therefore though Aristotle frequently
mentioneth this starre, and particularly affirmeth that fishes in the
Bosphorus are best to be catched from the arise of the Dog-starre, must
we conceave the same a meere effect thereof? Nor though Scaliger
from hence be willing to inferre the efficacy of this starre, are wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
hereto; except because the same Philosopher affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>meth; that
Tunny is fat about the rising of the Pleiades, and departs upon Arctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
or that most insects are latent, from the setting of the 7. starres;
except, I say, he give us also leave to inferre that these particular effects
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50218:122"/>
and alterations proceed from those stars, which were indeed but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signations
of such quarters and portions of the yeare, wherein the same
were observed: Now what Pliny affirmeth of the Orix, that it seemeth
to adore this star, and taketh notice thereof by voyce and sternutation,
untill wee be better assured of its verity, wee shall not salve the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what slender opinion the Ancients held of the efficacy of
this starre is declarable from their compute; for as Geminus affirmeth,
and Petavius his learned Comment proveth, they began their account
from its Heliacall emersion, and not its cosmicall ascent; The cosmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ascension of a starre we terme that, when it ariseth together with
the Sun, or the same degree of the Ecliptick wherein the Sun abideth;
and that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eliacall, when a starre which before for the vicinity of
the Sun was not visible, being further removed beginneth to appeare:
for the annuall motion of the Snn from West to East being far swif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er
then that of the fixed stars, he must of necessity leave them on the East
whilst he hastneth forward, and obscureth others to the West: and so
the Moone who performes its motion swifter then the Sun, (as may be
observed in their Conjunctions and E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ipses) gets Eastward out of his
rayes, and appeares when the Sun is set; if therefore the Dog-star had
this effectuall heat which is ascribed unto it, it would afford best evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
thereof, and the season would be most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervent, when it ariseth
in the probablest place of its activity, that is, the cosmicall ascent, for
therein it ariseth with the Sun, and is included in the same irradiation:
but the time observed by the Ancients was long after this ascent, and
in the Heliacall emersion, when it becomes at greatest distance from
the Sun, neither rising with it nor neere it; and therefore, had they
conceived any more then a bare signality in this Star, or ascribed the
heat of the season thereunto, they would not have computed from its
Heliacall ascent which was of inferiour efficacy, nor imputed the veh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of heat unto those points wherein it was more remisse, and
where with lesse probability they might make out its action.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, although we derive the authority of these dayes from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
of the Ancients, yet are our computes very different, and
such as confirme not each other, for whereas they observed it Heliacal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we observe it Cosmically; for before it ariseth Heliacally unto our
la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itude, the Summer is even at an end: Againe, we compute not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from different ascents, but also from divers starres; they from the
greater Dog-star<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we from the lesser; they from Orio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irius, we from Procyon; for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Dog-dayes with us is set downe the 19. of July, at which
time the lesser Dog-star ariseth with the Sun, whereas the starre of the
greater D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g ascendeth not untill about the 31. of July, in the 18. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Leo; and the joynt compute by both is onely justifiable in the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50218:122"/>
latitude of 30. degrees where both these starres arise together. So that
their observations confirme not ours, nor ours theirs, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
each other, computing from different foundations, and translating
at pleasure the effects and power of one starre unto another.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, (which is the Argument of Gem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>us) were there any
such effectuall heat in this starre, yet could it but weakly evidence
the same in Summer, it being about 40. degrees distant from the
Sun, and should rather manifest its warming power in the winter, when
it remaines conjoyned with the Sun in its Hybernall conversion; for
about the 29. of October, and in the 16. of Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pius, and so againe in
January the Sunne performes his revolution in the same parallell with
the Dogge-starre; Againe, if wee should impute the heat of this sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
unto the cooperation of any starres with the Sunne, it seemes more
favourable for our times, to ascribe the same unto the constellation of
Leo; where besides that the Sunne is in his proper house, it is conjoined
with many starres, whereof two of the first magnitude, and in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
of August is corporally conjoyned with Basiliscus, a starre of eminent
name in Astrologie, and seated in the very Eclipticke.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, if all were granted, that observation and reason were also for
it, and were it an undeniable truth that an effectuall se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vour proceeded
from this starre; yet would not the same determine the opinion now in

dayes are in the winter, as unto such as have no latitude, but live in a

from it; for in the one point the Sunne is at the Meridian, before
the Dogge-starre ariseth, in the other the starre is at the Meridian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sunne ascendeth.</p>
               <p>Some latitudes have no canicular dayes at all; as namely all those
which have more then 73. degrees of northerne Elevation, as the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> part of Greenland and Tartarie; for unto that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
the Dogge-starre is invisible, and appeareth not above the
Horizon.</p>
               <p>Unto such Latitudes as it ariseth, it carrieth a various and a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
respect; unto some it ascendeth when Summer is over, whether
we compute Heliacally or Cosmically; for though unto Alexandria
it ariseth in Cancer, it ariseth not unto Biarmia Cosmically before
it bee in Virgo, and Heliacally about the Autum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unto the Latitude of 52. the efficacy thereof is not much consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
whether we consider its ascent, Meridian altitude, or abode
above the Horizon; for it ariseth very late in the yeere, about the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50218:123"/>
of Leo, that is, the 31. of Iuly; Of Meridian Altitude it hath
but 23. degrees, so that it playes but obliquely upon us, and as the Sun
doth about the 23. of January, and lastly his abode above the Horizon
is not great; for in the eighteenth of Leo, the 31. of Iuly, although they
arise together, yet doth it set above 5. houres before the Sun, that is,
before two of the clock, after which time we are more sensible of heat,
then all the day before.</p>
               <p>Scondly, in regard of the variation of the longitude of the starres,
we are to consider (what the Ancients observed not) that the site of the
fixed starres is alterable, and that since elder times they have suffered
a large and considerable variation of their longitudes; the longitude of
a starre to speake plainly, is its distance from the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st point of numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
toward the East, which first point unto the Ancients was the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st, they
have very much varied from this point: The first starre of Aries in the
time of Meton the Athenian was placed in the very intersection, which
is now el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngated and removed Eastward 28. degrees; insomuch that
now the signe of Aries possesseth the place of Taurus, and Taurus that
of Gem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>i; which variation of longitude must very much distract the
opinion of the Dogge-starre, not onely in our dayes, but in times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore
and after; for since the world began it hath arisen in Taurus, and
before it end may have its ascent in Virgo; so that wee must place the
canicular dayes, that is the hottest time of the year in the spring in the
first Age, and in the Autumne in the ages to come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the starres have not onely varied their longitudes, whereby
their ascents have altered; but have also changed their declinations,
whereby their rising at all, that is, their appearing hath varied. The
longitude of a starre wee call its shortest distance from the Aequator.
Now though the poles of the world and the Aequator be immoveable,
yet because the starres in their proper motions, from West to East doe
move upon the poles of the Eclipticke distant 23. degrees and an half
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> poles of the Aequator, and describe circles parallel not unto
the Aequator, but the Eclipticke, they must be therfore sometimes nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,

                  </gap>ometimes removed further from the Aequator: All starres that
have their distance from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Eclipticke Northward not more then 23.
degrees a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d an halfe, which is the greatest distance of the Eclipticke
from the Aequator, may in progression of time have declination South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and move beyond the Aequator: but if any starre hath just this
distance of 23. and an halfe, as hath Cappella on the backe of E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ictho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
it may hereafter move under the Aequinoctiall, and the same will
happen respectively unto starres which have declination Southward:
and therefore many starres may be visible in our Hemisphere, which
are not so at present, and many which are at present, shall take leave of
our Horizon, and appeare unto Southerne habitations; and therefore
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50218:123"/>
the time may come that the Dogge-starre may not be visible in our
Horizon, and the time hath beene, when it hath not shewed it selfe
unto our neighbour latitudes; so that canicular dayes there have beene
none nor shall be, yet certainely in all times some season of the yeare
more notable hot then other.</p>
               <p>Lastly, wee multiply causes in vaine, for the reason hereof wee
need not have recourse unto any starre but the Sunne and the continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of its action: For the Sunne ascending into the Northerne signes,
begetteth first a temperate heat in the ayre, which by his approach
unto the solstice he intendeth, and by continuation increaseth the same
even upon declination; for running over the same degrees again, that is
in Leo, which hee hath done in Taurus, in July which he did in May, he
augmenteth the heat in the later which he began in the first, and easily
intendeth the same by continuation which was well promoted before:
So is it observed that they which dwell between the Tropicks and the
Aequator, have their second summer hotter and more maturative of
fruits then the former: so we observe in the day (which is a short yeer)
the greatest heat about two in the afternoone, when the Sunne is past
the Meridian (which is his diurnall Solstice) and the same is evident
from the Thermometer or observations of the weather-glasse; so are
the colds of the night sharper in the summer about two or three after
midnight, and the frosts in winter stronger about those houres: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the yeare we observe the cold to augment, when the dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to increase, though the Sunne be then ascensive, and returning from
the winter Tropick, and therefore if wee rest not in this reason for the
heat in the declining part of summer, we must discover freezing stars
that may resolve the latter colds of winter, which who ever desires to
invent, let him studie the starres of Andromeda, or the nearer constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Pegasus, which are about that time ascendent.</p>
               <p>It cannot therefore unto reasonable constructions seeme strange, or
savour of singularity that we have examined this point, since the same
hath beene already denyed by some, since the authoritie and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
of the Ancients rightly understood doe not confirme it,
since our present computes are different from those of the Ancients,
whereon notwithstanding they depend; since there is reason against it,
and if all were granted, yet must it be maintained with manifold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints,
farre otherwise then is received; and lastly since from plaine
and naturall principles, the doubt may be fairely salved, and not clapt
up from petitionary foundations and principles unestablished.</p>
               <p>But that which chiefly promoted the consideration of these dayes,
and medically advanced the same, was the doctrine of Hippocrates a
Physition of such repute, that he received a testimony from a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
that might have beene given unto Christ:<note place="margin">Qui <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50218:124"/>
the rising of Starres, especially the Dogge-starre, Arcturus, and
the setting of the Pleiades or seven Starres; from whence notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
wee cannot in generall inferre the efficacie of these Stars,
or coefficacie particular in medications: probably expressing no
more hereby then if hee should have plainely said, especiall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
wee are to take of the hottest time in Summer, of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Autumne and winter, for by the rising and setting of those
starres were these times and seasons defined; and therefore subjoynes
this reason, <hi>Quoniam his temporibus morbi finiuntur,</hi> because at these
times diseases have their ends, as Physitions well know, and hee else
where affirmeth, that seasons determine diseases, beginning in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries,
as the spring the diseases of Autumne, and the summer those
of winter; now (what is very remarkable) whereas in the same place
he adviseth to observe the times of notable mutations, as the Aequinox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and the Solstices, and to decline Medication tenne dayes before and
after, how precisely soever canicular cautions be considered, this is not
observed by Physitions, nor taken notice of by the people. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
should we blindly obey the restraints both of Physitions and
Astrologers, we should contract the liberty of our prescriptions, and
confine the utility of Physicke unto a very few dayes; for observing the
Dogdayes, and as is expressed some dayes before, and likewise tenne
dayes before, and after the Aequinoctiall and Solsticiall points, by this
observation alone are exempted above an hundred dayes; whereunto
if we adde the two Aegyptian dayes in every moneth, the interlunary
and pleniluary exemptions, the Eclipses of Sunne and Moone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
and oppositions Planeticall, the houses of Planets, and the site
of the Luminaries under the signes, (wherein some would induce a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of Purgation or Phlebotomy) there would arise aboue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
more; so that of the whole year the use of Physicke would not be
secure much above a quarter; now as we doe not strictly observe these
dayes, so need we not the other, and although consideration bee made
hereof, yet might wee preserve the nearer Indications, before those
which are drawn from the time of the year, or other caelestial relation.</p>
               <p>The second Testimony is taken out of the last peece of his Age, and
after the experience (as some thinke) of no lesse then an hundred years,
and that is his booke of Aphorismes, or short and definitive deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
in Physicke; the Aphorisme alleadged is this, <hi>sub Cane &amp;
ante Canem difficiles sunt purgationes; sub Cane &amp; Anticane,</hi> say some,
including both the Dogstarres, but that cannot consist with the Greek
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, nor had that Criticisme been ever omitted by Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len;
now how true this sentence was in the mouth of Hippocrates, and
with what restraint it must be understood, will readily appeare from
the difference between us in circumstantiall relations.</p>
               <p>And first, concerning his time and Chronologie, he lived in the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50218:124"/>
reigne of Artaxerxes Longimanus about the 82. Olympiade, 450.
yeares before Christ, and from our times above two thousand. Now
since that time (as we have already declared) the Starres have varied
their longitudes, and having made large progressions from West to
E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st, the time of the Dogstars ascent must also very much alter; for it
ariseth later now in the yeare, then it formerly did in the same latitude,
and far later unto us who have a greater elevation; for in the dayes of
Hippocrates this Starre ascended in Cancer which now ariseth in Leo,
and will in progression of time arise in Virgo; and therefore in regard
of the time wherein he lived, the Aphorisme was more considerable in
his dayes then it is to us, or unto his country in ours.</p>
               <p>The place of his nativity was Coos, an Iland in the Myrtoan Sea, not
far from Rhodes, described in Mappes by the name of Lango, and
called by the Turkes who are masters thereof Stancora, according unto
Ptolomie of Northerne latitude 36. degrees; that he lived and writ in
these parts, is not improbably collected from the Epistles that passed
betwixt him and Artaxe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xes, as also between the Citizens of Abdera,
and Coos, in the behalfe of Democritus; which place being seated
from our latitude of 52, 16 degrees Southward, there will arise a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
consideration, and we may much deceive our selves if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the ascent of Starres in one place unto another, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
they arise the same day of the moneth in Coos and in England;
for as Petavius computes in the first Julian yeare, at Alexandria of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itude
31. the Starre arose cosmically in the twelfe degree of Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cer,
Heliacally the 26. by the compute of Geminus about this time at
Rhodes of latitude 37. it ascended cosmically the 16 of Cancer, Helia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
the first of Leo; and about that time at Rome of latitude 42. cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically
the 22. of Cancer and Heliacally the first of Leo, for unto pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of greater latitude it ariseth ever later, so that in some latitudes the
cosmicall ascent happeneth not before the twentieth degree of Virgo,
ten dayes before the Autumnall Aequinox, and if they compute Helia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
after it in Libra.</p>
               <p>Againe, should we allow all, and only compute unto the latitude of
Coos, yet would it not impose a totall omission of Physicke; for if in
the hottest season of that clime, all Physicke were to be declined, then
surely in many other, none were to be used at any time whatsoever; for
unto many parts, not only in the Spring and Autumne, but also in the
Winter the Sun is nearer, then unto the clime of Coos in the Summer.</p>
               <p>The third consideration concerneth purging medicines, which are at
present far different from those implyed in this Aphorisme, and such
as were commonly used by Hippocrates; for three degrees wee make
of purgative medicines: The first thereof is very benigne, nor far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the nature of Aliment, into which upon defect of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it is oft times converted, and in this forme do we account Manna,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50218:125"/>
Cassia, Tamarindes and many more, whereof we finde no mention in
Hippocrates: the second is also gentle, having a familiarity with some
humor, into which it is but converted if it faile of its operation; of this
sort are Aloe, Rhabarbe, Senna, &amp;c. whereof also few or none were
knowne unto Hippocrates: The third is of a violent and venemous
quality, which frustrate of its action, assumes as it were the nature of
poyson, such as are Scammoneum, Colocynthis, Elaterium, Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium,
Tithymallus, Laureola, Peplum, &amp;c. of this sort it is manifest
Hippocrates made use, even in Fevers, Pleurisies and Quinsies; and that
composition is very remarkable which is ascribed unto Diogenes in
Aeius, that is of Pepper, Sal Armoniac, Euphorbium, of each an ounce,
the Dosis whereof foure scruples and an half, which whosoever should
take, would finde in his bowells more then a canicular heat though in
the depth the Winter; many of the like nature may be observed in Aeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Tetrab. 1. Serm. 3. or in the book <hi>De Dinamidiis,</hi> ascribed unto Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
which is the same <hi>verbatim</hi> with the other.</p>
               <p>Now in regard of the second, and especially the first degree of
Purgatives, the Aphorisme is not of force, but we may safely use
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hem, they being benigne and of innoxious qualities; and therefore
Lucas Gauricus, who hath endeavoured with many testimonies
to advance this consideration, at length concedeth that lenitive Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
may bee used, especially when the Moone is well affected in
Cancer or in the watery signes; but in regard of the third degree the
Aphorisme is considerable; purgations may be dangerous, and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
example there is in the medicall Epistles of Crucius, of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Prince that dyed upon an ounce of Diaphaenicon, taken in this
season; from the use whereof we refraine not only in hot seasons, but
warily exhibit it at all times in hot diseases, which when necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
we can performe more safely then the Ancients, as having better
wayes of preparation and correction; that is, not onely by addition
of other bodyes, but separation of noxious parts from their own.</p>
               <p>But beside these differences between Hippocrates and us, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians
of these times and those of Antiquity, the condition of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ase,
and the intention of the Physitian, holds a maine consideration in
what time and place soever: for Physicke is either curative or preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
Preventive we call that which by purging noxious humors, and
the causes of diseases preventeth sicknesse in the healthy, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
thereof in the val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tudinary; and this is of common use both at
the Spring and Fall, and we commend not the same at this season:
Therapeuticke or curative Physicke, we tearm that which restoreth the
Patient unto sanity, and taketh away diseases actually affecting; now
of diseases some are cronicall and of long duration, as quartane Agues,
Scurvy, &amp;c. wherein because they admit of delay we deferre the cure
to more advantagious seasons: others wee tearme acute, that is of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50218:125"/>
short duration and danger, as Fevers, Pleurifies, &amp;c. in which, because
delay is dangerous, and they arise unto their state before the Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
determine, we apply present remedies according unto Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>especting rather the acutenesse of the disease, and precipitancy of
occasion, then the rising or setting of Stars, the effects of the one being
disputable, of the other assured and inevitable.</p>
               <p>And although Astrologie may here put in, and plead the secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of this Starre; yet Gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n I perceive in his Comment, makes no
such consideration, confirming the truth of the Aphorisme from the
heat of the yeare, and the operation of Medicines exhibited, in regard
that bodies being heated by the Summer, cannot so well endure the
acrimony of purging Medicines, and because upon purgations contrary
motions ensue, the heat of the Ayre attracting the humours outward,
and the action of the Medicine retracting the same inward: but these
are readily salved in the distinctions before alleadged, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the constitution of our climate and divers others, wherein the
Ayre makes no such exhaustion of spirits; and in the benignity of
our Medicines, whereof some in their owne natures, others well
prepared, agitate not the humours, or make a sensible pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
               <p>Nor do we hereby reject or condemne a sober and regulated Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;
we hold there is more truth therein then in Astrologers, in some
more then many allow, yet in none so much as some pretend; we deny
not the influence of the Stars, but often suspect the due application
thereof; for though we should affirme that all things were in all things,
that heaven were but earth celestified, and earth but heaven terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
or that each part above had an influence upon its devided affinity
below; yet how to single out these relations, and duely to apply their
actions is a worke oft times to be effected by some revelation, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala
from above, rather then any Philosophy, or speculation here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
what power soever they have upon our bodies, it is not requisite
they should destroy our reasons, that is, to make us rely on the strength
of Nature, when she is least able to relieve us, and when we conceive
the heaven against us, to refuse the assistance of the earth created for
us; this were to suffer from the mouth of the Dog above, what others
doe from the teeth of Dogs below;<note place="margin">Upon the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a mad dog there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues an hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phobia or fear of water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the stars; and Ptolomy encourageth us, that by fore-knowledge, wee
may evade their actions; for, being but universall causes, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by particular agents, which being inclined not constrained,
containe within themselves the casting act, and a power to command
the conclusion.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if all be conceded, and were there in this Aphorisme an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrained
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50218:126"/>
truth, yet were it not reasonable to inferre from a caution
a non-usance or abolition, from a thing to bee used with discretion,
not to be used at all; because the Apostle bids us beware of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
heads of extremity will have none at all; an usuall fallacie in vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
and lesse distinctive braines, who having once overshot the mean,

               <p>And hereon we have the longer insisted, because the errour is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall,

               <p>Notwithstanding upon enquirie we finde no mention hereof in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Zoographers, and such as have particularly discoursed upon Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
as Aristotle, Aelian, Plinie, Solinus and many more, who seldom
forget proprieties of such a nature, and have beene very punctuall in
lesse considerable Records: Some ground hereof I confesse wee may
allow, nor need wee deny a remarkeable affection in Pelecans toward
their young; for Aelian discoursing of Storkes, and their affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
their brood whom they instruct to flie, and unto whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliver
up the provision of their bellies, concludeth at last, that Herons
and Pelecans do the like.</p>
               <p>As for the testimonies of ancient Fathers, and Ecclesiasticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
we may more safely conceive therein some Emblematicall then
any reall Storie: so doth Eucherius confesse it to bee the Embleme of
Christ; and wee are unwilling literally to receive that account of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,
that perceiving her young ones destroyed by Serpents, she open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her side with her bill, by the blood whereof they revive and return
unto life againe; by which relation they might indeed illustrate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50218:127"/>
of man by the old Serpent, and his restorement by the blood
of Christ; and in this sense we shall not dispute the like relations of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,
Isidore, Albertus, and many more, and under an Emblematicall
intention, we accept it in coat armour.</p>
               <p>As for the Hieroglyphick of the Aegyptians, they erected the same
upon another Story, that is, from earnestly protecting her young, when
her nest was set on fire; for as for letting out her blood, it was not the
assertion of the Egyptians, but seemes translated unto the Pelecan from
the Vulture, as Pierius hath most plainly delivered <hi>Sed quod Pelicanum

colour, it is inclining to white, excepting the extreamities or tops
of the wing feathers, which are black: It is described in the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a Henne, whereas it approacheth and sometimes exceedeth
the magnitude of a Swanne; it is commonly painted with a short bill,
whereas that of the Pelecan attaineth sometimes the length of two
spannes. The bill is made acute or pointed at the end; whereas indeed
it is flat and broad, and somewhat inverted at the extreame. It is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
like fissipedes, or birdes which have their feet or clawes divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
whereas it is palmipedous, or fin-footed like Swannes and Geese,
according to the Methode of nature, in latirostrous or flat bild birdes,
which being generally swimmers, the organ is wisely contriv'd unto
the action, and they are framed with fins or oares upon their feet; and
therefore they neither light, nor build on trees, if we except Cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
who make their nests like Herons. Lastly, there is one part
omitted more remarkeable then any other, and that is the chowle or
croppe adhering unto the lower side of the bill, and so descending by
the throat; a bagge or sachell very observable, and of capacity almost
beyond credit; which notwithstanding, this animall could not want;
for therein (as Aristotle, Aelian, and Bellonius since averreth) it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
Oysters, Cochles, Sckollops, and other testaceous animals, which
being not able to breake, it retaines them untill they open, and vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <head type="sub">Of the picture of Dolphins.</head>
               <p>THat Dolphins are crooked, is not onely affirmed by the hand of
the Painter, but commonly conceived their naturall and proper fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;
which is not onely the opinion of our times, but seemes the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of elder times before us: for beside the expressions of Ovid and
Pliny, their Pourtraicts in some ancient Coynes are framed in this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
as will appeare in some thereof in Gesner, others in Goltsius, and
Laevinus Hulsius in his description of Coynes, from Julius Caesar unto
Rhodulphus the second.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, to speake strictly in their naturall figure they are
straight, nor have they their spine connexed, or more considerably
embowed, then Sharkes, Porposes, Whales, and other Ceta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous
animalls, as Scaliger plainly affirmeth; <hi>Corpus habet non magis
curvum quam reliqui pisces;</hi> as ocular enquiry informeth, and as unto
such as have not had the opportunitie to behold them, their proper
pourtraicts will discover in Rondeletius, Gesner, and Aldrovandus, and
as indeed is deducible from pictures themselves; for though they be
drawne repandous, or connexedly crooked in one piece, yet the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin
that carrieth Arion is concavously inverted, and hath its spine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in another.</p>
               <p>And therefore what is delivered of their incurvitie, must either bee
taken Emphatically, that is not really but in appearance; which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
when they leap above water, and suddenly shoot downe againe;
which is a fallacy in vision, whereby straight bodies in a sudden moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
protruded obliquely downeward, appear unto the eye crooked, and
this is the construction of Bellonius: or if it be taken really, it must not
universally and perpetually, that is, not when they swimme and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in their proper figures, but onely when they leape, or impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
whirle their bodies any way, and this is the opinion of Gesnerus.
Or lastly, it must be taken neither really, nor Emphatically, but onely
Emblematically; for being the Hyeroglyphick of celerity, and swifter
then other animals, men best expressed their velocity by incurvity, and
under some figure of a bowe, and in this sense probably doe Heralds
also receive it, when from a Dolphin extended, they distinguish a Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin
imbowed.</p>
               <p>And thus also must that picture be taken of a Dolphin clasping an
Anchor; that is not really, as is by most conceived out of affection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>THere is also among us a common description and picture of a
Grashopper, as may be observed in the pictures of Emblematists
in the coats of severall families, and as the word <hi>Cicada</hi> is usually tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated

the Picture is widely mistaken, and that for ought enquiry can informe,
there is no such insect in England, which how paradoxicall soever,
upon a strict enquiry, will prove undeniable truth.</p>
               <p>For first, that animall the French tearme <hi>Santerelle,</hi> we a Grashop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,

all of them by bands. Againe, between the <hi>Cicad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> and that wee call
a Grashopper, the differences are very many, as may bee observed in
themselves, or their descriptions in Mathiolus, Aldrovandus, and
Muffetus: for first, they are differently cucullated or capuched upon
the head and backe, and in the <hi>Cicada</hi> the eyes are more prominent; the
Locusts have <hi>Antenuae</hi> or long hornes before, with a long falcation or
forcipated tayle behinde, and being ordained for saltation, their hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
legs doe far exceed the other. The Locust or our Grashopper hath
teeth, the <hi>Cicada</hi> none at all, nor any mouth according unto Aristotle,
the <hi>Cicada</hi> is most upon trees; and lastly, the note or fritiniancy thereof
is far more shrill then that of the Locust, and its life so short in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
that for provision it needs not recourse unto the providence of the
Pismire in Winter.</p>
               <p>And therefore where the <hi>Cicada</hi> must be understod, the pictures of
Heralds and Emblematists are not exact, nor is it sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e to adhere unto
the interpretation of Dictionaries, and we must with candour make out
our owne Translations: for in the plague of Aegypt, Exodus 10. the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is translated a Locust, but in the same sense and subject,
Wisdome 16. it is translated a Grashopper, For them the bitings of

<hi>Cicada</hi> hath no teeth, but is conceived to live upon dew, and the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of its subsistence is disputed by Licetus. Hereof I perceive Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetus
hath taken notice, and dissenteth from Langius and Lycostenes,
while they deliver, the cicada's destroyed the fruits in Germany, where
indeed that insect is not found; and therefore concludeth, <hi>Tam ipsos

                  </gap>ttigon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by Aetius in the affections of the kidneys: It must be likewise
understood with some restriction what hath been affirmed by Isidore,
which is yet delivered by many, that Cicades are bred out of Cuccow
spittle, or Woodseare; that is, that spumous frothy dew or exudation
or both, found upon Plants, especially about the joynts of Lavender
and Rosemary, and observable with us about the latter end of May;
for here the true cicada is not bred, but certaine it is, that out of this,
some kinde of locust doth proceed; for herein may be discovered a
little insect of a festucine or pale green, resembling in all parts a Locust,
or what we call a Grashopper.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the word it selfe is improper, and the tearme of Grashop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
not appliable unto the Cicada; for therein the organs of motion are
not contrived for saltation, nor are the hinder legges of such extension,
as is observable in salient animalls, and such as move by leaping;
whereto the Locust is very well conformed; for therein the legs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
are longer then all the body, and make at the second joynt acute
angles, at a considerable advancement above their backs.</p>
               <p>The mistake therefore with us might have its originall from a defect
in our language; for having not the insect with us, we have not fallen
upon its proper name, and so make use of a tearme common unto it and
the Locust, whereas other countries have proper expressions for it; so
the Italian calls it cicada, the Spaniard cigarra, and the French cigale;
all which appellations conforme unto the originall, and properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

               <head type="sub">Of the picture of the Serpent tempting Eve.</head>
               <p>IN the picture of Paradice, and delusion of our first Parents, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
is often described with humane visage, and not unlike unto
Cadmus, or his wife, in the act of their Metamorphosis, which is not
meerly a pictoriall contrivance or invention of the Painter, but an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
tradition and conceived reallity, as it stands delivered by Beda
and Authors of some Antiquity; that is, that Sathan appeared not
unto Eve in the naked forme of a Serpent, but with a Virgins head, that
thereby he might become more acceptable, and his temptation finde
the easier entertaine; which neverthelesse is a conceit not to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and the plaine and received figure, is with better reason em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:50218:129"/>
For first, as Pierius observeth from Barcephas, the assumption of
humane shape, had proved a disadvantage unto Sathan; affording not
only a suspicious amazement in Eve, before the fact, in beholding a
third humanity beside her self and Adam; but leaving some excuse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the woman, which afterward the man tooke up with lesser reason;
that is, to have been deceived by another like her selfe.</p>
               <p>Againe, there was no inconvenience in the shape assumed, or any
considerable impediment that might disturbe that performance in the
common forme of a Serpent: for whereas it is conceived the woman
must needs be afraid thereof, and rather flye then approach it, it was not
agreeable unto the condition of Paradise and state of innocencie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
if in that place as most determine, no creature was hurtfull or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
unto man, and those destructive effects they now discover succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the curse, and came in with them is chiefe of thornes and briars;
and therefore Eugubinus (who affirmeth this Serpent was a Basiliske)
incurreth no ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urdity, nor need we inferre that Eve should bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
immediatly upon that Vision; for noxious animalls could
offend them no more in the Garden, then Noah in the Arke: as
they peaceably received their names, so they friendly possessed their
natures: and were their conditions destructive unto each other,
they were not so unto man, whose constitutions were antidotes,
and needed not feare poysons, who had not incurred mortality. And
if (as most conceive) there were but two created of every kinde, they
could not at that time destroy either man or themselves; for this had
frustrated the command of multiplication, destroyed a species, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfected
the Creation: and therefore also if Cain were the first man
borne, with him entred not only the act, but the first power of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for before that time neither could the Serpent nor Adam destroy
Eve, nor Adam and Eve each other, for that had overthrowne the
intention of the world, and put its Creator to act the sixt day over
againe.</p>
               <p>Moreover, whereas in regard of speech, and vocall conference with
Eve, it may be thought he would rather assume an humane shape and
organs, then the improper forme of a Serpent, it implyes no materiall
impediment; nor need we to wonder how he contrived a voice out of
the mouth of a Serpent, who hath done the like out of the belly of a
Pythonissa, and the trunke of an Oake, as he did for many yeares at
Dodona.</p>
               <p>Lastly, whereas it might be conceived that an humane shape was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for this enterprise, it being more then probable she would be ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to heare a Serpent speak; some conceive she might not yet be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that onely man was priviledged with speech, and being in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the Creation, and inexperience of all things, might not bee
affrighted to hear a Serpent speak: Beside she might be ignorant of their
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50218:129"/>
natures who was not versed in their names, as being not present at the
generall survey of Animalls, when Adam assigned unto every one a
name concordant unto its nature; nor is this only my opinion, but the
determination of Lombard and Tostatus, and also the reply of Cyrill
unto the objection of Julian, who compared this story unto the fables
of the Greekes.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Picture of Adam and Eve with Navells.</head>
               <p>ANother mistake there may be in the picture of our first Parents,
who after the manner of their posterity are both delineated with a
Navell: and this is observable not only in ordinary and stayned pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but in the Authenticke draughts of Urbin, Angelo, and others;
which notwithstanding cannot be allowed, except we impute that unto
the first cause, which we impose not on the second, or what we deny
unto nature, we impute unto Naturity it selfe, that is, that in the first
and most accomplished peece, the Creator affected superfluities, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
parts without all use or office.</p>
               <p>For the use of the Navell is to continue the infant unto the Mother,
and by the vessells thereof to convey its aliment and sustentation: the
vessells whereof it consisteth, are the umbilicall veyne, which is a
branch of the Porta, and implanted in the liver of the Infant; two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
likewise arising from the Iliacall branches, by which the Infant
receiveth the purer portion of bloud and spirits from the mother; and
lastly, the Urachos or ligamentall passage derived from the bottome
of the bladder, whereby it dischargeth the waterish and urinary part
of its aliment: now upon the birth when the Infant forsaketh the
wombe although it dilacerate, and breake the involving membranes,
yet doe these vessells hold, and by the mediation thereof the Infant is
connected unto the wombe not only before, but a while also after the
birth: these therefore the midwife cutteth off, contriving them into a
knot close unto the body of the Infant, from whence ensueth that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosity
or complicated nodosity we usually call the Navell, occasioned
by the colligation of vessells before mentioned: now the Navell or
vessells whereof it is constituted, being a part precedent, and not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
unto generation, nativity, or parturition, it cannot be well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
at the creation or extraordinary formation of Adam, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
issued from the Artifice of God; nor also that of Eve, who was
not solemnly begotten, but suddenly framed, and anomalously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

               <p>And if we be led into conclusions that Adam had also this part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50218:130"/>
for if we conceive the way of his formation, or of the first animalls

we might fall into imaginations that Adam was made without teeth,

and therefore though Adam were framed without this part, as having

               <p>All the Navell therefore and conjunctive part we can suppose in

been in a momentall Navell with his Maker: and although from his
carnallity and corporall existence the conjunction seemeth no nearer
then of causality and effect, yet in his immortall and diviner part hee
seemed to hold a nearer coherence, and an umbilicality even with
God himselfe: and so indeed although the propriety of this part bee

               <p>COncerning the pictures of the Jews, and Easterne Nations at their
feasts, concerning the gesture of our Saviour at the Passeover, who
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50218:130"/>
is usually described sitting upon a stoole or bench at a square table, in
the middest of the twelve, many make great doubt; and though they
concede a table jesture will hardly allow this usuall way of Session.</p>
               <p>Wherein restrayning no mans enquiry, it will appeare that accuba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or lying downe at meales was a gesture used by very many nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
That the Parthians used it, is evident from Athenaeus, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
out of Possidonius, that their King lay downe at meales, on an
higher bed then others. That Cleopatra thus entertained Anthonie,
the same Author manifesteth when he saith, shee prepared twelve Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliniums.
That it was in use among the Greeks, the word T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iclinium
implyeth, and the same is also declareable from many places in the
Symposiacks of Plutarke. That it was not out of fashion in the dayes
of Aristotle, hee declareth in his Politicks, when among the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary
rules of youth, he adviseth they might not be permitted to heare
Iambicks and Tragedies before they were admitted unto discumben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or lying along with others at their meales. That the Romanes used
this gesture at repast, beside many more is evident from Lipsius, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curialis,
Salmasius, and Ciaconius who have expresly and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treated hereof.</p>
               <p>Now of their accumbing places, the one was called Stibadion and

Here at the left
wing was the principall place, and the most honourable person, if hee
were not master of the feast possessed that roome. The other was
tearmed Triclinium, that is, Three beds encompassing a table, as may
be seen in the figures thereof, and particularly in the Rhamnusian Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinium,
set down by Mercurialis. The customary use hereof was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
deduced from the frequent use of bathing, after which they
commonly retired to bed, and refected themselves with repast; and so
that custome by degrees changed their cubiculary beds into discubito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and introduced a fashion to goe from the bathes unto these.</p>
               <p>As for their gesture or position, the men lay downe leaning on their
left elbow, their backe being advanced by some pillow or soft sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
the second lay so with his backe towards the first, that his head
attained about his bosome; and the rest in the same order: For women,
they sat sometimes distinctly with their sexe, sometime promiscuously
with men, according to affection or favour, as is delivered by Juvenal—<hi>Gremio jacuit nova nupta mariti</hi>—and by Suetonius of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula,
that at his feasts he placed his sisters, with whom hee had beene
incontinent, successively in order below him.</p>
               <p>Againe, as their beds were three, so the guests did not usually exceed

that number in every one, according to the ancient Lawes, and prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall

At this feast there were but seaven; the middle places of the highest
and middle bed being vacant, and hereat was Sertorius the Generall
and principall guest slaine; and so may wee make out what is delivered
by Plutark in his life, that lying on his backe, and raysing himselfe up,
Perpenna cast himself upon his stomack; which he might very well do
being master of the feast, and lying next unto him, and thus also from
this Tricliniarie disposure, we may illustrate that obscure expression of
Seneca; That the Northwinde was in the middle, the North-East on
the higher side, and the North-West on the lower; for as appeareth in
the circle of the windes, the North-East will answer the bed ofAnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
and the North-West that of Perpenna.</p>
               <p>That the custome of feasting upon beds was in use among the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,
many diduce from the 23. of Ezekiel. Thou sattest upon a
stately bed, and a table prepared before it. The custome of Discalcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or putting off their shoes at meales, is conceived by some to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the same; as by that meanes keeping their beds cleane, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had a peculiar charge to eate the Passeover with their shooes
on, which Injunction were needlesse, if they used not to put
them off.</p>
               <p>That this discumbency at meales was in use in the dayes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
is conceived propable from severall speeches of his expressed in
that phrase, even unto common Auditors, as Luke the 14. <hi>Cum Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
fueris ad nuptias non discumbas in primo loco,</hi> and besides many more,
Matthew the 23. when reprehending the Scribes and Pharisees, hee
saith, <hi>Amant protoclisias id est primos recubitus in caenis, &amp; Protocathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drias
sive primas cathedras in Synagogis:</hi> wherein the tearms are very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
and by an Antithesis do plainly distinguish the posture of sitting,
from this of lying on beds.</p>
               <p>That they used this gesture at the Passeover, is more then probable
from the testimony of Iewish writers, and particularly of Ben-maimon
recorded by Scaliger <hi>de emendatione temporum:</hi> After the second cup
according to the Institution, Exod. 12. The son asketh, what meaneth
this service? Then he that maketh the declaration saith, How different
is this night from all other nights? for all other nights wee wash but
once, but this night twice; all other wee eat leavened or unleavened
bread, but this onely leavened; all other we eat flesh roasted, boyled,
or baked, but this only roasted; all other nights we eat together lying
or sitting, but this only lying along; and this posture they used as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of rest and security which they enioyed far different from that, at
the eating of the Passeover in Aegypt.</p>
               <p>That this gesture was used when our Saviour eate the Passeover,
is not conceived improbable from the words whereby the Evangelists
expresse the same, that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which termes do properly signifie this gesture in Aristotle, Athenaeus,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50218:132"/>
Euripides, Sophocles, and all humane Authors; and the like we meete
with in the paraphrasticall expression of Nonnus.</p>
               <p>And thus may it properly be made out; what is delivered John 13.
<hi>Erat recumbens unu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ex Discipulis ejus in sinu Iesu quem diligebat;</hi> Now
there was leaning on Jesus bosome one of his Disciples whom Jesus
loved; which gesture will not so well agree unto the position of sitting,
but is naturall, and cannot be avoyded in the Laws of accubation; and
the very same expression is to be found in Pliny, concerning the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
Nerva and Veiento whom he favoured, <hi>Caenabat Nerva cum

                        <ex>que</ex>

arose the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, a neere and bosome friend: and
therefore Causabon justly rejecteth Theophylact, who not considering
the ancient manner of decumbency, imputed this gesture of the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Disciple unto Rusticity, or an act of incivility; And thus also
have some conceived; it may be more plainly made out what is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of Mary Magdalen, Luke 7. That the stood at Christs feet behinde
him weeping, and began to wash his feet with teares, and did wipe
them with the haires of her head; which actions, if our Saviour sate,
she could not performe standing, and had rather stood behinde his
back, then at his feet; and thus it cannot be reconciled what is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
in many pieces, and even of Raphaell U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bin, wherein Mary
Magdalen is pictured before our Saviour, washing his feet on her
knees, which will not consist with the strict description and letter of
the Text.</p>
               <p>Now whereas this position may seeme to be discountenanced by
our Translation, which usually renders it sitting, it cannot have that il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
for the French and Italian translations expressing neither po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of session or recubation, do onely say that he placed himselfe at
the table, and when ours expresseth the same by sitting, it is in relation
unto our custome, time, and apprehension; and the like upon occasion
is not unusuall in our translation; so when it is said Luke 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and the Vulgar renders it, <hi>Cum plicasset librum,</hi> ours translateth
it, he shut or closed the booke, which is an expression proper unto the
paginall books of our times, but not so agreeable unto volumes or rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
bookes in use among the Jews, not onely in elder times, but even
unto this day. So when it is said, the Samaritan delivered unto the host
two pence for the provision of the Levite; and when our Saviour
agreed with the Labourers for a penny a day, in strict translation it
should be seven pence halfe penny, and is not to be conceived our
common penny, the sixtieth part of an ounce; for the word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in Latine, <hi>Denarius,</hi> and with the Romans did valew
the eight part of an ounce, which after five shillings the ounce amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
unto seven pence halfe penny of our money.</p>
               <p>Lastly, whereas it might be conceived that they eate the Passeover
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50218:132"/>
standing rather then sitting, or lying downe, according to the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Exod. 12. Thus shall you eate with your loynes girded, your
shooes on your feet, and your staffe in your hand; the Jews themselves
reply, this was not required of succeeding generations, and was not
observed, but in the Passeover of Aegypt, and so also many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
were afterward omitted, as the taking up of the Paschall
Lambe, from the tenth day, the eating of it in their houses dispersed,
the striking of the bloud on the dore posts, and the eating thereof in
haste; solemnities and Ceremonies primitively enjoyned, afterward
omitted, as was also this of station, for the occasion ceasing, and being
in security, they applyed themselves unto gestures in use among them.</p>

               <p>ANother picture there is of our Saviour described with long haire,
according to the custome of the Jews, and his description sent by
Lentulus unto the Senate; wherein indeed the hand of the Painter is
not accusable, but the judgement of the common Spectator, conceaving
he observed this fashion of his hayre, because he was a Nazarite, and
confounding a Nazarite by vow, with those by birth or edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>The Nazarite by vow is declared Numb. 6. and was to refraine
three things, drinking of Wine, cutting the hayre, and approaching
unto the dead, and such a one was Sampson: Now that our Saviour
was a Nazarite after this kinde, we have no reason to determine, for he
dranke wine, and was therefore called by the Pharisees <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The other Nazarite was a Topicall appellation, and applyable unto
such as were borne in Nazareth, a City of Galilee, and in the Tribe of
Napthali; neither if strictly taken, was our Saviour in this sense a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarite;
for he was borne in Bethleem in the Tribe of Judah; but
might receave that name, because he abode in that City, and was not
onely conceaved therein, but there also passed the silent part of his
life, after his returne from Aegypt, as is delivered by Matthew, And
he came and dwelt in a City called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the Prophet, he shall be called a Nazarene;

wood for the sacrifice, which being an holocaust or burnt offering to
be consumed unto ashes, we cannot well conceive the wood a burthen

at his full stature, if we beleeve Josephus, who placeth him in the last
of Adolescency, and makes him twenty five yeares old; and whereas
in the vulgar Translation he is termed <hi>puer,</hi> it must not be strictly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
(for that age properly endeth in puberty, and extendeth but
unto fourteen) but respectively unto Abraham, who was at that time
above sixscore: And therefore also herein he was not unlike unto him
who was after led dumbe unto the slaughter, and commanded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who had legions at command, that is in meeknesse and humble
submission; for had he resisted, it had not been in the power of his aged
parent to have inforced; and many at his yeares, have performed such
acts, as few besides at any: David was too strong for a Lion and a
Beare, Pompey had deserved the name of Great, Alexander of the
same cognomination was Generalissimo of Greece, and Anniball but
one yeare after succeeded Asdruball in that memorable Warre against
the Romanes.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Picture of Moses with Hornes.</head>
               <p>IN many peeces, and some of ancient Bibles, Moses is described with
Hornes; whereof the ground was surely the Hebrew text, in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of Moses, when he descended from the mount; for therein the
originall word being Aequivocall, and signifying horned as well as
shining, the Vulgar Translation hath retained the former; <hi>Qui videbant
faciem egredientis Mosis esse cornutam.</hi> But the word in the Septuagint is

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is his face was glorified, and this passage of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
is well explaned by another of the New, that is Corinth. 3.
wherein it is delivered that they could not stedfastly behold the face
of Moses, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, for the glory of his face. And
surely the exposition of one Text is best performed by another, men
vainly interposing their constructions, where the Scripture decideth
the controversie; and therefore some have seemed too active in their
expositions, who in the story of Rahab the harlot, have given notice
that the word also signifieth an Hostesse; for in the Epistle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,
she is plainly tearmed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

the thirteenth of Athenaeus.</p>
               <p>And therefore more allowable is the Translation of Tremellius,
then that of the Vulgar, <hi>Quod splendida facta esset cubis faciei ejus;</hi> or
rather as Estius hath interpreted it, <hi>facies ejus erat radiosa,</hi> his face was
radiant, and dispersing beames like many hornes and cones about his
head; which is also consonant unto the original signification, and yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

drawne with scintillations, or radiant Halo's about their head;
which after the French expression are usually tearmed, the Glory.</p>
               <p>Now if besides this occasionall mistake, any man shall contend a
propriety in this picture, and that no injury is done unto Truth by this
description, because an horn is the hieroglyphick of authority, power &amp;

               <p>VVE will not passe over the Scucheons of the tribes of Israel, as
they are usually described in the Mappes of Canaan and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50218:134"/>
other peeces; generally conceived to be the proper coats, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctive

bear three Barres wave, Judah a Lion Rampant, Dan a Serpent nowed,
Simeon a Sword inpale the point erected, &amp;c. the ground whereof is
the last Benediction of Jacob, wherein he respectively draweth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons
from things here represented.</p>
               <p>Now herein although we allow a considerable measure of truth,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.</note> yet
whether as they are usually described, these were the proper cognizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and coat armes of the Tribes, whether in this manner applyed, and
upon the grounds presumed, materiall doubts remai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e.</p>
               <p>For first, they are not strictly made out, from the Propheticall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Jacob; for Simeon and Levi have distinct coats, that is a Sword,
and the two tables, yet are they by Jacob included in one Prophesie,
Simeon and Levi are brethren, Instruments of cruelties are in their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.
So Joseph beareth an Oxe, whereof notwithstanding there
is no mention in this Prophesie; for therein it is said Joseph is a fruitfull
bough, even a fruitfull bough by a well; by which repetition are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
the two Tribes descending from him Ephraim and Manasses;
whereof notwithstanding Ephraim beareth an Oxe: True it is, that
many yeares after in the benediction of Moses, it is said of Joseph, His
glory is like the firstlings of his Bullocke;<note place="margin">Deut. 33.</note> and so wee may concede,
what Vossius learnedly declareth, that the Aegyptians represented Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph
in the symbole of an Oxe, for thereby was best implyed the
dreame of Pharaoh, which he interpreted, the benesit by Agriculture,
and provident provision of corne which he performed, and therefore
did Serapis beare a bushell upon his head.</p>
               <p>Againe, if we take these two benedictions together, the resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are not appropriate, and Moses therein conformes not unto Jacob;
for that which in the Prophesie of Jacob is appropriated unto one, is in
the blessing of Moses made common unto others: So whereas Judah
is compared unto a Lion by Jacob, Judah is a Lions whelpe; the same
is applyed unto Dan by Moses, Dan is a Lions whelpe, he shall leape
from Bashan: and also unto Gad, he dwelleth as a Lion, and teareth
the arme with the Crowne of the head.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if a Lyon were the proper coat of Judah, yet were it not
probably a Lyon Rampant, as it is commonly described, but rather
couchant or dormant, as some Heralds and Rabins doe determine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the letter of the Text, <hi>Recumbens dormisti ut Leo,</hi> He cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
as a Lyon, and as a young Lyon, who shall rouse him?</p>
               <p>Lastly, when it is said, Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch
by his owne standard with the Ensigne of their fathers house;<note place="margin">Numb. 2.</note> upon
enquiry what these standards and ensignes were there is no small incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and men conforme not unto the Prophesie of Jacob. Christian
Expositors are fayne herein to relye upon the Rabbins, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50218:134"/>
are various in their traditions, and confirme not these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
descriptions; for as for inferiour Ensignes either of particular
bands or houses they determine nothing at all, and of the foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
or Legionary standards, that is of Judah, Ruben, Ephraim, and
Dan, (under every one whereof marched three tribes) they explaine
them very variously. Jonathan who compiled the Thargum, conceives
the colours of these banners to answer the pretious stones in the breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,
and upon which the names of the Tribes were engraven. So the
standard for the campe of Judah, was of three colours according unto
the stones, Chalcedony, Saphir, and Sardonix; and therein were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
the names of the three tribes, Judah, Isachar, and Zabulon, and
in the middest thereof was witten,<note place="margin">Numb. 10.</note> Rise up Lord, and let thy enemies be
scattered, and let them that hate thee flye before thee; in it was also the
pourtrait of a Lyon: The standard of Ruben was also of three colours,
Sardine, Topaz, and Amethyst, therein were expressed the names of
Ruben,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> Simeon, and Gad, in the middest was written, Heare, O Israel,
The Lord our God, the Lord is one: Therein was also the pourtraiture
of a Hart. But Abenezra and others beside the colours of the field, do
set downe other charges, in Rubens the forme of a man or mandrake,
in that of Judah a Lyon, in Ephraims an Oxe, in Dan's the figure of
an Aegle.</p>
               <p>And thus indeed the foure figures in the banners of the principall
squadrons of Israel are answerable unto the Cherubins in the vision of
Ezechiel, every one carrying the forme of all these:<note place="margin">Ezek. 1.</note> As for the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their faces, they foure had the likenesse of the face of a Man,
they foure had also the face of an Aegle, and the face of a Lyon on the
right side, and they foure had the face of an Oxe on the left side, they
foure had also the face of an Aegle; and conformable hereunto the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of the Evangelists (whose Gospells are the Christian banners)
are set forth with the addition of a Man or Angell, an Oxe, a Lyon, and
an Aegle; and these symbolically represent the office of Angells, and
Ministers of Gods will; in whom is required understanding as in a
Man, courage and vivacity as in the Lyon, service and ministeriall
officiousnesse, as in the Oxe, expedition or celerity of execution, as in
the Aegle.</p>
               <p>From hence therefore we may observe that these descriptions the
most authenticke of any, are neither agreeable unto one another, nor
unto the Scuchions in question; for though they agree in Ephraim and
Judah, that is the Oxe and the Lyon, yet doe they differ in those of
Dan, and Ruben, as farre as an Aegle is different from a Serpent, and
the figure of a Man, Hart, or Mandrake, from three Barres wave, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
notwithstanding we rather declare the incertainty of Armes in this
particular, then any way question their antiquity; for hereof more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
examples there are, then the Scucheons of the Tribes, if Osyris,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50218:135"/>
Mizraim or Jupiter the Just, were the son of Cham; for of his two
sons, as Diodorus delivereth, the one for his Device gave a Dogge,
the other a Wolfe; and beside the shield of Achilles, and many ancient
Greeks, if we receive the conjecture of Vossius, that the Crow upon
Corvinus his head, was but the figure of that Animall upon his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
it is an example of Antiquity among the Romans.</p>

               <p>THe Picture concerning the death of Cleopatra with two Aspes or
venemous Serpents unto her armes, or breasts, or both, requires
consideration: for therein (beside that this variety is not excusable)
the thing it selfe is questionable; nor is it indisputably certaine what
manner of death she dyed. Plutarch in the life of Antonie plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth,
that no man knew the manner of her death; for some affirmed
she perished by poyson, which she alwayes carried in a little bollow
combe, and wore it in her hayre; beside there were never any Aspes
discovered in the place of her death, although two of her maids peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
also with her, only it was said two small and almost insensible
prickes were sound upon her arme; which was all the ground that
Caesar had to presume the manner of her death. Galen who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
unto Plutarch, delivereth two wayes of her death: that is,
that shee killed her selfe by the bite of an Aspe, or bit an hole in her
arme, and powred poyson therein. Strabo that lived before them
both, hath also two opinions, that she dyed by the byte of an Aspe, or
else a poysonous oyntment.</p>
               <p>We might question the length of the Aspes which are sometimes
described exceeding short, whereas the Chersaea or land Aspe which
most conceive she used, is above foure cubits long: their number is
not unquestionable; for whereas there are generally two described,
Augustus (as Plutarch relateth) did carry in his triumph the Image of
Cleopatra but with one Aspe unto her arme: as for the two pricks, or
little spots in her arme, they rather infer the sex, then plurality: for like
the viper, the female Aspe hath foure, but the male two teeth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it left this impression, or double puncture behinde it.</p>
               <p>And lastly, we might question the place; for some apply them unto
her breast, which notwithstanding will not consist with the history,
and Petrus Victorius hath well observed the same: but herein the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
was easie, it being the custome in capitall malefactors to apply
them unto the breast, as the Author <hi>De Theriaca ad Pisonem,</hi> an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesse
hereof in Alexandria, where Cleopatra dyed, determineth:
I beheld saith he, in Alexandria, how suddenly these Serpents bereave
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50218:136"/>
a man of life; for when any one is condemned to this kinde of death,
if they intend to use him favourably, that is, to dispatch him suddenly,
they fasten an Aspe unto his breast, and bidding him walke about, he
presently perisheth thereby.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Pictures of the nine Worthies.</head>
               <p>THe pictures of the nine Worthies are not unquestionable, and to
criticall spectators may seeme to containe sundry improprieties:
Some will enquire why Alexander the Great is described upon an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant?
for indeed, we do not finde he used that animall in his Armies,
much lesse in his owne person; but his horse is famous in history, and
its name alive to this day: Beside, he fought but one remarkable
battaile, wherein there were any Elephants, and that was with Porus
King of India; In which notwithstanding, as Curtius, Arrianus, and
Plutarch report, he was on horseback himselfe; and if because hee
fought against Elephants, he is with propriety set upon their backs,
with no lesse or greater reason is the same description agreeable unto
Judas Maccabeus, as may be observed from the history of the Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees;
and also unto Julius Caesar, whose triumph was honoured with
captive Elephants, as may be observed in the order thereof, set forth
by <hi>Iacobus Laurus:</hi> and if also wee should admit this description upon
an Elephant, yet were not the manner thereof unquestionable, that is,
in his ruling the beast alone; for, beside the champion upon their back,
there was also a guide or Ruler, which sate more forward to command
or guide the beast: Thus did King Porus ride when hee was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
by Alexander; and thus are also the towred Elephants descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
Maccab. 2. 6. Upon the beasts there were strong towres of wood
which covered every one of them, and were girt fast unto them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
there were also upon every one of them thirty two strong men,
beside the Indian that ruled them.</p>
               <p>Others will demand, not onely why Alexander upon an Elephant,
but Hector upon an Horse? whereas his manner of fighting, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
himselfe in battaile, was in a Chariot, as did the other noble
Trojans, who as Pliny affirmeth were the first inventers thereof; the
same way of fight is testified by Diodorus, and thus delivered by Sir
Walter Raleigh. Of the vulgar little reckoning was made, for they
fought all on foote, slightly armed, and commonly followed the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of their Captaines, who roade not upon horses, but in Chariots
drawne by two or three horses; and this was also the ancient way of
fight among the Britaines, as is delivered by Diodorus, Caesar, and
Tacitus; and there want not some who have taken advantage hereof,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50218:136"/>
and made it one argument of their orginall from Troy.</p>
               <p>Lastly, by any man versed in Antiquity, the question can hardly be
avoyded, why the horses of these Worthies, especially of Caesar, are
described with the furniture of great sadles, and styrrops; for sadles
largely taken, though some defence there may be, yet that they had
not the use of stirrops, seemeth out of doubt; as Pancirollus hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
as Polydore Virgil and Petrus Victorius have confirmed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
discoursing hereon; as is observable from Pliny, and cannot
escape our eyes in the ancient monuments, medals and Triumphant ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Romanes. Nor is there any genuine or classick word in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
to expresse them; for <hi>staphia</hi> or <hi>stapes</hi> is not to be found in Authors
of Antiquity; and whereas the name might promise some Antiquity,
because among the three small bones in the Auditory Organ, by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians
termed <hi>Incus Malleus,</hi> and <hi>stapes,</hi> one thereof from some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
doth beare this name; these bones were not observed, much lesse
named by Hippocrates, Galen or any ancient Physitian; but as Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius
observeth concerning the invention of the stapes or stirrop
bone, there is some contention betweene <hi>Columbus</hi> and <hi>Ingrassias,</hi> the
one of Sicilia, the other of Cremona, and both within the compasse of
this Century.</p>
               <p>The same is also deduceable from very approved Author<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

elevated places, and Scalary ascents, that by the help thereof

demand how Cavalliers then destitute of stirrops did usually mount
their horses, <hi>Vegetius</hi> resolves us, that they used to vault or leape up, and
therefore they had wooden horses in their houses and abroad, that
thereby young men might enable themselves in this action, wherein by
instruction and practice they grew so perfect, that they could vault up
on the right or left, and that with their sword in hand, according to that
of Virgil—

                  </gap>teth forth the picture of
Jephthah in the posture of Abraham, sacrificing his onely daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
Thus indeed is it commonly received, and hath had the attest of
many worthy Writers; notwithstanding upon enquity wee finde the
matter doubtfull, and many upon probable grounds to have beene of
another opinion; conceaving in this oblation not a naturall but a Civill
kinde of death, and a seperation onely unto the Lord; for that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
not his vow unto a literall oblation, there want not arguments
both from the Text and reason.</p>
               <p>For first, it is evident that she deplored her virginity, and not her
death; Let me goe up and downe the mountaines, and bewayle my
virginity, I and my fellowes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when it is said, that Jephthah did unto her according unto
his vow, it is immediately subjoyned, <hi>Et non cognovit virum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and shee
knew no man, which as immediate in words, was probably most neere
in sence unto the vow.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is said in the Text, that the daughters of Israel went
yearely to talke with the daughter of J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>phthah foure dayes in the
yeare, which had she beene sacrificed, they could not have done; For
whereas the word is sometime translated to lament, yet doth it also
signifie to talke or have conference with one, and by Tremellius who
was well able to judge of the Originall, it is in this sence translated:
<hi>Ibant filii Israelitarum ad confabulandum cum filia Iephthaci, quatuor die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
quotannis:</hi> And so it is also set downe in the marginall notes of our
Translation: And from this annuall concourse of the daughters of
Israel, it is not improbable in future Ages, the daughter of Jephthah
came to be worshipped as a Deity, and had by the Samaritans an annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
festivity observed unto her honour, as Epiphanius hath left recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the heresie of the Melchidecians.</p>
               <p>It is also repugnant unto reason, for the offering of mankinde was
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50218:137"/>
against the Law of God, who so abhorred humane sacrifice, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
not the oblation of uncleane beasts, and confined his altars but
unto five kinds of Animals; that is, the Oxe, the Goat, the Sheepe, the
Pigeon and its kinds: in the cleansing of the leper, there is I confesse,
mention made of the Sparrow, but great dispute may be made whether
it be properly rendred, and therefore the Scripture with indignation,
oft times makes mention of humane sacrifice among the Gentiles,
whose oblations scarce made scruple of any Animall, sacrificing not
onely man, but I Iorses, Lyons, Aegles; and though they come not into
holoca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sts, yet do we read the Syrians did make oblations of fishes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the goddesse Derceto; It being therefore a sacrifice so abominable
unto God, although hee had pursued it, it is not probable the Priests
and wisedom of Israel would have permitted it, and that not onely in
regard of the subject or sacrifice it selfe, but also the sacrificator, which
the picture makes to be Jepthah, who was neither Priest, nor capable
of that office; for he was a Gileadite, and as the text affirmeth, the son
also of an harlot; And how hardly the Priesthood would endure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment
upon their function, a notable example there is in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Ozias.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the offering up of his daughter was not onely unlawfull,
and entrenched upon his religion, but had beene a course and progresse
that had much condemned his discretion, that is, to have punished him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the strictest observance of his Vow, when as the Law of God
had allowed an evasion; that is, by way of commutation or redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
according as is determined, Levi. 27. whereby if she were between
the age of five and twenty, shee was to be estimated but at ten shekels,
and if between twenty and sixty, not above thirty; a sum that could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
discourage an indulgent Parent, it being but the value of a servant
slain, and the inconsiderable Salarie of Judas, and will make no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
noise then three pound fifteen shillings with us; and therefore their
conceit is not to be exploded, who say that from the Story of Jepthah
sacrificing his owne daughter, might spring the fable of Agam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mnon,
delivering unto sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia, who was also contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
unto J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pthah; wherein to answere the ground that hinted it,
Iphigenia was not sacrificed her self, but redeemed with an Hart, which
Diana acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pted for her.</p>
               <p>Now the ground at least which much promoted the opinion, might
be the dubious words of the text, which containe the sense of his vow;
most men adhering unto their common and obvious acception. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall come forth of the doores of my house shall surely be the
Lords, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. Now whereas it is
said, <hi>Erit Iehova, &amp; offeram illud holocaustum,</hi> The word signifying
both <hi>&amp;</hi> and <hi>aut,</hi> it may be taken disjunctively, <hi>aut offeram,</hi> that is, it
shall either be the Lords by separation, or else, an holocaust by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50218:138"/>
oblation, even as our marginal translation advertiseth; and as Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius
rendreth it, <hi>Erit inquam Iehovae, aut offer am illud holocaustum:</hi>
and for the vulgar translation, it useth often <hi>&amp;</hi> where <hi>aut</hi> must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
as Exod. 21. <hi>Si quis percusserit patrem &amp; matrem,</hi> that is not
both, but either. There being therefore two wayes to dispose of her,
either to separate her unto the Lord, or offer her as a sacrifice, it is of no
necessitie the latter should bee necessary; and surely lesse derogatorie
unto the sacred text, and history of the people of God, must bee the
former.</p>

of Camells haire; that is made of some texture of that haire, a
course garment, a cilicious or sackcloth habit; sutable to the austerity
of his life, and the severity of his doctrine, Repentance, and the place
thereof the wildernes, his food and diet locusts and wilde hony; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto the example of Elias, who Kings 1. 8. is said to <hi>vir pilosus,</hi>

which is more especially beleeved by the English, whose Protector
he is, and in which forme and history, according to his description
in the English Colledge at Rome, he is set forth in the Icons or Cuts
of Martyrs by Cevallerius. Now of what authority soever this piece
be among us, it is I perceive received with different beliefes: for some
men beleeve the person and the story; some the person, but not the
story, and others deny both.</p>

For of this name we meet with more then one in history, and no lesse

forth by Metaphrastes, and his myracles by Turonensis.</p>
               <p>As for the story depending hereon, we cannot make out the verity

and such whereby we now distinguish of time, have found no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in any ancient Writers, but are of late invention, as Pancirollus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth,
and Polydore Virgil discoursing of new inventions whereof
the authors are not knowne makes instance in Clocks and Guns: now
Jerome is no late Writer, but one of the ancient Fathers, and lived in
the fourth Century, in the reigne of Theodosius the first.</p>
               <p>It is not to be denyed that before the dayes of Jerome there were
Horologies, and severall accounts of time; for they measured the
hours not only by drops of water in glasses called Clepsydrae, but also
by sand in glasses called Clepsammia; there were also from great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
Sciotericall or Sun Dialls, by the shadow of a stile or gnomon
denoting the houres of the day: an invention ascribed unto Anaxime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
by Pliny; hereof a very memorable one there was in Campus
Martius from an obelisk erected, &amp; golden figures placed horizontally
about it, which was brought out of Aegypt by Augustus, and described
by Jacobus Laurus. And another of great antiquity we meet with in
the story of Ezechias; for so it is delivered Kings 2. 20. That the Lord
brought the shadow backward ten degrees by which it had gone
down in the Diall of Ahaz; that is, say some, ten degrees, not lines, for
the houres were denoted by certaine divisions or steps in the Diall,
which others distinguished by lines according to that of Persius—

every thing, so are these indeed of more generall and ready use then
any that went before them: by the water-glasses the account was not
regular; for from attenuation and condensation, whereby that Element
is altered, the houres were shorter in hot weather then in cold, and in
Summer then in Winter; as for Sciotericall Dialls, whether of the
Sunne or Moon, they are only of use in the actuall radiation of those
Luminaries, and are of little advantage unto those inhabitants, which
for many months enjoy not the lustre of the Sun.</p>

               <p>FEw eyes have escaped the Picture of the Mermaids; that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Horace his Monster, with womans head above, and fishy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity

Syrens that attempted upon Ullysses, which notwithstanding were of
another description, containing no fishie composure, but made up of
Man and Bird; the humane mediety variously placed not only above
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50218:140"/>
but below, according unto Aelian, Suidas, Servius, Boccatius, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandus,
who hath referred their description unto the story of fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
birds, according to the description of Ovid, and the account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in Hyginus, that they were the daughters of Melpomene, and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosied
into the shape of man and bird by Ceres.</p>
               <p>And therefore these pieces so common among us, do rather derive
their originall, or are indeed the very descriptions of Dagon, which
was made with humane figure above, and fishy shape below; whose
stumpe,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 5.</note> or as Tremellius and our margin renders it, whose fishie part
onely remained, when the hands and upper part fell before the Arke.
Of the shape of Atergates, or Derceto with the Phaeniceans; in whose
fishie and feminine mixture, as some conceive, were implyed the Moon
and the Sea, or the Deity of the waters; and therefore, in their sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they made oblations of fishes: from whence were probably occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
the pictures of Nereides and Tritons among the Grecians, and
such as we reade in Macrobius, to have beene placed on the top of the
temple of Saturne.</p>
               <p>We are unwilling to question the Royall supporters of England,

               <p>As for the Unicorne, if it have the head of a Deere, and the tayle of
a Boare, as Vartomannus describeth it, how agreeable it is in this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
every eye may discerne: if it be made bisulcous or cloven foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it agreeth unto the description of Vartomannus, but scarce of any
other; and Aristotle supposeth that such as devide the hoofe doe
double the horne; they being both of the same nature, and admitting
division together. And lastly, if the horne have this situation, and be
so forwardly affixed, as is described, it will not be easily conceived,
how it can seed from the ground, and therefore we observe that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in other cornigerous animals, hath placed the hornes higher and
reclining, as in Bucks; in some inverted upwards, as in the Rhinoceros,
the Indian Asse, and the Unicornous Beetles; and thus have some affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it is seated in this animall.</p>
               <p>Wee cannot but observe that in the picture of Jonah and others,
Whales are described with two prominent spouts on their heads;
whereas indeed they have but one in the forhead, and terminating
over the windepide. Nor can we overlooke the picture of Elephants
with Castles on their backs, made in the forme of land Castles, or
stationary fortifications, and answerable unto the Armes of Castile, or
Sir John Old Castle; whereas the towres they bore were made of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:50218:141"/>
wood, and girt unto their bodies, as is delivered in the books of Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees,
and as they were appointed in the Army of Antiochus.</p>
               <p>We will not dispute the pictures of Telary Spiders, and their posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the web, which is commonly made laterall, and regarding the
Horizon; although, if it be observed, wee shall commonly finde it
downeward, and their heads respecting the Center: We will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert
the picture of the seven Stars, although if thereby be meant the
Pleiades, or subconstellation upon the back of Taurus, with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
they are described, either in site or magnitude, in a cleere night
an ordinary eye may discover, from July unto April. We will not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion

the picture of the Flower <hi>de Luce,</hi> though how farre they agree unto
their naturall draughts, let every Spectator determine.</p>
               <p>Many more there are whereof our pen shall take no notice, nor shall
we urge their enquiry; we shall not enlarge with what incongruity, and
how dissenting from the pieces of Antiquity, the pictures of their gods
and goddesses are described, and how hereby their symbolicall sence
is lost, although herein it were not hard, to be informed from Phornu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
Fulgentius, and Albricus. Whether Hercules be more properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
strangling then tearing the Lion, as Victorius hath disputed,
nor how the characters and figures of the Signes and Planets be now
perverted, as Salmasius hath learnedly declared: Wee will dispence
with Beares with long tayles, such as are described in the figures of
heaven; We shall tolerate flying Horses, black Swans, Hydrae's, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taur's,
Harpies, and Satyres; for these are monstrosities, rarities, or else
Poeticall fancies, whose shadowed moralities require their substantiall
falsities: wherein indeed we must not deny a liberty, nor is the hand
of the Painter more restrainable then the pen of the Poet; but where
the real works of Nature, or veritable acts of story are to be described,
digressions are aberrations; and Art being but the Imitator or secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
representor, it must not vary from the verity of the example, or
describe things otherwise then they truly are or have beene: for hereby
introducing false Idea's of things, it perverts and deformes the face and

               <head type="sub">Of the Hieroglyphicall pictures of the Egyptians.</head>
               <p>CErtainly of all men that suffered from the confusion of Babel, the
Aegyptians found the best evasion; for, though words were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
they invented a language of things, and spake unto each other
by common notions in Nature, whereby they discoursed in silence,
and were intuitively understood from the theory of their Expresses:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50218:141"/>
for, they assumed the shapes of animals common unto all eyes, and by
their conjunctions and compositions were able to communicate their
conceptions unto any that coapprehended the Syntaxis of their natures.
This doe many conceive to have beene the primitive way of writing,
and of greater Antiquity then letters; and this indeed might Adam
well have spoken, who understanding the nature of things, had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of naturall expressions, which the Aegyptians but taking upon
trust upon their owne or common opinion, from conceded mistakes
they authentically promoted errors, describing in their Hieroglyphicks
creatures of their owne invention; or from knowne and conceded ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
erecting significations not inferrible from their natures.</p>
               <p>And first, although there were more things in Nature then words
which did expresse them, yet even in these mute and silent discourses,
to expresse complexed significations, they took a liberty to compound
and piece together creatures of allowable formes unto mixtures inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent;
and thus began the descriptions of Griphins, Basilisks, Phaenix,
and many more; which Emblematists and Heralds have entertained
with significations answering their institutions; Hieroglyphically ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Martegres, Wivernes, Lion fishes, with divers others; pieces of
good and allowable invention unto the prudent Spectator, but are
lookt on by vulgar eyes as literall truths, or absurd imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssibilities;
whereas, indeed they are commendable inventions, and of laudable
significations.</p>
               <p>Againe, beside these pieces fictitiously set downe, and having no
copy in Nature, they had many unquestionably drawne of inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
signification, nor naturally verfying their intention. Wee shall
instance but in few, as they stand recorded by Orus: The male sex they
expressed by a Vulture, because of Vultures all are females, and impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by the winde, which authentically transmitted hath passed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pens, and became the assertion of Aelian, Ambrose, Basil, Isidore,
Tzetzes, Philes, and others; wherein notwithstanding what injury is
offered unto the Creation in this con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inement of sex, and what distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
unto Phylosophy in the concession of windy conceptions, wee
shall not here declare: By two dragmes they thought it sufficient to
signifie an heart, because the heart at one yeare weigheth two dragmes,
that is, a quarter of an ounce, and unto fifty yeares annually encreaseth
the weight of one dragme, after which in the same proportion it yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decreaseth; so that the life of a man doth not naturally extdend above
an hundred, and this was not onley a populary conceit, but consentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
unto their Physicall principles, Heurnius hath accounted it, in his
<hi>Philosophica Barbarica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A woman that hath but one childe, they expresse by a Lionesse; for
that conceaveth but once: fecundity they set forth by a Goate, because
but seven dayes old, it beginneth to use coition: the abortion of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50218:142"/>
they describe by an horse kicking a wolfe; because a Mare will
cast her fole if she tread in the track of that animall. Deformity they
signifie by a Beare, and an unstable man by an Hyaena, because that
animall yearely exchangeth his sex: A woman delivered of a female
child, they imply by a Bull looking over his left shoulder, because if
in coition a Bull part from a Cow on that side, the Calfe will prove a
female.</p>
               <p>All which with many more, how farre they consent with truth, we
shall not disparage our Reader to dispute; and though some way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable

some thing to be feared; as upon the like consideration the meeting of

               <p>2. That Owles and Ravens are ominous appearers, and presignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

conception. Because many Ravens were seene when Alexander ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Babylon, they were thought to preominate his death; and because
an Owle appeared before the battaile, it presaged the ruine of Crassus,
which though decrepite superstitions, and such as had their nativity
in times beyond all history, are fresh in the observation of many heads,

and by the credulous and feminine partie still in some Majestie among
us. And therefore the Embleme of Superstition was well set out by
Ripa, in the picture of an Owle, an Hare, and an old woman; and it
no way confirmeth the Auguriall consideration, that an Owle is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden

spoken under the Rose; which expression is commendable, if the Rose
from any naturall propertie may be the Symbole of silence, as Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzene
seemes to imply in these translated verses.

and is also tolerable, if
by desiring a secrecy to words spoke under the Rose, wee onely meane
in society and compotation, from the ancient custome in Symposiacke
meetings, to weare chapletts of Roses about their heads; and so we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
not the Germane custome, which over the Table describeth a
Rose in the seeling; but more considerable it is, if the originall were
such as Lemnius and others have recorded; that the Rose was the
flower of Venus, which Cupid consecrated unto Harpocrates the God
of silence, and was therefore an Emblem thereof to conceale the
prancks of Venery, as is declared in this Tetrasticke—

and in many parts of Europe, whereof although there seeme no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

Petrus Victorius and Causabon have observed from a passage in Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,

haire is thought by many a point of consideration, which is perhaps
but the continuation of an ancient superstition: for piaculous it was
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50218:143"/>
unto the Romanes to pare their nayles upon the nundinae observed
every ninth day; and was also feared by others in certaine dayes

complicated haires of the head, and also of locks longer then the other

of Apuleius; <hi>Adjuro per dulcem capilli tui nodulum.</hi>

               <p>12. A custome there is in most parts of Europe to adorn Aqueducts,
spouts and Cisternes with Lions heads; which though no illaudable
ornament is an Aegyptian continuation, who practised the same under
a symbolicall illation; for because the Sun being in Leo, the flood of
Nilus was at the full, and water became conveyed into every part,
they made the spouts of their Aqueducts through the head of a Lion:
and upon some celestiall respects it is not improbable the great Mogull
or Indian King doth beare for his Armes a Lion and the Sun.</p>

considerations; for by a girdle or cincture are symbollically implied
Truth, Resolution and Readinesse unto Action, which are parts and
vertues required in the service of God: according whereto we finde
that the Isr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>elites eat the Paschall Lambe with their loynes girded, and
the Almighty challenging Job, bids him gird up his loynes like a man;

               <p>Moreover by the girdle the heart and parts which God requires are

he was slaine in that part, and as only vulnerable in the inferiour and

and walks in the paths thereof; and in this secondary and symbolicall
sense it may be also understood, when the Priests in the Law washed
their feet before the sacrifice; when our Saviour washed the feet of
his Disciples, and said unto Peter, if I wash not thy feet thou hast no
part in me; and thus is it symbollically explainable and implieth purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

               <p>14. The picture of the Creator, or God the Father in the shape of

                  </gap> may
revive the Anthropomorphites, which although maintained from the
expression of Daniel, I beheld where the Ancient of dayes did sit,
whose haire of his head was like the pure woole; yet may it be also

old man in a blew mantle, with an egge in his mouth, which was the
embleme of the world. Surely those heathens, that notwithstanding
their exemplary advantage in heaven, would endure no pictures of Sun
or Moone, as being visible unto all the world, and needing no repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation,
do evidently accuse the practise of those pencils, that will
describe invisibles. And he that challenged the boldest hand unto the
picture of an Echo, must laugh at this attempt not onely in the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of invisibility, but circumscription of Ubiquity, and fetching

               <p>The pictures of the Aegyptians were more tolerable, and in their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

for though they implyed the same by an eye upon a Scepter, by an

pretend no corporall representations, nor could the people mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceive
the same unto reall correspondencies. So though the Cherub
carryed some apprehension of Divinity, yet was it not conceived to be

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:50218:144"/>

goe so farre, we may be bold to affirme, not onely that one Sun dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
but two arose that day: That light appeared at his nativity, and
darkenesse at his death, and yet a light at both; for even that darknesse
was a light unto the Gentiles, illuminated by that obscurity. That 'twas
the first time the Sun set about the Horizon, that although there were
darkenesse above the earth there was light beneath it, nor dare we say
that hell was darke if he were in it.</p>

concerning the Infant and others, which is surely no more then a

who had an opinion it advantaged their promotion.</p>

is the outward membrane wherein are implanted the veynes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries

and umbilicall vessels, whereby its nourishment is conveyed: the
Allantois a thin coat seated under the Corion, wherein are received the
watery separations conveyed by the urachus, that the acrimony thereof
should not offend the skin. The Amnios is a generall investment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

about the time when the Infant breaketh these cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

carryeth with it about the head a part of the Amnios or neerest coat;
which saith Spiegelius, either proceedeth from the toughnesse of the

               <p>18. That 'tis good to be drunke once a month, is a common flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of sensuality, supporting it selfe upon physick, and the healthfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of inebriation. This indeed seemes plainly affirmed by Avicenna,
a Physitian of great Authority, and whose religion prohibiting Wine
could lesse extenuate ebriety. But Averroes a man of his owne faith
was of another beliefe, restraining his ebriety unto hilarity, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
making no more thereof, then Seneca commendeth, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
in Cato; that is, a sober incalescence and regulated aestuation
from wine, or what may be conceived betweene Joseph and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
when the Text expresseth they were merry, or dranke largely;
and whereby indeed the commodities set downe by Avicenna, that is,
alleviation of spirits, resolution of superfluities, provocation of sweat
and urine may also ensue. But as for dementation, sopition of reason,
and the diviner particle from drinke, though American religion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
and Pagan piety of old hath practised, even at their sacrifices;
Christian morality and the Doctrine of Christ will not allow. And
surely that religion which excuseth the fact of Noah, in the aged sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisall
of six hundred yeares, and unexpected inebriation from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
effects of wine, will neither acquit ebriosity nor ebriety, in
their knowne, and intended perversions.</p>
               <p>And indeed, although sometimes effects succeed which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the body, yet if they carry mischiefe or perill unto the soule, we
are therein restraineable by Divinity, which circumscribeth Physick,
and circumstantially determines the use thereof. From naturall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
Physick commendeth the use of venery; and happily, incest,
adultery, or stupration may prove as physically advantageous, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall
copulation; which notwithstanding must not bee drawne into
practise. And truly effects, consequents, or events which wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
arise oft times from wayes which all condemne. Thus from the
fact of Lot, we derive the generation of Ruth, and blessed Nativity of
our Saviour; which notwithstanding did not extenuate the incestuous
ebriety of the generator. And if, asit is commonly urged, we thinke
to extenuate ebriety from the benefit of vomit oft succeeding; Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50218:145"/>
sobriety will condemne us, who purgeth both wayes twice a
month, without this perturbation: and we foolishly contemne the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
hand of God, and ample field of medicines which soberly produce
that action.</p>
               <p>19. A conceit there is that the Devill commonly appeareth with a
cloven hoofe, wherein although it seeme excessively ridiculous there
may be somewhat of truth; and the ground thereof at first might be
his frequent appearing in the shape of a Goat, which answers that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.
This was the opinion of ancient Christians concerning the
apparitions of Panites, Faunes and Satyres, and in this forme we reade
of one that appeared unto Antony in the wildernesse. The same is also
confirmed from expositions of holy Scripture; for whereas it is said,
Thou shalt not offer unto Devils, the Originall word is <hi>Seghnirim,</hi> that
is,<note place="margin">Lev. 17.</note> rough and hayrie Goats, because in that shape the Devill most often
appeared, as is expounded by the Rabbins, as Tremellius hath also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained;
and as the word Ascimah, the god of Emath is by some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
nor did he onely assume this shape in elder times, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
in later dayes, especially in the place of his worship. If there be
any truth in the confession of Witches, and as in many stories it stands
confirmed by Bodinus; and therefore a Goat is not improperly made
the Hieroglyphick of the Devill, as Pierius hath expressed it; so might
it be the Embleme of sin, as it was in the sin offering; and so likewise
of wicked and sinfull men, according to the expression of Scripture in
the method of the last distribution, when our Saviour shall separate the
Sheep from the Goats, that is, the sons of the Lamb from the children
of the Devill.</p>

is that which is used in Minerall discoveries, that is, with a

forth, will stirre and play if any mine be under it: and though many
there are who have attempted to make it good, yet untill better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
we are of opinion with Agricola, that in it selfe it is a fruitlesse
exploration, strongly senting of Pagan derivation, and the <hi>virgula Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina,</hi>
proverbially magnified of old; the ground whereof were the
Magicall rods in Poets; that of Pollas in Homer, that of Mercury that
charmed Argus, and that of Circe which transformed the followers
of Ulysses; too boldly usurping the name of Moses rod; from which

the different conceits of men, and duly perpend the imperfections
of their discoveries.</p>
               <p>And first, the Heathens or histories of the Gentiles afford us slender
satisfaction, nor can they relate any story, or affixe a probable point to
its beginning: For some thereof (and those of the wisest amongst them)
are so far from determining its beginning, that they opinion and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it never had any at all; as the doctrine of Epicurus implyeth, and
more positively Aristotle in his bookes <hi>de Caelo</hi> declareth, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to confirme it with arguments of reason, and those appearingly
demonstrative; wherein to speake indifferently, his labours are rationall,

and a primary or first matter, beyond which no other hand
was apprehended: But herein we remaine sufficiently satisfied from
Moses, and the doctrine delivered of the Creation, that is a production
of all things out of nothing, a formation not only of matter, but of
forme, and a meteriation even of matter it selfe.</p>
               <p>Others are so far from defining the originall of the world or of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
that they have held opinions not only repugnant unto Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy

<hi>Aborigines,</hi> and in testimony thereof did weare a golden insect on their
heads; the very same name is also given unto the Inlanders or Midland
inhabitants of this Island by Caesar. But this is a conceit answerable
unto the generation of the Giants, not admittable in Philosophy, much
lesse in Divinity, which distinctly informeth wee are all the seed of
Adam, that the whole world perished unto eight persons before the

                  </gap>lood, and was after peopled by the Colonies of the sonnes of Noah;
there was therefore never any Autochthon, or man arising from the
earth but Adam, for the woman being formed out of the rib, was once
removed from earth, and framed from that element under incarnation.
And so although her production were not by copulation, yet was it in a
manner seminall: For if in every part from whence the seed doth
flow, there be contained the Idea of the whole, there was a seminality
and contracted Adam in the rib, which by the information of a soule,
was individuated into Eve. And therefore this conceit applyed unto
the orginall of man, and the beginning of the world, is more justly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriable
unto its end; for then indeed men shall rise out of the earth,
the graves shall shoot up their concealed seeds, and in that great

               <p>Others have been so blind in deducing the originall of things, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
their owne beginnings, that when it hath fallen into contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
they have not recurred unto Chronologie or the records of time,
but betaken themselves unto probabilities, and the conjecturalities of
Philosophy. Thus when the two ancient Nations, that is, Aegyprians
and Scythians contended for antiquity, the Aegyptians (as Diodorus
and Justine relate) pleaded their antiquity from the fertility of their
soyl, inferring that men there first inhabited, where they were with
most facility sustained, and such a land did they conceive was Aegypt.</p>
               <p>The Scythians although a cold and heavier Nation urged more
acutely, deducing their arguments from the two active elements and
principles of all things Fire and Water; for if of all things there was first
an union, and that afterward fire overruled the rest, surely that part of

by a new &amp; unknown experiment, bringing up two Infants with goats,

he forgot that speech was by instruction not instinct, by imitation, nor
by nature; that men do speak in some kind but like Parrets, and as they
are instructed, that is in simple tearms and words, expressing the open
notions of things, which the second act of reason compoundeth into

               <p>Lastly, some indeed there are, who have kept records of time, and
that of a considerable duration, yet doe the exactest thereof afford no
satisfaction concerning the beginning of the world, or any way point

of the antiquity of their Records, and those upon compute hee
found to amount unto 1903. yeares, which account notwithstanding
ariseth no higher then 95. yeares after the floud. The Arcadians I
confesse, were esteemed of great Antiquity, and it was usually said they
were before the Moone, according unto that of Seneca, <hi>Sydus post

they were existent before that Luminary, but were so esteemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

               <p>Thus the heathens affording no satisfaction herein, they are most
likely to manifest this truth who have been acquainted with holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,

floud, from thence unto Abraham, from Abraham unto the departure
from Aegypt, &amp;c. Now in this number have only beene Samaritans,
Jews, and Christians: for the Jews they agree not in their accounts, as
Bodine in his method of history hath observed out of Baal Seder,
Rabbi Nassom, Gersom, and others, in whose compute the age of the
world is not yet 5400. yeares; and the same is more evidently obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
from two most learned Jewes, Philo and Josephus, who very
much differ in the accounts of time, and variously summe up these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervalls
assented unto by all. Thus Philo from the departure out of
Aegypt unto the building of the Temple accounts but 920. yeares, but
Josephus sets downe 1062. Philo from the building of the Temple to
its destruction 440, Josephus 470, Philo from the creation to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Temple 3373; but Josephus 3513, Philo from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
to the destruction of the Temple 1718, but Josephus 1913, in
which computes there are manifest disparities, and such as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the concordance and harmony of times.</p>
               <p>But for the Samaritans, their account is different from these or any
others; for they account from the Creation to the Deluge, but 1302
yeares, which commeth to passe upon the different accoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the ages
of the Patriarks set downe when they begat children. For whereas
the Hebrew, Greek and Latine texts account Jared 162 when he begat
Enoch, they account but 62, and so in others. Now the Samaritans
were no incompetent judges of times and the Chronologie thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
they embraced the five bookes of Moses, and, it seemeth, preserved
the Text with far more integrity then the Jews; who as Tertullian,
Chrysostome, and others observe did severall wayes corrupt the same
especially in passages concerning the prophesies of Christ, so that as
Jerome professeth, in his translation he was faine sometime to relieve
himselfe by the Samaritane Pentateuch, as amongst others in that
Text, Deuteronomy 27, <hi>Maledictus omnis qui non permans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

quae scripta sunt in libro Legis.</hi> From hence St. Paul, Gal. 3. infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
there is no justification by the Law, and urgeth the Text according

unto what the Apostle had urged.</p>
               <p>As for Christians from whom wee should expect the exactest and
most concurring account, there is also in them a manifest disagreement,
and such as is not easily reconciled. For first, the Latins accord not in
their account; for to omit the calculation of the Ancients, of Austin,
Bede, and others, the Chronology of the Modernes doth manifestly
dissent; for Josephus Scaliger, whom Helvicus seemes to follow, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
the Creation in 765. of the Julian period; and from thence unto
the nativity of our Saviour alloweth 3947. yeares; But Dionysius Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius
a learned Chronologer dissenteth from this compute almost 40.
yeares, placing the Creation in the 730. of the Julian period, and
from thence unto the Incarnation accounteth 3983. yeares.</p>
               <p>For the Greeks, their accounts are more anomalous; for if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
unto ancient computes, we shall finde that Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
an ancient Father and preceptor unto Origen, accounted from the
Creation unto our Saviour, 5664. yeares; for in the first of his Stroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
he collecteth the time from Adam unto the death of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
to be 5858. yeares; now the death of Commodus he placeth in
the yeare after Christ 194. which number deducted from the former
there remaineth 5664. Theophilus Bishop of Antioch accounteth unto
the nativity of Christ 5515. deduceable from the like way of compute,
for in his first booke <hi>ad Antolycum,</hi> he accounteth from Adam unto
Aurelius Verus 5695. yeares; now that Emperour dyed in the yeare of
our Lord 180. which deducted from the former sum there remaineth
5515. Julius Africanus an ancient Chronologer, accounteth somewhat
lesse, that is, 5500. Eusebius Orosius and others dissent not much from
this, but all exceed five thousand.</p>
               <p>The latter compute of the Greeks, as Petavius observeth, hath been
reduced unto two or three accounts. The first accou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

5501. and this hath beene observed by Nicephorus, Theophanes,
and Maximus; the other accounts 5509. And this of all at present is
most generally received by the Church of Constantinople, observed
also by the Moscovite, as I have seene in the date of the Emperours
letters, wherein this yeare of ours 1645. is from the yeare of the world
7154. which doth exactly agree unto this last account 5509. for if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the richest ornament of his memorable Library; unto whom the high
Priest addressed six Jews out of every Tribe, which amounteth unto
72. and by these was effected that Translation wee usually terme the
Septuagint, or Translation of seventy; which name however it obtaine
from the number of their persons, yet in respect of one common Spirit,
it was the Translation but as it were of one man. For, as the story re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth,
although they were set apart and severed from each other, yet
were their Translations found to agree in every point, according as is
related by Philo and Josephus, although wee finde not the same in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risteus,
who hath expresly treated thereof.</p>
               <p>This Translation in ancient times was of great authority: By this
many of the Heathens receaved some notions of the Creation and the
mighty works of God; This in expresse termes is often followed by
the Evangelists, by the Apostles, and by our Saviour himselfe in the
quotations of the Old Testament. This for many years was used by the
Jews themselves, that is, such as did Hellenize and dispersedly dwelt
out of Palestine with the Greeks; And this also the succeeding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
and ancient Fathers observed, although there succeeded other
Greek versions, that is, of Aquila, Theodosius and Symmachus; for
the Latin translation of Jerome, called now the Vulger, was about
800. yeares after, although we shall not deny there was a Latin transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before, called the Italick version, and Austin forbad that of Jerom
to be used in his Diocesse.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever Interpretations there have beene since, have been espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
effected with reference unto these, that is, the Greeke and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
text; the Translators sometimes following the one, sometimes
adhering unto the other, according as they found them consonant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
truth, or most correspondent unto the rules of faith. Now however
it commeth to passe these two are very different in the enumeration of
Genealogies, and particular accounts of time; for in the second inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall,
that is betweene the floud and Abraham, there is by the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

introduced one Cainan to be the son of Arphaxad and father of
Salah; whereas in the Hebrew there is no mention of such a person,
but Arphaxad is set downe to be the father of Salah. But in the first
intervall, that is, from the Creation unto the floud, their disa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reement
is more considerable, for therein the Greek exceedeth the Hebrew,
and common account almost 600. yeares; and 'tis indeed a thing not
very strange, to be at the difference of a third part, in so large and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
an account, if wee consider how differently they are set forth in
minor and lesse mistakeable numbers. So in the Prophesie of Jonah,
both in the Hebrew and Latin text, it is said, Yet forty dayes and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivy
shall be overthrowne: But the Septuagint saith plainly, and that
in letters at length, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, yet three dayes and Ninivy

very ancient, discussed by Austin, and Theodoret, and was
conceived an errour committed by the Scribe. Men therefore have
raised different computes of time, according as they have followed
these different texts, and so have left the history of times far more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
then Chronology hath reduced.</p>
               <p>Againe, however the texts were plaine, and might in their numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
agree, yet were there no small difficulty to set downe a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Chronology, or establish from hence any sixed point of time;
for the doubts concerning the time of the Judges are inexplicable, that
of the Reignes and succession of Kings is as perplexed, it being uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
whether the yeares both of their lives and reignes ought to bee
taken as complete, or in their beginning and but currant accounts. And
thus also it is not unreasonable to make some doubt whether in the first
Ages, and long lives of our fathers, Moses doth not sometime account
by full and round numbers, whereas strictly taken they might be some
few yeares above or under; As in the age of Noah, it is delivered to
be just <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive hundred when he begat Sem, whereas perhaps hee might
be somewhat above or below that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound and complete number, for
the same way of speech is usuall in diverse other expressions: Thus doe
we say the Septuagint, and using the full and articulate number, doe
write the Translation of Seventy, whereas we have shewen before, the
precise number was seventy two; so is it said that Christ was three
dayes in the grave, according to that of Matthew, as Jonas was three
dayes and three nights in the Whales belly, so shall the Son of man be
three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
must be taken Synechdochically, or by understanding a part
for an whole day; for he remained but two nights in the grave, for he
was buried in the afternoone of the first day, and arose very early in
the morning on the third; that is, hee was interred in the Eve of the
Sabbath, and arose the morning after it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, although the number of yeares be determined and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood, there be without doubt a certaine truth herein, yet the
text speaking obscurely or dubiously, there is oft times no slender dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
at what point to begin or terminate the account. So when it is
said, Exod. 12. the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in
Aegypt was 430. yeares, it cannot be taken strictly, and from their first
arivall into Aegypt, for their habitation in that land was farre lesse; but
the account must begin from the covenant of God with Abhraham, and
must also comprehend their sojourne in the land of Canaan, according
as is expressed, Gal. 3. The Covenant that was con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irmed before of
God in Christ, the Law which was 430. yeares after cannot disanull.
Thus hath it also happened in the account of the 70. yeares of their
captivity, according to that of Jeremy, chap. 20. This whole land shall
be a desolation, and these nations shall serve the King of Babylon 70.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50218:150"/>
yeares; now where to begin, or end this compute ariseth no small dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty:
for there were three remarkable captivities, and deportations
of the Jewes; the first was in the third or fourth yeare of Joachim, and
first of Nabuchodonozer, when Daniel was carryed away; the second
in the raigne of Jeconiah, and the eighth yeare of the same King; the
third and most deploreable in the raigne of Zedechias, and in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
yeare of Nabuchodonozer, whereat both the Temple and
City were burned. Now such is the different conceit of these times,
that men have computed from all; but the probablest account and most
concordant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto the intention of Jeremy, is from the first of Nabucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donozer
unto the first of King Cyrus over Babylon; although the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Zachary, chap. 1. 12. accounteth from the last. O Lord of hostes,
How long! Wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem, against which
thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten yeeres? for he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this expostulation in the second year of Darius Histaspes, wherein
he prophesied, which is about eighteene yeares in account after the
other.</p>
               <p>Thus also although there be a certaine truth therein, yet is there no
easie doubt concerning the seventie weekes, or seventie times seven
years of Daniel; whether they have reference unto the nativitie or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our Saviour, and especially from whence, or what point of
time they are to be computed; for thus is it delivered by the angel Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel:
Seventy weekes are determined upon thy people; and againe in
the following verse: Know therefore and understand, that from the
going forth of the Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem
unto the Messias the Prince, shall be seven weekes, and threescore
and two weekes, the street shall be built againe, and the wall even in
troublesome times; and after threescore and two weekes shall Messiah
be cut off; Now the going out of the Commandment to build the
City, beeing the point from whence to compute, there is no slender
controversie when to begin; for there are no lesse then foure severall
Edicts to this effect; the one in the first yeere of Cyrus, the other in the
second of Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ius, the third and fourth in the seventh, and in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of Artaxerxes Longimanus; although as Petavius accounteth it
best, accordeth unto the twentie yeare of Artaxerxes, from whence
Nehemiah deriveth his Commission: Now that computes are made
incertainely with reference unto Christ, it is no wonder, since I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the time of his Nativitie is in controversie, and no lesse his age at
his Passion: For Clemens and Tertullian conceive he suffered at thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but Irenaeus a Father nearer his time, is further off in his account, that
is, betweene forty and fifty.</p>
               <p>Longomontanus a late Astronomer, endeavours to discover this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
from Astronomicall grounds, that is, the Apogeum of the Sunne,
conceiving the Excentricity invariable, and the Apogeum yearely to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:50218:151"/>
move one scruple, two seconds, fifty thirds, &amp;c. Wherefore if in the
time of Hipparchus, that is, in the yeare of the Julian period 4557. it
was in the fifth degree of Gemini, and in the dayes of Tycho Brahe,
that is, in the yeare of our Lord 1588. or of the world 5554. the
same was removed unto the fift degree of Cancer; by the proportion
of its motion, it was at the creation first in the beginning of Aries, and
the Perigeum or nearest point in Libra. But this conceit how ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or subtile soever is not of satisfaction; it being not determinable, or
yet agreed in what time precisely the Apogeum absolveth one degree,
as Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>avius hath also delivered in his fourth <hi>de Doctrina temporum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, however these or other difficulties intervene, and that wee
cannot satisfie our selves in the exact compute of time, yet may wee
notwithstanding sit downe with the common and usuall account; nor
are these differences derogatorie unto the Advent or Passion of Christ,
unto which indeed they all doe seeme to point; for the Prophecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our Saviour, were indefinitely delivered before that of Daniel;
for so was that pronounced unto Eve in Paradise, that after of Balaam,
those of Isaiah and the Prophets, and that memorable one of Jacob, the
Scepter shall not depart from Israel untill Shilo come; which time
notwithstanding it did not define at all. In what year therefore soever,
either from the destruction of the Temple, from the reedifying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
from the Flood, or from the Creation he appeared, certaine it is,
that in the fulnesse of time he came. When he therefore came is not so
considerable, as that he is come; in the one there is consolation, in the
other no satisfaction; The greater Quere is, when he will come again,
and yet indeed it is no Quere at all; for that is never to be knowne, and
therefore vainely enquired; 'tis a professed and authentick obscurity,
unknown to all but to the omniscience of the Almighty. Certainly the
ends of all things are wrapt up in the hands of God, he that undertakes
the knowledge thereof forgets his owne beginning, and disclaimes
his principles of earth; No man knows the end of the world, nor assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
of any thing in it: God sees it because unto his Eternity it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
hee knoweth the ends of us, but not of himselfe, and because hee
knowes not this, he knoweth all things, and his knowledge is endlesse,
even in the object of himselfe.</p>

Thus if wee suppose the Sunne created in Libra, in which signe
unto some it maketh Autumne, at the same time it had beene winter
unto the Northern-pole; for unto them at that time the Sun beginneth
to be invisible, and to shew it selfe againe unto the pole of the South,
unto the position of a right Sphere, or directly under the Aequator,
it had beene Summer; for unto that situation the Sunne is at that
time verticall: unto the latitude of Capricorne, or the Winter Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
it had been spring; for unto that position it had been in a middle
point, and that of ascent, or approximation; but unto the latitude of
Cancer or the Summer Solstice it had been Autumne; for then had it
it beene placed in a middle point, and that of descent, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And if wee shall take it literally what Moses described popularly,
this was also the constitution of the first day: for when it was evening
unto one longitude, it was morning unto another; when night unto one,
day unto another; and therefore that question whether our Saviour
shall come againe in the twilight, as is conceived he arose, or whether
he shall come upon us in the night, according to the comparison of a
thiefe, or the Iewish tradition, that he will come about the time of their
departure our of Aegypt, when they eate the Passeover, and the Angell
passed by the doores of their houses; this Quere I say needeth not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

broad day unto the Indians; if noone unto them, yet night unto the

different positions of the Spheare, as will be easily conceived by those
who understand the affections of different habitations, and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

the night, yet may the day of Judgement or Doomesday well retaine
that name; for that implyeth one revolution of the Sun, which maketh

yet to speake strictly, if (as the Apostle affirmeth) we shall be changed

in the twinckling of an eye, (and as the Schooles determine) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction

more seasonable, and is indeed in nature also determinable; yet posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to define that season, there is I conceive no slender difficulty; for
some contend that it began in the Spring, as beside Eusebius, Ambrose,
Bede, and Theodoret, some few years past <hi>Henrico Philippi</hi> in his
Chronologie of the Scripture: Others are altogether for Autumne;
and from hence doe our Chronologers commence their compute, as

               <p>AS for the divisions of the yeare, and the quartering out this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable

the first in frequent use with Astronomers, according to
the cardinall intersections of the Zodiack, that is the two Aequinoctials
and both the Solsticial points; defining that time to be the spring of the
yeare, wherein the Sunne doth passe from the Aequinox of Aries unto
the Solstice of Cancer; the time between the Solstice and the Aequin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.
Now this division although it be regular and equall, is not universall;
for it includeth not those latitudes, which have the seasons of the year
double; as have the Inhabitants under the Aequator, or else between the
Tropicks; for unto them the Sunne is verticall twice a yeare, making
two distinct Summers in the different points of verticallity. So unto
those which live under the Aequator, when the Sunne is in the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox
it is Summer, in which points it maketh Spring or Autumne unto
us; and unto them it is also Winter when the Sun is in either Tropick;
whereas unto us it maketh alwayes Summer in the one: And the like
will happen unto those habitations, which are between the Tropicks,
and the Aequator.</p>
               <p>A second and more sensible division there is observed by Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,
and most of the ancient Greekes, according to the rising and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50218:152"/>
setting of divers starres, dividing the yeare, and establishing the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of seasons from usuall alterations, and sensible mutations in the
ayre, discovered upon the rising and setting of those starres; accounting
the Spring from the Aequinoxiall point of Aries, from the rising of the
Pleiades, or the severall starres on the backe of Taurus, the Summer,
from the rising of Arcturus, a starre between the thighes of Bootes,
Autumne, and from the setting of the Pleiades, Winter: of these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
because they were unequall they were faine to subdivide the
two larger portions, that is of the Summer and Winter quarters; the
first part of the Summer they named <gap reason="foreign">

last which was their planting or grasing time <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; this way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
was in former ages received, is very often mentioned in Poets,
translated from one Nation to another, from the Greeks unto the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
as is received by good Authors, and delivered by Physitians, even
unto our times.</p>
               <p>Now of these two, although the first in some latitude may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned,
yet is not the other in any to be admitted: For in regard of
time (as we declare in the Chap. of canicular dayes) the starres do vary
their longitudes, and consequently the times of their ascention and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention;
That starre which is the terme of numeration or point, from
whence we commence the account, altering his site and longitude in
processe of time, and removing from West to East, almost one degree
in the space of 72 yeares; so that the same starre, since the age of Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates
who used this account, is removed in <hi>consequentia</hi> about 27
degrees; which difference of their longitudes, doth much diversifie the
times of their ascents, and rendereth the account unstable which shall
proceed thereby.</p>
               <p>Againe, in regard of different latitudes, this cannot be a setled rule
or reasonably applyed unto many Nations; for whereas the setting of
the Pleiades or seven starres is designed the terme of Autumne, and the
beginning of Winter; unto some latitudes these starres doe never set, as
unto all beyond 67 degrees; and if in severall and farre distant latitudes
we observe the same starre as a common terme of account unto both,
we shall fall upon an unexpected, but an unsufferable absurdity; and by
the same account it will be Summer unto us in the North, before it be
so unto those, which unto us are Southward, and many degrees approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
nearer the Sun. For if we consult the doctrine of the sphere, and
observe the ascention of the Pleiades, which maketh the beginning of
Summer, we shall discover that in the latitude of 40, these starres arise
in the 16 degree of Taurus; but in the latitude of 50 they ascend in the
eleventh degree of the same signe, that is 5 day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in England, before it grow hot in Spaine.</p>
               <p>This is therefore no generall way of compute, nor reasonable to be
derived from one Nation unto another, the defect of which considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath effected divers errors in Latine Poets, translating these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions

hee setteth downe a precept to beginne harvest at the arise of the
Pleiades, which in his time was in the beginning of May. This indeed
was consonant unto the clyme wherein he lived, and their harvest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
about that season, but is not applyable unto our owne; for therein
we are so farre from expecting an harvest, that our Barley seed is not
ended: Againe, correspondent unto the precept of Hesiod, Virgil
affordeth another—

                  </q>
Understanding hereby their Cosmicall descent, or their setting when
the Sunne ariseth, and not their Heliacall obscuration, or their inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in the lustre of the Sunne, as Servius upon this place would have
it; for at that time these starres are many signes removed from that lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary.
Now herein he strictly delivereth a precept, not to beginne
to sow before the setting of these starres; which notwithstanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an injury to agriculture, cannot be observed in England; for they
set unto us about the 12 of November, when our seed time is almost
ended.</p>
               <p>And this diversity of clyme and observations Caelestiall, precisely
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50218:153"/>
observed unto certaine starres and months, hath not onely overthrown
the deductions of one Nation to another, but hath perturbed the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of festivities and statary solemnities, even with the Jewes
themselves: for unto them it was commanded that at their entrance
into the land of Canaan, in the fourteenth of the first month, that is
Abib or Nisan which is Spring with us, they should observe the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of the Passeover; and on the morrow after, which is the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
day of the feast of unleavened bread; and in the sixteenth of the
same month, that they should offer the first sheafe of the harvest. Now
all this was feasible and of an easie possibility in the land of Canaan, or
latitude of Jerusalem; for so is it observed by severall Authors in later
times, and is also testified by holy Scripture in times very far before;<note place="margin">Josh. 3.</note>
for so when the children of Israel passed the river Jordan, it is delivered
by way of Parenthesis, that the river overfloweth its banks in the time
of harvest, which is conceived the time wherein they passed, and chap.
5. it is after delivered, that in the fourteenth day they celebrated the
Passeover, which according to the Law of Moses was to be observed
in the first month, or month of Abib.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is no wonder, nor any Paradox what is related by
Luke, that the Disciples upon the Deuteroproton, as they passed by,
plucked the ears of corne; for the Deuteroproton or second first Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
was the first Sabbath after the deutera or second of the Passeover,
which was the sixteenth of Nisan or Abib; and this is also evidenced
from the receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d construction of the first and latter rayne, delivered
Deut. 11. I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first
rain and the latter raine; for the first rayn fell upon the seed time about
October, and was to make the seed to root, the latter was to fill the car,
and fell in Abib, or March the first month; according as is expressed
Joel 2. And he will cause to come downe for you the rayne, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rayne, and the latter rayne in the first month, that is the month of
Abib wherein the Passeover was observed. This was the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and this in the land of Canaan was well observed according to
the first institution; but since their dispersion and habitation in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
whose constitutions admit not such tempestivity of harvest, and
many not before the latter end of Summer, notwithstanding the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of their Lunary account, and intercalary month, Veader affixed
unto the beginning of the yeare, there will be found a great disparity
in their observations, nor can they strictly and at the same season with
their forefathers observe the commands of their God.</p>
               <p>To adde yet further, those Geoponicall rules and precepts of Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture
which are delivered by divers Authors, are not to be generally
received, but respectively unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stood unto clymes wherein they are
determined. For whereas one adviseth to sow this or that at one sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
a second to set this or that at another, it must be conceived relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50218:154"/>
and every Nation must have its Country Farme; for herein we may
observe a manifest and visible difference, not only in the seasons of
harvest, but in the graines themselves; for with us Barley harvest is
made after Wheat harvest, but with the Israelites and Aegyptians it
was otherwise; and so is it expressed by way of priority, Ruth the 2.
So Ruth kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to gleane unto the end of
Barley harvest and of Wheat harvest; which in the plague of hayle in
Aegypt is more plainly delivered Exod. 9. And the Flax and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
were smitten, for the Barley was in the eare and the Flax was bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
but the Wheat and the Rye were not smitton, for they were not
growne up.</p>
               <p>And thus we see the account established upon the arise or descent of
the starres can be no reasonable rule unto distant Nations at all, and by
reason of their retrogression but temporary unto any one; nor must
these respective expressions be entertained in absolute considerations;
for so distinct is the relation, and so artificiall the habitude of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
globe unto the superiour, and even of one thing in each unto
the other: that generall rules are dangerous, and applications most
safe that runne with security of circumstance, which rightly to effect is
beyond the subtilty of sense, and requires the artifice of reason.</p>

unto truth; For they encrease in the month of March, almost
as much as in the two months of January and February; and decrease
as much in September, as they doe in July and August: For indeed
the dayes encrease or decrease according to the declina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion of the Sun;
that is, its deviation Northward or Southward from the Aequator.
Now this digression is not equall, but neare the Aequinoxiall intersecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it is right and greater, neare the Solstices more oblique and lesser.
So from the eleventh of March the vernall Aequinox unto the eleventh
of Aprill the Sun decl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

15 of June, or the Summer Solstice but 3 and a halfe; all which make
23 degrees and an halfe, the greatest declination of the Sun.</p>
               <p>And this inequality in the declination of the Sun in the Zodiacke or
line of life, is correspondent unto the growth or declination of man;
for setting out from our infancie we encrease not equally, or regularly

attaine to our state or perfection; nor when we descend from our state,
and tend unto the earth againe is our declination equall, or carryeth us
with even paces unto the grave. For, as Hippocrates affirmeth, a man
is hottest in the first day of his life, and coldest in the last; his naturall
heate setteth forth most vigorously at first, and declineth most sensibly
at last. And so though the growth of man end not perhaps untill 21.

we attaine unto at seven yeares, we do sometimes but double, most
times come short at one and twenty. And so do we decline againe; for
in the latter age upon the Tropick and first descension from our solstice,
wee are scarce sensible of declination; but declining further, our
decrement accelerates, we set apace, and in our last dayes precipitate
into our graves. And thus are also our progressions in the wombe, that
is, our formation, motion, our birth or exclusion. For our formation is
quickly effected, our motion appeareth later, and our exclusion very
long after: if that be true which Hippocrates and Avicenna have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that the time of our motion is double unto that of formation,
and that of exclusion treble unto that of motion; as if the Infant bee
formed at 35. dayes, it moveth at 70. and is borne the 210. day, that is,
the seventh month; or if it receaves not formation before 45. dayes,
it moveth the 90. day, and is excluded in 270. that is, the 9. month.</p>
               <p>There are also certaine popular prognosticks drawne from festivals
in the Calendar, and conceaved opinions of certaine dayes in months,
so is there a generall tradition in most parts of Europe, that inferreth
the coldnesse of succeeding winter from the shining of the Sun upon
Candlemas day, according to the proverbiall distich.—

So is it usuall amongst us to qualifie and conditionate the twelve
months of the yeare, answerably unto the temper of the twelve dayes
in Christmasse, and to ascribe unto March certaine borrowed dayes
from Aprill; all which men seeme to beleeve upon annuall experience
of their own, and the receaved traditions of their forefathers.</p>
               <p>Now it is manifest, and most men likewise know, that the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of these computers, and the accounts of these dayes are very
different; the Greeks dissenting from the Latins, and the Latins from
each other; the one observing the Julian or ancient account, as great
Britaine and part of Germany; the other adhering to the Gregorian or
new account, as Italy, France, Spaine, and the united Provinces of the
Netherlands. Now this latter account by ten dayes at least anticipateth
the other; so that before the one beginneth the accout, the other is
past it; yet in these severall calculations, the same events seeme true,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:50218:155"/>
and men with equall opinion of verity, expect and confesse a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from them both. Whereby is evident the Oraculous authority
of tradition, and the easie seduction of men, neither enquiring into
the verity of their substance, nor reforming upon repugnance of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance.</p>
               <p>And thus may diverse easily be mistaken who superstitiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
certaine times, or set downe unto themselves an observation of
unfortunate months, or dayes, or howres; As did the Aegyptians, two

Calends. And thus the Rules of Navigators must often faile, setting

               <p>HAving thus beheld the Ignorance of man in some things, his error
and blindnesse in others; that is, in the measure of duration both of
yeares and seasons, let us a while admire the Wisdome of God in this
distinguisher of times, and visible Deity, as some have termed it, the
Sun; which though some from its glory adore, and all for its benefits
ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ire, we shall advance from other considerations, and such as illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the artifice of its Maker; nor doe wee thinke we can excuse the
duty of our knowledge, if we onely bestow the flourish of Poetry here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or those commendatory conceits which popularly set forth the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:50218:155"/>
eminency of this creature, except we ascend unto subtiler considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and such as rightly understood, convinsively declare the wisdome
of the Creator, which since a Spanish Physition hath begun, wee will
inlarge with our owne deductions; and this we shall endeavour from
two considerations, that is, its proper situation, and wisely ordered
motion.</p>
               <p>And first, we cannot passe over his providence in that it moveth at
all; for, had it stood still, and were it fixed like the earth, there had
beene then no distinction of times, either of day or yeare, of Spring, of
Autumne, of Summer, or of Winter; for these seasons are defined by
the motions of the Sun; when that approacheth neerest us, wee call it
Summer, when furthest off, Winter, when in the middle spaces, Spring
or Autumne; whereas remaining in one place these distinctions had
ceased, and consequently the generation of all things depending on
their vicissi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udes; making in one hemisphere a perpetuall Summer, in
the other a deplorable and comfortlesse Winter, and thus had it also
beene continuall day unto some, and perpetuall night unto others; for
the day is defined by the abode of the Sun above the Horizon, and
the night by its continuance below; so should we have needed another
Sun, one to illustrate our hemisphere, a second to enlighted the other,
which inconvenience will ensue, in what site soever we place it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the poles, or the Aequator, or betweene them both; no spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
body of what bignesse soever illuminating the whole sphere of
another, although it illuminate something more then halfe of a lesser,
according unto the doctrine of the Opiticks.</p>
               <p>His wisdome is againe discernable not onely in that it moveth at all,
and in its bare motion, but wonderfull in contriving the line of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution;
which from his artifice is so effected, that by a vicissitude in
one body and light, it suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iceth the whole earth, affording thereby a
possible or pleasurable habitation in every part thereof; and that is the
line Eclyptick, all which to effect by any other circle it had beene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
For first, if we imagine the Sun to make his course out of the
Eclyptick, and upon a line without any obliquity, let it be conceaved
within that Circle, that is, either on the Aequator, or else on either
side (for, if we should place it either in the Meridian or Colures, beside
the subversion of its course from East to West, there would ensue the
like incommodities.) Now if we conceave the Sun to move betweene
the obliquity of this Eclyptick in a line upon one side of the Aequator,
then would the Sunne be visible but unto one pole, that is, the same
which was nearest unto it. So that unto the one it would be perpetuall
day, unto the other perpetuall night; the one would be oppressed with
constant heate, the other with unsufferable cold; and so the defect of
alternation would utterly impugne the generation of all things, which
naturally require a vicissitude of heate to their production, and no
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:50218:156"/>
lesse to their encrease and conservation.</p>
               <p>But if we conceive it to move in the Aequator; first, unto a parallell
sphere, or such as have the pole for their Zenith, it would have made
neither perfect day nor night; for being in the Aequator it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersect
their Horizon, and be halfe above, and halfe beneath it; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it would have made perpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uall night to both: for though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the rationall Horizon, which bissecteth the Globe into equall
parts, the Sunne in the Aequator would intersect the Horizon: yet in
respect of the sensible Horizon (which is defined by the eye) the Sun
would bee visible unto neither. For if as ocular witnesses report, and
some doe also write, by reason of the connexity of the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rth the
eye of man under the Aequator cannot discover both the poles,
neither would the eye under the pole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> discover the Sunne in the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator.
And thus would there nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ructifie either neare or
under them, the Sunne being Horizontall to the poles, and of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
altitude unto parts a reasonable distance from them. Again,
unto a right sphere, or such as dwell under the Aequator, although it
made a difference in day and night, yet would it not make any distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of seasons: for unto them it would be constant Summer, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alwayes verticall, and never de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lecting from them: So had there
been no fructification at all, and the Countries subjected would be as
inhabitable, as indeed antiquity conceived them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it moving thus upon the Aequator, unto what position so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
although it had made a day, yet could it have made no yeare;
for it could not have had those two motions now ascribed unto it, that
is, from E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st to West, whereby it makes the day, and likewise from
West to East, whereby the yeare is computed: for according to Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
the poles of the Aequator are the same with those of the <hi>Primum
Mobile.</hi> Now it is impossible that on the same circle, having the same
poles, both these motions from opposite termes, should be at the same
time performed; all which is salved if we allow the Sunne an obliquity
in his annuall motion, and conceive him to move upon the poles of the
Zodiack, distant from these of the world 23 degrees and an halfe:
A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d thus may we discerne the necessity of its obliquity, and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
its motion had been upon a circle parallell to the Aequator,
or upon the Aequator it selfe.</p>
               <p>Now with what providence this obliquity is determined, we shall
evidently perceive upon the ensuing inconveniences from any deviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for first, if its obliquity had been lesse, as instead of twenty three
degrees, twelve or the halfe thereof, the vicissitude of seasons appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the generation of all things, would surely have been too short;
for different seasons would have hudled upon each other, and unto
some it had not been much better then if it had moved on the Aequator:
but had the obliquity been greater then now it is, as double or of 40.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:50218:156"/>
degrees, severall parts of the earth had not been able to endure the
disproportionable differences of seasons, occasioned by the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
and distance of the Sunne: for unto some habitations the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
would have been extreme hot, and the Winter extreme cold; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Summer temperate unto some, but excessive and in extremity
unto others, as unto those who should dwell under the Tropicke of
Cancer, as then would doe some part of Spaine, or ten degrees beyond,
as Germany, and some part of England, who would have Summers
as now the Moores of Africa; for the Sunne would sometime be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
unto them: but they would have Winters like those beyond the
Articke Circle, for in that season the Sunne would be removed above
80 degrees from them. Againe, it would be temperate to some habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in the Summer, but very extreme in the Winter; temperate to
those in two or three degrees beyond the Artick Circle, as now it is
unto us; for they would be equidistant from that Tropick, even as we
are from this at present; but the Winter would be extreme, the Sun
being removed above an hundred degrees, and so consequently would
not be visible in their Horizon; no position of sphere discovering any
starre distant above 90 degrees, which is the distance of every Zenith
from the Horizon. And thus if the obliquity of this Circle had been
lesse, the vicissitude of seasons had been so small as not to be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed;
if greater, so large and disproportionable as not to be endured.</p>
               <p>Now for its situation, although it held this Eclypticke line, yet had
it been seated in any other Orbe, inconveniences would ensue of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
like the former; for had it been placed in the lowest sphere, and
where is now the Moone, the yeare would have consisted but of one
moneth; for in that space of time it would have passed through every
every part of the Eclyptick, so would there have been no reasonable
distinction of seasons required for the generation and fructifying of all
things; contrary seasons which destroy the effects of one another, so
suddenly succeeding; besides by this vicinity unto the earth its heat
had been intollerable: for if (as many affirme) there is a different sense
of heat from the different points of its proper orbe, and that in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogeum
or highest point (which happeneth in Cancer) it is not so hot
under that Tropick, on this side the Aequator, as unto the other side in
the Perigeum or lowest part of the eccentric (which happeneth in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricornus)
surely being placed in an orbe farre lower, its heat would be
unsufferable, nor needed we a fable to set the world on fire.</p>
               <p>But had it been placed in the highest Orbe or that of the eight sphere,
there had been none but Platoes yeare, and a farre lesse distinction of
seasons; for one yeare had then been many, and according unto the
slow revolution of that orbe which absolveth not his course in many
thousand years, no man had lived to attaine the account thereof. These
are the inconveniences ensuing upon its situation in the extreme orbes,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:50218:157"/>
and had it been placed in the middle orbes of the Planets, there would
have ensued absurdities of a middle and participating nature.</p>
               <p>Nor whether we adhere unto the hypothesis of Copernicus, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Earth to move, and the Sunne to stand still; or whether wee
hold as some of late have concluded from the spots in the Sun, which
appeare and dis-appeare againe; that besides the revolution it maketh
with its Orbes, it hath also a dineticall motion and rowles upon its
owne poles; whether I say we affirme these or no, the illations before
mentioned are not thereby infringed: we therefore conclude this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
and are not afraid to believe, it may be literally said of the
wisdome of God, what men will have figuratively spoken of the works
of Christ, that if the wonders thereof were duly described, the whole
world, that is all within the last circumference, would not containe
them; for as his wisdome is in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now from the first hereof that most concerneth us, wee have little
or no assistance, the fragments and broken records hereof inforcing not
at all our purpose; and although some things not usually observed, may
be from thence collected, yet doe they not advantage our discourse,
nor any way make evident the point in hand: For the second, though
it directly concernes us not, yet in regard of our last medium and some
illustrations therein, we shall be constrained to make some use thereof.
As for the last it concernes us not at all, for treating of times far below
us, it can no way advantage us; and though diverse in this last Age
have also written of the first, as all that have delivered the generall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of time, yet are their Tractates little auxiliary unto ours, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
us any light to detenebrate and cleare this truth.</p>
               <p>As for holy Scripture and divine relation, there may also seeme
therein but slender information, there being onely left a briefe narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hereof by Moses, and such as afford no positive determination. For
the text delivereth but two genealogies, that is, of Cain and Seth; in
the line of Seth there are onely ten descents, in that of Cain but seven,
and those in a right line with mention of father and sonne, excepting
that of Lamech, where is also mention of wives, sons, and a daughter:
notwithstanding if we shall seriously consider what is delivered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and what is also deducible, it will be probably declared what is by
us intended, that is, the populous and ample habitation of the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the floud, which wee shall labour to induce not from postulates
and entreated Maximes, but undeniable principles declared in holy
Scripture, that is, the length of mens lives before the floud, and the
large extent of time from the creation thereunto.</p>
               <p>We shall onely first crave notice, that although in the relation of
Moses there be very few persons mentioned, yet are there many more
to be presumed; nor when the Scripture in the line of Seth nominats but
ten persons, are they to be conceaved all that were of this generation;
the Scripture singly delivering the holy line, wherein the world was
to be preserved, first in Noah, and afterward in our Saviour. For in this
line it is manifest there were many more borne then are named; for it
is said of them all, that they begat sons and daughters. And whereas
it is very late before it is said they begat those persons which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the Scripture, the soonest at 65. it must not be understood that
they had none before, but not any in whom it pleased God the holy
line should be continued. And although that expression that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
sons and daughters be not determined to be, before or after the
mention of these, yet must it be before in some; for before it is said
that Adam begat Seth at the 130. yeare, it is plainly affirmed that Cain
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:50218:158"/>
knew his wife, and had a son, which must be one of the daughters of
Adam, one of those whereof it is after faid, hee begat sons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
And so for ought can be disproved there might be more persons
upon earth then are commonly supposed, when Cain slew Abel, nor
the fact so hainously to be aggravated in the circumstance of the fourth
person living. And whereas it is said upon the nativity of Seth, God
hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, it doth not imply he
had no other all this while, but not any of that expectation, or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(as his name implies) to make a progression in the holy line, in
whom the world was to be saved, and from whom he should be borne,
that was mystically slaine in Abel.</p>
               <p>Now our first ground to induce the numerosity of people before
the floud, is the long duration of their lives beyond 7. 8. and 9. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares, which how it conduceth unto populosity wee shall make
but little doubt, if we consider there are two maine causes of numero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
in any kind or species, that is, a frequent and multiparous way of
breeding, whereby they fill the world with others, though they exist
not long themselves; or a long duration and subsistence, whereby they
doe not onely replenish the world with a new annumeration of others,
but also maintaine the former account in themselves. From the first
cause we may observe examples in creatures oviparous, as birds and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ishes; in vermiparous, as Flies, Locusts, and G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ats; in animals also
viviparous, as Swine and Conies; of the first there is a great example
in the heard of Swine in Galilee, although it were an uncleane beast,
and forbidden unto the Jews. Of the other a very remarkable one in
Atheneus, in the Isle Astipalea, one of the Cyclades now called Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palia,
wherein from two that were imported, the number so encreased,
that the Inhabitants were constrained to have recourse unto the Oracle
of Delphos, for an invention how to destroy them.</p>
               <p>Others there are which make good the paucity of their breed with
the length and duration of their dayes, whereof there want not ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amples
in animals uniparous: First, in bisulcous or cloven hooft, as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,
and Beeves, whereof there is above a million annually slaine in
England: It is also said of Job, that he had a thousand yoake of Oxen,
and six thousand Camels; and of the children of Israel passing into the
land of Canaan, that they tooke from the Midianites threescore and
ten thousand Beeves; and of the Army of Semiramis, that there were
therein 100000. Camels; for Solipes, or firme hoofed creatures, as Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Asses, Mules, &amp;c. they are also in mighty numbers; so is it delivered
that Job had a thousand she Asses: that the Midianites lost 61000. Asses:
for horses it is affirmed by Diodorus, that Ninus brought against the
Bactrians 280000. horses; after him Semiramis 500000. horses, and
Chariots 100000. even in creatures sterill and such as do not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
the length of life conduceth much unto the multiplicity of the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:50218:159"/>
species; for the number of Mules which live farre longer then their
Dammes or Sires, in countries where they are bred is very remarkable,
and farre more common then horses.</p>
               <p>For animals multifidous, or such as are digitated or have severall
divisions in their feete, there are but two that are uniparous, that is,
Men and Elephants; in whom though their generations be but single,
they are notwithstanding very numerous. The Elephant (as Aristotle
affirmeth) carryeth the young two yeares and conceaveth not againe
(as <hi>Edvardus Lopez</hi> affirmeth) in many after; yet doth their age requite
this disadvantage, they living commonly one hundred, sometime two
hundred yeares. Now although they be unusuall with us in Europe,
and altogether unknowne unto America, yet in the two other parts
they are abundant, as evidently appeares by the relation of <hi>Gorcias ab
Horto,</hi> Physitian to the Viceroy at Goa; who in his Chapter <hi>de Ebore,</hi>
relates that at one venation the King of Sian tooke foure thousand, and
is of opinion they are in other parts, in greater number then heards of
Beeves in Europe. And though this delivered from a Spaniard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with our Northerne droves, may seeme very farre to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
yet must we conceave them very numerous, if wee consider the
number of teeth transported from one Countrey to another, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
onely two great teeth, and those not falling or renewing.</p>
               <p>As for man the disadvantage in his single issue is the same with
these, and in the latenesse of his generation somewhat greater then any;
yet in the continuall and not interrupted time thereof, and the extent of
dayes, he becomes at present, if not then any other species, at least
more numerous then these before mentioned. Now being thus nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
at present, and in the measure of threescore, four score or an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, if their dayes extended unto sixe, seven, or eight hund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed,
their generations would be proportionably multiplied; their times of
generation being not onely multiplyed, but their subsistence continued;
for though the great Grandchild went on, the Tycho or first Originall
would subsist and make one of the world, though he outlived all the
termes of consanguinity, and became a stranger unto his proper proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
So by compute of Scripture Adam lived unto the ninth generation,
unto the dayes of Lamech the father of Noah; Methuselah unto the
yeare of the floud, and Noah was contemporary unto all from Enoch
unto Abraham. So that although some dyed, the father beholding so
many discents, the number of survivers must still be very great; for if
halfe the men were now alive, which lived in the last Century, the
earth would scarce con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aine their number; whereas in our abridged
and septuagesimall ages, it is very rare and deserves a distich to behold
the fourth generation: Xerxes complaint still remaining, and what he
lamented in his Army, being almost deplorable in the whole world,
men seldome ariving unto those yeares whereby Methuselah exceeded
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50218:159"/>
nine hundred, and what Adam came short of a thousand, was defined
long agoe to be the age of man.</p>
               <p>Now although the length of dayes conduceth mainely unto the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merosity
of mankinde, and it be manifest from Scripture they lived
very long, yet is not the period of their lives determinable, and some
might be longer livers, then we account that any were; For, (to omit
that conceit of some, that Adam was the oldest man, in as much as he
is conceaved to be created in the maturity of mankinde, that is, at 60.
(for in that age it is set downe they begat children) so that adding this
number unto his 930. he was 21. yeares older then any of his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
that even Methuselah was the longest lived of all the children of
Adam, we need not grant, nor is it definitively set downe by Moses:
Indeed of those ten mentioned in Scripture with their severall ages it
must be true; but whether those seven of the line of Caine and thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
progeny, or any of the sons or daughters posterity after them outlived
those, is not expressed in holy Scripture; and it will seeme more
probable that of the line of Caine, some were longer lived then any of
Seth, if we concede that seven generations of the one lived as long as
nine of the other. As for what is commonly alledged, that God
would not permit the life of any unto a thousand, because (alluding
unto that of David) no man should live one day in the sight of the
Lord, although it be urged by divers, yet is it me thinks an inference
somewhat Rabbinicall, and not of power to perswade a serious exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator.</p>
               <p>Having thus made manifest in generall how powerfully the length
of lives conduced unto populosity of those times, it will yet be easier
acknowledged if we discend to particularities, and consider how many
in seven hundred yeares might discend from one man; wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the length of their dayes, we may conceave the greatest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to have beene alive together. And this that no reasonable spirit
may contradict, wee will declare with manifest disadvantage; for
whereas the duration of the world unto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>loud was above 1600.
yeares, we will make our compute in lesse then halfe that time; nor
will we begin with the first man, but allow the earth to bee provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of women fit for marriage the second or third first Centuries; and
will onely take as granted, that they might beget children at sixty, and
at an hundred yeares have twenty, allowing for that number forty
yeares. Nor will we herein single out Methuselah, or account from the
longest livers, but make choice of the sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>test of any wee finde recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Text, excepting Enoch; who after hee had lived as many
yeares as there be dayes in the yeare, was translated at 365. And thus
from one stock of seven hundred yeares, multiplying still by twenty,
we shall finde the product to be one thousand, three hundred forty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
millions, three hundred sixty eight thousand, foure hundred and
twenty.</p>

to beget children about six yeares of age; for whereas it is said he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat

               <p>Having thus declared how much the length of mens lives conduced
unto the populosity of their kinde, our second foundation must be the
large extent of time, from the Creation unto the Deluge; that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50218:160"/>
unto received computes about 1655 yeares) a longer time then
hath passed since the nativity of our Saviour; and which we cannot but
conceive sufficient for a very large encrease, if we do but affirm what
reasonable enquirers will not deny; That the earth might be as popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in that number of yeares before the Flood, as we can manifest it
was in the same number after. And whereas there may be conceived
some disadvantage, in regard that at the Creation, the originall of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
was in two persons, but after the Flood their propagation issued
at least from sixe; against this we might very well set the length of their
lives before the Flood, which were abreviated after, and in halfe this
space contracted into hundreds and threescores. Notwithstanding to
equalize accounts, we will allow three hundred yeares, and so long a
time as we can manifest from the Scripture, There were foure men at
least that begat children, Adam, Cain, Seth, and Enos; so shall wee
fairly and favourably proceed if we affirme the world to have been as
populous in sixteen hundred and fifty yeares before the Flood, as it
was in thirteen hundred after. Now how populous and largely inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
it was within this period of time, we shall endeavour to declare
from probabilities, and severall testimonies of Scripture and humane
Authors.</p>
               <p>And first, to manifest the same neere those parts of the Earth where
the Arke is presumed to have rested, wee have the relation of holy
Scripture accounting the genealogie of Japhet, Cham and Sem, and in
this last, foure descents unto the division of the earth in the dayes of
Peleg, which time although it were not upon common compute much
above an hundred yeares, yet were they at this time mightily encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
nor can we well conceive it otherwise, if we consider they began
already to wander from their first habitation, and were able to attempt
so mighty a worke as the building of a City and a Tower, whose top

number of persons, if we consider the magnitude thereof, expressed
by some, &amp; conceived to be <hi>Turris Beli</hi> in Herodotus; and the multitudes
of people recorded at the erecting of the like or inferiour structures: for
so is it delivered in the Book of Kings, that at the building of Solomons
Temple there were threescore and ten thousand that carryed burdens,
and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountaines, beside the chiefe of
his officers three thousand and three hundred; and at the erecting of the
Pyramids in the reigne of King Cheops, as Herodotus reports there
were <hi>decem</hi> myriades, that is an hundred thousand men. And though
it be said of the Aegyptians, <hi>Porrum &amp; caepe nefas violare &amp; frangere
morsu;</hi> yet did the summes expended in Garlicke and Onyons amount
unto no lesse then one thousand six hundred Talents.</p>
               <p>The first Monarchy or Kingdome of Babylon is mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
under the foundation of Nimrod, which is also recorded in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50218:161"/>
history; as beside Berosus, in Diodorus and Justine, for Nimrod
of the Scriptures is Belus of the Gentiles, and Assur the same with Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
his successour. There is also mention of divers Cities, particularly
of Ninivy and Resen expressed emphatically in the Text to be a great
City.</p>
               <p>That other Countries round about were also peopled, appeares by
the Wars of the Monarchs of Assyria with the Bactrians, Indians, Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyans,
Aethiopians, Armenians, Hyrcanians, Parthians, Persians, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians;
they vanquishing (as Diodorus relateth) Aegypt, Syria, and all
Asia minor, even from Bosphorus unto Tanais. And it is said, that
Semiramis in her expedition against the Indians, brought along with
her the King of Arabia. About the same time of the Assyrian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
do Authors place that of the Sycionians in Greece, and soone
after, that of the Argives, and not very long after, that of the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
under Cecrops; and within our period assumed are hystorified ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
memorable actions of the Greekes, as the expedition of the Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nautes,
with the most famous Wars of Thebes and Troy.</p>
               <p>That Canaan also and Aegypt were well peopled farre within this
period, besides their plantation by Canaan and Misraim, appeareth from
the history of Abraham, who in lesse then 400 yeares after the Flood
journied from Mesopotamia unto Canaan and Aegypt; both which he
found well peopled and policied into Kingdomes; wherein also in
430 yeares, from threescore and ten persons which came with Jacob
into Aegypt he became a mighty Nation: for it is said, at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there journyed from Rhamesis to Succoth about six hundred
thousand on foot, that were men besides children. Now how popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
the land from whence they came was, may be collected not only
from their ability in commanding so mighty subjections, but from the
severall accounts of that Kingdome delivered by Herodotus; and how
soone it was peopled is evidenced from the pillar of their King Osyris,
with this inscription in Diodorus; <hi>Mihi pater est Saturnus deorum junior,

ancient Fathers, Adam was buried in the same place, where Christ
was crucified, that is Mount Calvary, the first man ranged farre
before the Flood, and laid his bones many miles from that place,
where its presumed he received them: And this migration was the

The like might we affirme from credible histories both of France

the fabulous and Trojan originall delivered by Jeofrey of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
and the expresse text of Scripture, that the race of J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

people the Isles of the Gentiles; (in which number this of ours hath
beene specially accounted) their originall was so obscure in Caesars
time, that he affirmeth the Inland inhabitants were Aborigines, that is,
such as reported, that they had their beginning in the Island; That
Ireland our neighbour Island was not long time without Inhabitants,
may be made probable by sundry accounts, although we ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus though we have declared how largely the world was inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
within the space of 1300 years, yet must it be conceived more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
then can be evinced; for a greater part of the Earth hath ever
been peopled, then hath been known or described by Geographers, as
will appeare by the discoveries of all ages; for neither in Herodotus or
Thucydides do we finde any mention of Rome, nor in Ptolomy of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts of Europe, Asia, or Africa: and because many places wee have
declared of long plantation, of who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e populosity notwithstanding or
memorable actions we have no ancient story, if we may conjecture of
these by what we finde related of others, wee shall not need many
words, nor assume the halfe 1300 yeares, and this we might illustrate
from the mighty acts of the Assyrians performed not long after the
Flood, and recorded by Justine and Diodorus, who makes relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of expeditions by Armies more numerous then have beene ever
since. For Ninus King of Assyria brought against the Bactrians 700000
foot, 200000 horse, 10600 Chariots; Semiramis his successor led against
the Indians 1300000 foot, 500000 horse, 100000 Chariots, and as
many upon Camells: And it is said, Staurobates the Indian King met
her with greater force then she brought against him; all which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
within lesse then foure hundred yeares after the Flood.</p>
               <p>Now if any man imagine the unity of their language did hinder their

not much afterward: for though it might restraine their dispersion, it
could not their populosity, which necessarily requireth transmigration
&amp; emission of Colonies, as we read of Romanes, Greeks, Phaeniceans in
ages past, and have beheld examples thereof in our dayes; and we may
also observe that after the Flood before the confusion of tongues, men
began to disperse; for it is said, they journied towards the East, and
the Scripture it selfe expresseth a necessity conceived of their disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
for the intent of erecting the Tower is so delivered in the text, lest

in regard of Navigation and shipping discovered since the Flood,
whereby the Islands and devided parts of the earth are now inhabited;
hee must consider that whether there were Islands or no before the
Flood is not yet determined, and is with probability denyed by very
learned Authors.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if we shall fall into apprehension that it was lesse inhabited,
because it is said in the sixt of Genesis about 120. yeares before the
Flood, and it came to passe that when men began to multiply upon
the face of the earth: Beside that this may be onely meant of the race
of Cain, it will not import they were not multiplyed before, but that
they were at that time plentifully encreased; for so is the same word
used in other parts of Scripture. And so is it afterward in the 9. Chap.
said that Noah began to be an husbandman, that is, he was so, or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
performed the Acts thereof: so it is said of our Saviour that he
began to cast them out that bought and sold in the Temple; that is, he
actually cast them out, or with alacrity effected it.</p>
               <p>And thus have I declared my private and probable conceptions in
the enquiry of this truth; but the certainty hereof let the Arithmeticke

part be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>earmed East, every habitation differing in longitude, will
have this point also different, in as much as the Sunne successively ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
unto every one.</p>
               <p>The second ground, although it depend upon the former, approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
nearer the effect; and that is the efficacie of the Sunne, set out
and divided according to priority of assent, whereby his in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>luence is
conceived more favourable unto one Country then another, and to
felicitate India more then any after. But hereby we cannot avoid ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
and such as infer effects controulable by our senses: For first,
by the same reason that we affirm the Indian richer then the American,
the American will also be more plentifull then the Indian, and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
or Spaine more fruitfull then Hispaniola or golden Castile; in as
much as the Sunne ariseth unto the one sooner then the other, and so
accountably unto any Nation subjected unto the same parallell, or with
a considerable diversity of longitude from each other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, an unsufferable absurdity will ensue; for thereby a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y
may be more fruitfull then it selfe: For India is more fertile then
Spaine, because more East, and that the Sunne ariseth first unto it;
Spaine likewise by the same reason more fruitfull then America, and
America then India; so that Spaine is lesse fruitfull then that Country,
which a lesse fertile Country then it selfe, excelleth.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if we conceive the Sunne hath any advantage by the priority
of its ascent, or makes thereby one Country more happy then another,
we introduce injustifiable acceptions; and impose a naturall partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
on that luminary, which being equidistant from the Earth,
and equally removed in the East as in the West, his power and
efficacie in both places must bee equall, as Boetius hath taken notice
in his first <hi>de Gemmis,</hi> and Scaliger hath graphically declared
in his Exercitations; some have therefore forsaken this refuge of
the Sunne, and to salve the effect have recurred unto the influence of
the starres, making their activities Nationall, and appropriating their
powers unto particular regions: So Cardan conceiveth the tayle of
Ursa major peculiarly respecteth Europe, whereas indeed once in 24
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50218:164"/>
houres it also absolveth its course over Asia and America: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it will not be easie to apprehend those stars peculiarly glance on
us, who must of necessity carry a common eye and regard unto all
Countries unto whom their revolution and verticity is also common.</p>
               <p>The effects therefore are different productions in severall Countries,
which we impute unto the action of the Sunne, must surely have nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
and more immediate causes then that Lumina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y; and these if wee
place in the propriety of the clime, or condition of soyle wherein they
are produced, we shall more reasonably proceed, then they who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
them unto the activity of the Sunne, whose revolution being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
it hath no power nor efficacie peculiar from its orientality,
but equally disperseth his beames unto all which equally and in
the same restriction receive his lustre; and being an universall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
agent, the effects or productions we behold, receive not their
circle from his causality, but are determined by the principles of the
place or qualities of that region which admits them: and this is evident
not onely in gemmes, mineralls, and metalls, but observable in pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts
and animalls, whereof some are common unto many Countries, some
peculiar unto one, some not communicable unto another: For the
hand of God that first created the earth, hath with variety disposed the
principles of all things, wisely contriving them in their proper semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
and where they best maintaine the intention of their species;
whereof if they have not a concurrence, and be not lodged in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
matrix, they are not excited by the efficacie of the Sunn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, or
fayling in particular causes receive a reliefe or sufficient promotion
from the universall. For although superiour powers cooperate with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
activities, and may (as some conceive) carry a stroake in the
plasticke and formative draught of all things, yet doe their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
belong unto particular agents, and are defined from their proper
principles. Thus the Sunne which with us is fruitfull in the generation
of frogs, toads, and serpents, to this effect proves impotent in our
neighbour Island; wherein as in all other carrying a common aspect, it
concurreth but unto predisposed effects, and onely suscitates those
formes, whose determinations are seminall, and proceed from the Idea
of themselves.</p>
               <p>Now wheras there be many observations concerning East, and divers
considerations of Art which seeme to extoll the quality of that point,
if rightly understood they doe not really promote it. That the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
takes account of nativities from the Ascendent, that is, the first
house of the heavens, whose beginning is toward the East, it doth not
advantage the conceit; for, he establisheth not his Judgement upon
the Orientality thereof, but considereth therein his first ascent above
the Horizon; at which time its efficacy becomes observable, and is
conceaved to have the signification of life, and to respect the condition
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50218:164"/>
of all things, which at the same time arise from their causes, and ascend
to their Horizon with it. Now this ascension indeed falls out respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
in the East; but as we have delivered before, in some positions
there is no Easterne point from whence to compute these ascensions.
So is it in a parallel spheare: for, unto them six houses are continually
depressed, and six never elevated; and the Planets themselves, whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
are of more speed, and influences of higher consideration,
must finde in that place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> very imperfect regard; for halfe their period
they absolve above, and halfe beneath the Horizon; and so for six
yeares, no man can have the happinesse to be borne under Jupiter, and
for fifteene together all must escape the ascendent dominion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>
               <p>That A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which is open towards the East, and admitteth the rayes of the rising

But that site is commended, in regard the damps and vaporous exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

his farme unto the equinoxiall ascent of the Sun; that Palladius
adviseth the front of his edifice should so respect the South, that in the
first angle it receave the rising rayes of the winter Sunne, and decline a
little from the winter setting thereof. And concordant hereunto is the
instruction of Columella in his Chapter <hi>Depositione villae,</hi> which hee
contriveth into Summer and Winter habitations; ordering that the
Winter lodgings regard the winter ascent of the Sun, that is, South-East;
and the roomes of repast at supper, the Aequinoxiall setting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that is, the West; that the Summer lodgings regard the Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiall
Meridian, but the roomes of caenation in the Summer, he obverts
unto the winter assent, that is, South-East; and the Balnearies or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
places, that they may remaine under the Sun untill evening, hee
exposeth unto the Summer setting, that is, North-West; in all which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Cardinall points be introduced, yet is the consideration
Solary, and onely determined unto the aspect or visible reception of
the Sun.</p>
               <p>That Mahumetans and Jews in these and our neighbour parts are
observed to use some gestures towards the East, as at their benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the killing of their meate it cannot be denied; and though many
ignorant spectators, and not a few of the actors conceave some Magick
or mysterie therein, yet is the Ceremony onely Topicall, and in a
memoriall relation unto a place they honour. So the Jews do carry a
respect and cast an eye upon Jerusalem; for which practise they are
not without the example of their forefathers, and the encouragement
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:50218:165"/>
of their wise King;<note place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> For so it is said that Daniel went into his house, and
his windowes being opened towards Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his
knees three times a day, and prayed; So is it expressed in the prayer of
Solomon, what prayer or supplication soever be made by any man,
which shall spread forth his hands towards this house, if thy people go
out to battaile, and shall pray unto the Lord towards the City which
thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have chosen to build
for thy Name, then heare thou in heaven their prayer, and their suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and maintaine their cause. Now the observation hereof, unto
the Jews that are dispersed Westward, and such as most converse with
us, directeth their regard unto the East; But the words of Solomon
are applyable unto all quarters of heaven, and by the Jews of the East
and South must be regarded in a contrary position. So Daniel in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
looking toward Jerusalem had his face toward the West; So the
Jews in their owne Land looked upon it from all quarters. For the
Tribe of Judah beheld it to the North; Manasses, Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>thali unto the South; Ruben and Gad unto the West; onely the Tribe
of Dan regarded it directly or to the due East: and so when it is said
Luke 12. when you see a cloud rise out of the West, you say there
commeth a showre, and so it is; the observation was respective unto
Judea; nor is this a reasonable illation in all other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> whatsoever;
For the Sea lay West unto that Country, and the winds brought raine
from that quarter; But this consideration cannot be transferred unto
India or China, which have a vast Sea Eastward, and a vaster Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
toward the West. So likewise when it is said by Job, in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Translation, Gold commeth out of the North; is this a reasonable
inducement unto us and many other Countries, from some p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cold and Northerne regions, which wee most plentifully discover in
hot and Southerne habitations?</p>
               <p>For the Mahometans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they partake with all Religions in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
so they imitate the Jew in this. For in their observed gestures,
they hold a regard unto Mecha and Medina Taln<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bi, two Cities in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia
faelix;</hi> where their Prophet was borne and buried; whither they
performe their pilgrimages; and from whence they expect he should
returne againe. And therefore they direct their faces unto these parts,
which unto the Mahometans of Barbary and Aegypt lye E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

in some point thereof, unto many other parts of Turkey: wherein not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
there is no Orientall respect; for wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h the same devotion
on the other side they regard these parts toward the West, and so with
variety wheresoever they are seated, conforming unto the ground of
their conception.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas in the ordering of the Campe of Israel, the East
quarter is appointed unto the noblest Tribe, that is the Tribe of Judah,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:50218:165"/>
according to the command of God, Numb. 2. In the East-side to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the rising of the Sunne, shall the Standard of the Tribe of Judah
pitch, it doth not peculiarly extoll that point; for herein the East is
not to bee taken strictly, but as it signifieth or implyeth the formost
place; for Judah had the Van, and many Countries through which
they passed were seated E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sterly unto them. Thus much is implyed by
the Originall, and expressed by Translations which strictly conforme
thereto: So Tremellius and Junius, <hi>Castra habentium ab anteriore parte
Orientem versus, vexillum esto castrorum Iudae;</hi> so hath R. Solomon Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi
expounded it, the foremost or before, is the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st quarter, and the
West is called behind: And upon this Interpretation may all be salved
that is alleageable against it. For if the Tribe of Judah were to pitch
before the Tabernacle at the East, and yet to march first, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Numb. 10. there must ensue a disorder in the Campe, nor
could they conveniently observe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xecution thereof: For when
they set out from Mount Sinah where the Command was delivered,
they made Northward unto Rithmah; from Rissah unto Ezionbeber
about fourteen stations they marched South: From Almon Diblathaim
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ough the mountaines of Yabarim and plaines of Moab towards
Jordan the face of their march was West: So that if Judah were
strictly to pitch in the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st of the Tabernacle, every night he encamped
in the Reare: And if (as some conceive) the whole Campe could not
be lesse then twelve miles long, it had been preposterous for him to
have marched foremost, or set out first, who was most remote from the
place to be approached.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that Learning, Civility and Arts, had their beginning in
the East, it is not imputable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ither to the action of the Sunne, or its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entality,
but of the first plantation of Man in those parts, which unto
Europe doe carry the respect of East; for on the mountaines of Ararat,
that is part of the hill Taurus, between the East-Indies and Scythia, as
Sir W. Ralegh accounts it, the Arke of Noah rested; from the East
they travelled that built the Tower of Babell, from thence they were
dispersed and successively enlarged, and learning good Arts and all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
communicated. The progression whereof was very sensible; and
if we consider the distance of time between the confusion of Babell,
and the civility of many parts now eminent therein, it travelled late
and slowly into our quarters; for notwithstanding the learning of
Bardes and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uides of elder times, he that shall peruse that worke of
Tacitus <hi>de moribus Germanorum,</hi> may easily discerne how little civility
two thousand years had wrought upon that Nation; the like he may
observe concerning our selves, from the same Author in the life of
Agricola, and more directly from Strabo; who to the dishonour of our
Predecessours, and the disparagement of those that glory in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of their Ancestors, affirmeth, the Britans were so simple, that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:50218:166"/>
though they abounded in Milke, they had not the Artifice of
Cheese.</p>
               <p>Lastly, that the Globe it selfe is by Cosmographers divided into
East and West, accounting from the first Meridian, it doth not establish
this conceit; for that division is not naturally founded, but artificially
set downe, and by agreement; as the aptest termes to define or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate
the longitude of places. Thus the ancient Cosmographers
doe place the division of the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st and Westerne Hemisphere, that is
the first terme of longitude in the Canary or fortunate Islands; concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
these parts the extreamest habitations Westward: But the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
have altered that terme and translated it unto the Azores or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaels
Islands, and that upon a plausible conceit of the small or insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
variation of the compasse in those parts; wherein neverthelesse,
and though upon second invention, they proceed upon a common and
no appropriate foundation; for even in that Meridian farther North or
South the compasse observably varieth; and there are also other places
wherein it varieth not, as Alphonso and Rodoriges <hi>de Lago</hi> will have
it about <hi>Capo de las Agullas</hi> in Africa; as Maurolycus affirmeth in the
shore of Peloponesus in Europe, and as Gilbertus averreth, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of great regions, in most parts of the earth.</p>

all Historians. Eratosthenes in his description of Aegypt hath likewise
passed them over: Aristotle is so indistinct in their names and numbers,
that in the first of Meteors, he plainly affirmeth the Region of Aegypt,
which we esteem the ancientest Nation in the World, was a meere
gained ground; and that by the setling of mud and limous matter
brought downe by the River Nilus, that which was at first a continued
Sea, was raysed at last into a firme and habitable Country. The like

               </p>
               <p>Moderne Geographers and travellers do much abate of this number;
for as Maginus and others observe, there are now but three or foure
mouths thereof, as Gulielmus Tyrius long agoe, and Bellonius since,
both ocular enquirers, with others have attested. For below Cairo,
the River devides it selfe into foure branches, whereof two make the
chiefe and navigable streames, the one running to Pelusium of the
Ancients, and now <hi>Damiats;</hi> the other unto <hi>Canopium</hi> and now <hi>Roscet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the other two, saith Mr. Sandys, doe runne betweene these, but
poore in water; of those seven mentioned by Herodotus, and those
nine by Ptolomy, these are all I could either see, or heare of.</p>
               <p>Lastly, what ever was or is their number, the contrivers of Cards
and Maps, afford us no assurance or constant description therein. For
whereas Ptolomy hath set forth nine, Hondius in his Map of Africa,
makes but eight, and in that of Europe ten. Ortelius in his <hi>Theatrum
Botannicum,</hi> in the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus may we perceave that this account was differently related
by the Ancients, that it is undeniably rejected by the Modernes, and
must be warily received by any. For if wee receave them all into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

credit the descriptions of good Authors, other Rivers excell it in

the first place unto the River Ganges, which truly according
unto later relations, if not in length, yet in breadth and debth may bee
granted to excell it: For the magnitude of Nilus consisteth in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mension

it maintaineth beyond Syene or Asna, and so forward unto its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,

of forty Leagues, and with that source and plenty that men at Sea doe
taste fresh water, before they approach so neere as to discover the land:
So is it exceeded by that which by Cardan is termed the greatest in the
world, that is the River Oregliana in the same Continent, which as
Maginus delivereth, hath beene navigated 6000. miles, and opens in a
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50218:167"/>
Channell of ninety leagues broad; so that, as Acosta an ocular wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
recordeth, they that sayle in the middle, can make no land of
either side.</p>
               <p>Now the ground of this assertion was surely the magnifying esteem
of the Ancients, arising from the indiscovery of its head. For as things
unknowne seeme greater then they are, and are usually receaved with
amplifications above their nature; So might it also be with this River,
whose head being unknowne and drawne to a proverbiall obscurity,
the opinion thereof became without bounds, and men must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat
a large extent of that to which the discovery of no man had set a
period. And this an usuall way to give the superlative unto things of
eminency in any kinde: and when a thing is very great, presently to
define it to be the greatest of all; whereas indeed Superlatives are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
whereof there being but one in every kinde, their determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are dangerous, and must not be made without great circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So the City of Rome is magnified by the Lati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to be the greatest
of the earth; but time and Geography enforme us, that Cairo is bigger
then ever it was, and Quinsay in China farre exceedeth both. So is
Olympus extolled by the Greeks, as an hill attaining unto heaven; but
the enlarged Geography of after times makes slight account hereof,
when they discourse of Andes in Peru, or Teneriffa in the Canaries.
So have all Ages conceaved, and most are still ready to sweare, the
Wren is the least of birds, yet the discoveries of America, and even of
our owne Plantations have shewed us one farre lesse, that is, the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird,
not much exceeding a Beetle. And truly, for the least and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
the highest and the lowest of every kinde, as it is very difficult to
define them in visible things, so is it to understand in things invisible.
Thus is it no easie lesson to comprehend the first matter, and the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of that which is next neighbour unto nothing; and impossible
truly to comprehend God, who indeed is all things; and so things as
they arise unto perfection, and approach unto God, or descend to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
and draw neerer unto nothing, fall both imperfectly into
our apprehensions; the one being too weake for our conception, our
conception too weake for the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, divers conceptions there are concerning its increment or
inundation. The first unwarily opinions, that this encrease or annuall
overflowing is proper unto Nile, and not agreeable unto any other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
which notwithstanding is common unto many currents of Africa.
For about the same time the River Niger, and Zaire do ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>flow, and
so do the Rivers beyond the mountaines of the Moone, as Suama, and
Spirito Santo: and not onely these in Africa, but some also in Europe
and Asia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for so it is reported of Menan in India, and so doth Botero
report of Duina in Livonia, and the same is also observable in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Jordan in Judea; for so is it delivered Josuah 3. that Jordan over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floweth
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50218:168"/>
all his banks in the time of harvest.</p>
               <p>The effect indeed is wonderfull in all, and the causes surely best
resolvable from observations made in the Countries themselves, the
parts through which they passe, or whence they take their originall;
That of Nilus hath beene attempted by many, and by some to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire
of resolution, that they have only referred it unto the providence
of God, and the secret manuduction of all things unto their ends; but
divers have attained the truth, and the cause alledged by Diodorus,
Seneca, Strabo and others is allowable; that the inundation of Nilus
in Aegypt proceeded from the raines in Aethiopia, and the mighty
source of waters falling towards the fountaines thereof. For, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
unto the Aegyptians happeneth when it is winter unto the
Aethiopians; which habitations, although they have no cold winter,
the Sun being no farther removed from them in Cancer, then unto us
in Taurus; yet is the fervour of the ayre so well remit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, as it admits
a sufficient generation of vapours, and plenty of showres ensuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
This theory of the Ancients is since confirmed by experience
of the Modernes, as namely by Franciscus Alvarez who lived long in
those parts, and hath left a description of Aethiopia; affirming that
from the middle of June unto September, there fell in his time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
raines. As also Antonius Ferdinandus, who in an Epistle written
from thence, and noted by Condignus, affirmeth that during the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in those Countries there passed no day without raine.</p>
               <p>Now this is also an usuall course to translate a remarkable quality in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a propriety, and where we admire an effect in one, to opinion there
is not the like in any other, with these conceits do common apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
entertaine the antidotall and wondrous condition of Ireland;
conceaving in that Land onely an immunity from venemous creatures;
but unto him that shall further enquire, the same will be affirmed of
Creta<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> memorable in ancient stories, even unto fabulous causes and
benediction from the birth of Jupiter: The same is also found in Ebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
or Evisa, an Island neere Majorca upon the coast of Spaine. With
these opinions do the eyes of neighbour spectators behold Aetna, the
flaming mountaine in Sicilia; But Navigators tell us there is a burning
mountaine in Island, a more rema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
and many vulcano's or fiery hils elsewhere. Thus Crocodiles
were thought to be peculiar unto Nile, and the opinion so possessed
Alexander, that when he had discovered some in Ganges, he fell upon
conceit he had found the head of Nilus; but later discoveries affirme
they are not onely in Asia and Africa, but very frequent in some Rivers
of America.</p>
               <p>Another opinion confineth its inundation, and positively affirmeth,
it constantly encreaseth the seventeenth day of June, wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

latitude. So when Hippocrates saith, <hi>Sub Cane &amp; ante Canem
difficiles sunt purgationes;</hi> there is a latitude of dayes comprised therein,
for under the Dogstar he containeth not onely the day of its ascent, but
many following, and some ten dayes preceding: So Aristotle delivers
the affections of animalls, with the wary termes of <hi>Circa &amp; magna ex

the latitude of divers dayes: For affirming it happeneth before
the Nones, he alloweth but one day, that is the Calends, for in the
Romane account the second day is the fourth of the Nones of June.</p>
               <p>Againe, were the day definitive it had prevented the delusion of the
Devill, nor could he have gained applause by its prediction; who (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
as Athanasius in the life of Anthony relateth) to magnifie
his knowledge in things to come, when he perceived the rains to fall in
Aethiopia, would presage unto the Aegyptians the day of its inundation.
And this would also make uselesse that naturall experiment observed
in earth or sand about the River, by the weight whereof (as good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
report) they have unto this day, a knowledge of its encrease.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it is not reasonable from variable and unstable causes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
a fixed and constant effect, and such are the causes of this Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
which cannot indeed be regular, and therefore their effects not
prognosticable like Ecclipses; for depending upon the clouds and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of showres in Aethiopia, which have their generation from vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
exhalations, they must submit their existence unto contingencies,
and endure anticipation and recession from the moveable condition of
their causes. And therefore some yeares there hath been no encrease
at all, as Seneca and divers relate of the eleventh yeare of Cleopatra,
nor nine yeares together, as is testified by Calisthenes. Some yeares it
hath also retarded, and came far later then usually it was expected, as
according to Sozomen and Nicephorus it happened in the dayes of
Theodosius; whereat the people were ready to mutiny, because they
might not sacrifice unto the River according to the custome of their
Predecessors.</p>
               <p>Now this is also an usuall way of mistake, and many are deceived
who too strictly construe the temporall considerations of things. Thus
bookes will tell us, and we are made to beleeve that the fourteenth
yeare males are seminificall and pubescent; but he that shall enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the generality, will rather adhere unto the cautelous assertion of
Aristotle, that is <hi>bis septem annis exactis,</hi> and then but <hi>magna ex parte.</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:50218:169"/>
That Whelps are blinde nine dayes, and then begin to see is generally
beleeved; but as we have elsewhere declared, it is exceeding rare, nor
doe their eye-lids usually open untill the twelfth, and sometimes not
before the fourteenth day. And to speake strictly an hazardable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
it is unto fluctuating and indifferent effects, to affixe a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
type or period; for in effects of far more regular causalities diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
doe often arise, and even in time it selfe which measureth all
things, we use allowance in its commensuration. Thus while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
we have the account of a year in 365 dayes, exact enquirers and
computists will tell us, that we escape 6 houres, that is a quarter of a
day; and so in a day which every one accounts 24 houres, or one revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the Sunne; in strict account we must allow the addition of
such a part as the Sunne doth make in his proper motion, from West to
East, whereby in one day he describeth not a perfect circle.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is affirmed by many, and received by most, that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
raineth in Aegypt, the River supplying that defect, and bountifully
requiting it in its Inundation: but this must also be received in a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
sense, that is, that it raines but seldome at any time in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and very rarely in the Winter. But that great showres do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fall upon that Region, beside the assertion of many Writers, we
can confirme from honourable and ocular testimony,<note place="margin">Sir Wiliam Paston.</note> and that not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares past, it rayned in Grand Cairo 8 or 9 dayes together. Beside
men hereby forget the relation of holy Scripture, as is delivered Ex. 9.
Behold I will cause it to raine a very grievous haile, such as hath not
been in Aegypt since the foundation thereof even untill now: wherein
God threatning such a raine as had not happened, it must be presumed
they had been acquainted with some before; and were not ignorant of
the substance, the menace being made in the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Now this mistake ariseth from a misapplication of the bounds or
limits of time, and an undue transition from one unto another; which
to avoid we must observe the punctuall differences of time, and so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
distinguish thereof, as not to confound or lose the one in the
other. For things may come to passe, <hi>Semper, Plerum<expan>

Sometimes, Oftimes or Seldome: Now the deception is usuall which
is made by the misapplication of these; men presently concluding that
to happen often, which happeneth but sometimes; that never, which
happeneth but seldome; and that alway which happeneth for the most
part: So is it said, the Sunne shines every day in Rhodes, because for
the most part, it faileth not: So we say and believe that a Camelion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

very seldome, but many there are who have beheld it to feed on flyes.
And so it is said, that children borne in the eighth moneth live not; that
is, for the most part, but not to be concluded alwayes; nor it seems in

read that from the River Indus he came unto Alexander at Babylon,
some few dayes before his death. Now Babylon was seated upon the
River Euphrates, which runnes into the Persian Gulph; and therefore
however the Latine expresseth it in Strabo, that Nearchus suffered

That therefore the Red Sea or Arabian Gulph received its name
from personall derivation is but uncertaine, that both the Seas of one
name should have one common denominator lesse probable; that
one from name, another from colour not incredible; that there is a
grosse and materiall rednesse in either not to be affirmed, that there is
an emphaticall or apparent rednesse in one, not well to be denyed; and
this is sufficient to make good the Allegory of the Christians; and in

               <p>IT is evident not only in the generall frame of Nature, that things
most manifest unto sense, have proved obscure unto the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
But even in proper and appropriate objects, wherein
we affirme the sense cannot erre, the faculties of reason most often fail
u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Thus of colours in generall, under whose glosse and vernish all
things are seen, no man hath yet beheld the true nature, or positively
set downe their incontroulable causes; which while some ascribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the mixture of the Elements, others to the graduality of opacity and
light; they have left our endeavours to grope them out by twilight,
and by darknesse almost to discover that whose existence is evidenced
by light. The Chymists have attempted laudably, reducing their
causes u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to Sal, Sulphur, and Mercury; and had they made it out so
well in this, as in the objects of smell and taste, their endeavours had
been more acceptable: For whereas they refer Sapor unto Salt, and
Odor unto Sulphur, they vary much concerning colour; some reducing
it unto Mercury, some to Sulphur, others unto Salt; wherein indeed
the last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it doth not oppresse the former, and Salt may carry a
strong concurrence therein. For beside the fixed and terrestrious Salt,
there is in naturall bodies a <hi>Sal niter</hi> referring unto Sulphur; there is
also a volatile or Armoniac Salt, retaining unto Mercury; by which
Salts the colours of bodies are sensibly qualified, and receive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of lustre or obscurity, superficiality or profundity, fixation or
volatility.</p>
               <p>Their generall or first natures being thus obscure, there will be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
difficulties in their particular discoveries; for being farther removed
from their simplicities they fall into more complexed considerations,
and so require a subtiler act of reason to distinguish and call forth their
natures. Thus although a man understood the generall nature of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loures,

Writers, particularly by Ortelius, but amply and satisfactorily
discussed as we know by no man; we shall therefore endeavour a full

the security of this assertion.</p>
               <p>And first, many which countenance the opinion in this reason, doe
tacitly and upon consequence overthrow it in another: For whilst they
make the River Senaga to divide and bound the Moores, so that on the
South-side they are blacke, on the other onely tawnie; they imply a
secret causality herein from the ayre, place or River, and seem not to
derive it from the Sunne; the effects of whose activity are not precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously
abrupted, but gradually proceed to their cessations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we affirme that this effect proceeded, or as we will not
be backward to concede, it may be advanced and fomented from the

and perpendicular rayes of the Sunne, doe yet make good the
complexion of their species, and hold a colourable correspondence
unto those in milder regions. Now did this complexion proceed from
heat in man, the same would be communicated unto other animalls
which equally participate the Influence of the common Agent: For
thus it is in the effects of cold in Regions far removed from the Sunne;
for therein men are not only of faire complexions, gray eyed, and of
light haire, but many creatures exposed to the ayre, deflect in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
from their naturall colours, from browne, russet and blacke, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the complexion of Winter, and turning perfect white; for thus
Olaus Magnus relates, that after the Autumnall Aequinox, Foxes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to grow white; thus Michovius reporteth, and we want not ocular
confirmation, that Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thus a white Crow, a Proverbiall rarity with us, is none unto them;
but that ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, if the fervor of the Sunne, or intemperate heat of clime
did solely occasion this complexion, surely a migration or change
thereof might cause a sensible, if not a totall mutation; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
experience will not admit: For Negroes tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and also their generations; except they mixe with different

of their originalls; and if they preserve their copulations entire they still
maintaine their complexions, as is very remarkable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which transplanted about an hundred years past, continue the tinctures
of their fathers unto this day: and so likewise faire or white people
translated into hotter Countries receive not impressions amounting to
this complexion, as hath been observed in many Europeans who have
lived in the land of Negroes: and as <hi>Edvardus Lopes</hi> testifieth of the
Spanish plantations, that they retained their native complexions unto
his dayes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if the fervor of the Sunne were the sole cause hereof in
Aethiopia or any land of Negroes, it were also reasonable that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the same latitude subjected unto the same vicinity of the
Sunne, the same diurnall arch, and direction of its rayes, should also
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:50218:172"/>
partake of the same hue and complexion, which notwithstanding they
do not; For the Inhabitants of the same latitude in Asia are of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
complexion, as are the Inhabitants of Cambogia and Java; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that some conceave the Negroe is properly a native of Africa,
and that those places in Asia inhabited now by Moores, are but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>rusions
of Negroes ariving first from Africa, as we generally conceave
of Madagascar, and the adjoyning Islands, who retaine the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
unto this day. But this defect is more remarkable in America,
which although subjected unto both the Tropicks, yet are not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants

Southward in Brasilia, Chili, or Peru, nor yet to the Northward in

natives of America.</p>
               <p>Fifthly; we cannot conclude this complexion in Nations from the
vicinity or habitude they hold unto the Sun, for even in Africa they be
Negroes under the Southerne Tropick, but ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not all of this hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> either
under or neere the Northerne. So the people of Gualata, Aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramantes,
and of Goaga, all within the Northerne Tropicks are not
Negroes, but on the other side about Capo Negro, Cefala, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagascar,
they are of a Jetty black.</p>
               <p>Now if to salve this Anomaly wee say the heate of the Sun is more
powerfull in the Southerne Tropick, because in the signe of Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne
falls out the Perigeum or lowest place of the Sun in his Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,
whereby he becomes neerer unto them then unto the other in
Cancer, wee shall not absolve the doubt. And if any insist upon such
nicities, and will presume a different effect of the Sun, from such a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of place or vicinity, we shall ballance the same with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
of its motion, and time of revolution; and say he is more
powerfull in the Northerne hemisphere, and in the Apoge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>; for
therein his motion is slower, and so his heate respectively unto those
habitations, as of duration so also of more effect. For, though he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
his revolution in 365. dayes, odde howres and minutes, yet by
reason of his Excentricity, his motion is unequall, and his course farre
longer in the Northerne semicircle, then in the Southerne; for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he passeth in 178. dayes, but the other takes him 187. that is, eleven
dayes more; so is his presence more continued unto the Northerne
Inhabitant, and the longest day in Cancer is longer unto us, then that
in Capricorne unto the Southerne habitator. Beside, hereby we onely
inferre an inequality of heate in different Tropicks, but not an equality
of effects in other parts subjected to the same; For, in the same degree,
and as neere the earth he makes his revolution unto the American,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:50218:173"/>
whose Inhabitants notwithstanding partake not of the same effect.
And if herein we seek a reliefe from the Dogstarre, we shall introduce
an effect proper unto a few, from a cause common unto many, for upon
the same grounds that Starre should have as forcible a power upon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica
and Asia, and although it be not verticall unto any part of Asia,
but onely passeth by Beach, <hi>in terra incognita;</hi> yet is it so unto Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
and vertically passeth over the habitations of Peru and Brasilia.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, and which is very considerable, there are Negroes in Africa
beyond the Southerne Tropick, and some so far removed from it, as
Geographically the clime is not intemperate, that is, neere the cape of
good Hope, in 36. of Southerne Latitude. Whereas in the same
elevation Northward, the Inhabitants of America are faire, and they
of Europe in Candy, Sicily, and some parts of Spaine deserve not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rly
so low a name as Tawny.</p>
               <p>Lastly, whereas the Africans are conceaved to be more p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>culiarly
scorched and torrified from the Sun, by addition of drinesse from the
soyle, from want and defect of water, it will not excuse the doubt.
For the parts which the Negroes possesse, are not so void of Rivers and
moisture, as is herein presumed; for on the other side the mountaines
of the Moone, in that great tract called Zanzibar, there are the mighty
Rivers of Suama, and <hi>Spirito Santo;</hi> on this side, the great River Zaire,
the mighty Nile and Niger, which doe not onely moysten, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate

earth by their annuall inundations. Beside, in that part of Africa, which
with all disadvantage is most dry, that is, in site betweene the Tropicks,
defect of Rivers and inundations, as also abundance of sands, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are not esteemed Negroes; and that is Lybia, which with the
Greeks carries the name of all Africa; A region so des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rt, dry and
sandy, that travellers (as Leo reports) are faine to carry water on their
Camels, whereof they finde not a drop sometime in 6. or 7. dayes; yet
is this Countrey accounted by Geographers no part of <hi>terra Nigrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now the ground of this opinion might bee the visible quality of
Blacknesse observably produced by heate, fire, and smoake; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
with the Ancients the violent esteeme they held of the heate of
the Sun, in the hot or torrid Zone; conceaving that part unhabitable,
and therefore that people in the vicinities or frontiers thereof, could
not escape without this change of their complexions. But how farre
they were mistaken in this apprehension, moderne Geography hath
discovered: And as wee have declared, there are many within this
Zone whose complexions descend not so low as blacknesse. And if we
should strictly insist hereon, the possibility might fall into some que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
that is, whether the heate of the Sun, whose fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus having evinced at least made dubious, the Sunne is not the
Author of this blacknesse, how and when this tincture fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st began i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet a Riddle, and positively to determine it surpasseth my presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Seeing therefore we cannot certainly discover what did effect it,
it may afford some piece of satisfaction to know what might procure
it: It may be therefore considered, whether the inward use of certaine
waters or fountaines of peculiar operations, might not at first produce
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffect in question. For, of the like we have records in story related
by Aristotle, Strabo, and Pliny, who hath made a collection hereof,
as of two fountaines in Baeotia, the one making Sheepe white, the other
black, of the water of Siberis which made Oxen black, and the like
effect i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> had also upon men, dying not onely the skin, but making their
haires black and curled. This was the conceit of Aristobulus, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved
so little satisfaction from the other, or that it might be caused
by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eate, or any kinde of fire, that he conceaved it as reasonable to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the effect unto water.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be perpended whether it might not fall out the
same way that Jacobs cattell became speckled, spotted and ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straked,
that is, by the power and efficacy of Imagination; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
effects in the conception correspondent unto the phancy of the
Agents ingeneration, and sometimes assimilates the Idea of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
into a realty in the thing ingendred. For, hereof there passe for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
many indisputed examples; so in Hippocrates wee reade of one,
that from the view and intention of a picture conceaved a Negroe; And
in the history of Heliodore of a Moorish Queene, who upon aspection
of the picture of Andromeda, conceaved and brought forth a faire
one. And thus perhaps might some say it was at the beginning of this
complexion, induced first by Imagination, which having once impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
the seed, found afterward concurrent productions, which were
continued by Climes, whose constitution advantaged the first impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Thus Plotinus conceaveth white Peacocks first came in: Thus as
Aldrovand relateth, many opinion that from aspection of the
Snow which lyeth long in Northerne Regions, and high mountaines,
Hawkes, Kites, Beares, and other creatures become white; And by
this way Austin conceaveth the Devill provided, they never wanted a
white spotted Oxe in Aegypt, for such an one they worshipped, and
called it Apis.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is not indisputable whether it might not proceed from
such a cause and the like foundation of Tincture, as doth the black
Jaundise, which meeting with congenerous causes might settle durable
inquinations, and advance their generations unto that hue, which was
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:50218:174"/>
naturally before but a degree or two below it: And this transmission

               <p>However therefore this complexion was first acquired, it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maintained by generation, and by the tincture of the skin as a sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
part traduced from father unto son, so that they which are
strangers contract it not, and the Natives which transmigrate omit it
not without commixture, and that after divers generations. And this
affection (if the story were true) might wonderfully be confirmed, by
what Maginus and others relate of the Emperour of Aethiopia, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
John, who derived from Solomon is not yet descended into the
hue of his Countrey, but remaines a Mulatto, that is, of a mongrill
complexion unto this day. Now although we conceive this blacknesse
to be seminall, yet are we not of Herodotus conceit, that is, that their
seed is black; an opinion long agoe rejected by Aristotle, and since by
sence and enquiry; his assertion against the Historian was probable,
that all seed was white; that is, without great controversie in viviparous
Animals, and such as have Testicles, or preparing vessels wherein it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
a manifest dealbation: And not onely in them, but (for ought I
know) in Fishes, not abating the seed of Plants, whereof though the
skin and covering be black, yet is the seed and fructifying part not so:
as may be observed in the seeds of Onyons, Pyonie, and Basill: most
controvertible it seemes, in the spawne of Frogs, and Lobsters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
notwithstanding at the very first the spawne is white, contracting by
degrees a blacknesse, answerable in the one unto the colour of the shell,
in the other unto the porwigle or Tadpole, that is, that animall which
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:50218:175"/>
first proceedeth from it: And thus may it also be in the generation and
sperme of Negroes; that being first and in its naturals white, but upon

               <p>A Second opinion there is, that this complexion was first a curse of
God derived unto them from Cham, upon whom it was was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for discovering the nakednesse of Noah. Which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is sooner affirmed then proved, and carrieth with it sundry impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities.
For first, if we derive the curse on Cham, or in generall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his posterity, we shall Benegroe a greater part of the earth then ever
was, or so conceived; and not onely paint the Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hiopians, and reputed
sons of Cush, but the people also of Aegypt, Arabia, Assyria, and
Chaldea; for by his race were these Countries also peopled. And if
concordantly unto Berosus, the fragment of <hi>Cato de Originibus,</hi> some
things of Halicarnasseus, Macrobius, and out of them of Leandro and
Annius, wee shall conceive of the travailes of Camese or Cham, wee
may introduce a generation of Negroes as high as Italy, which part
was never culpable of deformity, but hath produced the magnified ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of beauty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the curse mentioned in Scripture was not denounced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Cham, but Canaan his youngest son, and the reasons thereof are
divers; the first, from the Jewish Tradition, whereby it is conceived,
that Canaan made the discovery of the nakednesse of Noah, and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
it unto Cham. Secondly, to have cursed Cham had been to cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se
all his posterity, whereof but one was guilty of the fact. And lastly,
he spared Cham, because he had blessed him before, cap. 9. Now if
we confine this curse unto Canaan, and thinke the same fulfilled in his
posterity, then do we induce this complexion on the Sidonians, then
was the promised land a tract of Negroes; For from Canaan were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
the Canaanites, Jebusites, Amorites, Gergezites, and Hevites,
which were possessed of that Land.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, although we should place the originall of this curse upon
one of the sons of Cham, yet were it not knowne from which of them
to derive it. For the particularity of their discents is imperfectly set
downe by accountants, nor is it distinctly determinable from whom
thereof the Aethiopians are proceeded. For, whereas these of Africa
are generally esteemed to be the Issue of Chus, the elder son of Cham,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:50218:175"/>
it is not so easily made out. For the land of Chus, which the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint
translates Aethiopia, makes no part of Africa, nor is it the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Blackmo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, but the countrie of Arabia, especially the Happy,
and stony; possessions and Colonies of all the sons of Chus, excepting
Nimrod, and Havila<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, possessed and planted wholly by the children of
Chus, that is, by Sabtah and Raamah, Sabtacha, and the sons of Raa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,
Dedan and Sheba, according unto whose names the Nations of
those parts have received their denominations, as may bee collected
from Pliny and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olomy; and as wee are informed by credible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
they hold a faire Analogie in their names, even unto our dayes.
So the wife of Moses translated in Scripture an Aethiopian, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the fabulous relation of Josephus, was none of the daughters
of Africa, nor any Negroe of Aethiopia, but the daughter of J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thro,
Prince and Priest of Madian, which was a part of Arabia the stony,
bordering upon the Red Sea. So the Queene of Sheba came not unto
Solomon out of Aethiopia, but from Arabia, and that part thereof
which bore the name of the first planter thereof, the son of Chus. So
whether the Eunuch which Philip the Deacon baptised, were servant
unto Candac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Queene of the African Aethiopia, (although Damianus
<hi>à</hi> Goes, Codignus, and the Aethiopick relations averre) is yet by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and with strong suspicions doubted. So that Army of a million,
which Zerah King of Aethiopia is said to bring against Asa, was drawn
out of Arabia, and the plantations of Chus, not out of Aethiopia, and
the remote habitations of the Moores; For it is said that Asa pursuing
his victory, tooke from him the city Gerar; now Gerar was no city in
or neere Aethiopia, but a place betweene Cadesh and Zur, where Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
formerly sojourned. Since therefore these African Aethiopians,
are not convinced by the common acception to be the sons of Chus,
whether they be not the posterity of Phut, or Mizraim, or both, it is
not assuredly determined; For Mizraim, he possessed Aegypt, and the
East parts of Africa: From Ludym his son came the Lybians, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
from them the Aethiopians: Phut possessed Mauritania, and the
Westerne parts of Africa, &amp; from these perhaps descended the Moors
of the West, of Mandinga, Meleguette and Guinie. But from Canaan,
upon whom the curse was pronounced, none of these had th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
for he was restrained unto Canaan and Syria; although in after
Ages many Colonies dispersed, and some thereof upon the coasts of
Africa, and the prepossessions of his elder brothers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to take away all doubt or any probable divarication, the
curse is plainely specified in the Text, nor need we dispute it, like the
marke of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in; <hi>Servus servorum erit fratribus suis,</hi> Cursed be Canaan,
a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren; which was after ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in the conquest of Canaan, subdued by the Israelites, the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Sem; which Prophecy Abraham well understanding, tooke an
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:50218:176"/>
oath of his servant not to take a wife for his Son Isaac out of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Canaanites; And the like was performed by Isaac in the
behalfe of his son Jacob. As for Cham and his other sons this curse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
them not, for Nimrod the son of Chus set up his kingdome in
Babylon, and erected the first great Empire, Mizraim and his posterity
grew mighty Monarches in Aegypt; and the Empire of the Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
hath beene as large as either.</p>
               <p>Lastly, whereas men affirme this colour was a Curse, I cannot
make out the propriety of that name, it neither seeming so to them, nor
reasonably unto us; for they take so much content therein, that they
esteeme deformity by other colours, describing the Devill, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
objects White. And if wee seriously consult the definitions of
beauty, and exactly perpend what wise men determine thereof, wee
shall not reasonably apprehend a curse, or any deformity therein. For
first, some place the essence thereof in the proportion of parts, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it to consist in a comely commensurability of the whole unto the
pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts, and the parts betweene themselves, which is the determination
of the best and learned Writers: and whereby the Moores are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from beauty; there being in this description no consideration
of colours, but an apt connexion and frame of parts and the whole.
Others there be, and those most in number, which place it not onely in
proportion of parts, but also in grace of colour; But to make Colour
essentiall unto Beauty, there will arise no slender difficulty; For, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
in two definitions of pulchritude, and Galen in one, have made
no mention of colour: Neither will it agree unto the Beauty of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
wherein notwithstanding there is an approved pulchritude. Thus
horses are handsome under any colour, and the symmetry of parts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scures
the consideration of complexions; Thus in concolour animals
and such as are confined unto one colour wee measure not their Beauty
thereby; for if a Crow or Black<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bird grow white, wee generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
it more pretty, And even in monstrosity descend not to opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of deformity. And by this way likewise the Moores escape the
curse of deformity, there concurring no stationary colour, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
not any unto Beauty.</p>
               <p>The Platonick contemplators reject both these descriptions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ounded
upon parts and colours, or either, as M. Leo the Jew hath excellently
discoursed in his Genealogy of Love, defining Beauty a formall grace,
which delights and moves them to love which comprehend it. This
grace say they, discoverable outwardly, is the resplendor and Raye of
some interiour and invisible Beauty, and proceedeth from the formes
of compositions amiable; whose faculties if they can aptly contrive
their matter, they beget in the subject an agreeable and pleasing beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if over ruled thereby, they evidence not their perfections, but runne
into deformity. For seeing that out of the same materials, Thersites
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:50218:176"/>
and Paris Beauty and monstrosity may be contrived, the formes and
operative faculties introduce and determine their perfections; which in
naturall bodies receive exactnesse in every kinde, according to the first
Idea of the Creator, and in contrived bodies the phancie of the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer:
And by this consideration of Beauty, the Moores also are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
but hold a common share therein with all mankinde.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in whatsoever its Theory consisteth, or if in the generall, we
allow the common conceit of symmetry and of colour, yet to descend
unto singularities, or determine in what symmetry or colour it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
were very dangerous; for beauty is determined by opinion, and
seems to have no essence that holds one notion unto all; that seeming
beauteous unto one, which hath no favour with another, and that unto
every one, according as custome hath made it naturall, or sympathy
and conformity of minds shall make it seem agreeable. Thus flat noses
seem comly unto the Moore, an Aquiline or hawked one unto the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,
a large and prominent nose unto the Romane, but none of all these
are acceptable in our opinion. Thus some thinke it most ornamentall
to weare their Bracelets on their wrests, others say it is better to have
them about their Ancles; some thinke it most comely to weare their
Rings and Jewells in the Eare, others will have them about their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
a third will not thinke they are compleat except they hang them
in their lips, cheeks or noses. Thus Homer to set off Minerva calleth her
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is gray or light blew eyed: now this unto us seems farre
lesse amiable then the black. Thus we that are of contrary complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
accuse the blacknes of the Mores as ugly: But the Spouse in the
Canticles excuseth this conceit, in that description of he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, I am black,
but comely: And howsoever Cerberus, and the furies of hell be descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by the Poets under this complexion, yet in the Beauty of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
blacknesse is commended, when it is said his locks are bushie and
blacke as a Raven. So that to inferre this as a curse, or to reason it as a
deformity, is no way reasonable; the two foundations of beauty Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y
and Complexion, receiving such various apprehensions, that
no deviation will bee expounded so high as a curse or undeniable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
without a manifest and confessed degree of monstrosity.</p>
               <p>Lastly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is a very injurious method unto Philosophy, and a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
promotion unto Ignorance, in points of obscurity, nor open unto
easie considerations, to fall upon a present refuge unto Miracles, or
recurre unto immediate contrivance from the insearchable hands of
God. Thus in the conceit of the evill odor of the Jewes, Christians
without a farther research into the verity of the thing, or enquiry into
the cause, drawe up a judgement upon them, from the passion of their
Saviour. Thus in the wondrous effects of the clime of Ireland, and the
freedome from all venomous creatures, the credulity of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
imputes this immunity unto the benediction of St. Patrick, as Beda
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:50218:177"/>
and Gyraldus have left recorded. Thus the Asse having a peculiar
marke of a crosse made by a blacke list downe his backe, and another
athwart, or at right angles downe his shoulders; common opinion as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
this figure unto a peculiar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

honour to beare our Saviour upon his backe. Certainly this is a
course more desperate then Antipathies, Sympathies or occult quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
wherein by a finall and satisfactive discernment of faith, we lay
the last and particular effects upon the first and generall cause of all
things, whereas in the other wee doe but palliate our determinations,

affirmeth that Charcoales, made out of the wood of Oxycedar

not blacke linnen being hanged in the smoake thereof, but rather whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it, by reason of the drying and penetrating quality of sulphur, which
will make red Roses white: And therefore to conceive a generall

austere and inconcocted roughnesse, as Sloes, Medlers and Quinces:
And that not onely vitriol is a cause of blacknesse, but that the salts of
naturall bodies doe carry a powerfull stroake in the tincture and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
of all things, we shall not deny, if we contradict not experience,
and the visible art of Dyars, who advance and graduate their colours
with Salts, for the decoctions of simples which beare the visible co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of bodies decocted, are dead and evanid without the commixtion
of Alume, Argol, and the like; and this is also apparent in Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
preparations. So Cinaber becomes red by the acide exhalation
of sulphur, which otherwise presents a pure and niveous white. So
spirits of Salt upon a blew paper make an orient red. So Tartar or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
upon an infusion of violets affords a delightfull crimson. Thus it
is wonderfull what variety of colours the spirits of Saltpeter, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
if they be kept in a glasse while they pierce the sides thereof; I
say, what Orient greens they will project: from the like spirits in the

Apple, is commonly beleeved, confirmed

fruit was the first occasion of evill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

reviving the conceit of Barcephas, peremptorily concludeth it to
be the Indian Fig-tree, and by a witty Allegory labours to confirme
the same. Some fruits we observe to passe under the name of Adams

fruit of that plant Serapion termeth <hi>Musa,</hi> but the Easterne Christians
commonly the Apples of Paradise; not resembling an apple in figure,
and in taste a Melon or Cowcumber; which fruits although they have
received appellations suitable unto the Tradition, yet can we not from
thence inferre they were this fruit in question; no more then <hi>Arbor

that it was the fruit of a tree good for food and pleasant unto
the eye, in which regards many excell the Apple; and therefore learned
men doe wisely conceive it inexplicable, and Philo puts determination
unto despaire, when hee affirmeth the same kinde of fruit was never
produced since. Surely, were it not requisite or reasonable to have
been concealed, it had not passed unspecified, nor the tree revealed
which concealed their nakednesse, and that concealed which revealed
it; for in the same Chapter mention is made of Fig-leaves, and the
like particulars although they seem uncircumstantiall are oft set downe
in holy Scripture; so is it specified that Elias sate under a Junip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it a sufficient resolution to reinquire upon what leg King Philip halted;
and the Jews not undoubtedly resolved of the Sciatica side of Jacob,
do cautelously in their diet abstaine from the sinewes of both; yet are
there many nice particulars which may bee authentically determined.
That Peter cut off the right eare of Malchus is beyond all doubt. That
our Saviour eat the Passeover in an upper roome, we may determine
from the Text; and some we may concede which the Scripture plainly
defines not. That the Dyall of Ahaz was placed upon the West side
of the Temple, wee will not deny, or contradict the description of
Adricomius. That Abrahams servant put his hand under his right
thigh, we shall not question; and that the Thiefe on the right hand was
saved, and the other on the left reprobated, to make good the Method
of the last Judiciall dismission, we are ready to admit; but surely in

fruit of Paradise which was the destruction of man; but thereby is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

was of no longer duration then those horary and soon decaying fruits
of Summer; nor when it is said in the same Translation, <hi>Poma desiderii

to make a fayrer cavity for the Infant, the coccyx sometime
more reflected to give the easier delivery, and the ribs themselves
seeme a little flatter, yet are they equall in number. And therefore,
while Aristotle doubteth the relations made of Nations which had
but seven ribs on a side, and yet delivereth that men have generally no
more then eight; as he rejecteth their history, so can we not accept of
his Anatomy.</p>
               <p>Againe, although we concede there wanted one rib in the Sceleton
of Adam, yet were it repugnant unto reason and common observation
that his posterity should want the same; for we observe that mutilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not transmitted from father unto son; the blind begetting such
as can see, men with one eye, children with two, and criples mutilate
in their owne persons, do come out perfect in their generations. For,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:50218:181"/>
the seed conveigheth with it not onely the extract and single Idea of
every part, whereby it transmits their perfections or infirmities, but
double and over againe; whereby sometimes it multipliciously deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neates
the same, as in Twins in mixed and numerous generations. And
to speake more strictly, parts of the seed do seeme to containe the Idea
and power of the whole; so parents deprived of hands, beget manuall
issues, and the defect of those parts is supplyed by the Idea of others.
So in one graine of corne appearing similary and insufficient for a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
germination, there lyeth dormant the virtuality of many other, and
from thence sometimes proceed an hundred eares: and thus may bee
made out the cause of multiparous productions; for though the semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
materialls disperse and separate in the matrix, the formative ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
will not delineat a part, but endeavour the formation of the
whole; effecting the same as farre as the matter will permit, and from
devided materials attempt entire formations. And therefore, though
wondrous strange, it may not be impossible what is confirmed at Laus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun
concerning the Countesse of Holland, nor what Albertus reports
of the birth of an hundred and fifty, and if we consider the magnalities
of Generation in some things, wee shall not controver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

dayes fifty or sixty yeares, for about that time wee reade that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
children; so that if unto 930. we adde sixty yeares, he will exceed
Methuselah. And therefore if not in length of dayes, at least in old
age he surpassed others; he was older then all who was never so young
as any; for though hee knew old age he was never acquainted with
puberty, youth, or Infancy; and so in a strict account he begat children
at one yeare old; and if the usuall compute will hold, that men are of
the same age which are borne within compasse of the same yeare, Eve
was as old as her husband and parent Adam, and Cain their son coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous
unto both.</p>
               <p>Now that conception that no man did ever attaine unto a thousand

yeares, because none should ever be one day old in the sight of the
Lord, unto whom according to that of David, A thousand yeares are
but as one day, doth not advantage Methuselah; and being deduced
from a popular expression, which will not stand a Metaphysicall and
strict examination, is not of force to divert a serious enquirer; for unto
God a thousand yeares are no more then one moment, and in his sight
Methuselah lived no neerer one day then Abel, for all parts of time are
alike unto him, unto whom none are referable, and all things present,
unto whom nothing is past or to come; and therefore, although we be
measured by the Zone of time, and the flowing and continued instants
thereof, do weave at last a line and circle about the eldest; yet can we
not thus commensurate the sphere of Trismegistus, or summe up the
unsuccessive and stable duration of God.</p>

               <head type="sub">That there was no Rainebow before the Flood.</head>
               <p>THat there shall no Rainebow appeare forty yeares before the end

we cannot conclude the nonexistence of the Rainebow;
nor is that Chronology naturally established, which computeth the
antiquity of effects arising from physicall and setled causes, by additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
impositions
from voluntary determinators. Now by the decree of
reason and Philosophy, the Rainebow hath its ground in Nature, and
caused by the rayes of the Sunne, falling upon a roride and oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> cloud;
whereof some reflected, others refracted beget that semicircu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
variety we generally call the Rainebow; which must succeed upon
concurrence of causes and subjects aptly praedisposed. And therefore,
to conceive there was no Rainebow before, because God chose this
out as a token of the Covenant, is to conclude the existence of things
from their signalities, or of what is objected unto the sence, a coexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
with that which is internally presented unto the understanding.
With equal reason we may inferre there was no water before the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Baptisme, nor bread and wine before the holy Eucharist.</p>
               <p>Againe, while men deny the antiquity of one Rainebow, they anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
concede another. For, beside the solary Iris which God shewed
unto Noah there is another Lunary, whose efficient is the Moone, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:50218:183"/>
onely in the night, most commonly at full Moone, and some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
above the Horizon. Now the existence hereof men doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert,
although effected by a different Luminary in the same way
with the other; and probably appeared later, as being of rare appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and rarer observation, and many there are which thinke there
is no such thing in Nature. And therefore by casuall spectators they
are lookt upon like prodigies, and significations made not signified by
their natures.</p>
               <p>Lastly, we shall not need to conceive God made the Rainebow at
this time, if we consider that in its created and predisposed nature, it
was more proper for this signification then any other Meteor or cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall
appearency whatsoever. Thunder and lightning had too much
terrour to have beene tokens of mercy; Comets or blazing Stars ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
too seldome to put us in minde of a Covenant to be remembred
often, and might rather signifie the world should be once destroyed by
fire, then never againe by water. The Galaxia or milky Circle had
beene more probable; for, (beside that unto the latitude of thirty it
becomes their Horizon twice in foure and twenty howres, and unto
such as live under the Equator, in that space the whole Circle appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth)
part thereof is visible unto any situation, but being onely disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable
in the night and when the ayre is cleere, it becomes of unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and comfortlesse signification. A fixed Starre had not beene vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
unto all the Globe, and so of too narrow a signality in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
concerning all. But Rainebowes are seene unto all the world, and
every position of sphere; unto our owne Elevation it may appeare in
the morning while the Sunne hath attained about forty five degrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Horizon, (which is conceived the largest semidiameter of
any Iris) and so in the afternoone when it hath declined unto that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
againe; which height the Sun not attaining in winter, Raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes
may happen with us at noone or any time. Unto a right po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of spheare it may appeare three howres after the rising of the
Sun, and three before its setting; for the Sun ascending fifteene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
an houre, in three attaineth forty five of altitude. Even unto a
parallell sphere, and such as live under the pole, for halfe a yeare some
segments may appeare at any time and under any quarter, the Sun not
setting, but walking round about them.</p>
               <p>But the propriety of its Election most properly appeareth in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
signification and prognostick of it selfe; as contayning a mixt sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality
of raine and faire weather; for being in a roride cloud and ready
to drop, it declareth a pluvious disposure in the ayre; but because
when it appeares the Sun must also shine, there can bee no universall
showres, and consequently no deluge. Thus when the windowes of
the great deepe were open, in vaine men lookt for the Rainebow, for
at that time it could not be seene, which after appeared unto Noah. It
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:50218:183"/>
was therefore existent before the flood, and had in Nature some
ground of its addition; unto that of Nature God superadded an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his promise, that is, never to hinder its appearance, or so to
replenish the heavens againe as that we should behold it no more. And
thus, without disparaging the promise, it might raine at the same time
when God shewed it unto Noah; thus was there more therein then the
Heathens understood, when they called it the <hi>Nuncia</hi> of the gods, and
the laugh of weeping heaven; and thus may it be elegantly said, I put
my Bow,<note place="margin">Risus plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympi.</note> not my Arrow in the clouds, that is, in the menace of Raine
the mercy of faire weather.</p>
               <p>Laudable is the custome of the Jews, who upon the appearance of
the Rainebow, doe magnifie the fidelity of God in the memory of his
Covenant, according to that of Syracides, Looke upon the Rainebow,
and praise him that made it. And though some pious and Christian
pens have onely symboliz'd the same from the mystery of its colours,
yet are there other affections which might admit of Theologicall allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
nor would he finde a more improper subject that should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that the colours are made by refraction of light, and the shadows
that limit that light; that the Center of the Sun, the Rainebow, and
the eye of the beholder must be in one right line; that the spectator
must be betweene the Sun and the Rainebow; that sometime three ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,

                  </gap>eed not grant; nor will it
so well concord unto the letter of the Text, and its readiest Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
For, so is it said in our Translation, Sem the father of all the sons
of Heber, the brother of Japhet the elder; so by the Septuagint, and so
by that of Tremellius; and therefore when the Vulgar reades it, <hi>Fratre
Iaphet majore,</hi> the mistake, as Junius observeth, might be committed
by neglect of the Hebrew accent, which occasioned Jerom so to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, and many after to beleeve it. Nor is that argument contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
which is deduced from their Chronology; for probable it is, that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:50218:184"/>
Noah had none of them before, and begat them from that yeare when
it is said hee was five hundred yeares old and begat Sem, Ham, and
Japhet; Againe, it is said he was sixe hundred yeares old at the flood,
and that two yeares after Sem was but an hundred, therefore Sem must
be borne when Noah was five hundred and two, and some other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the yeare of five hundred and one.</p>
               <p>Now whereas the Scripture affordeth the priority of order unto
Sem, we cannot from thence inferre his primogeniture; for in Sem
the holy line was continued, and therefore however borne, his
genealogy was most remarkeable.<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> So is it not unusuall in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to nominate the younger before the elder;<note place="margin">Gen. 28.</note> so is it said, That Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ah
begat Abraham, Nachor, and Haram; whereas Haram was the
eldest. So Rebecca is termed the mother of Jacob and Esau. Nor is it
strange the younger should be first in nomination, who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
had the priority in the blessings of God, and been first in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction.
So Abel was accepted before Cain, Abraham the younger,
preferred before Ismael the elder, Jacob before Esau, Joseph was
the youngest of twelve, and David the eleventh son, and but the cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det
of Jesse.</p>
               <p>Lastly, though Japhet were not elder then Sem, yet must we not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that he was younger then Cham, for it is plainely delivered, that
after Sem and Japhet had covered Noah, he awaked, and knew what
his youngest son had done unto him. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

of the Septuagint, <hi>Filius minor</hi> of Jerome, and <hi>minimus</hi> of Tremelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.
And upon these grounds perhaps Josephus doth vary from the
Scripture enumeration, and nameth them Sem, Japhet, and Cham,
which is also observed by the Annian Berosus; <hi>Noah cum tribus fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Japhet there may be some difficulty, though Cyrill, Epiphanius, and
Austin have accounted Sem the elder, and Salian the Annalist, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius
the Chronologist contend for the same, yet Cham is more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <head type="sub">That the Tower of Babel was erected against a second deluge.</head>
               <p>AN opinion there is of some generality, that our fathers after the
Flood attempted the tower of Babel to secure themselves from a
second Deluge. Which however affirmed by Josephus and others,
hath seemed improbable unto many who have discoursed hereon. For,
(beside that they could not be ignorant of the promise of God never
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:50218:184"/>
to put them in minde thereof) it is improbable from the nature of
the Deluge, which being not possibly causable from naturall showres
above, or watery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruptions below, but requiring a supernaturall hand,
and such as all acknowledge irresistible; wee must disparage their
knowledge and judgement in so succeslesse attempts.</p>
               <p>Againe, they must probably heare, and some might know, that the
waters of the flood ascended fifteene cubits above the highest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.
Now, if as some define, the perpendicular altitude of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
mountaines bee foure miles, or as others, but fifteene furlongs,
it is not easily conceived how such a structure could bee effected;
except wee receive the description of Herodotus concerning the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Belus, whose first tower was eight furlongs higher, and eight
more built upon it; except we beleeve the Annian Berosus, or the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall
relation of Jerome.</p>
               <p>It was improbable from the place, that is a plaine in the land of
Shinar. And if the situation of Babylon were such at first as it was in
the dayes of Herodotus, it was rather a seat of amenity and pleasure,
then conducing unto this intention; it being in a very great plaine, and
so improper a place to provide against a generall Deluge by towers
and eminent structures, that they were faine to make provisions against
particular and annuall inundations by ditches and trenches, after the
manner of Aegypt. And therefore Sir Walter Ralegh accordingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth;
If the Nations which followed Nimrod, still doubted the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
of a second flood, according to the opinions of the antient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,
it soundeth ill to the eare of Reason, that they would have
spent many yeares in that low and overflowne valley of Mesopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.
And therefore in this situation, they chose a place more likely to
have secured them from the worlds destruction by fire, then another
Deluge of water, and as Pierius observeth, some have conceived that
this was their intention.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the reason is delivered in the Text. Let us build us a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and a Tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us
make us a name, lest wee be scattered abroad upon the whole earth,
as wee have already began to wander over a part. These were the open
ends proposed unto the people, but the secret designe of Nimrod, was
to settle unto himselfe a place of dominion, and rule over the rest of
his brethren, as it after succeeded, according to the delivery of the
Text, The beginning of his kingdome was Babel.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Mandrakes of Leah.</head>
               <p>VVEE shall not omit the Mandrakes of Leah, according to the
History of Genesis. And Reuben went out in the dayes of
Wheat-harvest and found Mandrakes in the field, and brought them
unto his mother Leah; then Rachel said unto Leah, Give me, I pray
thee, of thy sonnes Mandrakes, and she said unto her, Is it a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that thou hast taken my husband, and wouldest thou take my sons
Mandrakes also? and Rachel said, therefore he shall lye with thee
this night for thy sonnes Mandrakes; from whence hath arisen a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conceit, that Rachel requested these plants as a medicine of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundation,
or whereby she might become fruitfull; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is very questionable, and of incertaine truth.</p>
               <p>For first from the comparison of one Text with another, whether
the Mandrakes here mentioned, be the same plant which holds that
name with us there is some cause to doubt; the word is used in another
place of Scripture,<note place="margin">Cant. 7.</note> when the Church inviting her beloved into the
fields, among the delightfull fruits of Grapes and Pomegranats, it is
said, the Mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of
pleasant fruits. Now instead of a smell of delight, our Mandrakes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
a papaverous and unpleasant odour, whether in the leafe or apple
as is discoverable in their simplicity or mixture; the same is also dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
from the different interpretations: for though the Septuagint and
Josephus doe render it the Apples of Mandrakes in this Text yet in the
other of the Canticles the Chaldy Paraphrase tearmeth it Balsame.
R. Solomon, as Drusius observeth, conceives it to be that plant the
Arabians named Jesemin. Oleaster and <hi>Georgius Venetus</hi> the Lilly;
and that the word <hi>Dudaim,</hi> may comprehend any plant that hath a
good smell, resembleth a womans breast, and flourisheth in wheat
harvest; Junius and Tremellius interpret the same for any amiable
flowers of a pleasant and delightfull odour: but the Geneva Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
have been more wary then any; for although they retaine the word
Mandrake in the Text, they in effect retract it in the Margine, wherein
is set downe, The word in the originall is <hi>Dudaim,</hi> which is a kinde
of fruit or slower unknowne.</p>
               <p>Nor shall we wonder at the dissent of exposition, and difficulty of
definition concerning this Text, if we perpend how variously the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
of Scripture are expounded, and how hard it is in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to make out the species determined. Thus are we at variance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the plant that covered Jonas, which though the Septuagint
doth render Colocynthis, the Spanish Calabaca, and ours accordingly
a gourd, yet the vulgar translates it Hedera or Juice; and, as Grotius ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:50218:185"/>
Jerome thus translated it, not as the same plant but best appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
thereby. The Italian of Diodati and that of Tremellius have
named it Ricinus, and so hath ours in the Margine; for <hi>palma Christi</hi> is
the same with Ricinus. The Geneva Translators have herein been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
circumspect; for they have retained the originall word <hi>Kikaion,</hi> and
ours hath also affixed the same unto the Margine: nor are they indeed
alwayes the same plants which are delivered under the same name, and
appellations commonly received amongst us; so when it is said of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
that hee writ of plants from the Cedar of Lebanus, unto the
Hysop that groweth upon the wall, that is from the greatest unto the
smallest, it cannot be well conceived our common hysop; for neither
is that the least of vegetables, nor observed to grow upon walls; but
rather as Lemnius well conceiveth some kinde of the capillaries, which

how this conceit fell into mens minds it cannot fall into mine, for the
Scripture delivereth it not, nor can it bee clearely deduced from the

               <p>Thirdly, if Rachel had any such intention, yet had they no such
effect, for she conceived not many yeares after of Joseph; whereas in
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:50218:186"/>
the meane time Leah had three children, Isachar, Zabulon, and
Dinah.</p>
               <p>Lastly, although at that time they failed of this effect, yet is it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
questionable whether they had any such vertue either in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those times or in their proper nature; that the opinion was popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in the land of Canaan it is improbable, and had Leah understood
thus much she would not surely have parted with fruits of such a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
especially unto Rachel who was no friend unto her. As for its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
nature, the Ancients have generally esteemed it Narcotick or stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefactive,
and is to be found in the list of poyson set downe by Diosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides,
Galen, Aetius, Aegineta, and severall Antidotes delivered by
them against it. It was I confesse from good Antiquity, and in the
dayes of Theophrastus accounted a philt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, or plant that conciliates
affection, and so delivered by Dioscorides; and this intent might seem
more probable, had they not been the wives of holy Jacob, had Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel
presented them unto him, and not requested them for her selfe.</p>
               <p>Now what Dioscorides affirmeth in favour of this effect, that the
graines of the Apples of Mandrakes mundifie the Matrix and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with sulphur stop the fluxes of women, he overthrows by qualities
destructive unto conception; affirming also that the juice thereof pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
upward like Hellebore, and applyed in pessaries provokes the
menstruous flowes and procures abortion. <hi>Petrus Hispanus,</hi> or Pope
John the twentieth speakes more directly in his <hi>Thesaurus pauperum;</hi>
wherein among the receits of saecundation, he experimentally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
the wine of Mandrakes given with <hi>Triphera Magna:</hi> but the
soule of the medicine may lye in <hi>Triphera magna,</hi> an excellent compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
and for this effect commended by Nicolaus. And whereas
Levinus Lemnius that eminent Physitian doth also concede this effect
it is from manifest causes and qualities elementall occasionally produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the same; for he imputeth the same unto the coldnesse of that
simple, and is of opinion that in hot climates, and where the uterine
parts exceeed in heat, by the coldnesse hereof they may bee reduced
into a conceptive constitution, and Crasis accommodable unto gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
whereby indeed we will not deny the due and frequent use may
proceed unto some effect, from whence notwithstanding wee cannot
inferre a fertiliating condition or property of fecundation: for in this
way all vegetables doe make fruitfull according unto the complexion
of the Matrix; if that excell in heat, plants exceeding in cold doe recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

it, if it be cold, simples that are hot reduce it, if dry moist, if moist
dry correct it, in which division all plants are comprehended; but to
distinguish thus much is a point of Art, and beyond the method of
Rachels or feminine Physicke. Againe, whereas it may be thought
that Mandrakes may fecundate since Poppy hath obtained the Epithite
of fruitfull, and that fertility was hieroglyphically described, by Venus
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:50218:186"/>
with an head of poppy in her hand; the reason hereof, was the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

that they were Kings of Collein. For though Collein were the

yet will no history informe us there were three Kings thereof. Beside
these being rulers in their Countries, and returning home would have

their conversion was not wrought untill seventy yeares after by
Maternus a disciple of Peter. And lastly, it is said that the wise men

but especially by Georgius Trapezuntius, who hath expresly
treated upon this Text; and although he lived but in the last Centurie,
did still affirme that Iohn was not yet dead.</p>
               <p>As for the grosse opinion that he should not dye, it is unto my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sufficiently refuted by that which first occasioned it, that is the
Scripture it selfe, and no further of, then the very subsequent verse:
yet Iesus said not unto him he should not dye, but if I will that he tarry
till I come, what is that to thee? and this was written by Iohn himself
whom the opinion concerned, and as is conceived many yeares after
when Peter had suffered, and fulfilled the Prophesie of Christ.</p>
               <p>For the particular conceit the foundation is weake, nor can it bee
made out from the Text alleadged in the Apocalyps: for beside that
therein two persons are onely named, no mention is made of Iohn a
third Actor in this Tragedy; the same is overthrowne by History,
which recordeth not onely the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of his buriall, that is Ephesus a City in Asia minor; whither after hee
had beene banished into Patmos by Domitian hee returned in the

and this is testified by Ierome <hi>de Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis,</hi> by Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian

Sepulchre was to be seen; and by a more ancient Testimony alleadged

should have said, Thou hast thine owne doome, why enquirest thou

if he stay untill I come, what concerneth it thee? who shalt bee sure to

he foreknew Iohn should not suffer a violent death, but goe unto
his grave in peace; which had Peter assuredly knowne, it might have
cast some water on his flames, and smothered those fires which kindled
after unto the honour of his Master.</p>
               <p>Now why among all the rest Iohn only escaped the death of a
Martyr, the reason is given; because all other fled away or withdrew
themselves at his death, and he alone of the Twelve beheld his passion
on the Crosse; wherein notwithstanding, the affliction that he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
could not amount unto lesse then Martyrdome: for if the naked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
at least the intentive consideration of that passion, be able still
and at this disadvantage of time, to rend the hearts of pious con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an object more sharpely pierce the martyr'd soule of Iohn, then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
did the nayles the crucified body of Peter.</p>
               <p>Againe, they were mistaken in the Emphaticall apprehension, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the consideration upon the words, If I will, whereas it properly
lay in these, when I come: which had they apprehended as some have
since, that is, not for his ultimate and last returne, but his comming in
judgement and destruction upon the Iewes; or such a comming as it
might be said, that that generation should not passe before it was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled:
they needed not, much lesse need we suppose such diuturnity;
for after the death of Peter, Iohn lived to behold the same fulfilled
by Vespasian: nor had he then his <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> or went out like unto

for he survived the other Twelve, he was aged 22 yeares when
he was called by Christ, and 25 that is the age of Priesthood at his
death, and lived 93 yeares, that is 68 after his Saviour, and dyed not
before the second yeare of Trajane. Now having outlived all his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the world was confirmed he might live still, and even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the
comming of his Master.</p>
               <p>The grounds which promoted it in succeeding ages were especially
two; the the first his escape of Martyrdome: for whereas all the rest
suffered some kinde of forcible death, we have no history that he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
any; and men might thinke he was not capable thereof, for so, as
History hath related, by the command of Domitian he was cast into a
Cauldron of burning oyle, and came out againe unsinged. Now fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ages apprehending hee suffered no violent death, and finding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the means that tended thereto could take no place, they might bee
confirmed in their opinion that death had no power over him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeve he might live alwayes who could not be destroyed by fire,
and resist the fury of that Element which nothing shall resist. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
was a corruption crept into the Latine Text, reading for <hi>Si, Sic
eum manere volo,</hi> whereby the answer of our Saviour becommeth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,
or that he will have it so, which way of reading was much recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in former ages, and is still retained in the vulgar Translation; but in
the Greek &amp; original, the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifying <hi>Si</hi> or if, which is very

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and cannot bee translated for it: and answerable

unto the Greeke by the authority of <hi>Sixtus quintus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third confirmed it in ages farther descending, and proved a
powerfull argument unto all others following; that in his tombe at
Ephesus there was no corps or relique thereof to be found; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
arised divers doubts, and many suspitious conceptions, some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:50218:189"/>
he was not buried, some that he was buried, but risen againe;
others, that he descended alive into his tombe, and from thence depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

hath observed, who alledgeth a letter of Celestine Bishop of
Rome, unto the Councell of Ephesus, wherein he declareth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of John were highly honoured by that City, and a passage also
of Chrysostome in the Homilies of the Apostles. That John being
dead did cures in Ephesus, as though he were still alive. And so I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now that the first ages after Christ, those succeeding, or any other
should proceed into opinions so farre devided from reason, as to thinke
of Immortality after the fail of Adam, or conceit a man in these later
times should out-live our fathers in the first, although it seeme very
strange, yet is it not incredible, for the credulity of men hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
into the like conceits, and as Ireneus and Tertullian have made

we reade in story and undeniable Authors. For that they received this
blow from Christ, and no other causes alledged by the Heathens, from

some very remarkeable. The first that Oracle of Delphos delivered

               <p>All which were evident and convincing acknowledgements of that
power which shut his lips, and restrained that delusion which had
reigned so many Centuries. But as his malice is vigilant, and the sins
of men do still continue a toleration of his mischiefes, he resteth not,
nor will he ever cease to circumvent the sons of the first deceaved, and
therefore expelled his Oracles and solemne Temples of delusion, he
runnes into corners, exercising minor trumperies, and acting his deceits
in Witches, Magicians, Diviners, and such inferiour seductions. And
yet (what is deplorable) while we apply our selves thereto, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

For, if we rightly consider the organ of taste, we shall finde the length
of the neck to conduce but little unto it. For the tongue being the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument

will not advantage the gust to have the neck ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

third and forth propagations, and so diffuse themselves into the tongue.
And therefore Cranes, Hernes, and Swans, have no advantage in taste
beyond Hawkes, Kites, and others of shorter necks.</p>
               <p>Nor, if we consider it, had Nature respect unto the taste in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
contrivance of necks, but rather unto the parts contained, the
compos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>

                  </gap>eed.
Thus animals of long leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, have generally long necks; that is, for the
conveniency of feeding, as having a necessity to apply their mouths
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:50218:194"/>
unto the earth. So have Horses, Camels, Dromedaries long necks,
and all tall animals, except the Elephant, who in defect thereof is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with a Trunck, without which he could not attaine the ground.
So have Cranes, Hernes, Storks, and Shovelards long necks; and so
even in Man whose figure is erect, the length of the neck followeth
the proportion of other parts; and such as have round faces, or broad
chests and shoulders, have seldome or never long necks. For, the length
of the face twice exceedeth that of the neck, and the space betwixt
the throat pit and the navell is equall unto the circumference thereof.
Againe, animals are framed with long necks, according unto the course
of their life or feeding: so many with short legs have long necks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they seed in the water, as Swans, Geese, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>licans, and other sin-footed
animals. But Hawkes and birds of prey have short necks and
trussed legs; for that which is long is weake and flexible, and a shorter
figure is best accommodated unto that intention. Lastly, the necks of
animals doe va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, according to the parts that are contained in them,
which are the weazon and the gullet. Such as have no weazon and
breathe not, have scarce any neck, as most sorts of fishes, and some
none at all, as all sorts of pectinals, Soales, Thornback, Flounders; and
all crustacco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, and Lobsters.</p>
               <p>All which considered, the Wish of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>loxenus will hardly consist
with reason. More excusable had it beene to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ave wished himselfe an
Ape, which if common conceit speake true, is exacter in taste then any.
Rather some kinde of granivorous bird then a Crane, for in this sense
they are so exquisite, that upon the first peck of their bill, they can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
the qualities, of hard bodies, which the sence of man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
not without mastication. Rather some ruminating animall,
that he might have eate his meate twice over; or rather, as Theophilus
observed in Athenaeus, his desire had been more reasonable, had hee
wished himselfe an Elephant, or an Horse; for in these animals the
appetite is more vehement, and they receive their viands in large and
plenteous manner. And this indeed had beene more sutable, if this
were the same Philoxenus whereof Plutarch speaketh, who was so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilly
greedy, that to engrosse the messe, he would preventively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
his nostrils in the dish.</p>
               <p>As for the musicall advantage, although it seeme more reasonable,
yet doe we not observe that Cranes and birds of long necks have any
musicall, but harsh and clangous throats. But birds that are canorous
and whose notes we most commend, are of little throats, and short
necks, as Nightingales, Finches, Linnets, Canary birds and Larkes. And
truly, although the weazon, throtle and tongue be the instruments of
voice, and by their agitations doe chiefly concurre unto these delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
modulations, yet cannot we assigne the cause unto any particular
formation; and I perceive the best thereof, the Nightingale hath
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:50218:194"/>
some disadvantage in the tongue; which is not acuminate and pointed
as in the rest, but seemeth as it were cut off; which perhaps might give
the hint unto the fable of Philomela, and the cutting off her tongue by
Tereus.</p>

               <p>COncerning the Lake Asphaltites, the Lake of Sodome, or the dead
Sea, that heavy bodies cast therein sinke not, but by reason of a
salt and bituminous thicknesse in the water floate and swimme above,
narrations already made are of that variety, we can hardly from thence
deduce a satisfactory determination, and that not onely in the story it
selfe, but in the cause alledged. For, as for the story men deliver it
variously; some I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eare too largely, as Pliny, who affirmeth that
bricks will swim therein. Mandevill goeth farther, that Iron swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
and feathers sinke. Munster in his Cosmography hath another
relation, although perhaps derived from the Poem of Tertullian, that
a candle burning swimmeth, but if extinguished sinketh. Some more
moderately, as Josephus, and many other; affirming onely that living
bodies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rring they cannot sinke, but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they doe not easily descend. Most traditionally, as Galen, Pliny,
Solinus and Strabo, who seemes to mistake the Lake Serbonis for it;
few experimentally, most contenting themselves in the experiment of
Vespasian, by whose command some captives bound were cast there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
and found to floate as though they could have swimmed: divers
contradictorily, or contrarily, quite overthrowing the point. Aristotle
in the second of his Meteors speaks lightly thereof, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and
esteemeth thereof as a fable. Biddulphus devideth the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of Judea into three pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

the second apparent falshoods, the third are dubious or betweene bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h,
in which forme hee ranketh the relation of this Lake. But Andrew
Thevet in his Cosmography doth ocularly overthrow it; for hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
he saw an Asse with his saddle cast therein, and drowned. Now
of these relations so different or contrary unto each other, the second
is most moderate, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est to be embraced, which saith, that living
bodies swim therein, that is, they doe not easily sinke: and this, untill
exact experiment further determine, may be allowed, as best consistent
with this quality, and the reasons alledged for it.</p>
               <p>As for the cause of this effect, common opinion conceives it to bee
the salt and bituminous thicknesse of the water. This indeed is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
and may bee admitted as farre as the second opinion concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.
For, certaine it is that salt water will support a greater burden
then fresh, and we daylie see an egge will descend in salt water, which
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:50218:195"/>
will swimme in brine. But that Iron <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hould floate therein, from this
cause is hardly granted; for heavy bodies will onely swim in that
liquor, wherein the weight of their bulke exceedeth not the weight
of so much water as it occupieth or taketh up. But surely no water is
heavy enough to answer the ponderosity of Iron; and therefore that
metall will sinke in any kinde thereof, and it was a perfect miracle
which was wrought this way by Elisha. Thus wee perceive that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
doe swim or sinke in different liquors, according unto the tenuity
or gravity of those liquors which are to support them. So salt water
beareth that weight which will sinke in vineger, vineger that which
will fall in fresh water, fresh water that which will sinke in spirits of
Wine, and that will swimme in spirits of Wine which will sinke in
cleere oyle, as wee made experiment in globes of waxe pierced with
light sticks to support them. So that although it be conceived an hard
matter to sinke in oyle, I beleeve a man should finde it very difficult,
and next to flying to swimme therein. And thus will Gold swim in
Quicksilver, wherein Iron and other metals sinke; for the bulke of
Gold is onely heavier then that space of Quicksilver which it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth;
and thus also in a solution of one ounce of Quicksilver in two of
<hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> the liquor will beare Amber, horne and the softer kinds
of stones, as we have made triall in each.</p>
               <p>But a private opinion there is which crosseth the common conceit,
maintained by some of late, and alledged of old by Strabo, that is, that
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>loating of bodies in this Lake proceeds not from the thicknesse of
the water, but a bituminous ebullition from the bottome, whereby it
wafts up bodies injected, and suffereth them not easily to sinke. The
verity thereof would be enquired by ocular exploration, for this way
is also probable; so we observe, it is hard to wade deep in baths where
springs arise, and thus sometime are bals made to play upon a spouting
streame.</p>
               <p>And therefore, untill judicious and ocular experiment confirme or
distinguish the assertion, that bodies doe not sinke herein at all we doe
not yet beleeve; that they not easily or with more difficulty descend
in this then other water we shall already assent: but to conclude an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
from a difficulty, or affirme whereas things not easily sinke,
they doe not drowne at all; beside the fallacy, is a frequent addition
in humane expression, and an amplification not unusuall as well in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
as in relations; which oftentimes give indistinct accounts of
proximities, and without restraint transcend from one unto another.
Thus for as much as the torrid Zone was conceived exceeding hot, and
of difficult habitation, the opinions of men so advanced its constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to conceive the same unhabitable, and beyond possibility for
man to live therein. Thus, because there are no Wolves in England,
nor have beene observed for divers generations, common people have
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:50218:195"/>
proceeded into opinions, and some wise men into affirmations, they
will not live therein although brought from other Countries. Thus

For, a laugh there is of contempt or indignation, as well as of mirth

Christian Philosophy did not thinke it reasonable presently to annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

he was not the first that changed his name in that Sea; nor as
Platina affirmeth, have all his successours precisely continued that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome;

their Baptismall denominations, nor is it proved, or probable that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius
changed the name of <hi>Bocca di Porco,</hi> for this was his sirname or
gentilitious appellation, nor was it the custome to alter that with the
other; but he commuted his Christian name Peter for Sergius, because
he would seem to decline the name of Peter the second. A scruple I

               <p>And in this opinion and hopes wee are not single; but Andreas
Alciatus the Civilian in his Parerga, and <hi>Franciscus de Cordua</hi>

Certainely, sad and Tragicall stories are seldome drawne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

intend the hatred or pitty of the persons, so are they set forth
with additionall amplifications. Thus have some suspected it hath

it hath fared with that of Judas, who having sinned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
aggravation, and committed one villany which cannot bee
exasperated by all other; is yet charged with the murther of his
reputed brother, parricide of his father, and Incest with his
owne mother, as Florilegus or Matthew of Westminster hath
at large related. And thus hath it perhaps befallen the noble Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisarius,
who, upon instigation of the Empresse, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
the exile, and very hardly treated Pope Serverius, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
pens, as a judgement of God upon this fact, have set forth
his future sufferings: and omitting nothing of amplification, they
have also delivered this, which notwithstanding <hi>Iohannes</hi> the
Greeke, makes doubtfull, as may appeare from his Iambicks in
Baronius.</p>

poyson is not without a poyson unto its selfe; yet hath the curse

               <p>4. A story there passeth of an Indian King, that sent unto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
a faire woman fed with Aconites and other poysons,
with this intent, either by converse or copulation complexionally
to destroy him. For my part, although the designe were true,
I should have doubted the successe. For, though it be possible
that poysons may meet with tempers whereto they may become
Aliments, and wee observe from fowles that feed on fishes, and
others feed with garlick and onyons, that simple aliments are
not alwayes concocted beyond their vegetable qualities; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that even after carnall conversion, poysons may yet retaine some
portion of their natures; yet are they so refracted, cicurated, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
as not to make good their first and destructive malignities. And
therefore the Storke that eateth Snakes, and the Stare that feedeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Hemlock, though no commendable aliments, are not destructive
poysons. For, animals that can innoxiously digest these poisons become
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:50218:199"/>
antidotall unto the poyson digested; and therefore whether their
breath be attracted, or their flesh ingested, the poysonous reliques goe
still along with their Antidote, whose society will not permit their
malice to be destructive. And therefore also animals that are not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chifed
by poyson<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which destroy us, may bee drawne into Antidote
against them; The bloud or flesh of Storks against the venome of
Serpents, the Quaile against Hellebore, and the dyet of Starlings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the draught of Socrates. Upon like grounds are some parts of
Animals Alexipharmacall unto others, and some veines of the earth,
and also whole regions, not onely destroy the life of venemous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but also prevent their productions. For, though perhaps they
containe the seminals of Spiders, and Scorpions, and such as in other
earths by suscitation of the Sun may arise unto animation; yet lying
under command of their Antidote, without hope of emergency they
are poysoned in their matrix by those powers, that easily hinder the
advance of their originals, whose confirmed formes they are able to
destroy.</p>

               <p>OTher relations there are, and those in very good Authors; which
though we doe not positively deny, yet have they not beene un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questioned
by some, and as improbable truths doe stand rejected by
others. Unto some it hath seemed incredulous what Herodotus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
of the great Army of Xerxes, that dranke whole Rivers dry.
And unto the Author himselfe it appeared wondrous strange, that
they exhausted not the provision of the Countrey, rather then the
waters thereof. For, as he maketh the account, and <hi>Budeus de Asse</hi>
correcting the miscompute of Valla, delivereth it; if every man of
the Army had had a chenix of Corne a day, that is a sextary and
halfe, or about two pints and a quarter, the Army had daylie
expended ten hundred thousand and forty medimna's, or measures
containing six Bushels. Which rightly considered, the Abderites
had reason to blesse the heavens, that Xerxes eate but one meale a
day, and Pythius his noble hoste might with lesse charge and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
provision entertaine both him and his Army. And yet may all be
salved, if we take it hyperbolically, and as wise men receive that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
in Job, concerning Behemoth, or the Elephant; Behold, hee
drinketh up a River and hasteth not, he trusteth that hee can draw up
Jordane into his mouth.</p>
               <p>2. That Anniball eate or brake through the Alpes with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,

the tops of some of the highest mountaines. For, as it is vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood, that hee cut a passage for his Army through those
mighty mountaines, it may seeme incredible, not onely in the
greatnesse of the effect, but the quantity of the efficient: and such
as behold them, may thinke an Ocean of Vinegar too little for
that effect. 'Twas a worke indeed rather to be expected from
earthquakes and inundations, then any corrosive waters, and much
condemneth the judgement of Xerxes, that wrought through Mount
Athos with Mattocks.</p>
               <p>3. The received story of Milo, who by daylie lifting a Calfe,
attained an ability to carry it being a Bull, is a witty conceit, and
handsomely sets forth the efficacy of Assuefaction. But surely the
account had beene more reasonably placed upon some person not
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:50218:200"/>
much exceeding in strength, and such a one as without the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of custome could never have performed that act; which some
may presume that Milo without precedent artifice or any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative,
had strength enough to performe. For, as relations declare,
he was the most pancraticall man of Greece, and as Galen reporteth,
and Mercurialis in his Gymnasticks representeth, he was able to persist
erect upon an oyled planke, and not to bee removed by the force or
protrusion of three men; and if that bee true which Atheneus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,
he was little beholding to custome for this ability. For,
in the Olympick games, for the space of a furlong, he carryed an
Oxe of foure yeares upon his shoulders; and the same day hee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
it in his belly; for as it is there delivered he eate it up himselfe:

the Author with an <hi>aiunt,</hi> is made to salve himself. Assuredly it was a
noble Nation that could afford an hint to such inventions of patience,
and upon whom, if not such verities, at least such verisimilities of
fortitude were placed. Were the story true, they would have made

Asse, without a beliefe of that of Mahomets Camell, or Livies Oxe;
if any man make a doubt of Giges ring in Justinus, or conceives hee

since be the same with that of Lots wife; whether this were the hand
of Paul, or that which is commonly showne the head of Peter, if any
doubt, I shall not much dispute with their suspicions. If any man shall
not beleeve the Turpentine betwixt Jerusalem and Bethlem, under
which the Virgin suckled our Saviour, as she passed betweene those
Cities; or the figtree of Bethanie shewed to this day, whereon Zacheus
ascended to behold our Saviour, I cannot tell how to enforce his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
nor doe I thinke it requisite to attempt it. For, as it is no reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
proceeding to compell a Religion, or thinke to enforce our owne
beliefe upon another, who cannot without the concurrence of Gods
Spirit, have any indubitable evidence of things that are obtruded; so
is it also in matters of common beliefe; whereunto neither can we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably
assent, without the cooperation of our sense or reason, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
consist the principles of perswasion. For, as the habit of faith in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:50218:201"/>
is an argument of things unseene, and a stable assent unto things
inevident, upon authority of the divine Revealer; So the beliefe of
man which depends upon humane Testimony, is but a staggering as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto the affirmative, not without some feare of the negative. And
as there is required the Spirit of God, and an infused inclination unto
the one, so must the actuall sensation of our senses, at least the non op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of our reasons procure our assent &amp; acquiescence in the other.
So when Eusebius an holy writer affirmeth there grew a strange and
unknowne plant neere the statue of Christ, erected by his hemarroidall
patient in the Gospel, which attaining unto the hemne of his vesture,
acquired a sudden faculty to cure all diseases. Although he saith he
saw the statua in his dayes, hath it found in many men so much as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
beliefe; some believing, others opinioning, a third suspecting it
might be otherwise. For, indeed in matters of beliefe the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
assenting unto the relation, either for the authority of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or the probability of the object; although there may be a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the one, yet if there be not a satisfaction in the other, there
will arise suspensions; nor can we properly believe untill some argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of reason, or of our proper sense convince or determine our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.</p>
               <p>And thus it is also in matters of certain and experimented truth: for,
if unto one that never heard thereof, a man should undertake to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the affections of the Loadstone, or that Jet and Amber attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
strawes and light bodies, there would be little Rhetorick in the
authority of Aristotle, Pliny, or any other. Thus, although it be true
that the string of a Lute or Violl will stirre upon the stroake of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Diapazon in another of the same kinde; that Alcanna being
greene, will suddenly infect the nailes and other parts with a durable
red; that a candle out of a Musket will pierce through an inch board,
or an Urinall force a naile through a planke, can few or none believe
thus much without a visible experiment. Which notwithstanding fals
out more happily for knowledge; for these relations leaving unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

               <p>4. I hope it is not true, and some indeed have strongly denyed, what
is recorded of the Monke that poysoned Henry the Emperour, in a
draught of the holy Eucharist. 'Twas a scandalous wound unto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, and I hope all Pagans will forgive it, when they shall
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:50218:202"/>
reade that a Christian was poysoned in a cup of Christ, and received
his bane in a draught of his salvation. Had I believed Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I should have doubted the effect; and surely the sinne it selfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
an aggravation in that opinion. It much commendeth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
of our forefathers, and the simplicity of those times, whose
Laws could never dreame so high a crime as parricide: whereas this
at the least may seeme to outreach that fact, and to exceed the regular
distinctions of murder. I will not say what sinne it was to act it; yet
may it seeme a kinde of martyrdome to suffer by it: For, although un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowingly
he dyed for Christ his sake, and lost hs life in the ordained
testimony of his death. Certainely, had they knowne it, some noble
zeales would scarcely have refused it, rather adventuring their owne
death, then refusing the memoriall of his.</p>
               <p>Many other accounts like these we meet sometimes in history, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
unto Christianity, and even unto humanity; whose verities not
onely, but whose relations honest minds doe deprecate. For of sinnes
heteroclitall, and such as want either name or president, there is oft
times a sinne even in their histories. We desire no records of such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities;
sinnes should be accounted new, that so they may be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

sufficiently expatiate without these singularities of Villany; For, as
they encrease the hatred of vice in some, so doe they enlarge the theory
of wickednesse in all. And this is one thing that may make latter Ages
worse then were the former; For, the vicious examples of Ages past,
poyson the curiosity of these present, affording a hint of sin unto se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceable
spirits, and solliciting those unto the imitation of them, whose
heads were never so perversely principled as to invent them. In this
kinde we commend the wisdome and goodnesse of Galen, who would
not leave unto the world too subtile a Theory of poysons; unarming
thereby the malice of venemous spirits, whose ignorance must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with Sublimate and Arsenick. For, surely there are subtiler ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenations,

these unruly affections that make us sinne such prodigies, and

species answering their former natures; some men must surely live over

entered; and though the objection of Plato should take place, that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

all things, and growing fewer in number, must leave some soules apart
