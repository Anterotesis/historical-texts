            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his Highneſs The moſt Illuſtrious, Heroick &amp; Highborn PRINCE, <hi>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PERT</hi> Count Palatine of the <hi>RHINE,</hi> AND Duke of BAVARIA and CUMBERLAND, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THe Common Law of <hi>England</hi> (moſt eminent Prince) makes great difference between the Inheritance of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of Subjects: for the next Heir, though of half Bloud, ſhall inherit the Crown. Thus did Queen <hi>Mary</hi> inherit the Crown from <hi>Edward,</hi> though but of half Bloud to him: So did Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> from Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> yet was but of half Bloud to her. But no Subject of half Bloud ſhall inherit any Eſtate; but for want of an Heir of the whole Bloud, it ſhall Eſcheat to the King, or the Lord upon whom the Eſtate was held.</p>
            <p>And as the Common Law makes this difference in Bloud, ſo does it in the Inheritance of the Crown, and men born out of the Allegeance of the King. For no perſon born out of the Allegeance of the King, ſhall Inherit any Eſtate from any Engliſh Subject: but the Heir of the Crown ſhall Inherit
<pb facs="tcp:108084:3"/>
whereſoever he be born. Thus did King <hi>James</hi> (your Highneſs Grandfather, and the happy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niter of the Britiſh Monarchy) Inherit the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet was not born in the Allegeance of it.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England,</hi> though born a Forreigner, may purchaſe and hold an Eſtate in <hi>England;</hi> but no other Forreigner; though born of Subjects to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſhall take an Eſtate by Purchaſe, but the King ſhall have it. The Reaſon of theſe differences I do not underſtand: For as the Law ſecures the Inheritance of the Crown, ſo doth it make a bar between this Nation and all others who deſire to become Subject to it. But if there were anciently any reaſon for this Law, it is now ceaſed; ſince the peopling the <hi>American</hi> Plantations, the repeopling <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Wars, and late Great Plague, have loſt and conſumed ſo many people out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Common Law debars the Nation of any future ſupply for all theſe Loſſes, ſo ſome Acts of Parliament have put the Nation into a Hoſtile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with the World. There was a Law made in the 5 of <hi>Rich. 2. c. 3.</hi> which forbid the Engliſh to carry forth, or bring in Merchandize, but in Ships of the King's Allegeance, and the Marriners, or more part, Subjects: but this Law was ſo intolerable, that the next year, <hi>viz. 6 Rich. 2. c. 8.</hi> the Engliſh had liberty to Trade in Forrein Veſſels, where others could not be had. But this Law thus qualified by the Authority of the <hi>1 Eliz. cap. 13.</hi> cauſed great diſpleaſure between Forrein Princes and the Kings of this Realm, and the Merchants were ſore grieved and damaged thereby. Therefore for the encreaſe
<pb facs="tcp:108084:3"/>
and Continuation of Amity, both the Laws made by <hi>Rich. 2.</hi> were Repealed, and the Engliſh had liberty given them to carry out and bring in Merchandize in any Veſſels, paying Strangers Duties; but if there were War, or any reſtraint of Engliſh Ships, then to pay but ordinary Duties. But the Engliſh had liberty given them at all times to import Maſts, Raff, Pitch and Tar, in any Veſſels, paying ordinary Duties; the former being for the preſervation of the Timber of <hi>England,</hi> the latter for the benefit of the Navy.</p>
            <p>But the Rump-Parliament deſigning a War againſt the Dutch, without any conſideration of this Law, or of the Statute of <hi>14 Rich. 2. c. 6.</hi> whereby the Merchants of <hi>England</hi> in any Realm might freight forrein Ships to that Realm, if the Ships of that Realm would not take reaſonable Gains; or of the <hi>35 Eliz. 11.</hi> for the preſervation of the Timber of <hi>England;</hi> or of the <hi>17 Car. 1.</hi> for Importation of Gunpowder, which themſelves had made; (all which yet ſtand in force, and are unrepealed.) made a Thing, Intituled, <hi>An Act for encouragement and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Shipping and Navigation,</hi> commonly called The Act of <hi>Navigation,</hi> whereby the Engliſh are forbid to import any forrein Goods unleſs in Engliſh-built Ships, whether they can get them or not, and Sailed by ¾ Engliſh, upon penalty of confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Goods, Guns, Tackle, Apparel, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition. A War they deſigned, and a War they had with the Dutch, which laſted longer than their Government; and ſo they left the Nation engaged in a War abroad, and the Laws at War at home.</p>
            <p>But though the Nation be freed from the Tyranny
<pb facs="tcp:108084:4"/>
of the Rump, yet it ſtill labours under the miſerable effects of this Law; for with ſome few alterations it twice received the Royal Stamp, <hi>viz. 12 Car. 2. 18.</hi> and <hi>13 Car. 2. 14.</hi> As the terrour of this Law has put this Nation into a Hoſtile condition with the World, ſo hath it ſuſpended all thoſe good Laws made by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, for preſervation of the Timber of <hi>England,</hi> and the maintenance and ſupport of the Navy Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, whereby the Nation may be beſt ſecured from the danger of a forrein War. Your Highneſs at your leiſure may read how many other ways the Trade and Navigation of <hi>England</hi> have ſuffered under this Law, as well in the former Treatiſes, as theſe which now implore your Highneſs Protection.</p>
            <p>In this condition then was the Nation involved in a War with the Dutch, under the Glory and Conduct of your Highneſs (who though deſcended from the Royal Extraction of the firſt Monarch of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> yet is your Highneſs a Forreigner born, and ſo not regarded by theſe Laws, and therefore had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon to expoſe your ſelf to ſuch imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in defence of them, if your innate affection for the Honour and Happineſs of the Engliſh Nation did not otherways tranſcend all obſtacles againſt it.) The Nation, as well as his Majeſty, by a univerſal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, was ſatisfied with the neceſſity of your Conduct for the preſervation of it. I wiſh it were as well underſtood, that theſe Laws, and ſome other Grants and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages, have made the Dutch ſo powerful to oppoſe it, and the Nation in no better condition to preſcribe Laws to them.</p>
            <p>But Sir, the vertue of your Noble minde, is not
<pb facs="tcp:108084:4"/>
circumſcribed within the Pale of Military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but extends to an Integrity and Judgement in Counſel, equal to your Valour and Conduct in War. And the Nation ſtands not in leſs need of your Counſel at home, than it did of your Conduct abroad: for as the Caſe ſtands, though God ſhould have Crowned your Conduct with ſuch deſired ſucceſs, as to have obtained an entire Victory againſt the Dutch; yet could not this Nation, (the Trade and Navigation of it being reſtrained to Companies, and Engliſh-built Ships and Marriners) but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, reap the benefit from it. Your Highneſs is doubly qualified; ſo as the Nation may be happy in your Counſel, as your Highneſs is a Privy-Councellor to the King, and a Member of the Houſe of Peers. And if the Nation by your Counſel ſhall partake of thoſe benefits which the Enemies of it enjoy, this will be ſo much more an Eternal Monument of your never-dying Fame, by how much the difficulty of overcoming theſe Laws, and the prejudice of the times is more.</p>
            <p>To the vertues of your Noble Minde, is added your being born free from Subjection to theſe Laws; and ſo with more indifference your Highneſs may better judge between them and the Intereſt of the Nation, than another born in Subjection, and who by a long habit hath wonted to them.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder all theſe Attributes of your Highneſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, do theſe Humble Treatiſes implore your Protection, of all which they stand in need: For though one end deſigned by them is to procure Peace abroad, yet will they have a War at home with three ſorts of people: the Ignorant, Prejudiced, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.
<pb facs="tcp:108084:5"/>
I do not (God knows) ſully your High Name with Flattery, or private deſigne of mine own: nor could a leſs excitation than the Honour and Happineſs of the Nation have invited me to make this Humble Addreſs to your Highneſs. With a ſincere Heart then (ſo well as I am able) from cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes before known, from which all the Conſequences are inferred, I ſubmit theſe Treatiſes to your Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. If I fail in my end, yet I do not underſtand how otherways I could have ſo well attain'd it; and therefore hope it will in ſome meaſure plead a Pardon for this Preſumption in</p>

            <p>ALL men naturally deſire to know. By Knowledge here, I do not mean Intellective, Memorative, or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, (which God without any Humane Aſſiſtance endues man with, and can never be learned or taught) but Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal (which never comes to paſs but by Education, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Converſation.) And although all men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus deſire to know, and to be accounted Rational men; yet rarely do they ſubmit to thoſe Anxieties of minde which ever attend it. From whence it comes to paſs, that Books Rationally written are reſtrained to few Readers, and are commonly more beholden to ſubſequent Ages, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Times.</p>
            <p>Whereas Books which pleaſe theheat and humour of the Times, though they contain neither Truth, Learning, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are not therefore leaſt eſteemed, but Swarms of them are admired, and devoured in an inſtant; but theſe, like the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemeris</hi> (which, if you believe <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is be gotten of the Fire too) do die, and are forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a day.</p>
            <p>As all Learning and Reaſoning is ever attended by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſideration and Method; ſo Ignorance neglecting theſe, abounds in Pride and Suſpition, in both which ſhe claims ſuch a prerogative, that ignorant men ſo much more
<pb facs="tcp:108084:6"/>
cenſure and ſuſpect, by how much leſs they underſtand: They Triumph as Victorious in every Cenſure, and think they have prevented ſome deſigne by each ſuſpition. So that I do not queſtion but if <hi>Socrates</hi> out of the Duſt could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this preſent Age, he would perceive a generation of men, who leſs knowing, ſeem more wiſe than the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> did in his time.</p>
            <p>Since the publiſhing of the Reaſons of the decay of the Strength, Wealth, and Trade of <hi>England,</hi> and the encreaſe of the Dutch Trade, though I never heard or read one <hi>Propoſition</hi> confuted, or the method of Reaſoning contradicted; yet from ſeveral parts I have been cenſured, for deſigning to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the Church, and Academical Learning, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a Commonwealth, which is only capable of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Freedom of Trade and Religion, without which Trade can never be encreaſed. I will add one more (which in ſome ſenſe is true) that I may be accounted a buſie-body in medling with other mens buſineſs, which is a ſigne I have little of mine own; and that I contend againſt many opponents, and have but few or none who will ſecond me, or know I endeavour theirs or the Nations Intereſt; and therefore none but Fools will aſſert ſuch an Intereſt.</p>
            <p>For the laſt, I ſay, it may be the Fate of many hundred Younger Brothers, as well as my ſelf, that even Conſcience, in the late times, would not permit them to take any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; and it was too late to begin when the King was reſtored: yet it may be none but one in my Condition could have ſpent ſo much time in enquiring into the preſent State of <hi>England,</hi> compared with other Countries, as I have done: for mens buſineſs generally relates to their Individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; which is either Mechanical, where from unknown Cauſes, men by a habit in doing things get a Livelyhood; or by Learning in ſome Art or Science, to excel other men in Fortune and Reputation. Theſe they ſo intend, that their whole life is too little to anſwer the neceſſities of the one, or the deſires of the other: ſo that it is neceſſary for a third perſon to undertake a buſineſs of this nature.</p>
            <p>For my endeavouring to undermine Academical Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:108084:6"/>
I ſay, it is as free for me to oppoſe it, as it is for any man to defend it, and obſerve the method of Reaſoning I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. And I ſay moreover, that if any aſſerter of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or the Logick taught in our Univerſities, can give any one inſtance, that from the Authority or Learning of either, ever any progreſs of Learning in any Art of Science was propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in any one <hi>Propoſition,</hi> I will yield the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>I acknowledg I was by Gods Grace baptized a Chriſtian in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and have ever been ſo conſtant an obſerver of it, that in all the perſecutions of it, I never Communicated with any other: and I ſay, that all men are more obliged, in Conſcience as well as Gratitude, to give God publick praiſes with other men, who alike partake publick Benefits with them, than to give him private thanks for the private benefits they enjoy; for theſe are contained in the publick. So that if Religion be a Communion of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God publick Thanks (which muſt be preſcribed by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority) by many men, for publick benefits they all alike enjoy; as, that they are alike Chriſtians, and are protected by the King and Laws in their Lives and Fortunes; which differing in divers places, it is neceſſary the Religion or publick Worſhip of God ſhould be different.</p>
            <p>But though all Nations be not of the ſame Religion, yet all Nations ſubſiſt in Society and Commerce; and as every man ſtands in need of being ſupplied by another, ſo does e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Country. To reſtrain therefore the Society and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of Nations to thoſe of the ſame Religion, is to violate an Inſtitution of God in the conſervation of Humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to deny the benefits which places mutually receive from one another. Every man when he comes into any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Government, becomes ſubject to the Government of it, not to the Religion of it; and though God often puniſhed the Jews for not obſerving the Religion and Ceremonies he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them, yet for conſervation of Society and Commerce does he often pronounce great Judgments to them, if they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Stranger in the Land, though perhaps in leſs than paying Strangers duties. Nor did I ever read of any forrein people, who in any Country where they enjoyed a Religion
<pb facs="tcp:108084:7"/>
they were bred in, did make any diſturbance upon the account of it.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe (which I do not grant) that liberty of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to the Natives of a place be neceſſary for inlarging Trade and Commerce; yet is this more tolerable in a Monarchy than a Commonwealth: For Monarchy is one and Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and therefore diverſities or Factions in Religion can make no Confuſions in it; whereas Popular Governments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compounded of many, are eaſily obnoxious to both.</p>
            <p>Nor is it neceſſary that Trade and Commerce ſhould only flouriſh in Popular Governments; but within ſuch places where it is more free, and men are more ſecure, their Intereſts may be better advanced. This is evident, in that the State of <hi>Genoua</hi> impoſing 16 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon goods imported, made the Trade uneaſie; and the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> (who is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute a Prince as any with whom the Pope has to do) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the advantage of this Impoſition by the States of <hi>Genoua,</hi> did make <hi>Legorne</hi> a free Port, whereby it is now, under a Prince, become the moſt flouriſhing place of Trade within the <hi>Streights.</hi> And I have it from a good hand, that when the French King, about ſeven years ſince, made <hi>Marſeilles</hi> a free Port, the Jews in <hi>Legorne</hi> conſidering that <hi>Marſeilles</hi> was a better Harbour, and <hi>France</hi> a nobler Country for Trade than <hi>Italy,</hi> reſolved to leave <hi>Legorn,</hi> and eſtabliſh themſelves at <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> hereupon made an Edict, That in caſe any Chriſtian bought a Jews houſe, it ſhould be forfeit; and this kept the Jews conſtant to <hi>Legorne;</hi> where as in <hi>England</hi> if a Jew buys a houſe, it is forfeit to the King.</p>
            <p>I now deſire my <hi>Reader</hi> to conſider me in manifold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and to bear with the Imperfections, which I, or it may be any other man may be ſubject to in a work of much leſs moment than one of this kinde: For the Introduction of any buſineſs is more difficult than the progreſs. And I do not know of any which has made an attempt upon this Subject, in the differing parts of it, before me. I am alſo aſſured theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes will encounter many difficulties and diſcouragements. Difficulties in being oppoſed by the Ignorant and Intereſſed, (for many particular perſons may be intereſſed to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb facs="tcp:108084:7"/>
Detriment) and theſe are known, and many; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in contending for the Publique, I know not one who will be my Second. Beſides, no man can ſo eſtabliſh any Humane Action or Learning, but he muſt ſubmit the ends he deſignes to Gods Bleſſing; which in a Luxurious and Effeminate Age cannot reaſonably be expected: yet I am aſſured no man can juſtly accuſe me of any private deſigne of mine, or reward I propound to my ſelf, other than if it pleaſes God now or hereafter to bleſs me, ſo that theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes or any part of them, may be uſeful to my Country, or any one in it, I may thank God I have not ſpent all my life in vain.</p>

Mr. <hi>Mun</hi> in his Excellent Treatiſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. of <hi>Engliſh Treaſure by Forreign Trade,</hi> affirms it to be the onely expedient to encreaſe the Treaſure of the Nation; whereas it is demonſtratively apparent, that the Admiſſion of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners to purchaſe Lands in <hi>England</hi> will encreaſe it, and that more certainly and ſurely. I ſay this will more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreaſe the Treaſure of <hi>England;</hi> for it neceſſarily ſo much encreaſes it, as the Money expended in it does amount to: Whereas ſometimes the Merchant loſes by Forrain Trade, whereby the Nation, as well as Merchant, loſes of the Treaſure of the Nation. And in the Purchaſing of Land by Forreigners the Nation ventures nothing, and ſo cannot loſe any Treaſure or Land by it: whereas oftentimes the Ships and all the Lading is loſt in Forrain Trade, to the loſs of the Nation, and undoing the Merchant. But the Purchaſing Lands by Natives, does not encreaſe the Treaſure of <hi>England,</hi> but diverts ſo much Money from carrying on the beneficial Trades of <hi>England,</hi> as is expended therein; and many other Inconveniencies accrue to the Nation by it, which do largely appear in the <hi>Annot.</hi> upon the 3d <hi>Cor.</hi> of the 26 <hi>Prop.</hi> of <hi>the Equal Danger of the Church, State, and Trade of</hi> England.</p>

Every one of theſe Forreigners, and of their Family, will wear Clothes, Stockings, Shooes, and other neceſſaries, and furniſh their Houſes; whereby ſo much a greater Trade muſt enſue as the Forreigners are more; and ſo many poor people employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, who otherways can have no Employment. By the Rule of Contraries then, ſo many People as leave the Country to encreaſe other places, ſo much decreaſes the Trade of the Country, and encreaſes it in thoſe other places. And I appeal to any man who hath been converſant in the Country theſe laſt twenty years, whether he hath not found this to be ſo by Experience.</p>

And whereſoever the people are plentiful in Proportion to the Lands, they are Dear.

                        <p>If Lands be only Valuable as the Trade of the places is, It is unreaſonable then to have ſo many Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in reference to the Title and Security of the Lands of <hi>England,</hi> and none for the Trade of it, whereby they onely become Valuable.</p>

The <hi>Walloons</hi> whom <hi>Edw. 3d</hi> invited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> and taught our Engliſh the Myſtery of working the Manufactures of Cloath, were very inconſiderable in numbers to thoſe who now work them; ſo were the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> permitted to work in <hi>Norwich, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> and places thereabout, the Stuffs, Bayes, and Sayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are now wrought in them.

                        <p>As the Improvement of Woollen or any other Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture would thus be infinitely beneficial to the Nation, as the Improvement is more; ſo the loſing of Woollen, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Manufacture in <hi>England,</hi> will be equally miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to it. In the years 1636, 37, and 38. when Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical diſcipline was ſo ſeverely exacted, about two hundred Families left the Counties of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves at <hi>Leyden, Alkmare,</hi> and other places of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where they inſtructed the Dutch in the Woollen-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk.</hi> And I have heard Sir <hi>Charles Harbord</hi> (a perſon of great Wiſdom and Inſight in Forrein as well as the Intereſt of this Nation) ſay, that if all the Biſhopricks of <hi>England</hi> were ſold, and given to the Nation, it would not neer compenſate the loſs the Nation ſuſtained thereby.</p>

                        <p>So long as this pre-emption is continued, the beſt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can hope for, is, that the Inhabitants of the Nation cannot expect any further Employment, than the abilities of theſe Freemen can ariſe to. So that it will be impoſſible to enlarge our Forrein Trades of Woollen and other Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, beyond their abilities; or to conſerve the Forrein Trades we now enjoy of them, if by War or other accident, their abilities become leſs. And as the Retailers in Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations neither Labour, nor take care in labouring for the production of our Woollen and other Manufactures, but only how to impoſe upon the labourer and thoſe they ſell to: So theſe pre-emption-men, neither labour, take care in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, or to bring the Manufactures of <hi>England</hi> to their Corporations; yet not only the Artificer muſt be at their mercy in buying, but all the world in ſelling.

                        <p>In truth I have often admired, the <hi>German</hi> Empire and Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> ſhould give protection to <hi>Hamburg</hi> and <hi>Dantzick;</hi> for no member of the Empire or Kingdom is permitted to be ſupplied with Forrein Commodities, or to vend the Commodities of <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Poland</hi> in either place, but as they buy of, or ſell to the Burgers of them; which are Impoſitions as injurious as can be impoſed upon a Conquered Nation. And though <hi>Hamburg</hi> be otherwiſe a great Trading place to many places of the world by Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and very conſiderable in the <hi>Groenland-</hi>fiſhing; yet the Town of <hi>Dantzick</hi> hath little or no Trade, but their pre-emption of all ſorts of Forrein Commodities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Dutch and other Nations ſupply them, and they <hi>Poland;</hi> and by pre-emption of all the Commodities of

And as by this kinde of Trading we endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger our own Forrein Trade of our Manufactures, ſo we make room for the Dutch and other induſtrious Nations, who are not ſubject to the charges and reſtrictions we lie under; and fix and eſtabliſh Trades by theſe Commodities in other Countries, ſo much more as we charge or reſtrain ours.</p>

                        <p>About the middle of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, the State of that part of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> was in ſo flouriſhing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by reaſon of the Eaſt-land Trade, that Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> at the requeſt of the Inhabitants of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> built Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Mills at <hi>Bourn-Bridge,</hi> a mile from <hi>Ipſwich.</hi> When they were built, the Town proffered him 240 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> in caſe he would let them to the Town; but Sir <hi>Edward</hi> told them, at their requeſt he built them for a publick benefit, and ſo he would continue them.

                        <p>No creature endewed with leſs Preſcience than Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, can foreſee the miſchiefs the Act of Navigation brings upon the Nation by this reſtriction. For as every man ſtands of need of being ſupplied by another, ſo does every Country. No man ſhall ever be well ſupplied by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who will be only ſupplied by thoſe men who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately do things he needs, or by his own Servants: for the men who do the things I ſtand in need of, it may be are out of diſtance, or have no means to convey them to me. But when things are made convenient for Humane uſe, they are commonly ſent to the moſt probable place where they may finde a Market, and there men reſort to be ſupplied, and to ſell or exchange other things for them. For my part, I am no Merchant, and therefore cannot give thoſe inſtances which Merchants can hereof, in the Trade of the Nation; yet am I as morally aſſured of the reaſon of this <hi>Gorollary,</hi> as if I could give a Thouſand particular inſtances of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It was prov'd before a Committee of the Houſe of Commons, the 12 of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1668. That before the Rump-Parliament contrived the Act of Navigation, the Trade to <hi>Norway</hi> for Timber, Pitch and Tar, was generally driven by the Engliſh in Barter of our Manufactures, but then by Dollars, and the Treaſure of the Nation: and thoſe Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures which were exported into <hi>Norway,</hi> were rarely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported but by <hi>Norwegians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 That the Prices of <hi>Norway-</hi>Timber was become neer double.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That our own Timber was much waſted, by reaſon of the Dearneſs of the <hi>Norway-</hi>Timber.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That we had not built one Ship for that Trade ſince the Law, nor could ever hope to do, ſo long as it ſtood in force, becauſe a Forreign Ship might be built for half the price, and be more free for Trade; whereas the <hi>Norwegians</hi> had doubled their Ships, and built them twice as big, and encreaſed their Marriners from 600 to 6000, and yet Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108084:33"/>
to no place but <hi>England;</hi> whereby the Engliſh in a ſhort time would neceſſarily be excluded the Trade of <hi>Norway,</hi> unleſs they drive it by <hi>Norwegians</hi> and in <hi>Norway</hi> Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That the Engliſh were then almoſt wholly laid aſide, the Trade of <hi>Norway</hi> being generally driven by the <hi>Norwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> and in <hi>Norway</hi> Bottoms.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That the Engliſh were wholly left to the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>'s diſpoſing, whenever he pleaſed to impoſe any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuſes than were then complained of; which were, that the Engliſh ever ſince 1646, and by a Treaty made between the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> 1660, paid ⅘ of a Rix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dollar <hi>per Laſts</hi> for the growths of <hi>Norway;</hi> (except the Town of <hi>Bergen)</hi> but ſince the late War with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> they paid for Timber a Rixdollar and half <hi>per Laſt;</hi> for other growths a Rixdollar and ⅘; others 2 and ⅖; and for others 3 Rixdollars: and in meaſuring the Laſtage, the ſame Ships which before the War had their Meaſures adjuſted were raiſed ſome 35, others 40 <hi>Laſts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. That it was the Intereſt of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to make the Trade of <hi>Norway</hi> inſupportable to the Engliſh; for thereby the Act of Navigation did reduce the whole Trade to the <hi>Norwegians.</hi> As this ſucceſs attended this reſtriction by the Act of Navigation, in reference to the Trade of <hi>Norway,</hi> both for our Manufactures and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of <hi>Norway:</hi> So did it not much better ſucceed in the Trades of our Manufactures, and of the Hemp and Flax imported by the Dutch in exchange of them.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108084:33"/>
ſo cheap with Hemp and Flax, that the poor people upon the Eaſtern Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> and here in <hi>London,</hi> were able to make Cordage, Nets and Sails almoſt ſufficient to ſupply the Navigation and Fiſhing upon the Eaſtern parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and the returns of theſe by the Dutch, were chiefly for Clothes and other Manufactures and growths of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But the Act of Navigation not permitting the Dutch to import theſe; and the Engliſh having ſo loſt their Trade into the <hi>Sound;</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Riga, Revel,</hi> and other places of the <hi>Sound</hi> from whence the beſt Hemp and Flax comes, little Trading with us into <hi>England;</hi> and the Act of Navigation permitting the Dutch to import the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of Cordage, Nets and Sails,</p>

                        <p>It came to paſs, that as the Natives loſt a great exchange of their Woollen and other Manufactures for Hemp and Flax, ſo did many thouſands of poor people their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in making Cordage, Nets and Sails: Even the Town of <hi>Yarmouth</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> before the Act of Navigation, made yearly 2800 Tun of Cordage, now not ten.</p>
                        <p>And the fitting up of Ships with Cordage and Sails be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo dear, that in the year 1650, ſeveral perſons of good knowledge and experience in building Ships, and any ſelf built a Veſſel of 100 Tun, and fitted her out to Sea for 505 <hi>l.</hi> Four years after, the ſame Builder built another (both for the <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>Trade) of 110 Tum, and this Ship fitted out to Sea coſt above 800 <hi>l.</hi> And the reaſon of this dearneſs, the Builder aſcribed to the exceſſive prices of Pitch, Tar, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and Sails.</p>

                        <p>As the free buying our Woollen and other Manufactures of <hi>England</hi> will encreaſe the Trade of our Woollen and other Manufactures, whereby the Inhabitants will be ſo much more employed in them; ſo by Exchanging Goods for our Manufactures, we to our own enriching, add another employment to our People; and this ſo much more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the Money wherewith the Goods are bought, as the Goods become more valuable in other Manufactures than the Money. And therefore it is an errour in the Act of Navigation, to permit all Nations to import Money into the Nation, and to reſtrain the importation of Goods to the Engliſh and Natives: for if we did too much abound in Money, this would be a burthen to the Nation, and of ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the King and Subject. For if a man, as the caſe ſtands, may buy that for 100 <hi>l.</hi> which if Money were five-fold encreaſed, he ſhall pay 500 <hi>l.</hi> for it, he hath five times the trouble in it. And all Commodities being valued according to the plenty of Money, the Revenues of the Crown, and Leaſes granted by the Nobility, Gentry, and Church, would be but one fifth of the value, if the Money were five times more; for they muſt pay five times more for the Commodities renewed upon their Farms, and yet receive but the Rent at firſt reſerved when the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties bore but ⅕ of the Money. And therefore it was a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Inſtitution of Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi> (who being choſen Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> when from the <hi>Spaniſh Indies</hi> the Money became ſo plentiful in <hi>England,</hi> that the Members of the Univerſity could ſcarce buy Bread
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108084:37"/>
upon the Rents reſerved on their Leaſes) to have one third to be paid in Corn, or ſo much as the prices of Corn ſhould amount to in <hi>Cambridge</hi> market the Market-day before our <hi>Lady day</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas.</hi> And therefore if our Treaſure were more than our Neighbouring Nations, I did not care whether we had one fifth part of the Treaſure we now have.</p>
                        <p>I have often ſaid in Coffee-houſes, (and I am ſorry I could not finde a more convenient place in <hi>England</hi> to ſpeak it in) at the beginning of the War between the French and Dutch, That the French Nation would be exceedingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed thereby, and to the undoing of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the French: For the French Trade for Wines, Salt, Paper, Linnen, and other the Manufactures of <hi>France,</hi> was above all other Nations, carried on in Forrein Trade by the Dutch Navigation, whereby the Natives were employed, and the Kingdom and Natives exceedingly enriched: but the Dutch Navigation being removed by reaſon of the War, all theſe Commodities of <hi>France,</hi> which were Tranſported by the Dutch Navigation in Forrein Trade, finde not like vent; and by conſequence, the Nation loſes much of the wealth it gained thereby, and the Inhabitants their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nor is it in the power of <hi>France</hi> to redreſs this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtoring the Dutch Navigation: for admit the French King ſhould take meaſures by our Act of Navigation, (as they ſay he does) and endeavour to eſtabliſh a Forrein Trade of the Commodities of <hi>France</hi> by his own Subjects; and could make ſhips of Oyſter-ſhells and Shingle, and in an inſtant create Factories, and make all the returns the Dutch do of the Commodities of <hi>France;</hi> and without Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Inſtruction make Navigators and Marriners at his will, of his Subjects; yet ſo, many of his Subjects as he makes Sea-men, ſo many ſewet he will leave to plant Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, make Paper, Linnen, Salt, and other Commodities of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo much leſſen the Manufactures of <hi>France,</hi> as he encreaſes his Navigation.</p>
                        <p>But the Dutch War is but an accident of the time, and it is probable when the French King pleaſes, he may make Peace
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108084:38"/>
with the Dutch, and ſo reſtore the Dutch Navigation again to the trade of <hi>France.</hi> But alas! who can ever untwiſt the Treefold Cord of the Law againſt Naturalization, the Act of Navigation, and the Freedom of Corporations here in <hi>England!</hi> Each of theſe is more miſchievous to us here in <hi>England,</hi> than the Dutch-War is to <hi>France:</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> as it is a Kingdom above threefold greater than <hi>England,</hi> ſo in that proportion it is doubly more peopled, and therefore may much better endure the Sequeſtration of the Dutch Navigation, and eſtabliſh it upon the account of the French than we can; our Coaſt being almoſt deſolate, and ſo poor, that they can ſcarce maintain their poor; and ſo have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men nor Means to conſerve the little Trades they have, much leſs to encreaſe them; and the Country ſcarce half In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and ſo the Lands of <hi>England</hi> not half improved: and at this day I believe the Nobility and Gentry have above twenty thouſand Farms in their hands; and to take theſe from Husbandry, to people our Coaſt, and encreaſe our Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, will leave ſo many fewer in the Country; yet to Eternity, for ought is known, we muſt continue in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>

                        <p>Though Trade where the Commodities are conſumed to loſs, becomes ſo much more prejudicial, and impoveriſhes any place ſo much as ſuch conſumption is: And therefore as all beneficial Trades ought to be made free, and by all means encouraged; ſo it may ſeem reaſonable, that deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Trades where things are vainly conſumed, and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of our people hindred thereby, as are our Trades to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> for Wines; and to <hi>France</hi> for fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, Lace, Points; and the importation of Dutch Black Clothes, and French Hats and Druggets, whereby the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of our people is hindred, and ſo much of the Treaſure of the Nation exhauſted as is ſpent in our conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, ought totally to be prohibited; yet neerly looking into it, ſuch prohibition will prove dangerous to our Trade at home and abroad, and alſo to the Peace of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>For firſt, as every man ſtands in need of being ſupplied by another, ſo does every place; and therefore, if we ſhould prohibit the Importation of the Commodities of <hi>France,</hi> though it be evident the Nation conſumes them all to loſs, (except Salt and Sails) yet we cannot then but expect the French will likewiſe prohibit the Importation of our Welch Frizes, and <hi>Exeter</hi> Carſeys, Leather, Gloves, Ribbons, and ſeveral other Commodities; whereby the employment of all our Artificers in them, being taken away, they become miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and the Lands on which the Wools and the Cattle were renewed, become leſs valuable. The reaſon is the ſame, if we prohibit the Importation of Dutch Black Clothes, who take off many of our White Clothes, and other Manufactures of <hi>England. Secondly,</hi> If we prohibit the French Hats, Druggets, and Dutch Black Clothes, we put our ſelves and the World upon the Monopoly of having only ſuch as the Engliſh make, who will ſoon know the prerogative they enjoy hereby, and make the Engliſh pay more for worſe work than they did before, and make them ſo dear and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108084:39"/>
bad, that we ſhall eſtabliſh the Forrein Trade of ſuch things to the French and Dutch; whereas the Importation of theſe will be an Awe upon the Engliſh, to make ours ſo good and cheap, as to ſupply us and the world better, or they will loſe their employment. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Such Prohibition cauſes Ha<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Therefore, if my opinion were worthy to be admitted, no Goods of any ſort ſhould be Prohibited: but if any be imported which are Luxuriouſly conſumed, with little or no employment of the people, as the Wines imported are, they ſhould pay the King the full value in their conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but little or nothing, if they could be again Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: for the importation is beneficial to the Nation, by improving the Rents of Houſes, the employment of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Lading and Ualading, and in vending our Corn and Proviſion to the Importer. But if an employment may happen to the People of the Nation, if things were not imported, as in fine Linnen, Lace, Points, Blacks and Druggets, encouragement ſhould be given to all people to inſtruct ours in thoſe Manufactures; and ſuch duties for ſome time impoſed on the Importation, that better hopes might be expected here, than otherwiſe, in working them.</p>

                        <p>I ſay, this free admiſſion of Forreigners to import Goods into <hi>England,</hi> will more certainly enrich the Nation, than can be reaſonably expected by the returns of the Growths and Manufactures of <hi>England</hi> and our Plantations in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Trade. For the Nation is neceſſarily enriched ſo much, as the value of the Goods imported by Forreigners amounts to: Whereas the Merchant in return of Goods by Forrein Trade, is not ſo ſecure but he may become a loſer: or, if he or the Nation gains by the returns, yet the gain is no more than the value of the Goods returned exceed the value of the Goods Exported; which if 1/10, is very conſiderable; whereas the Nation entirely gains the value of the Goods imported by Forreigners. And in caſe the Merchant loſes the outward Fraught, or the returns of the Goods of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                           <pb n="51" facs="tcp:108084:40"/>
or our Plantations, the Nation loſes ſo much as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Goods amount to. But the Nation ventures nothing by the Importation of Goods imported by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, yet neceſſarily gains ſo much as the Goods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported amount to in value.</p>
                        <p>And herein I obſerve, that Goods being valuable as they can be vended, the places where they are vended generally receive greater benefit by the Intercourſe of People, and the varieties of Trades and Traders, than the places whereon the Goods are wrought and renewed. So that though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>London, Amſterdam, Hamburg, Legorne,</hi> and many other frequented places have little or no Good; of their own growth or Manufactures yet by reaſon of the frequencles of people, in many varieties of Trades, they receive much greater benefit than the places on which the Goods are wrought and renewed. And I ſee no reaſon but if the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of Goods were as free in <hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>Holland, Zealand, Hamburg, Gottenburg, Legorne,</hi> &amp;c. but that our Ports might be as rich and flouriſhing as theſe; and ſo much more, as ours are better, and more convenient.

                        <p>As this free Importation of forrein Goods, will ſo much enrich the Nation, as the goods imported are more; ſo it may ſo much encreaſe the forrein Trade of our Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Plantations, and of the fiſh caught upon our Coaſt, as the goods imported are more. The Dutch, we ſee, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting <hi>French</hi> Wines, Brandy, and Salt, and exporting them with their Fiſh, Woollen Manufactures, and Spice, ſend yearly 1500 Sail of Ships into the <hi>Sound;</hi> and forty to <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> whereas we, though our Woollen Manufactures are better, and it may be, if we had thoſe Trades, might be ſold cheaper, yet in a year we ſend not above ſeven into the <hi>Sound,</hi> (two whereof are Laden with Woollen Manufactures, the other five with Balaſt only, which pay for their Lading commonly by Money upon Bills of Exchange from <hi>Hamburg)</hi> and to

Beſides, the great Exportation of many other Commodities to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and places in the <hi>Sound,</hi> eſtabliſhes ſo great a Commerce with the Dutch, that thoſe people ſupplied by them, dare not buy Woollen Manufactures of others who cannot ſupply them with other Neceſſaries.

                  <p>THus by freedom of working our Woollen and other Manufactures, and by the benefit of free Importing and Exporting Forrein Commodities with them in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Trade, the <hi>Reader</hi> may underſtand how many ways the Nation may be Strengthened, Enriched, and poor people employed; whereas by reſtraining and unneceſſary charging theſe, we weaken and impoveriſh the Nation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn many thouſands of people to Miſery and Poverty, and eſtabliſh all the benefits we might enjoy, in other places, to the endangering the Trade and Employment of people we now poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p>I know nothing worſe reſented in our Parliaments, or in ordinary Diſcourſe, than Monopolies, and that deſervedly; for they render the Ingenuity and Induſtry of many people uſeleſs, and the Improvement of any new Invention for the publick more difficult; whilſt the Monopoliſts do things dearer, and worſe. Therefore I wiſh that encouragement were given to Inventors of any beneficial Myſtery any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way than by Patent of the ſole uſe for fourteen years: for by that means the uſe of it becomes leſs and dearer to us, and may be more uſeful and cheaper to other Nations who do not Monopolize it, whereby they may enjoy more benefit by it than can be hoped for by us.</p>
                  <p>But if a Monopoly be the reſtraining, the doing, or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding things excluſive to other men, I do not underſtand, but the reſtraining the benefit of the Improvement of the Growths and Manufactures of <hi>England</hi> to the Natives, is a Monopoly to all the world beſides. And the reſtraining
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108084:48"/>
the free exercife of Arts and Myſteries in any Manufacture to the Freemen of Corporations, is a Monopoly to all the Nation befides: ſo is the forrein Trade by Companies, of our Growths and Manufactures, excluſive to other men, a Monopoly to the World, as well as Nation: and the pre-emption of Freemen, a Monopoly and grievous to both. And the reſtraining the vending the Growths and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of <hi>England</hi> in forrein Trade, and to make returns into <hi>England</hi> only in Engliſh-built Ships, and Sailed by ¾ Engliſh, is a Monopoly to both Trades: So is the vending Cattle to the Eaſtern and Southern parts of <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Scots,</hi> Northern and Weſtern people of <hi>England,</hi> excluſive to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> a Monopoly.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak this only in reference to Trades which are benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, eſpecially thoſe which more depend upon Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of people at home: For it is advantageous in Trades which impoveriſh and debauch the people, to have them driven by few, and in Companies, and thoſe reſtrained both to managing the Trades, and the prices of the things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; as in the Trades for French Wines and Brandies, <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wines and Fruits, and all ſorts of fine Linnen, Lace, and Ribbons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are conſumed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us: for by this mean, ſo much cheaper as they are imported and reſtrained, ſo much more the Nations Wealth and Stock is preſerved. Before 1641, the <hi>Canary</hi> Trade was managed by a Company, the Prices were ſet, and the Wines imported were in Barter of our Commodities, ſo as the Nation was not conſiderably damnified by that Trade. But aſter that Trade by the Company was left, the Vintners in <hi>London,</hi> to get the Flowers (as they call them) of thoſe Wines, outbid one another ſo high, that the prices became near double; and rather than loſe them, they would pay in the <hi>Canaries</hi> ready Money. And ſo we loſt the Barter of our Commodities for them to boor: but as well in the Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial as Hurtful Trades of the Nation, we invert the means by which thoſe may be more improved, and theſe rendred leſs hurtful: For almoſt all the outward Trades of our Growths and Manufactures are managed by Companies
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108084:49"/>
clogged with pre-emption of Freemen: But the inward Trades of <hi>French, Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wines and Fruits, and of fine Linnen, Ribbons, Lace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which are all conſumed among us, are driven at large by any Engliſh, or other people of thoſe places who will import them.</p>
                  <p>And as by our Monopolizing Trade we reſtrain the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of our people, and the Wealth and Strength of the Nation to what the Monopoliſts pleaſe; ſo we had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter charge Lands 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> than the forrein Trade of our Manufactures two: For Lands are only valuable as our Trades, eſpecially Forrein, are valuable: and therefore, in caſe we could doubly encreaſe the forrein. Trade of our Woollen and other Manufactures, our Lands would be of double the value; whereas in caſe we charge the forrein Trade of our Woollen and other Manufactures two <hi>per Cent.</hi> above another place, we endanger the whole, and fix the Trade in that other place.

                  <head>PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O Introduce a happy Reign, Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> before ſhe called a Parliament, fitted up and repaired her Navy Royal, ſo as it was far ſuperiour to any other; this gave her Reputation at home, and Fame abroad: And well knowing how highly the ſafety of her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects did depend upon conſerving the Soveraignty of the <hi>Britiſh Seas,</hi> though afterwards ſhe protected the Infant Dutch States, to give a check to the growing <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Greatneſs, yet would ſhe never permit the Dutch to build ſuch Men of War, as thereby to be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to queſtion her Dominion in the Seas which beat upon the Engliſh Shores. And it is ſaid, that when <hi>Henry</hi> the great of <hi>France,</hi> after the Peace of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins,</hi> deſigned to enlarge the Dominion of <hi>France</hi> as well by Sea as Land, ſhe forhad his building great Ships, or ſhe would fire them in his Harbours; whereupon this great Monarch did deſiſt.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>James,</hi> however he loved Peace, did rightly judge he could no way ſecure it ſo well, as by forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ſtrength of his Navy Royal; and to that
<pb facs="tcp:108084:51"/>
left by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he added the <hi>Prince Royal,</hi> the <hi>Old James,</hi> and ſeveral others.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, (a Prince of Sacred me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) not knowing where the ſwelling Dutch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation would end, and how much it might tend to the diminution of his Honour, and endangering the ſafety of his Subjects, judged it neceſſary for conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of both, yet further to enlarge his Navy, yet was unhappy, that his Subjects did not, or would not, rightly underſtand him in it. This was a Navy ſo Invincible to any Humane Power, that though Sir <hi>William Batten</hi> in 1648, carried a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of it to his now Majeſty; yet with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of it, and the <hi>Speaker</hi> and <hi>Warwick</hi> Frigats, (one of the third rate, the other of the fourth rate) conjoyned with ſome Hired Merchants-ſhips, the Rump-Parliament in 1651, 1652, and 1653, without difficulty overcome the Dutch in all Fights, and had without doubt ſubdued them, if <hi>Oliver</hi> had not firſt turned them out, and after in 1654, made an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled and diſhonourable Peace with the Dutch. The Dutch ſecured by this Peace, to prevent the Ruine of their State by another War with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, immediately built much larger and more Men of War than they had; which could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from <hi>Oliver,</hi> who encreaſed the Engliſh Fleot with many more and very conſiderable men of War. And after the King's Reſtauration, before the next Dutch War in 1664, the King added many more, ſo as the Engliſh Navy Royal was more than twice as formidable as it was when the Rump Engaged the Dutch. But the Dutch having greater quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and more choice of Timber, and many more
<pb facs="tcp:108084:51"/>
Builders than could be found in <hi>England,</hi> though the experience the Engliſh acquired in Naval fights with the Dutch in the former War were much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, yet could not the Engliſh obtain ſo eaſie a Victory as before: and at this time, it is ſaid, the Dutch have above 50 Men of War more than the King has, and of equal, if not greater Bulk in the main; and above 2500 pieces of Cannon.</p>
                  <p>The Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and much more the French King, Alarm'd by this encreaſe of the Engliſh and Dutch Fleets, in proportion enlarged theirs; ſo that the French Fleet is in number, and bigneſs Superior to the Engliſh; but by reaſon of want of Mariners, none of them is comparably ſo formidable. But becauſe Ships without Mariners, and Mariners without Ships, ſignifie but little in War, let us ſee from what Cauſes the Dutch are become ſo formidable to the Engliſh by Sea, above the <hi>French, Dane,</hi> or <hi>Swede.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had fitted and repaired the Navy Royal (as has been ſaid) in the firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of her Reign, <hi>chap. 13.</hi> ſhe enlarged the Trade of the Nation, by permitting the Engliſh to Trade in any Veſſels, paying Strangers Duties: as this encreaſed the Trade of the Nation, ſo did it Mariners, whereby her Navy might be more and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupplied by them.</p>
                  <p>This paying ſtrangers Duties for Goods Imported into <hi>England,</hi> was the principal cauſe the Dutch found an eaſie Foundation of their future great Trade and encreaſe of Mariners above what could be employed from the Ports of <hi>England:</hi> For about fourteen years after the Dutch Government began to
<pb facs="tcp:108084:52"/>
Bud int o States; and being preſſed in their Wars againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> permitted all Nations to Import and Export Goods, paying ſmall Duties; whereby they became enabled, not only to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Returns of the Fiſhing Trade to many other parts of the World, but of French Wines, Salt, Clothes from <hi>England,</hi> and many other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from <hi>Germany</hi> and other places, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other Trades upon the returns of theſe; whereas the payment of Strangers Duties upon Goods Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into <hi>England,</hi> neceſſitated a Conſumption of them here; and ſo the outward Trade and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns became impoſſible to us, and by conſequence the employment of all thoſe Mariners who depended upon them.</p>
                  <p>This Liberty and ſmalneſs of Duties upon Goods Imported and Exported by the Dutch in Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi>'s Reign, ſwell'd the Dutch Trade out of the bounds of <hi>Europe</hi> into the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> which afterwards in the Reigns of King <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt became incredibly encreaſed.</p>
                  <p>Whereas, notwithſtanding the Liberty granted to the Engliſh by the <hi>1 Eliz. 13.</hi> the Engliſh being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Fiſhing Trade, by reaſon of paying ſuch great Duties upon Goods imported for Fiſh vended in forrein Trade above the Dutch; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of her Reign, the people upon the Coaſt expecting to reap a greater benefit by the <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>trade, deſerted the Fiſhing Trade in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein parts for white Herring, Ling and Cod; which being preſently poſſeſſed by the Dutch, they thereby ſo much encreaſed their Mariners and Navigation, as the Engliſh became loſers in both. And this was ſo
<pb facs="tcp:108084:52"/>
much more pernicious to the Engliſh, by how much the Fiſhing Trade was diffuſed generally from the Eaſtern Ports of <hi>England,</hi> and all ſorts of people employed in it; whereas the <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>trade is driven but by few, and none but younger men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in it.</p>
                  <p>The Loſs of the forreign Trade for Fiſh from the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> was not ſenſibly perceived in King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, by reaſon of the encreaſe of the <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>trade, and of the Spaniſh Trade, whereof the Engliſh became upon the matter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, by the Peace the King made with <hi>Spain;</hi> and alſo about the middle of his Reign the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi> and <hi>Virgina-</hi>Trade became conſiderable, and the Trade of the Engliſh to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> was much encreaſed, whereby the Nation became incredibly enriched, more than it was in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, or in any other Prince's before her.</p>
                  <p>The Seeds of theſe Trades thus laid in King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, ſprung up exceedingly in King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign; and the Plantations of <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi> were added to thoſe of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> and <hi>Barbadoes:</hi> But in the mean time the Dutch encreaſed their Trades to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> into the <hi>Baltick,</hi> up the <hi>Elb,</hi> to <hi>Turky</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> ſo that I cannot tell whether we employed more Mariners by encreaſing our Weſtern Plantations, or loſt the employment of more in the Trades which the Dutch ſought to ſupplant us in.</p>
                  <p>The War breaking out in 1641, between the King and Parliament, ſtreightned the Engliſh from fully ſupplying the Eaſt-Country and <hi>Germany</hi> with Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufactures; whereupon the Engliſh upon the
<pb facs="tcp:108084:53"/>
matter have loſt the Trade into the <hi>Sound,</hi> and the Mariners their Employment; and the Trade up the <hi>Elb</hi> is much reduced. And the Murther of the King in 1648, extinguiſhed that part of the Trade to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> which the Dutch had left for the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſhare.</p>
                  <p>And as the Act of the <hi>1 Eliz. 13.</hi> did ſo much preſerve the Engliſh Timber, by how many more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Veſſels were employed and bought by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; and the 35 of <hi>Eliz. 11.</hi> was purpoſely made for further preſervation of it: ſo the Terrour of the Act of Navigation hath made both theſe wholſome Laws ineffectual to the Nation, and to the charge of Duties upon Goods imported into <hi>England,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the dearneſs of Shipping to it of about ⅓; ſo that all thoſe Trades which could not overcome theſe Charges became loſt to the Nation, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the employment of thoſe Mariners which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon them.</p>

Mariners, the Engliſh Navy Royal may become as little formidable to them, as the <hi>French, Dane,</hi> and <hi>Swede</hi> are to us: Eſpecially now the Dutch can build twenty men of War, and of equal Dimenſions, to one the King of <hi>England</hi> can, and in leſs time; and have above tenfold the Mariners the Engliſh have, whereof fivefold are Mariners whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt purely depends upon the Dutch Government; whereas the Mariners of <hi>England</hi> (now the Trade between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> is loſt) have little or no dependence upon the Nation, in all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Trades of it, and to our Plantations: but in caſe the Dutch, or any other Nation will give them better pay, it is our Mariners Intereſt to ſerve them.</p>

                        <head>Annot.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Britain</hi> being an Iſland, and ſo as another World divided from the Continent, the encreaſe of Navigation and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is more proper to it and deſirable, than where the Sea lies but on part of the bounds of the Country: and this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe is ſo much more deſirable, by how much the Coaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with many Excelling and Noble Ports, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Naturally watred with Rivers more apt for Navigation than any other, and which through thoſe loſe themſelves in the Ocean. But Navigation and Marriners cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe encreaſed, than from ſuch Principles as God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has ordained. Trade therefore being a Principle to Navigation, is ſuperiour and more excellent than it, and may ſubſiſt without Navigation; but Navigation never without Trade. A Nation may be rich and flouriſhing by Trade, yet upon the Navigation of other Countries. The great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which <hi>France</hi> lately enjoyed, did ariſe chiefly from the Engliſh and Dutch Trading into their Ports. So <hi>Legorne</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> grow rich by the Trade which the Engliſh French, and Dutch Navigation bring into <hi>Legorne.</hi> So it is in the <hi>Turkie, Eaſt Indie,</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Trades, by the Engliſh, French, Dutch, and Venetians, whereby thoſe Countries grow vaſtly rich, yet employ no Shipping or Navigation to procure it.</p>
                        <p>Trade being a principle to Navigation, Navigation may be infinitely encreaſed, as Trade is encreaſed: I deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Navigation to and from the Ports of <hi>England</hi> might be encreaſed by the forrein Trade of our Woollen and other Manufactures, rather than by the <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>trade, or the Trade to our Plantations: For the home-vent of the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle-</hi>trade employs few of the Natives but Miners and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nners, and thoſe but half the year, and is driven to the loſs of the Nation: for we conſume the Coals; and beſides the Conſumption of our Timber in the Shipping in this Trade, we generally buy the Pitch, Tar, Cordage and Sails employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, of the French, Dutch, Swedes, and Norwegians.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108084:56"/>
Add hereto, that this Trade has cauſed, vaſt deſtruction of the Wood-land-Grounds of the Eaſtern, Southern and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land parts of <hi>England;</hi> which by reaſon of the plenty and cheapneſs of <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>Coals, can finde no vent. Whereas Navigation, which would ariſe from the forrein Trade of our Woollen and other Manufacturers, would ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the Nation, as the value of the Manufactures is more than the Principles of them are in value. And I prefer the Navigation which may ariſe from encreaſing our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures at home, before that Navigation which ariſes from our Trades to our Plantations; becauſe the Nation hereby would be more and better peopled, and the Lands of the Crown, Church, Nobility, Gentry and others of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> would become ſo much more valuable, as Trade and Navigation would be hereby encreaſed: whereas the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions rob us of our people, to the weakning the Nation, and diminiſhing the value of the Lands of it; and that beſides Mariners, few people in <hi>England</hi> except Retailers, Sugar-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Porters, and Car-men, are employed in the Trades of them. And the Riches which ariſe by the Trade of them, accrews to few but the King, Merchant, Sugar-bakers, and Retailers. And I do not queſtion, but the value of the Conſumption of the Commodities of the Plantations here in <hi>England,</hi> is much more than the profit of them by forrein Trade: And yet we have little elſe but the forrein Trade of our Woollen Manufactures, ſo Taxed, ſo Reſtrained, and ſo Endangered, as hath been in all the Three precedent Treatiſes demonſtrated, to ſuſtain the Loſs the Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives by the <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>trade, the Trade to our Plantations, and the Trades to <hi>Norway France,</hi> the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and for Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen.</p>
                        <p>I deſire as much as any man, that Navigation and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may be encreaſed by the Natives of <hi>England,</hi> and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Ships, ſo far as the Natives of <hi>England</hi> in ſuch Shipping can maintain Navigation, yet both muſt be done in time, and by ſuch means as God and Nature have ordained, <hi>viz.</hi> by encreaſing Trade in <hi>England:</hi> and if both Trade and Navigation cannot be carried on by the Natives alone, I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108084:57"/>
ſee no reaſon why (at leaſt at preſent) Trade (which is more excellent than Navigation) ſhould not be encreaſed, though upon the account of forrein Navigation. And I ſay, it is impoſſible, as the caſe ſtands, that the forrein vent of our Engliſh Manufactures, and the Fiſh caught upon the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> can be encreaſed by Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Mariners in Engliſh-built Ships: For the Towns upon the Coaſt of <hi>England</hi> generally are become ſo decayed, that they are not neer half Inhabited; and ſo poor, that they have no Means to build Ships, or to buy our Woollen or other Manufactures, or the Fiſh caught upon our Coaſt; nor have Factories or Correſpondence in forrein parts to eſtabliſh Trade and Commerce: yet if they had, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible long to continue the Navigation we now poſſeſs in Engliſh-built Ships, therefore leſs poſſible to encreaſe it.</p>
                        <p>It's believed, the French Nation, before their War with the Dutch, gained above 6000000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly by the Engliſh and Dutch trading into their Ports, for Wine, Salt, Brandy, Linnen, Paper, and other Commodities of <hi>France:</hi> Suppoſe the French King upon the account of encreaſing the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and Mariners of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould have excluded the Engliſh, and Dutch trading into his Ports, and by Edict have Commanded, that all the Commodities of <hi>France</hi> ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in forrein Trade, ſhould firſt be brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> there none to buy them but Free-men and Companies, (if they have any) and they only to vend them in French-built Ships, and Sailed by ¾ French, whether they have Ships or Mariners or not; and that the Returns of them ſhould pay the King twenty times the Duties they ſhould in caſe they were imported into <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Hamburg:</hi> whether the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the Shipping and Mariners of <hi>France</hi> would have countervailed the loſs <hi>France</hi> would have ſuſtained thereby? Or <hi>Reader</hi> conſider (chainging the places) if this be not the Condition of <hi>England,</hi> in reference to the forrein Trade of the Manufactures, and the Fiſh caught up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coaſt of it.</p>

                        <p>I ſay, this free admiſſion of Forreigners to inhabit in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in any Veſſels to fiſh and Trade into forrein parts with Fiſh caught upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> may encreaſe the Navigation of <hi>England;</hi> for thereby their Intereſt being planted in the Nation, it would enjoy the fruits of their Trade and Navigation.

by the niggardly Trades we now enjoy, (whereby we can do little more than conſume in <hi>England</hi> the Returns of our Manufactures, and the Product of our Plantations) that it is not long poſſible by it to maintain theſe Trades; therefore leſs poſſible by it to eſtabliſh the Fiſhing Trade, which, it may be, will require more Shipping than we now employ in all the Trades we drive in the World. Or in caſe we had quantities of Timber ſufficient for carrying on the Fiſhing Trade, yet would it be of no benefit to us in this Trade: for the Fiſh coſt nothing but the catching, and the Hull of a Veſſel for the Fiſhing Trade or Fiſhery, may be built for ⅔ of what one of equal dimenſions can be built in <hi>England;</hi> and thoſe built of Engliſh Timber are ſo heavy, that they require ½ more Sails and Cordage to fit them up, and ſo more Hands to manage them; whereby it becomes impoſſible to the Engliſh to Fiſh and Trade ſo cheap as the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Hamburger.</hi> Nor is this Miſchief (as the caſe ſtands) poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be remedied by Veſſels built of forrein Timber in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for by reaſon of the high Duties upon it, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages the <hi>Norwegians</hi> have by impoſing their own Terms upon us, the Engliſh at this day pay 30 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> more for Timber imported, than the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Hamburgers</hi> do.</p>

                        <p>But to attain to this in <hi>England,</hi> it will not be only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary freely to import Pitch, Tar, Ruff Hemp and Flax, and Timber; but alſo to permit all forrein Ship-wrights to inhabit, and have equal freedom to exerciſe their Profeſſions in all convenient places in <hi>England</hi> for building Ships; for no man is born an Artificer, but it comes to paſs by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Labour, and Experience: and the Engliſh are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted in building Buſſes for the Fiſhing Trade, and in building ſhips for the <hi>Norway</hi> or <hi>Groenland</hi> Trades, and many other. The Dutch build ſhips for all Trades accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the beſt convenience: we only know how to build Men of War; and our ſhips for other Trades are of like figure, whether it be convenient or not.</p>

                        <p>From hence it is, that the Engliſh are not able ſo to build one Buſs or Veſſel for the Fiſhery and forrein Trade of White Herring caught upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as to turn to profit; or for the <hi>Groenland</hi> Fiſhery and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Trade of it, or for the <hi>Norway</hi> Trade: But Trading in <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>ſhips to <hi>Norway,</hi> and the ſhips being dear and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108084:68"/>
for that Trade, enables the <hi>Norwegians</hi> to impoſe like Rates upon us for Pitch, Tar, and Timber, as the Engliſh can import theſe in thoſe dearer and more inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Ships they are reſtrained to.</p>
                        <p>The King's Duties, and employment of Engliſh Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are oppoſed to this free Importation of Pitch, Tar, Ruff Hemp, Flax, and Timber. For the Kings Duties, upon an enquiry, about four years ſince, I found the King's Duties for Pitch, Tar, Ruff Hemp and Flax imported, did amount to about 1600 <hi>l. per Annum:</hi> and if the payment of Searchers and other Officers of the Cuſtom-houſe were deducted, perhaps not 1000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> came clear to the King: So that if the whole Duties hereof were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the Revenue of the Crown would not be hereby much diminiſhed. It is true, the King's Duties for Timber im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported ſince the burning the City of <hi>London,</hi> are conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet not ſo to the King, for it is Farmed out, and the Farm to the King is (as I am informed) 6000 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> whereas, if the inward Freight of theſe were as cheap as into <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Hamburg,</hi> beſides the employment of our people, the King's Duties, by the greatneſs of the Trade, might be ſo much more, as the Trade is greater; and the King ſave more, by the cheapneſs of Timber, in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and repairing his Men of War and Palaces, than now his Revenue for Timber amounts to.</p>
                        <p>In the employment of our Mariners to import Ruff Hemp and Flax, two Conſiderations ariſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ships and Mariners employed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. The number of ſhips employed (ſo well as I can learn) are about nine, whereof two are fraught out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with Cony-skins and Woollen Manufactures; the other ſeven take Bills of Exchange from <hi>Hamburg,</hi> and have no outward Lading but Ballaſt: ſo that the number of Ships being nine, allowing thirteen Men to every ſhip, and the Voyage to <hi>Dantzick, Queenborough, Riga, Revel,</hi> and <hi>Narve</hi> to be four Moneths, the whole amounts to 117 Mariners, who being employed but ⅓ of the year, the conſtant employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 39 Mariners is equivalent to it. But if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108084:68"/>
the employment, the outward Voyage of ſeven of theſe ſhips is loſt time to the Mariners, and loſs to the Nation in the Ware and Tare of the Ships for want of a Freight, and ſo much more as the Hemp and Flax is bought with ready Money, for want of Goods to exchange for them. So I leave it to any to judge, whether the employment of 39 Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, whereof above 30 are not only in half of their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment idly employed, but to the loſs and impoveriſhing the Nation, be comparable to the conſtant employment of (it may be) above 100000 people, by the free importation of Pitch, Tar, Ruff Hemp, Flax and Timber, in building ſhips, and in the Manufactures of Ropes, Nets and Sails.</p>

                        <p>This permiſſion will increaſe Navigation to and from the Ports of <hi>England;</hi> ſo will the Returns of theſe, and expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them again, and ſo infinitely. And in all theſe Trades and Navigations, the forrein Trades of our Manufactures and Growths, and Fiſh caught upon our Coaſts, will receive this benefit, that if any part of the World wants any of theſe Goods, and but in a little meaſure ſtand in need of our Goods, theſe Goods of ours may finde forrein vent, which otherwiſe would not of themſelves pay the charge of the Voyage. This permiſſion alſo would create a conſtant Trade and Navigation to and from the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> whereby the people upon the Coaſt, and from all parts of <hi>England,</hi> would finde a conſtant employment, &amp; infinite other benefits would accrue hereby to the Country and Lands of <hi>England,</hi> in Victualling Ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which can neither be foreſeen or enumerated.</p>
                        <p>This King's Duties, and the employment of Engliſh Ships and Mariners, are uſually oppoſed to this Permiſſion. But the Oppoſition is without conſideration of the nature of Trade, the King's Revenue, or Navigation: For Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a principle to the King's Revenue, and Navigation which depends upon it; both the King's Revenue and Navigation may be infinitely increaſed, as the forrein Trades of the Nation, or the forrein Trade of other Commodities driven from the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> are increaſed. But if men begin at the Conſequences, <hi>viz.</hi> the King's Revenue and Navigation, and Tax Trade higher than it can bear; or reſtrain it only to ſuch Ships, ſo that Trade hereby becomes loſt, ſo does the King's Revenue, and the Navigation.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe of the Importance of it, we will therefore more intently compare the Loſs the King ſhall receive by this Permiſſion, and what will be the damage of our Engliſh Navigation and Mariners; and if any be to either, whether it may not be otherways over-ballanced.</p>
                        <p>Herein I ſay, that this permiſſion of Forreigners to inhabit
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108084:71"/>
and Fiſh from the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> and to vend their white Herring in forrein Trade, and to import and export all ſorts of forrein Commodities, and make Returns into the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> will not diminiſh the Kings Revenue, though they paid no Duties; nor the employment of Engliſh Ships and Mariners, for we employ no Shipping or Mariners in it, nor hath the King any Revenue thereby: whereas by it the King's Revenue would be hereby ſo much increaſed, as the conſumption of Beer, Ale, and all other Exciſeable Commodities are more; and our Engliſh Mariners, in all outward and inward Voyages, may finde employment. I do not believe (unleſs it be for French Wines imported and conſumed in <hi>England)</hi> the King's Duties imported and exported out of <hi>Harwich-</hi>Haven (from whence all the Trade the Dutch drive in the Eaſt and North-Eaſt, might be better driven, than from all the Ports of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands)</hi> amount to 300 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> Nor do we employ one Veſſel or Mariner to any part of the World from thence, upon the forrein Trade of Goods imported: Even the Town of <hi>Tarmouth</hi> (which we ſo much boaſt of) is ſo far from carrying on any Trade upon this account, that, I am told, they cannot ſupply any part of the World with a piece of <hi>Norwich-</hi>ſtuff, though the Navigation between <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> and them be very commodious. Is it not a ſhame then, that ſuch prodigious Trades and Navigations upon this account ſhould from the other ſide of the Water be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from worſe and more incommodious Harbours, whileſt we employ not one Veſſel or Mariner in any of them? And what is affirmed of <hi>Yarmouth</hi> and <hi>Harwich,</hi> I believe, is as true of all the other Ports of <hi>England,</hi> except <hi>London.</hi> As <hi>Harwich</hi> is of all others the moſt opportune and excellent Harbour for the Eaſt and North-Eaſt parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> ſo is <hi>Falmouth</hi> for the South, South-Eaſt, Weſt and South-Weſt parts of the World. I cannot tell what the King's Duties for Goods imported there yearly ariſe to; nor whether within the Harbour there be any good Towns for reception of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and Storehouſes for Goods: But I think I may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, that in all Chriſtendom is not ſo healthful and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108084:72"/>
delicate a place for Warehouſes and reception of Merchants as <hi>Ipſwich</hi> is: the Town ſo clean, though an even Level, that after the greateſt Rains in the depth of Winter, a man in Slippers may walk the Town over without wetting his Feet: And though Ships of 200 Tun burthen may come up to the Key, yet every Street is watered with the pureſt and ſweeteſt Water of any place I ever came in. To theſe may be added, that ſtanding in the Boſome of the moſt Fertile County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which conjoyns with the no leſs Fertile County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> it is, or, I am ſure might be ſupplied with all ſorts of Proviſions by Land equal to any other. And if theſe two Ports were made free for Importation and Exportation of Goods by all Nations, and the ſame Revenue continued to the King; and that it were free for all people to inhabit in <hi>England,</hi> and to Fiſh, and Trade with Fiſh into forrein parts, and make Returns into <hi>England;</hi> I ſhould be content the reſt of the Ports of the Nation ſhould enjoy their Priviledges ſo long as they pleaſed. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> made <hi>Gottenburgh</hi> free but for ſeven years, which has made it the moſt flouriſhing Town for Trade in the North-Eaſt: So did the Duke of <hi>Florence Legorne,</hi> whereby it excels all other Ports in the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> yet neither of theſe any ways comparable in any reſpect to <hi>Falmouth</hi> or <hi>Ipſwich.</hi> But if this cannot be had, I muſt ſubmit; yet I hope it will not be urged, it will be to the detriment of the King's Revenue, or hinder the Engliſh Navigation, or employment of our Mariners.</p>
                        <p>Another Objection made againſt the free permiſſion of Forreigners to import Goods, is, that the greateſt Returns which the Dutch make from <hi>Dantzick,</hi> is in Corn; whereby they ſupply their own neceſſities; which in caſe it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into <hi>England,</hi> would make a glut here, and bring down the prices of our Lands. To this I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Dutch do not onely hereby ſupply themſelves plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, ſo as the prices of Corn are conſtant and reaſonable, and ſo as whatever happens in other places, they never fear a Famine; but alſo upon all occaſions ſupply other places with Corn, ſo as a Famine or ſcarcity of Corn becomes their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108084:72"/>
whereas we are never at any certainty in the prices of our Corn; but if a plentiful year happens, whereby Nature has disburthened her ſelf of more than ſhe can renew the future year, the Tenants are neceſſitated to vend it abroad at low prices, to pay their Rent; and when the dear year ſucceeds, it may be we pay double for the ſame Corn again. And I ſay alſo, it is Plenty in all things which makes Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore wherever Corn is plentiful, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the people or Market, it will be cheaper. But in caſe our Towns in the Mediterrane parts of <hi>England</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with all ſorts of Artificers, and the Ports of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> abounded with the Dutch Navigation, the prices of Corn would bear a proportion to the number of Artificers and Mariners, and the means which by their Crafts and Traffick they ſhould be enabled to buy Corn withal: We then ſhould not need to fear the Importation of Corn or Iriſh Cattle. And I believe it would be a happineſs equal to any Temporal, both to the Land-lord and Tenant, to have the prices of Corn conſtant and reaſonable; and that ſuch ſtores were preſerved in all great and Navigable places, ſo as to prevent a Famine in <hi>England,</hi> and to ſupply other places which labour under it. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of her Reign, permitted the Engliſh in any Veſſels to import Corn, paying ordinary and but reaſonable Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which Law ſtands yet in force.</p>

                        <p>By free permiſſion, here, I intend ſuch Duties only, as that <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Coal may, with regard to the goodneſs of it, be cheaper vended in forrein parts, than Scotch-Coal from the Ports of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for whilſt the Duties of exporting <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>Coal continue ſo high, Forreigners paying above 16 <hi>s. per</hi> Chauldron, and the Engliſh above 8 <hi>s.</hi> all Nations, unleſs it be in working Iron Manufactures, generally take in lading of Coals from <hi>Scotland.</hi> We glory much, that the <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>Trade, in our home-vent of Coals, above all other Trades, employs our Shipping and Mariners; yet, as has been ſaid, this Employment is to the loſs of the Nation, by how much Pitch, Tar, Cordage and Sails are conſumed in it: whereas the forrein Trade of it, if free to the Engliſh, for ought I know, might employ more Shipping and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and both the outward vent and the Returns may be profitable to the Nation. I am ſure the Coals under ground are no benefit to the Nation; nor need we fear, in caſe the collieries were drained, ever to want Coals to ſupply our ſelves or Forreigners. It is true, Forreigners in <hi>France, Flanders, Holland,</hi> and other places, by this permiſſion might work Iron Manufactures cheaper, by how much cheaper the Engliſh ſhould import <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>Coal. But to this I ſay, that all Nations (except the Engliſh, in conſuming Wines im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) deſigne ſome benefit by Goods bought and ſold; and therefore in Traffick, men compare the benefits in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſelling; and it is great Wiſdome in any Nation, ſo to eſtabliſh Trade and Commerce, that the Nations Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick be improved: and therefore, in caſe the vending our Coals in forrein Trade, and making Returns, beſides the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of our Shipping and Mariners, be more beneficial to this Nation, than cheaper working Iron Manufactures be prejudicial to it, this Exportation is to be prefer'd.</p>

                           <pb n="109" facs="tcp:108084:73"/>
Another Objection againſt this permiſſion is, <hi>The King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue will be hereby leſſened, by how much the Duties are leſs.</hi> To this I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the King's Revenue upon Trade, is a Conſequence to Trade; and therefore, if the King's Revenue upon Trade be higher than it can bear, the Trade will be loſt, and then neceſſarily will be the King's Revenue: and that it is the height of the Duties upon Coals exported, which eſtabliſhes ſo great a Trade of Coals in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and makes our forrein vent ſo inconſiderable. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue upon <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>Coals, in the forrein vent of it, is Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; ſo that though the Duties be very high, yet it may be the King's Revenue is not conſiderable. Whereas, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in caſe the forrein Duties were reaſonable, the greatneſs of the Trade might much more increaſe the King's Revenue than as it ſtands, whenas the greatneſs of the Duties cauſes ſo ſmall a Trade.</p>
                        <p>To ſum up this Diſcourſe, and leave the Progreſs of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a deſigne to others, whoſe inſight and abilities are better able to improve the Trade and Navigation of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I ſay, that in caſe we ſhould reſerve the <hi>Eaſt Indie,</hi> the <hi>Turkie</hi> Trades, and the Trades to our Plantations, as alſo the home-vent and forrein Trade of <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>coals, to the Natives of <hi>England,</hi> and again eſtabliſh the Trade and Navigation to <hi>Ireland,</hi> as it was before the Act againſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of Iriſh Cattle, and permit all Nations to inhabit and Fiſh from the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> and import and export freely French Wines, Brandies and Salt from <hi>France,</hi> and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Pitch and Tar from <hi>Norway,</hi> and Ruff Hemp and Flax from the Ports within the <hi>Sound;</hi> I know not of any Trades or Navigation we ſhould be in danger to loſe, ſo as not to employ our Shipping and Mariners, but thoſe to <hi>France, Muſcovy,</hi> and into the <hi>Sound.</hi> For the Trade and Navigation to <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and into the <hi>Sound,</hi> by Engliſh ſhips and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners only, we have examined it in the <hi>Annot.</hi> upon the <hi>13th Prop.</hi> the <hi>Coroll.</hi> and <hi>14th Prop.</hi> of this Treatiſe, and finde it not only prejudicial to the Trade and Navigation of the Nation, but dangerous to the conſerving the Sovereignty of the Britiſh Seas to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> In the French
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108084:74"/>
Trade for Wines and Brandies I obſerve, that this Trade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others impoveriſhes the Nation, not only as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch and impoveriſh our ſelves in drinking all the Wines, good or bad, imported; but alſo in the Ware and Tare of the Veſſels wherein we import them; and the outward freight is with little elſe than Ballaſt, and the Returns as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Voyage in the moſt perillous ſeaſons of Navigation of all others, wherein we loſe more Shipping and Mariners than in all our other Trades &amp; Navigation beſides. Whereas in caſe we ſhould increaſe a forrein Trade of <hi>Newcaſtle-</hi>coals, and reſtore the Trade we had to <hi>Ireland;</hi> both theſe Trades would be profitable to the Nation in the outward freight, ſo might the Returns; the Trades and Navigation might be conſtant, and in the ſeaſonable Times of Navigation: and for ought I know, we might conſtantly employ double the Sea-men and Mariners in theſe Trades, to the Mariners and Navigation we employ for French Wines and Brandies in the Moneths of <hi>October, November,</hi> and <hi>December.</hi> For the Importation of Salt, I ſay, it may be one Veſſel of Salt may with that Commodity ſupply a hundred Veſſels for the Fiſhing Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in caſe Forreigners import Salt cheaper than the Engliſh, all theſe hundred Veſſels will have the benefit of it. And whether we ought to prefer the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Navigation for one Veſſel of Salt, or the Fiſhery of a hundred Veſſels, and the Navigation which depends upon it, I leave to any one to judge. Beſides, the cheap Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Salt, has not onely an Influence upon the forrein Trade of it, but upon all the Veſſels which take in Proviſions of Salt-Beef and Pork, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But as the Law againſt Naturalization re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains the Improvement of our Native Commodities only to Engliſh, whereby infinite benefits might accrue to the Nation; and the priviledges of Corporations reſtrains the improvement of very few, yet veryer poor Freemen; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both ways the Navigation, as well as the Forein and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Trade of the Nation is hindred: So the Act of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation reſtraining the forrein vent of our Commodities, and making Returns into the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> not only by the ſcarcity and dearneſs of Shipping endangers the Trade and Navigation of the Nation, but prohibiting upon terms of Confiſcation of Ships, Goods, Guns, Tackle, Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Apparel, all Nations to import Goods into any of the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> unleſs by the Natives, and Ships of the place; not only the export of French Wines, Salt, Brandies and other Commodities, with the growths and Manufactures of the Nation becomes impoſſible, to the infinite hindrance of the forrein Trade of them; but alſo by reaſon of the dearneſs and ſcarcity of Pitch, Tar, Timber, Ruff Hemp and Flax, and all ſorts of Dying ſtuff, the Domeſtick working of our Manufactures, as well as the forrein Trade and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which depends thereon, is forely damnified.

The Pen of <hi>Great Yarmouth</hi> is a rarity equal to any the Nation can boaſt of; by the benefit whereof, this Town (after <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Briſtol)</hi> excels all others of <hi>England</hi> in Trade and Navigation. Our King in his Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wiſdome, at great expence, endeavours to finiſh the Mole at <hi>Tangier,</hi> thereby reaſonably hoping that that place may become famous for Trade, and a ſecure Harbour for his Men of War and the Merchants of <hi>England</hi> upon all occaſions, both in Peace, but more in time of War. With a diligence and induſtry equal to his power, the French King endeavours to make the Port of <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> more deep and commodious for Shipping, thereby to advance the Trade and Navigation of <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Britain.</hi> Even the Act of Navigation with reaſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits the Trade of our Plantations to Forreigners, becauſe thereby, though it would enrich them by how much more their Trade would become greater, yet this would be ſo much to the loſs of the Nation: and permits a free Trade to <hi>Tangier,</hi> becauſe it may enrich the place, and make it more frequented.

by Forreigners, were no longer ours than the Merchants and Owners pleaſed; yet by reaſon of the Intercourſe and Commerce, the Trade would ſo much more fix, as the Commerce is more free: the World would finde the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Traffick, from the Excellency, Convenience, and Openneſs of our Ports; which in time may invite them to eſtabliſh their Riches and Trade in our Country, and leave them to their Poſterities with us in <hi>England.</hi> In the mean time, the Country-Farn or would finde vent of his Commodities in V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctualling the Vſſels, and poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple employment in mending the Ships and Rigging, and in lading and unlading Goods; and many thouſands of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Houſes upon the Coaſt would let for good Rents, which now decay, and fall down for want of Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>By this free Importation of Goods into the Ports of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> we may infinitely improve the benefits which will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to a'l ſorts of Artificers by the plenty and cheapneſs of all things they need, and to the forrein Trades of our Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and other Manufactures, by their Returns into the Ports of <hi>England:</hi> the multitudes of Shipping and Traders, will excite them to ſeek employment for their Shipping in all ſorts of Commodities we can ſupply them with, and they the World. This Freedom and Intercourſe in our Ports would eſtabliſh an Intereſt with all thoſe Nations which hold Trade and Traffick with us, ſo as their Intereſt would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come interwoven with ours in all diſcords and Wars between us and other Nations. And I am not affraid to ſay, that the City of <hi>London</hi> would equally, if not more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, enjoy benefit by this freedom of Trade and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation; for it is the Trade <hi>London</hi> now enjoys above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other place in <hi>England,</hi> which makes it ſo eminent above all other places of <hi>England;</hi> which might be ſo much more increaſed, as the Nation by this Freedom may hold a greater Commerce with it. Whereas, in caſe we continue ſtill to Tax and reſtrain our forrein Trades, of all places <hi>London</hi> will ſuffer moſt: For the Country of <hi>England</hi> may ſubſiſt, though poorly, without a forrein Trade, or Trade with <hi>London:</hi> But in caſe the Nation loſes the forrein Trade of
<pb facs="tcp:108084:76"/>
our Woollen and other Manufactures, and the Country becomes ſo poor as they cannot hold Commerce with <hi>London, London</hi> cannot ſubſiſt.</p>
                  <p>But though all Humane Wiſdome is Lame and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and, without a Bleſſing by God's Providence upon it, cannot reaſonably hope to attain the deſigned end; yet no man can reaſonably hope for God's Bleſſing upon buſineſs, where he deſignes by forceable means, more than the Nature of it, to attain his Ends. We have ſaid the height of Duties upon Goods imported into <hi>England,</hi> was the Cauſe the Dutch are become ſo powerful in Trade and Navigation above us; and that it was the Impoſition of 16 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon Goods imported, which loſt the Trade of <hi>Genoua</hi> to <hi>Legorne;</hi> and at this time we enjoy moſt infinite advantages above the Dutch, as well in our Country as Coaſt. And to theſe may be added the preſent Calamities the Dutch now labour under, by the terrible Inundation of Waters, which they can never ſecurely prevent for the future. But as the Dutch in their long Wars with the Spaniards built a Fort called <hi>Lillo</hi> upon the <hi>Scheld,</hi> to interrupt the Traffick which many parts of the world held with <hi>Antwerp,</hi> thereby to gain that Trade to themſelves: So the Act of Navigation, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Corporations, and the Law againſt Naturalization; are <hi>Lillo's</hi> upon all the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> yet was there no War between the Ports and Nation to cauſe them; and this not to gain a Trade to the Ports or Nation, but to eſtabliſh it in other places. And though the forrein Trade of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, and the Fiſh caught upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Navigation depending thereon, be the Soul of the well-being and ſafety of the Nation; yet in it is not ſo much as a Council of Trade, or any eſtabliſhed Power, to Govern or Regulate it.</p>
