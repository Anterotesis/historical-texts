            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That may come by the continuall familiaritie that suche men haue with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: in whom they haue no pleasure for respect of loue, or whose familiaritie doeth make Loue lothesome or out of taste.</p>
            <p>¶What is the cause, that he that loueth feruently is soone angrie?</p>
            <p>Because the sprites and humors of Louers be verie hote, and boyle continuallie.</p>
            <p>¶How commeth it to passe, that an amorouse woman is so curious to be finely appareled and decked?</p>
            <p>She doeth it to increase and set foorth her beautie, therby to subdue and drawe those vnto her, that be moost beautifull and desirous to Loue.</p>
            <p>¶But why be rough and hearie men more prone and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the amorouse battell of Loue, then other?</p>
            <p>Bycause they abound and be more full of humors then other.</p>
            <p>¶What hath moued certeine Greke Poetes to saie: that Loue is the moost excellent amongest all the heauenly goddes?</p>
            <p>It is perchaunce because there is no Philosopher that doeth teache the maner of mans life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o well as he, or maketh man more practique or quicke sprited.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19907:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>¶But why hath Loue bene estemed a godde?</p>
            <p>Bycause he maketh an Idiote to speake well, a coward to be bolde and hardie, a melancolike man Ioyful, a heauie and slouthful man prompt and readie to all enterprises, be they neuer so great. Or els he is made a godde, for man to excuse him selfe, and to cast vpon Loue all that, which by the same he hath done and susteined.</p>
            <p>¶Why be Louers so desirous of corporall &amp; bodelie beautie?</p>
            <p>Bycause beautie (as auncient Poetes do affirme) doth please the Goddes, is agreable to men, is not lothesome nor heauie to him that is indued therwith: but desired aboue all thinges that may be wished.</p>
            <p>¶what is the reason and cause of Nosegaies, garlandes of floures, and grene bowes, wherwith Louers be wont to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne the frontes of their Ladies lodginges?</p>
            <p>It is to honor them as their goddes on earth, and to shewe that such Nosegaies, Garlandes, and Maie bowes doe serue for the spoiles and triumphes of their Ladies, and for true signes of the seruice and deuotion of their louing seruantes.</p>
            <p>¶But wherof commeth it that we dreame seldome of the thing that we loue?</p>
            <p>All louers being tossed and vexed with diuerse thoughtes can not stedfastlie graue and settle any one thing in their fantasie: for their hough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes be like the circles and bubblinges of the water, which are dissipated the one by the other.</p>
            <p>¶From whence commeth it, that certeine Louers vpon the viewe and sight of their Ladies, doo blushe?</p>
            <p>It riseth of the blodde and sprites which ascend vpwardes, wherof the face, fullest of poores of any part of the bodie, doeth charge it selfe with coulor. It may be also, that it procedeth of a singuler reuerence that they beare to their Paramoures.</p>
            <p>¶But why doo they afterwardes waxe pale?</p>
            <p>There is no true louer but is troubled with some disquiet or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie. Yf the cause then of his paine doe present it selfe before his eyes, the same doeth easelie growe and increase. And so Nature retiring vnto the inward partes, as into her holde or forte, carieth with her both the blodde and sprites, leauing the superior partes without any coulor,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:19907:6"/>¶Howe chaunceth it, that barren and vnfruitfull women be more hote and prompt to loue, then they which are fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and beare children?</p>
            <p>Bycause that suche doo moore abound with seede, and do purge them selues of their naturall disease lesse then other doo.</p>
            <p>¶Why doe Louers delight to beare in their handes Nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaies and Apples?</p>
            <p>All Louers haue desire to enioye and possesse the floure and the fruicte of others age and beautie, wherin they reioyce, when soeuer they see the same. And so be amorouse bothe of flour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being bothe of bodie and spirit more firme in all affaires. And naturallie he is more constant and of better perswacion in loue.</p>

            <p>That peraduenture maie come, bycause our spirites can not resist the amorouse shottes which doe procede of the swete lookes that Louers doe continuallie cast one vpon another. Or els we will saie: that it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of nature to couple and ioyne like to like, and to skatter and diuide the thinges which haue no proportion together.</p>
            <p>¶Wherfore do men saie, that to Neese is a good signe in the facte and dede of Loue?</p>
            <p>Bycause it commeth of the braine, which is as it were the litle Cauan and withdrawing place of all the senses. And it semeth that all the senses doe agree and geue their assent to the sentence and conclusion of Louers.</p>
            <p>¶Wherof commeth it, that secret loue is more burning and feruent, then that which is discouered and open?</p>
            <p>That chaunceth bycause the secret Louer hath no meane of ease and rest to lett out the fyre that doeth consume him, the vertue of Loue being of meruelouse force and strength, and so not able to atteine the thing which he loueth best is vnto him greater trauell and paine, then yf he inioyed it, or might discouer it to his frende for his comforte.</p>
            <p>¶Whether were it better that there were loue or no loue?</p>
            <p>I beleue it to be better that there were loue, for somuch as it bringeth vnto vs more good effectes then euill, and to my minde and opinion Plato agreeth, who making a definicion of Loue doeth saie, that it is nothing

            <p>I doe not iudge or thinke that Loue doeth serue for a spurre to pricke men to vertue: supposing that a man desireth it for none other purpose, but to enioye it.</p>

            <p>I saye that the vertue of the Planetes haue wrought it: for in this vniuersitie of thinges nothing doeth moue it selfe, that doeth not take his fyrst motion of the planetes.</p>

            <p>The vulgare and common loue is blynd, but the celestiall loue is not: but with great dexteritie it openeth and discouereth the greatest secretes.</p>
            <p>¶ Why be they that haue small legges more subiect to loue then others?</p>
            <p>That procedeth of the aboundaunce of seede that maketh them so Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouse, which thing commeth ordinarilie to those, whose inferior parts of the bodie receiue no great nourishment: Bicause all that which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taketh from the nether partes, is by Nature conuerted into super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie and seede.

            <p>Youth aboundeth in heate, and is subiect to diuerse and many thinges, and can not staie it selfe in one thought, wherby it procedeth that the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes haue made Uenus the mother of Loue, whom many Louers do followe.</p>

            <p>¶Is it possible that a couetouse man may become amorouse?</p>
            <p>The forces of Loue haue alwaies beene more braue and fine, then those of couetousnes. So I beleue that Loue can not onelie make the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouse liberall, but also prodigall: for as the couetouse haue had no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to get goodes, so they may haue as litle to spend them, yf they thinke that by money they maie inioye the thing that they loue.</p>
            <p>¶Wherfore haue men more libertie then women to loue in moe places then one?</p>
            <p>Take modestie, shamefastnes, and feare from women, and ye take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie their life, which chaunceth not to man.</p>
            <p>¶Wherfore be Louers continuallie readie to demaund the hartie good will of them that they loue?</p>
            <p>The harte is the feate of desire and of all knowledge, all which be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to obey the thing that it loueth: the ymage wherof representing it selfe pleasant before the eyes of Louers, doeth rauishe from them both the hart and the principall partes.

            <p>The nature of a Crocodill after the mind of those, that haue written of natural thinges, is to followe those that flye from him, and to flye from them that doe followe him: And so is it with Loue. Therfore I geue councell, that who soeuer will inioy theffecte of his desires, that he be not to sharpe and egre to pursue and followe his Ladie.</p>

            <p>Wherof commeth it, that diuerse which loued feruentlie to haue some comfort, did soudenlie lose that great heate of loue?</p>
            <p>All vehement loue doeth not longe continewe, for within a while the spirite hath leasure to examine it selfe, and to retourne to due vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, thinking vpon all thinges that might violate and corrupt the same, wherby the sensuall appetites be by this meanes restrained.</p>
            <p>¶ Why doe men call loue bothe flame and fyre?</p>
            <p>It is not possible better to expresse howe insupportable a thing it is, considering the heate of the desires which it ingendreth in the hartes of his seruantes, and the tirannie that he vseth towardes those whiche are vnder his power, whom he bringeth to ruine and consumeth like fyre without any pitie.</p>

Loue is a passion proceding of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine fyer which by the eyes is discouered (and manifesteth it selfe by the coulor of the face,) and by all the actes of a Louer it maie be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and knowen, so that without great paine and difficultie, it can not be hidden.</p>

            <p>¶ Which be the noblest hartes?</p>
            <p>They whom loue disdaineth not to warme with his sacred heate.</p>
            <p>¶ Wherfore do sume loue many persons at once, and yet do not vse to disclose the same?</p>
            <p>Noble mindes take great pleasure to do so, but to tell and shewe it, it is but losse and shame.</p>
            <p>¶ Is it true which men say, that yf one be in loue with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he then beareth affection to all those thinges, which resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the thing he loueth?</p>
            <p>That is to true, for they be in loue euen with thinges that be dombe and without sence, with pictures and ingrauen thinges and suche lyke, yf they shew any remembraunce of the thing they loue.</p>
            <p>¶ What is the true gage of Loue?</p>
            <p>A pure and cleane harte.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:19907:30"/>¶ Why doe women very oftentimes blame or disprayse their Louers?</p>
            <p>To thintent that other shoulde praise them, thereby to double their pleasure.</p>
            <p>¶ Who hath the more liuely spirite, and better memorie, the man, or the woman?</p>
            <p>The man, not after the saying onely of the Philosophers, but also of holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>¶ Who hath the better iudgement of the amiable partes, the man, or the woman?</p>
            <p>The man, as beyng indued with the nature of a more highe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and a spirite more subtill.</p>
            <p>¶ May we loue the thing that doeth turne vs to dishonor?</p>
            <p>I thinke not.</p>
            <p>¶ What is the greatest recompence that a woman can make vnto a man?</p>
            <p>To reueale vnto him her secretes, and finally to make him Lorde and maister of her bodie, and of all her thoughtes.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:19907:31"/>I will tell you. Uineger beyng of his nature colde remoueth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation and heate of the stomake, which prouoketh thirst, and so by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing the cause, the affection also is taken awaie.</p>

            <p>At all times when the breth is kept in, then hath the hearing greater force abrode, and so consequently receiueth and comprehendeth the better that which is presented, whether it be sound or noyse. Moreouer blowing or breathing doth somwhat let the hearing. And therfore the same being reteyned, the hearing is more free.</p>
            <p>¶ But wherof commeth it that many hauing the knowledge of naturall thinges, do thinke it not good to drinke after fructe and specially after Melons and Pompions?</p>
            <p>Wine of it selfe is penetratife, in suche sort that it easely draweth with it the vndigested fructes to the vaines, where they do sone corrupt, and so engender very great feuers, and other lingering sicknesses.</p>
            <p>¶¶ What is the cause that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gentle women of Milan, to make themselues fatte, doe loue and vse swete wines?</p>
            <p>Swete wine doth engender grosse blood, and doth easely penetrate into all the partes of the bodie, and is conuerted into nourishment, wherof they become so fat, and of good liking. Grene wine &amp; sharpe doth not the same.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:19907:32"/>¶ Wherof commeth it that all they which be extreme thirstie do loue no swete wines?</p>
            <p>All thinges which may ingender and enflame choler are apte to make men thirstie, and suche is swete wine.</p>
            <p>¶ Wherof commeth it that diuerse religiouse persons, which naturally are very zelouse of Chastitie, do absteine from wine?</p>
            <p>Wine is hote and full of vapours, and therfore prouoketh lust, his heat dissolueth seede, and with his ventositie causeth the courage to ryse.</p>
            <p>¶ What is the cause that the <hi>Florentines</hi>

               </note> do let it rest a certein space before they drink it</p>
            <p>The more the water is mingled and incorporated with the wine, the more the fume of the wine is quenched, beyng reduced as it were into one body and nature. Therfore after my iudgement it should be better when the wine is newe pressed to put in water, then otherwise.</p>
            <p>¶ Why be the <hi>Arabians</hi> accustomed to slepe with their bodies bowing or folded?</p>
            <p>It must nedes be, that Nature or they which knowe his effectes haue taught them the same. For sleping so folded together, their stomackes doe waxe warme &amp; digest the better, and there is no windines that can hinder their digestion. The body being bowed as aforesaid, causeth that the bely doth receiue al ventositie, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like vnto an open purse. Contrariwise y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy stretched forth maketh the belly to close &amp; shut in such sort that it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no windines: the belly being bent &amp; stretched forthe, stuffed on euery side with bowels &amp; inward parts, which causeth that the ventosities fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no place in the belly, are forced to retire els wher, &amp; to hinder digestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>¶ Why do the <hi>Polonians</hi> eate colewortes to make them selues sober when they be dronke?</p>
            <p>The propertie of coleworte is, to send downe to the bowels, the moost materiall and grosse parte of the wine, and that which is moost subtillest and fynest to the blader: and that commeth of the participation that it hath with Nitrum of saltenes. And for to vse it to this effecte, the cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort must not be to muche sodden.</p>
            <p>¶ Wherfore did our forefathers make difficultie to vse at their tables diuerse meates and sortes of dishes?</p>
            <p>The diuersitie of meates can not be digested with one proportion of heate And so nature being troubled with indigestion of such diuersitie of meats causeth noysomnes to the stomacke, and specially when it is weake.</p>

            <p>The subtill ayer is sone infected, and soone purged of the infection: contrariewise, the grosse ayer is not so lightly infected, nor yet so soone purged.</p>
            <p>¶ Howe may the fyne and subtill ayer be knowen from the grosse and corrupt ayer?</p>
            <p>The tenuitie and subtiltie of the ayer is knowen, for that at the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Sunne it is soudenly heated, and waxeth colde at the goyng downe therof. The contrarie doth chaunce to the grosse and vitious ayer.</p>
            <p>¶ Wherof commeth it that the winter in some countries is longer then the Somer, and in other cuntries the Somer lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the winter?</p>
            <p>The cause of the Sunne in the Zodiaque doeth cause mutation of the foure seasons of the yere: And where the sunne continueth longest, ouer the heddes of those that dwell in that region, there is Somer greatest: and where it is farre of, winter doeth longest continewe.</p>
            <p>¶ Why is Musike more delectable in the morning, then at any other tymes?</p>
            <p>Bicause that all things be then in silence, the sences be more lustie and waking, and the minde in great moderation and temperaunce.</p>
            <p>¶ Why be fructes commonly beloued of all men?</p>
            <p>For the naturall swetenes which is in them: or els bicause they be of temperature hote and moyst.</p>
            <p>¶ Wherfore is the sighte aboue all the other senses mooste estemed?</p>
            <p>Bycause by the sight we see the difference of all thinges. Or els we may say that it commeth by the impression of Loue, which taketh his first force and strength by the sighte.</p>

            <p>¶ Why was <hi>Cato</hi> of many men compted a foole.</p>
            <p>Bicause he rather chose voluntary death, then to yelde himselfe into the hands of Cesar, who sought no other thing of him but frendship, and was ment to pardon him al his iniuryes past.</p>
            <p>¶ Why did <hi>Scipio</hi> take such hede of going rashlye to the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe and cumbat?</p>
            <p>He knewe well that by his natiuitie, he was appointed to be generall of armies, and not a simple souldior: wherfore he behaued him selfe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Maiestie of that office, and not like a priuate souldior.</p>

            <p>The true title of a prince is rather to be iust then mightie: and oughte rather to resemble God by vertue, then the Lion by force.</p>

            <p>The one vseth thoffice of a man, the other of a beaste. The Prince ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth as a father to his subiectes: the Tyraunt deuoureth them.</p>
            <p>¶ Howe may a Tyraunt assure him selfe in his Tyrannie?</p>

            <p>¶ What was the cause that <hi>Nicomedes</hi> kinge of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> instituted the <hi>Romanes</hi> to be his heyers?</p>
            <p>In token of remembraunce of gratefulnes to be towardes them, being by their ayde, after he was chased from his estate by Mithridates king of Pontas, restablished in the same againe.</p>

            <p>To thinke that it is laweful for him to do all thinges, and that all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes is sufferable, hauing power to do what he liste.

            <p>A disordinate appetite, a cupiditie insatiable, a disease whiche infecteth the person, making man vile and effeminate. But after the opinion of the Stoiks, Plato declareth that he whiche desireth to be riche, muste geue ouer his appetites and heape no treasure together. Other Philosophers affirme, that couetousnes is a disease that poisoneth the bodie, and maketh the minde effeminate, and can neuer be recouered.</p>

Wherfore in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thende his people did cast him into the riuer Pactolus, which is ful of fine gold, to thintent he might glut him selfe with gold, after which he so much thirsted. The selfe same vice of couetousnes was thoccasion of the death of Crassus, who was slaine by the Persians.</p>
            <p>¶ What is liberalitie?</p>
            <p>To vse richesse indifferently, that is to saye, to spende nether to muche nor to litle: so that it is as it were a meane betwene Couetousnes and prodigalitie.</p>

            <p>He that receaueth a good tourne, is debter to him that doeth it.
