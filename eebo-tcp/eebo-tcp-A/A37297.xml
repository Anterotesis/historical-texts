            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For my Lord hath commanded me to caſt my bread upon the waters, and I ſhall find it after many dayes: He commands me to do good to all, but principally to thoſe that are in diſtreſs: To ſuch (I ſay) as groan under the burthen of Gods heavy hand, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thoſe that labour under the violence of this furious and almoſt contagious Diſeaſe now reigning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, which is called by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people The <hi>FLUX,</hi> with the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings in the Bowels.</hi> By which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand many periſh for want of means to purchaſe fit Medicines for that Diſeaſe from the learned Phyſicians; unto ſuch alone I doe preſent this

            <p>This Medicine being thus taken, and theſe Rules obſerved at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Diſeaſe, with Gods help it giveth a ſpeedy Cure: But if the Diſeaſe have continued long upon thee, then expect not ſo ſudden a Cure, and therefore uſe the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine every other day, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel-Drink,</hi> and the <hi>Plantane-Drink,</hi> every day ordinarily, the oftner the better. The beſt and fitteſt time to give the <hi>Groundſel-Drink</hi> is at 6 a clock in the Morning. But if thou art ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly taken ſick at any time of the day with this Diſeaſe, then take the <hi>Groundſel-Drinke</hi> preſently, without delay, (for delayes in this caſe are very dangerous) after thou haſt been an

houre in Bed: And if thy conſtitution be ſo hard to work upon, and thy body withall ſtrong, ſo that the Medicine beginneth not to work effectually in an hour and a halfs time, then you may take ſuch another draught of <hi>Groundſel.</hi> But if through ſtubbornneſs of thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and thy former long neglect, thy body doth ſtill languiſh, then repair to my habitation, or ſend me a diſcreet Meſſenger (for Urines in this caſe are not to be truſted to) though many unworthy Profeſſors of the honourable Science of Phyſick doe raſhly adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to give Phyſick upon the bare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the Urine, to the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſick Patient, although their idle prattle ſatisfies, but yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives ignorant people: A diſcreet Meſſenger I ſay that may be able to reſolve me ſome queſtions concerning the ſtate of your body: By which Meſſenger I ſhall ſend you a Pill and a Powder, which you ſhall have <hi>gratis,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60096:5"/>
provided the Meſſenger bring me a Certificate under the hand of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that you are poor, that ſo the Poor may not be deceived: Which Pill and Powder are of excellent virtue for opening the Obſtructions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, and evacuates that ſharp humor and wind which cauſeth this violent diſtemper; and by the taking thereof not onely this, but many Diſeaſes have been Cured, and as many Prevented, to the preſervation of thouſands in this and other Nations.</p>
            <p>It is excellent for the cure of the <hi>Dropſie,</hi> for by its evacuative quality it unburdeneth the languiſhing body from thoſe <hi>Hydropick</hi> humours which invade the life of the Patient.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gout,</hi> though a Diſeaſe reputed incurable, yet this hath cured the ſame at twice taking, ſome Topical Medicine being applyed to the part, intentionally to diſcuſſe the humour collected, and farther taking the ſame Medicine once

in half a year intercepteth the furious reintration of the Diſeaſe, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly purſueth thoſe that have had the Diſeaſe every Spring and Fall.</p>
            <p>It hath likewiſe mightily prevailed in the Curing of thoſe which have had the <hi>Stone,</hi> which it diſſolveth by its pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trative faculty, and afterwards by its expulſive faculty it forces the <hi>Stone</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>It Cureth the <hi>Quotidian, Tertian,</hi> and <hi>Quartan</hi> Ague, though indeed the <hi>Quartan</hi> requireth longer time, but the reſt it moſt commonly cureth at the firſt taking.</p>
            <p>It hath cured many of the Diſeaſe, <hi>Struma,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Kingsevil,</hi> if the Diſeaſe be not too inveterate, and the Maſs of Blood wholly corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſequently it cureth many <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Apoſtheums, Morphews, Itch,</hi> and ſuch like deformities of the Skin; for by the operative virtue of this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, thoſe ſharp humours which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60096:6"/>
theſe unſeemly and unwiſh'd for diſaſters, are carried away, and that at the firſt or ſecond taking, but general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the third Doſe performs the work without queſtion, if the conſtitution be any thing helpful to Nature.</p>
            <p>But principally it is highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thoſe who have taken <hi>Surfets</hi> by Eating or Drinking: For by its virtue it exonerates the Stomach from thoſe nauſeous humours lately received from that redundancy; which humours by continuance a very few hours in the body, kindle the flames of violent Fevers, even to the ſubverſion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and loſs of Life, which too too many ſee and find by daily and woful experience; all which calamities may be ſeaſonably prevented by taking of this wholſome Medicine.</p>
            <p>It is very profitable for thoſe that want an Appetite and Digeſtion, which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60096:7"/>
indeed is the forerunner of many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, for a Failing Appetite and a Weak Digeſtion ſpeaks the whole body diſtempered, and gives certain notice of the purſuit of ſome furious diſeaſe. Many careleſly neglecting theſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticks, precipitate themſelves to their deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is a proper Medicine to be taken at the beginning of any manner of Diſeaſe, for by its operative virtue it doth Diopilate the Stomach, Liver, Spleen and Meſentery, and preſently cleanſeth them from thoſe Impurities, which being lodged in thoſe official parts, their Natural operation is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently hindred, and the ſad effects of inſuing Diſeaſes produced.</p>
            <p>This Medicine being a perfect Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, worketh impartially on each redundant humor; and incountring with that enemie the Diſeaſe, in the beginning before he hath intrencht
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60096:7"/>
himſelf, gives him a repulſe, and forces him to flight; indeed it is like little <hi>David</hi> to great <hi>Goliah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were fit to be preſerved for uſe in all families that are careful of their health, but eſpecially for ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Phyſicians: it may be taken at any time if the patient find himſelf ſuddenly ſurprized with the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of inſuing Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The precedent ſymptomes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly theſe following. An unuſual pain in the Head, unaccuſtomed paſſions and trembling of the Heart, oppreſſion and loathſomeneſs of the Stomach, with a rare propenſity to vomit: alſo a grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Bowels, pain in the Loynes or back, with ſhivering Chillneſs or ſhaking, with a ſudden violent heat, with ſlothfulneſs, drowſineſs and reſtleſneſs to the whole body.</p>
            <p>I ſay when theſe or any of theſe Symptomes appear, then know aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60096:8"/>
there is a ſtorm coming, then without delay take this Medicine.</p>
            <p>It may likewiſe be given to Children, if you find any of theſe Symptomes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing on them: But to ſuch give not the powder in ſubſtance, but that which is called the infuſion of it, which you muſt make thus. Take the whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and let it lie in ſeven ſpoonfuls of white wine all night, then ſtrain the white wine from the powder through a three double cloth, of the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> wine give the Child one ſpoonful in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſting, (if the child be not above four years old) but if a luſty Child, and near eight or ten years of age, you may then give the quantity of three ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls, rather leſs then more, for if it ſhould not work in an hour and a halfs time you may give another ſpoonful, when you find it begins to work, give now and then a draught of poſſet-drink; Let not the Child ſtir abroad all that day,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60096:8"/>
nor ſleep in four hours after taking the white wine; To a Child of fourteen or ſixteen years of age, you may give four ſpoonfuls, alwayes remembring to give rather a ſpoonful too little, then one drop too much, in regard you may increaſe the quantity when you pleaſe; it were fit that one of theſe powders were alwayes kept in a viol full of white wine, cloſe ſtopt, for it will keep a whole year being ſet now and then by the fire, or in the Sun, and then it is ready to be taken upon all occaſions; for twelve hours neglect may danger the loſs of the Child; if the Child be taken ſick one day and neglect the Medicine, till the next morning whilſt the infuſion is preparing: withall remembring that Children take not the Pill.</p>

Take the Pill alwayes over night two hours after the eating of a light ſupper, ſo go to reſt; next morning take the powder faſting in a ſtewed pruon, pap of an Apple, a piece of ſweet butter, or of honey the quantity of a haſle nut; one hour after drink a draught of poſſet Ale, and when it begins to work with you, drink now and then a draught of the ſaid Ale; Sleep not in four hours after taking thereof, neither ſtir out of your Chamber all that day: about Noon eat ſome warm meat, making but a light Meal; And if it be needful you may take another pill and powder three dayes after, in the ſame manner as aforeſaid. And if the patients body be Coſtive, then 4 hours before you give the firſt pill give him or her a gliſter
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60096:9"/>
made onely with half a pint of pure Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let oyle, and half a pint of new milk. So likewiſe the next day ſix or ſeven hours after the taking the powder give the ſame gliſter, if the inflexibilitie of the humors have prevented the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine working downwards anſwerable to your expectation; But this is notuſual, yet the firſt gliſter is Common.</p>
            <p>But if you ſhall find any of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Symptomes formerly ſpoken of appear; then ſtay not till night or next morning, but immediately go to Bed, and as ſoon as you are warm, there take the pill, and within an hour after take the powder, in order and manner as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed; And withall remember the uſe of the gliſters, if your body be very Coſtive: And if your body continue ſtill in a diſtemper, then the next day in the Evening take another pill, and the next morning after another powder as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſcribed, not forgetting the Gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60096:10"/>
Be it likewiſe remembred, that whereas, each body hath its ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, habit, ſtrength or weakneſs; And therefore you muſt take notice, that although the pill is to be given to men or women generally, yet the whole quantity of Powder is not to be given to every patient: but rather half the powder at a time to a tender body, or elſe the greateſt part of the infuſion of the whole powder, according to former direction for Children; and if the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, whether the Powder or the infuſion, work not in an hour, or two hours time; then you may take the reſt of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or infuſion, alwayes obſerving to take ſomewhat leſs then a grain exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the direction.</p>
            <p>But withall if you expect a bleſſing upon theſe my weak but willing endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, be mindfull of that wholeſome direction delivered by a holy one, which ſpeaks thus; <hi>My Son? in thy ſickneſs be not</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60096:10"/>
               <hi>negligent, but pray unto the Lord, and he will make thee whole, ſet thy whole endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours on work to relinquiſh ſin, and to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy hands aright, and then give place to the Phyſician, for the Lord hath created him; I ſay expect not a bleſſing untill you fit your ſelf for that bleſſing by repentance,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that ſinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the hands of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian <hi>(ſaith a holy One)</hi> and know thou whoſoever thou art, that its thy ſin hath begot this puniſhment, which makes thee ſtand in need of the Phyſician; and aſſure thy ſelf, if this puniſhment, this ſickneſs, be removed from thee before an appearance of hearty ſorrow be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in thee for thy ſin, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioneth the ſame, this puniſhment, this ſickneſs, is removed but to try thee, or to give way to a far greater affliction which will undoubtedly fall upon thee and that ſuddenly; therefore if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not onely preſent but future com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</p>

Begin now an amendment of life: thou that haſt by continual tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons endeavoured to Crucifie again the Son of Life, repent that your Sins may be put away (which are the cauſe of all your preſent ſufferings) when the time of refreſhings ſhall come from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. Unto ſuch as are poor in ſpirit, whoſe inheritance is the everlaſting Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. To ſuch I ſay as thus mourn, it is my deſire to Comfort them, for they ſhall, they muſt be comforted, it is due to them by promiſe; Unto whom I ſay as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto the poor lame man at the Temple gate who beg'd his Alms, Gold and Silver have I none, but onely ſuch as I have I freely give thee: In the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt of Nazareth, riſe up and walk.</p>
            <p>Ask and it ſhall be given you.</p>
