            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Sithence then the place is so frée in entertainement, allowing a stoole as well to the Farmers sonne as to your Templer: that your Stinkard has the selfe same libertie to be there in his To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-Fumes, which your swéet Courtier hath: and that your Car-man and Tinker claime as strong a voice in their suffrage, and sit to giue iudgement on the plaies life and death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as the prowdest <hi>Momus</hi> among the tribe of <hi>Critick</hi>: It is fit y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hée, whom the most tailors bils do make roome for, when he comes should not be basely (like a vyoll) casd vp in a corner.</p>
               <p>Whether therefore the gatherers of the publique or priuate Play-house stand to receiue the afternoones rent, let our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant (hauing paid it) presently aduance himselfe vp to the Throne of the Stage. I meane not into the Lords roome, (which is now but the Stages Suburbs) No, those boxes by the iniquity of custome, conspiracy of waiting-women and Gentlemen-Ushers, that there sweat together, and the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes of Sharers, are contemptibly thrust into the reare, and much new Satten is there dambd by being smothred to death in darknesse.

               <p>By sitting on the stage, you may (without trauelling for it) at the very next doore, aske whose play it is: and by that <hi>Quest</hi> of <hi>Inquiry,</hi> the law warrants you to auoid much mistaking: if you know not the author, you may raile against him: and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture so behaue your selfe, that you may enforce the Author to know you.</p>
               <p>By sitting on the stage, if you be a Knight, you may happily get you a Mistresse: if a méere <hi>Fleet-street</hi> Gentleman, a wife; but assure your selfe by continuall residence, you are the first and principall man in election to begin the number of <hi>We three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By spreading your body on the stage, and by being a Iustice in examining of plaies, you shall put your selfe into such true <hi>Scaenicall</hi> authority that some Poet shall not dare to present his Muse rudely vpon your eyes, without hauing first vnmaskt her, rifled her, and discouered all her bare and most mysticall parts before you at a Tauerne, when you most knighly shal for his paines, pay for both their suppers.</p>

                  </gap>itting on the stage, you may (with small cost) purchase the déere acquaintance of the boyes: haue a good stoole for six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: at any time know what particular part any of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants present: get your match lighted, examine the play-suits lace, and perhaps win wagers vpon laying tis copper, &amp;c. And to conclude whether you be a foole or a Iustice of peace, a Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold or a Capten, a Lord Maiors sonne or a dawcocke, a knaue or an vnder Shreife, of what stamp soeuer you be, currant or counterfet, the Stagelike time will bring you to most perfect light, and lay you open: neither are you to be hunted from thence though the Scar-crowes in the yard, hoot at you, hisse at you, spit at you, yea throw durt euen in your téeth: tis most Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman like patience to endure all this, and to laugh at the silly Animals; but if the <hi>Rabble</hi> with a full throat, crie away with the foole, you were worse then a mad-man to tarry by it: for the Gentleman and the foole should neuer sit on the Stage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

Present not your selfe on the Stage (especially at a new play) vntill the quaking prologue hath (by rubbing) got cullor into his chéekes, and is ready to giue the trumpets their Cue that hées vpon point to enter: for then it is time, as though you were one of the <hi>Properties,</hi> or that you dropt out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

It shall crowne you with rich commendation to laugh alowd in the middest of the most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and saddest scene of the terriblest Tragedy: and to let that clapper (your tongue) be tost so high that all the house may ring of it: your Lords vse it; your Knights are Apes to the Lords, and do so too: your Inne-a-court-man is Zany to the Knights, and (many very scuruily) comes likewise limping after it: bee thou a beagle to them all, and neuer lin snuffing till you haue sented them: for by talking and laughing (like a Plough-man in a Morris) you heape <hi>Pelion</hi> vpon <hi>Ossa,</hi> glory vpon glory: As first, all the eyes in the galleries will leaue walking after the Players, and onely follow you: the simplest dolt in the house snatches vp your name, and when he méetes you in the stréetes, or that you fall into his hands in the middle of a Watch, his word shall be taken for you, héele cry, <hi>Hees such a Gallant,</hi> and you passe. Secondly, you publish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your temperance to the world, in that you séeme not to resort thither to taste vaine pleasures with a hungrie appetite; but onely as a Gentleman, to spend a foolish houre or two, because you can doe nothing else. Thirdly you mightily disrelish the Audience, and disgrace the Author: mary you take vp (though it be at the worst hand) a strong o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of your owne iudgement and inforce the Poet to take pitty of your weakenesse, and by some dedicated sonnet to bring you into a better paradice, onely to stop your mouth.</p>

to shun Shoulder-clapping, and to ship away your Cockatrice betimes in the morning it addes a kind of state vnto you, to be carried from thence to the staires of your Play-house: hate a Sculler (remember that) worse then to be acquainted with one ath Scullery. No, your Oares are your onely Sea-crabs, boord them, &amp; take héed you neuer go twice together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one paire: often shifting is a great credit to Gentlemen: &amp; that diuiding of your Fare wil make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore watersnaks be ready to pul you in péeres to enioy your custome: No matter whether vpon landing you haue money or no, you may swim in twentie of their boates ouer the riuer, vpon <hi>Ticket</hi>: mary when siluer comes in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to pay trebble their fare, &amp; it will make your Flounder-catchers to send more thankes after you, when you doe not draw, then when you doe: for they know, It will be their owne another daie.</p>
               <p>Before the Play begins, fall to cardes, you may win or loose (as <hi>Fencers</hi> doe in a prize) and beate one another by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie, yet share the money when you méete at supper: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, to gul the <hi>Ragga-muffins</hi> that stand a loofe gaping at you, throw the cards (hauing first torne foure or fiue of them) round about the Stage, iust vpon the third sound, as though you had lost: it skils not if the foure knaues ly on their backs, and outface the Audience, theres none such fooles as dare take exceptions at them, because ere the play go off, better knaues then they will fall into the company.</p>
               <p>Now sir, if the writer be a fellow that hath either epigramd you, or hath had a flirt at your mistris, or hath brought either your feather or your red beard, or your little legs &amp;c. on the stage, you shall disgrace him worse then by tossing him in a blancket, or giuing him the bastinado in a Tauerne, if in the middle of his play, (bee it Pastorall or Comedy, Morall or Tragedie) you rise with a skreud and discontented face from your stoole to be gone: no matter whether the Scenes be good or no, the better they are, the worse doe you distast them: and béeing on your féete, sneake not away like a coward, but salute all your gentle acquaintance, that are spred either on the rushes, or on stooles about you, and draw what troope you can from the stage after you: the <hi>Mimicks</hi> are beholden to you, for allowing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:5530:20"/>
them elbow roome: their Poet cries perhaps a pox go with you, but care not you for that, theres no musick without frets.</p>
               <p>Mary if either the company, or indisposition of the weather hinde you to sit it out, my counsell is then that you turne plaine Ape, take vp a rush and tickle the earnest eares of your fellow gallants, to make other fooles fall a laughing: mewe at passionate spéeches, blare at merrie, finde fault with the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, whew at the childrens Action, whistle at the songs: and aboue all, curse the sharers, that whereas the same day you had bestowed forty shillings on an embrodered Felt and Feather, (scotch-fashion) for your mistres in the Court, or your punck in the Cittie, within two houres after, you encounter with the very same block on the stage, when the haberdasher swore to you the impression was extant but that morning.</p>
               <p>To conclude, hoord vp the finest play-scraps you can get, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon which your leaue wit may most sauourly féede for want of other stuffe, when the <hi>Arcadian</hi> and <hi>Euphuird</hi> gentlewomen haue their tongues sharpened to set vpon you: that qualitie (next to your shittlecocke) is the onely furniture to a Courtier thats but a new beginner, and is but in his <hi>ABC</hi> of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The next places that are fild, after the Playhouses bée emptied, are (or ought to be) Tauernes, into a Tauerne then let vs next march, where the braines of one Hogshead must be beaten out to make vp another.</p>

The vse which you shall make of this familiarity is this: If you want money fiue or six daies together, you may still pay the reckoning, with this most Gentlemanlike language <hi>Boy, fetch me money from the Barre,</hi> and kéepe your selfe most, prouidently from a hungry melancholly in your chamber. Besides, you shal be sure (if there be but one fawcet that can betray neate wine to the barre) to haue that arraignd before you, sooner then a better and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier person.</p>

Hauing therefore receiued this bill, you shal (like a Capten putting vp déere paies) haue many Sallads stand on your table, as it were for blankes to the other more seruiceable dishes: and according to the time of the yeare, vary your face, as Capon is a stirring meate sometime, Oisters are a swelling meate sometimes, Trowt a tickling meate some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, gréene Goose, and Woodcock a delicate meate sometimes, especially in a Tauerne, where you shall sit in as great state as a Church-warden amongst his poore Parishioners at <hi>Pentecost</hi> or <hi>Christmas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For your drinke, let not your Physitian confine you to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one particular liquor: for as it is requisite that a Gentleman should not alwaies be plodding in one Art, but rather bée a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Scholler (that is, to haue a licke at all sorts of learning &amp; away) So tis not fitting a man should trouble his head with sucking at one Grape, but that he may be able (now there is a generall peace) to drink any stranger drinke in his owne ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of drinke, or more properly in his owne mist language.</p>
               <p>Your discourse at the table must be such as that which you vtter at your Ordinary: your behauiour the same, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more carelesse: for where your expence is great, let your modesty be lesse: and though you should be mad in a Tauerne, the largenesse of the <hi>Items</hi> will beare with your inciuility, you may without prick to your conscience set the want of your wit against the superfluity and sawcines of their reckonings.</p>
               <p>If you defice not to be haunted with <hi>Fidlers</hi> (who by the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute haue as much libertie as <hi>Roagues</hi> to trauell into any place, hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Reckoning (like an inditement) bids you hold vp your hand, and that you must answere it at the barre, you must not abate one peny in any particular, no, though they reckon chéese to you when you haue neither eaten any, nor could euer abide it, raw or toasted: but cast your eie onely vpon the <hi>Totalis</hi> and no furder; for to trauerse the bill, would betray you to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the rates of the market, nay more, it would make the Uintners beléeue, you were <hi>Pater-familias,</hi> and kept a house which I assure you is not now in fashion.</p>
               <p>If you fall to dice after Supper, let the drawers be as fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier with you as your Barber, and venture their siluer amongst you: no matter where they had it, you are to cherish the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftinesse of such yong tame pigions, if you be a right gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: for when two are yoakt together by the purse strings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; draw the <hi>Charriot</hi> of Madam <hi>Prodigalitie,</hi> when one faints in the way, and slips his hornes, let the other reioice and laugh at him.</p>
               <p>At your departure forth the house, to kisse mine Hostis ouer the barre, or to accept of the courtesie of the Celler, when tis offered you by the drawers (and you must know that kindnes neuer créepes vpon them, but when they sée you almost cleft

to the shoulders) or to bid any of the Uintuers good night, is as commendable, as for a Barber after trimming to laue your face with swéete water.</p>
               <p>To conclude, count it an honour either to inuite, or to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited to any Rifling, for commonly though you finde much sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there, yet you shall likewise find many cittisens sonnes, and heires, and yonger brothers there who smell out such feasts more gréedily then Taylors hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon sundaies after weddings. And let any hooke draw you either to a Fencers supper, or to a Players that acts such a part for a wager: for by this meanes you shall get experience by béeing guilty to their abhominable shauing.</p>
