            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Are we not borne so? and shall a foolish custome make vs to breake the lawes of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? our first parents so long as they went naked, were suffered to dwell in paradice, but after they got coates to their backes, they were turnd out a doores: Put on therefore either no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at all, or put it on carelesly: for looke how much more delicate libertie is then bondage, so much is the loosenesse in wearing of our attire, aboue the imprisonment of being neatly and Tailor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like drest vp in it: To be ready in our clothes, is to be ready for nothing else. A man lookes as if hee hung in chaines; or like a scar-crow: and as those excellent birds (whom <hi>Pliny</hi> could neuer haue the wit to catch in all his sprindges commonly called wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks (whereof there is great store in England) hauing all their feathers pluckt from their backes, and being turnd out as naked as <hi>Platoes</hi> cocke was before all <hi>Diogenes</hi> his Schollers: or as the Cuckooe in Christmas, are more fit to come to any Knights board, and are indÃ©ede more seruiceable then when they are lapt in their warme liueries: euen so stands the case with man. Truth (because the bald-pate her father <hi>Time,</hi> has no haire to couer his head) goes (when she goes best) starke naked; But falshood has euer a cloake for the raine. You sÃ©e likewise that the Lyon, being the king of beasts, the horse being the lustiest crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Unicorne, whose horne is worth halfe a City, all these go with no more clothes on their backes, then what nature hath bestowed vpon them; But you <hi>Babiownes,</hi> and you Iack-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apes (being the scum, and rascality of all the hedge-crÃ©epers) they go in ierkins and mandilions: marry how? they are put into these rags onely in mockery.</p>

               <p>Sithence then the place is so frÃ©e in entertainement, allowing a stoole as well to the Farmers sonne as to your Templer: that your Stinkard has the selfe same libertie to be there in his To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-Fumes, which your swÃ©et Courtier hath: and that your Car-man and Tinker claime as strong a voice in their suffrage, and sit to giue iudgement on the plaies life and death<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as well as the prowdest <hi>Momus</hi> among the tribe of <hi>Critick</hi>: It is fit y<hi rend="sup">â€¢</hi> hÃ©e, whom the most tailors bils do make roome for, when he comes should not be basely (like a vyoll) casd vp in a corner.</p>
               <p>Whether therefore the gatherers of the publique or priuate Play-house stand to receiue the afternoones rent, let our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant (hauing paid it) presently aduance himselfe vp to the Throne of the Stage.

yet no man shal once offer to hinder you from obtaining the title of an insolent ouer-wÃ©ening Coxcombe.</p>
               <p>By sitting on the stage, you may (without trauelling for it) at the very next doore, aske whose play it is: and by that <hi>Quest</hi> of <hi>Inquiry,</hi> the law warrants you to auoid much mistaking: if you know not the author, you may raile against him: and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture so behaue your selfe, that you may enforce the Author to know you.</p>
               <p>By sitting on the stage, if you be a Knight, you may happily get you a Mistresse: if a mÃ©ere <hi>Fleet-street</hi> Gentleman, a wife; but assure your selfe by continuall residence, you are the first and principall man in election to begin the number of <hi>We three.</hi>

                  </gap>itting on the stage, you may (with small cost) purchase the dÃ©ere acquaintance of the boyes: haue a good stoole for six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: at any time know what particular part any of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants present: get your match lighted, examine the play-suits lace, and perhaps win wagers vpon laying tis copper, &amp;c. And to conclude whether you be a foole or a Iustice of peace, a Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold or a Capten, a Lord Maiors sonne or a dawcocke, a knaue or an vnder Shreife, of what stamp soeuer you be, currant or counterfet, the Stagelike time will bring you to most perfect light, and lay you open: neither are you to be hunted from thence though the Scar-crowes in the yard, hoot at you, hisse at you, spit at you, yea throw durt euen in your tÃ©eth: tis most Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman like patience to endure all this, and to laugh at the silly Animals; but if the <hi>Rabble</hi> with a full throat, crie away with the foole, you were worse then a mad-man to tarry by it: for the Gentleman and the foole should neuer sit on the Stage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

Present not your selfe on the Stage (especially at a new play) vntill the quaking prologue hath (by rubbing) got cullor into his chÃ©ekes, and is ready to giue the trumpets their Cue that hÃ©es vpon point to enter: for then it is time, as though you were one of the <hi>Properties,</hi> or that you dropt out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

It shall crowne you with rich commendation to laugh alowd in the middest of the most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and saddest scene of the terriblest Tragedy: and to let that clapper (your tongue) be tost so high that all the house may ring of it: your Lords vse it; your Knights are Apes to the Lords, and do so too: your Inne-a-court-man is Zany to the Knights, and (many very scuruily) comes likewise limping after it: bee thou a beagle to them all, and neuer lin snuffing till you haue sented them: for by talking and laughing (like a Plough-man in a Morris) you heape <hi>Pelion</hi> vpon <hi>Ossa,</hi> glory vpon glory: As first, all the eyes in the galleries will leaue walking after the Players, and onely follow you: the simplest dolt in the house snatches vp your name, and when he mÃ©etes you in the strÃ©etes, or that you fall into his hands in the middle of a Watch, his word shall be taken for you, hÃ©ele cry, <hi>Hees such a Gallant,</hi> and you passe. Secondly, you publish<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> your temperance to the world, in that you sÃ©eme not to resort thither to taste vaine pleasures with a hungrie appetite; but onely as a Gentleman, to spend a foolish houre or two, because you can doe nothing else.

to shun Shoulder-clapping, and to ship away your Cockatrice betimes in the morning it addes a kind of state vnto you, to be carried from thence to the staires of your Play-house: hate a Sculler (remember that) worse then to be acquainted with one ath Scullery. No, your Oares are your onely Sea-crabs, boord them, &amp; take hÃ©ed you neuer go twice together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one paire: often shifting is a great credit to Gentlemen: &amp; that diuiding of your Fare wil make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore watersnaks be ready to pul you in pÃ©eres to enioy your custome: No matter whether vpon landing you haue money or no, you may swim in twentie of their boates ouer the riuer, vpon <hi>Ticket</hi>: mary when siluer comes in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to pay trebble their fare, &amp; it will make your Flounder-catchers to send more thankes after you, when you doe not draw, then when you doe: for they know, It will be their owne another daie.</p>
               <p>Before the Play begins, fall to cardes, you may win or loose (as <hi>Fencers</hi> doe in a prize) and beate one another by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie, yet share the money when you mÃ©ete at supper: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, to gul the <hi>Ragga-muffins</hi> that stand a loofe gaping at you, throw the cards (hauing first torne foure or fiue of them) round about the Stage, iust vpon the third sound, as though you had lost: it skils not if the foure knaues ly on their backs, and outface the Audience, theres none such fooles as dare take exceptions at them, because ere the play go off, better knaues then they will fall into the company.</p>
               <p>Now sir, if the writer be a fellow that hath either epigramd you, or hath had a flirt at your mistris, or hath brought either your feather or your red beard, or your little legs &amp;c. on the stage, you shall disgrace him worse then by tossing him in a blancket, or giuing him the bastinado in a Tauerne, if in the middle of his play, (bee it Pastorall or Comedy, Morall or Tragedie) you rise with a skreud and discontented face from your stoole to be gone: no matter whether the Scenes be good or no, the better they are, the worse doe you distast them: and bÃ©eing on your fÃ©ete, sneake not away like a coward, but salute all your gentle acquaintance, that are spred either on the rushes, or on stooles about you, and draw what troope you can from the stage after you: the <hi>Mimicks</hi> are beholden to you, for allowing

them elbow roome: their Poet cries perhaps a pox go with you, but care not you for that, theres no musick without frets.</p>
               <p>Mary if either the company, or indisposition of the weather hinde you to sit it out, my counsell is then that you turne plaine Ape, take vp a rush and tickle the earnest eares of your fellow gallants, to make other fooles fall a laughing: mewe at passionate spÃ©eches, blare at merrie, finde fault with the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, whew at the childrens Action, whistle at the songs: and aboue all, curse the sharers, that whereas the same day you had bestowed forty shillings on an embrodered Felt and Feather, (scotch-fashion) for your mistres in the Court, or your punck in the Cittie, within two houres after, you encounter with the very same block on the stage, when the haberdasher swore to you the impression was extant but that morning.</p>
               <p>To conclude, hoord vp the finest play-scraps you can get, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon which your leaue wit may most sauourly fÃ©ede for want of other stuffe, when the <hi>Arcadian</hi> and <hi>Euphuird</hi> gentlewomen haue their tongues sharpened to set vpon you: that qualitie (next to your shittlecocke) is the onely furniture to a Courtier thats but a new beginner, and is but in his <hi>ABC</hi> of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The next places that are fild, after the Playhouses bÃ©e emptied, are (or ought to be) Tauernes, into a Tauerne then let vs next march, where the braines of one Hogshead must be beaten out to make vp another.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hosoeuer desires to bee a man of good recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Cittie, and (like your French Lord) to haue as many tables furnisht, as Lackies (who when they kÃ©epe least, kÃ©epe none (whether he be a yong <hi>Quat</hi> of the first yÃ©eres reuennew, or some nustere and sullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facd steward, who (in despight of a great heard, a satten suite, and a chaine of gold wrapt in cipers) proclaimes himselfe to any (but to those to whom his Lord owes money) for a ranck coxcombe, or whether he be a country gentleman that brings
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5530:20"/>
his wife vp to learne the fashion, sÃ©e the Tombs at Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, the Lyons in the Tower, or to take physicke, or else is some yong Farmer, who many times makes his wife (in the country) belÃ©eue he hath suits in law, because he will come vp to his letchery: be he of what stamp he will that hath money in his purse, and a good conscience to spend it, my councell is that hÃ©e take his continuall diet at a Tauerne, which (out of question) is the onely <hi>Rende-vous</hi> of boone company; and the Drawers the most nimble, the most bold, and most sudden proclaimers of your largest bounty.</p>
               <p>Hauing therefore thrust your selfe into a case most in fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (how course soeuer the stuffe be, tis no matter so it hold fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion) your office is (if you meane to do your iudgement right) to enquire out those Tauernes which are best customd, whose maisters are oftenest drunke (for that confirmes their taste, and that they choose wholesome wines) and such as stand furthest from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counters, where landing your self &amp; your followers, your first complement-shall be-to grow most inwardly acquainted with the drawers, to learne their names, as <hi>Iack,</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Tom,</hi> to diue into their inclinations, as whether this fellow vseth to the Fencing Schoole, this to the Dauncing Schoole; whether that yong coniurer (in Hogsheads) at midnight, kÃ©epes a Gelding now and then to visit his Cockatrice, or whether he loue dogs, or be addicted to any other eminent and Citizen-like quality: and protest your selfe to be extreamely in loue, and that you spend much money in a yeare, vpon any one of those exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which you perceiue is, followed by them. The vse which you shall make of this familiarity is this: If you want money fiue or six daies together, you may still pay the reckoning, with this most Gentlemanlike language <hi>Boy, fetch me money from the Barre,</hi> and kÃ©epe your selfe most, prouidently from a hungry melancholly in your chamber. Besides, you shal be sure (if there be but one fawcet that can betray neate wine to the barre) to haue that arraignd before you, sooner then a better and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier person.</p>
               <p>The first question you are to make (after the discharging of your pocket of Tobacco and pipes, and the houshold stuffe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belonging) shall be for an inuentorie of the Kitchen: for it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5530:21"/>
were more then most Tailor-like, and to be suspected you were in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eague with some Kitchen-wench, to descend your selfe, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your stomach with the sight of the Larder, and happily to greaze your Acconstrements. Hauing therefore receiued this bill, you shal (like a Capten putting vp dÃ©ere paies) haue many Sallads stand on your table, as it were for blankes to the other more seruiceable dishes: and according to the time of the yeare, vary your face, as Capon is a stirring meate sometime, Oisters are a swelling meate sometimes, Trowt a tickling meate some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, grÃ©ene Goose, and Woodcock a delicate meate sometimes, especially in a Tauerne, where you shall sit in as great state as a Church-warden amongst his poore Parishioners at <hi>Pentecost</hi> or <hi>Christmas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For your drinke, let not your Physitian confine you to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one particular liquor: for as it is requisite that a Gentleman should not alwaies be plodding in one Art, but rather bÃ©e a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Scholler (that is, to haue a licke at all sorts of learning &amp; away) So tis not fitting a man should trouble his head with sucking at one Grape, but that he may be able (now there is a generall peace) to drink any stranger drinke in his owne ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of drinke, or more properly in his owne mist language.</p>
               <p>Your discourse at the table must be such as that which you vtter at your Ordinary: your behauiour the same, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more carelesse: for where your expence is great, let your modesty be lesse: and though you should be mad in a Tauerne, the largenesse of the <hi>Items</hi> will beare with your inciuility, you may without prick to your conscience set the want of your wit against the superfluity and sawcines of their reckonings.</p>
               <p>If you defice not to be haunted with <hi>Fidlers</hi> (who by the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute haue as much libertie as <hi>Roagues</hi> to trauell into any place, hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ng the pasport of the house about them) bring then no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men along with you; but if you loue the company of all the drawers, neuer suppe without your Cockatrice: for hauing her there, you shall be sure of most officious attendance. Enquire what Gallants sup in the next roome, and if they be any of your acquaintance, do not you (after the City fashion) send them in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ottle of wine, and your name swÃ©etned in two pittifull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Suger, with some filthy Apologie cramd into the mouth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5530:21"/>
of a Drawer; but rather kÃ©epe a boy in fÃ©e, who vnder hand shall proclaime you in euery roome, what a gallant fellow you are, how much you spend yearely in Tauernes, what a great gamester, what custome you bring to the house, in what witty discourse you maintaine a table, what Gentlewomen, or Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens wiues you can with a wet finger haue at any time to sup with you, and such like. By which <hi>Encomiasticks</hi> of his, they that know you not: shall admire you; and thinke themselues to bÃ©e brought into a paradice but to be meanely in your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and if any of your endÃ©ered friends be in the house, and beate the same Iuy-bush that your selfe does, you may ioyne companies and bee drunke together most publikly.</p>
               <p>But in such a deluge of drinke, take hÃ©ede that no man coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit him selfe drunck, to frÃ©e his purse from the danger of the shot: tis an vsuall thing now amongst gentlemen, it had wont bÃ©e the qualitie of Cockne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>es, I would aduise you to leaue so much braines in your head, as to preuent this. When the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Reckoning (like an inditement) bids you hold vp your hand, and that you must answere it at the barre, you must not abate one peny in any particular, no, though they reckon chÃ©ese to you when you haue neither eaten any, nor could euer abide it, raw or toasted: but cast your eie onely vpon the <hi>Totalis</hi> and no furder; for to trauerse the bill, would betray you to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the rates of the market, nay more, it would make the Uintners belÃ©eue, you were <hi>Pater-familias,</hi> and kept a house which I assure you is not now in fashion.</p>
               <p>If you fall to dice after Supper, let the drawers be as fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier with you as your Barber, and venture their siluer amongst you: no matter where they had it, you are to cherish the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftinesse of such yong tame pigions, if you be a right gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: for when two are yoakt together by the purse strings<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> &amp; draw the <hi>Charriot</hi> of Madam <hi>Prodigalitie,</hi> when one faints in the way, and slips his hornes, let the other reioice and laugh at him.</p>
               <p>At your departure forth the house, to kisse mine Hostis ouer the barre, or to accept of the courtesie of the Celler, when tis offered you by the drawers (and you must know that kindnes neuer crÃ©epes vpon them, but when they sÃ©e you almost cleft
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:5530:22"/>
to the shoulders) or to bid any of the Uintuers good night, is as commendable, as for a Barber after trimming to laue your face with swÃ©ete water.</p>
               <p>To conclude, count it an honour either to inuite, or to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited to any Rifling, for commonly though you finde much sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there, yet you shall likewise find many cittisens sonnes, and heires, and yonger brothers there who smell out such feasts more grÃ©edily then Taylors hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t vpon sundaies after weddings. And let any hooke draw you either to a Fencers supper, or to a Players that acts such a part for a wager: for by this meanes you shall get experience by bÃ©eing guilty to their abhominable shauing.</p>
