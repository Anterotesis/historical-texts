            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Such who are to be true and proper Reformers, they muſt have a lawfull Calling thereunto: duties which God hath impaled in for ſome particular perſons; amongſt theſe actions, Reformation of Churches is chiefe: Now the Supreme Power alone hath a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling to reforme a Church, as it plainly appeares by the Kings of Iudah in their Kingdome.</p>

or carnall ſecuritie, not upon a Popiſh implicite faith, but to let every man be perſwaded in his own minde, that it be grounded upon a neceſſary Cauſe, and taken ſoberly, adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, diſcreetly, reverently, and in the rear of God.</p>

               <head>Quaere II. How can it conſiſt with the Oath?</head>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>OF Supremacy.</hi> For if he be once ſupream over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in all cauſes Eccleſiaſticall and Temporall, how can I ſwear to ſubject him, or bring him under any perſon, in any Cauſe whatſoever? and though the chief occaſion of that Oath was upon the Popes pretending juriſdiction, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and extention was to ſhut all his Subjects under the ſame condition of Obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Of Allegiance,</hi> For I am bound Firſt, To defend the King and his Succeſſours to the uttermoſt of my power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Treaſons, &amp; Conſpiracies againſt his Perſon, Crown and dignity. Secondly, To doe my beſt endeavour to reveal all Conſpiracies I know or hear againſt him or any of them, and Third, That no perſon whatſoever hath power to abſolve me of the Oath, and All which ſeem to be endangered by taking up Armes againſt him, or his life-guard, or the forces raiſed by him.</p>

3. <hi>Of the late Proteſtation,</hi> in regard of a double ſeeming Contradiction.

For though there be many ſtrange Fancies, and doctrines in the Church of England, yet there is but One expreſſe Doctrine of the Church of England, and that is conteined in the 39 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and Book of Common Prayer (to which all the regular Clergy muſt ſubſcribe) and are confirmed by an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now one Proteſtant point of our Religion, expreſſed in the Doctrine of this Church, is in the 37 <hi>Article,</hi> Viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Kings Majeſty hath the Chief power</hi> (id eſt, <hi>ſupremacy) in this Realme of England, unto whom the Chiefe gouernment of All Eſtates of this Realme, whether Eccleſiaſticall or Civill, in all Cauſes doth appertaine, To Rule All eſtates and degrees committed to his charge, and to reſtrain with the ſword the Stubborne and evill doers,</hi> which hee cannot doe if the Sword or Militia bee taken from him.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That the two Books of Homilies containes a godly and wholſome Doctrine and are to be read in Churches by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters (not only reading Miniſters) diligently and diſtinctly, that they may be underſtood of the people.</hi>
