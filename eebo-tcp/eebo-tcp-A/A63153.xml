         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And being here Charged with divers Facts, it was neceſſary for me to have divers Witneſſes; and they are diſperſt: And therefore I beg of Your Lordſhip that my Tryal may be put off, that I may get my Witneſſes together.</p>

               <p>On Wedneſday laſt in the Afternoon I had notice, and not before then. But being kept ſo cloſe Priſoner, I had not the opportunity of any Council till Friday at Noon; and then it being but two days, and I in diſtreſs and hardſhip, it was impoſſible for me to get my Witneſſes together.</p>

Accordingly the Priſoner, amongſt others challenged two, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning as a Cauſe, that they were the King's Servants. But he was told by the Court that that was no Cauſe of Challenge; but the King's Counſel did not inſiſt on that, if there were enough beſides. And this was ſaid, that it might not go for a Precedent, that this is a ſufficient Reaſon for a Challenge. The Twelve that were ſworn, were,</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, This Indictment does contain as heavy an Accuſation as ever was brought againſt any one: For it charges the Priſoner not only with the traiterous Deſign of ſubverting the Government, and of killing the King; but alſo it charges the Priſoner with deſigning an Invaſion upon theſe Kingdoms, and an Aſſaſſination of the King's Perſon. The Indictment ſets forth, that the Priſoner did meet with Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> and other falſe Traitors; and there it was agreed how to procure ſome French Forces to land here in <hi>England,</hi> and alſo to raiſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt his Majeſty within this Kingdom. Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> was ſent as a Meſſenger from the Priſoner and the reſt, over to the late King <hi>James,</hi> to acquaint him with this bloody Deſign, and to deſire him to procure and borrow of the French King as many Forces as he could ſpare, to make this Deſcent upon theſe Kingdoms: and to facilitate his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, they promiſed to get as many together as they could, to meet him upon his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And it was agreed that forty Men ſhould be provided, of which the Priſoner was one, to lie in wait, and ſet upon the King in his Return from Hunting, and to Aſſaſſinate him. Some were to fall upon the Guards, while others murdered the King in his Coach.</p>
               <p>The Indictment further charges the Priſoner with providing ſeveral Horſes and Arms, and that he did provide five Horſes for them that were to commit the Aſſaſſination. And the Indictment alſo does charge the Priſoner with getting together ſeveral Arms. To this Indictment the Priſoner has pleaded not Guilty. If you do not believe him Guilty of what the Indictment charges him with, God forbid but he ſhould be acquitted. But if you believe him Guilty, the Nation does expect you ſhould do Juſtice to the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, the Priſoner, Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> ſtands indicted of High Treaſon, for compaſſing and endeavouring the Death of the King, and adhering to his Majeſty's Enemies. The Overt-acts laid in the Indictment to prove this Treaſon are theſe; That the Priſoner, together with ſeveral others, had ſeveral Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Conſultations, wherein it was agreed to ſend a Meſſenger over to invite the French King to invade this Kingdom, and to depoſe the King, and ſubject this Kingdom to the Tyranny of a French Power. And further, that he entred into a Conſpiracy with ſeveral Perſons to murder his Majeſty. Theſe are the Overt-acts to prove this Treaſon againſt the Priſoner. The Evidence to prove this will be in this manner: It will appear, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner had a Commiſſion from the late K. <hi>James</hi> to raiſe a Regiment of Horſe in <hi>England;</hi> and that in <hi>May</hi> laſt the Priſoner had a Meeting with ſeveral others at the Old King's-head in <hi>Leadenhall-ſtreet,</hi> where there were preſent the Lord <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> the Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> Sir <hi>John Fenwick,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> came in after Dinner. At that Meeting it was conſulted among them, how they ſhould bring back the late King <hi>James,</hi> and depoſe his preſent Majeſty King <hi>William.</hi> And in order to that, did reſolve to ſend a Meſſenger, Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> one of them, to the late King <hi>James,</hi> to deſire him that he would obtain from the French King about ten thouſand Men to invade this Kingdom; eight thouſand Foot, a thouſand Horſe, and a thouſand Dragoons: And to incourage the late King <hi>James</hi> to do this, they did aſſure him by their Meſſenger, they would meet him with two thouſand Horſe upon his Landing. They all agreed they would do this, and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> did agree to go upon this Errand. About a Week after Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> not being willing to go without good Aſſurance from them that ſent him, did deſire there might be another Meeting. And accordingly there was another Meeting of the ſame Perſons, of which the Priſoner was one; and that was at Mrs. <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s, a Tavern in <hi>James-ſtreet.</hi> And at that Meeting they did all agree, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, to continue the Reſolution they had taken, to ſend Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> over to the late King <hi>James,</hi> to aſſure him of their Aſſiſtance, if he would give them notice when and where he would land. And they did take notice, that that was a very proper time for ſuch an Invaſion to be attempted; for the King was then gone into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and moſt of the Forces were drawn thither, and the People very much diſſatisfied; and therefore it would be very eaſy to accompliſh ſuch a Deſign at that time. And they did therefore deſire Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> to go upon that Errand, and to deſire that the late King <hi>James</hi> would be ſpeedy in his Coming. After a few days Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> did go to <hi>France,</hi> and delivered his Meſſage to the late King <hi>James,</hi> who took it very kindly, but ſaid, the French King could not ſpare ſo many Forces at that time. And he came over again, and brought that Meſſage to thoſe Gentlemen that ſent him. This was in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> laſt, and ſo the Conſpiracy ceaſed at that time. But you will hear, laſt Winter it was revived again, and was attempted and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65373:5"/>
carried on very near to a fatal Succeſs. You will hear, Gentlemen, that the Priſoner at the Bar has had as great a hand as any in this barbarous Conſpiracy and Treaſon; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Invaſion that he and the reſt ſent the Meſſenger over to procure, but in the blackeſt part, the Aſſaſſination of the King. About <hi>January</hi> laſt Sir <hi>G. Berclay,</hi> Lieutenant of the Guards to the late King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was ſent over into <hi>England,</hi> to excite Perſons to go on in the aſſaſſinating of the King; and for his Aſſiſtance there were ſent over, before and after him, about twenty Troopers of the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Guards in <hi>France:</hi> and Sir <hi>G. Berclay,</hi> to incourage Perſons to ingage in this horrid Conſpiracy, brought over with him a pretended Authority from the late King <hi>James</hi> to juſtify them; and that was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the late King <hi>James.</hi> He communicates this Deſign of his to Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> and others; and amongſt the reſt to the Priſoner at the Bar, having a great Confidence in him. He did acquaint him he had ſuch a Commiſſion, and ſhewed it him; and that the Commiſſion was to levy War againſt the King's Perſon, which they took as a ſufficient Authority to attack his Perſon. In order to the accompliſhing this horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, ſeveral Meetings there were, at which the Priſoner was preſent, and very active, ſometimes at Capt. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodgings, at other times at the Nag's-head in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and the Sun-Tavern in the <hi>Strand.</hi> You will hear, that at theſe Meetings they did propoſe ſeveral Ways and Methods to accompliſh this Conſpiracy; and ſeveral Perſons, ſome of which have ſuffered the juſt Puniſhment of the Law, were appointed to go and view the Ground, where moſt conveniently the King's Perſon might be aſſaulted. <hi>King,</hi> that has been executed for it, and Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> and one <hi>Knightly,</hi> went to view the Ground, to ſee the moſt convenient Place. And the Day before they went, there was a Meeting, at which was preſent the Priſoner and ſeveral others, where it was reſolved upon, that they ſhould go and view the Ground; and Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knightly,</hi> and Mr. <hi>King,</hi> accordingly went to ſee the moſt convenient Place. After that, at <hi>Brentford,</hi> they went over to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> where his Majeſty uſed to go a hunting to divert himſelf. At laſt they pitch'd upon a Place, a Lane between <hi>Brentford</hi> and <hi>Turnham-green,</hi> and they thought that a convenient Place for doing this barbarous thing. And when they had viewed the Ground, they were to come back in the Evening to the Nag's-head-Tavern, where the reſt were to meet, to give them an Account of their Proceedings. Accordingly in the Evening they came back, and at the ſaid Place were the Priſoner, Sir <hi>G. Berclay,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> and others; and there they had an Account of the thing, and they did reſolve it ſhould be done in that Place; and the manner was this, That Sir <hi>G. Berclay,</hi> with ſeven or eight cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the reſt, were to attack the King's Coach, and (to kill the King, while the other Party were to attack the Guards; and the Number in all was to be about forty. This was agreed upon. And the firſt time they agreed upon to put this barbarous Deſign in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, was the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> upon a Saturday, the day the King uſually went a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But it happened, by very great Providence, that the King did not go abroad that day. They contrived further, to make the thing very ſure, that there ſhould be two Perſons, whom they called Orderly Men, that ſhould be placed at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> to give notice when the King went abroad, one <hi>Chambers,</hi> and <hi>Durance</hi> a Fleming.</p>
               <p>And afterwards <hi>Durance</hi> was likewiſe imployed to view the Place at <hi>Turnham-Green</hi> and to take notice of thoſe Places that were moſt convenient for the lodging and placing of their Men two or three in a Houſe, that they might not be obſerved to be in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Day they were to accompliſh their Deſign.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> they being diſappointed by the King's not going abroad, they reſolved to accompliſh it upon the Saturday following, the King uſually going a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Saturdays, and therefore that Day was pitch'd upon. Accordingly on the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following there was another Meeting at the <hi>Nags-Head</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> where were preſent Sir <hi>George Berclay,</hi> Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> and the Priſoner. There they had ſome Diſcourſe, and were in doubt, becauſe of the firſt Diſappointment they had received, whether there were not ſome Diſcovery, and the thing taken Air; but they were ſoon reſolved of that, for it was ſaid, if the thing had been diſcovered they ſhould not have been there to meet; that ſeemed very probable, and gave them new Aſſurance that they were not diſcovered; and thereupon they reſolved to put it in execution the next Day, the Day which they had before reſolved on, being Saturday the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> and to do it in the ſame manner as had been reſolved on before. At that meeting Captain <hi>Porter</hi> told them he had had a Misfortune, that ſome of the Horſes he had undertaken to provide were fallen Lame; he acquainted the Priſoner, Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> with it; and he was careful to ſupply him with other Horſes, and told him he could get him a note to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65373:6"/>
one <hi>Lewis,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe to the Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> for three Horſes out of his Stable; and accordingly did ſend him a Note for three Horſes to be had from thence. <hi>February</hi> the <hi>2<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d</hi> in the Morning, the Time appointed to put it in Execution, they met together, and had notice from <hi>Kenſington</hi> that the King did go a Hunting; and then there was great Joy among them all, for then they thought they ſhould be ſure to accompliſh their Deſign, and ſo they ordered all things to be got ready. But afterwards, about twelve a Clock, News came that the King did not go abroad, that the Coaches were come back, and the Horſes all of a Foam; and then they thought it had taken Air, and that they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and that put them into a great Conſternation. Now, Gentlemen, this is the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you will have by the Evidence, of the Conſpiracy for Aſſaſſinating the King, at the ſeveral Meetings at which the Priſoner was preſent. There will be a little more Evidence if there be occaſion, to confirm this, as to the part the Priſoner had in this barbarous Conſpiracy: For it will appear to you, Gentlemen, the Priſoner had a Commiſſion from the late King <hi>James</hi> to raiſe a Regiment of Horſe, and had ſent a Meſſenger on purpoſe to invite the late Kings <hi>James</hi> over about <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> laſt, and he had provided many Arms for that purpoſe. About <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt he ſent a Parcel of choice Goods, as he called them, put into ſeveral Caſes, there were ſeven or eight of them; and they were put into three large Caſes, and ſent by his order from his Houſe in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> to one <hi>Heywood</hi>'s. It ſeems this <hi>Heywood</hi> married Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi>'s Siſter, and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> ſent a Lettter to <hi>Heywood,</hi> to deſire him to lodg ſome Goods in his Houſe of Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi>'s, for he durſt not truſt them in his own Houſe in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> becauſe he had no Servants to look after them, and did deſire they might be lodged in his Houſe, and he gave him a Letter directed to <hi>Heywood.</hi> And they were accordingly carried to <hi>Heywood</hi>'s, and locked up, and privately kept till this horrid Conſpiracy came out: and then the Priſoner ſent his own Servant down the Tueſday after the Diſcovery, and gave him order immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to go down to <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> to one <hi>Evans</hi> his Servant there, to deſire him to remove all thoſe Goods away with all Expedition, and to ſecure and hide them. Accordingly on Wedneſday, the Day after, he came thither, and acquainted <hi>Evans</hi> with his Meſſage; and they went on <hi>Aſh-wedneſday</hi> in the dark with a Cart, and they were deſired to ſtay till the next Day; but they could not ſtay longer, but would have the Goods removed that very Night; and accordingly they were carried from thence to Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi>'s Houſe, and they were buried in the Ground to preſerve them, being Goods of very great Value. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſearch being made in Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Houſe, and when they came to be diſcovered, and the Caſes broke open, you will hear they were Goods of great Concern, of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Nature, 32 Carbines, 25 Caſes of Piſtels, and 4 dozen of Swords: So that this will make it apparent without diſpute, how far the Priſoner has ingaged in Levying of War, and encouraging an Invaſion.Further it will appear upon the Priſoner, that he had a conſiderable number of Horſes at his Houſe in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> for he had another Houſe at <hi>Buſhy</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire;</hi> ſome of theſe were brought up to the <hi>George-Inn</hi> in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn.</hi> But there is another thing I muſt open to you before that of the Horſes: About <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt the Priſoner did acquaint one Mr. <hi>Sweet,</hi> an Officer of the <hi>Exciſe,</hi> (I am very ſorry we ſhould have any Officers any where truſted with High-Treaſon, as he was) The Priſoner gave him an Account, that he had aſſurance formerly that the late K. <hi>James</hi> would land, but now he had it under his own Hand that he would land ſpeedily; and he had made Preparation on purpoſe to meet him, and that great things were expected from him, and that he had his own Troop ready that conſiſted chiefly of old Soldiers, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons would be Voluntiers under him. He told him he was to go into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and that there were ſeveral Gentlemen from the North and the Weſt to meet together, to ſettle a Correſpondence, and to conſult of Methods how to meet the late King upon his landing.
And accordingly he did go, and you will have an Account he came to <hi>Leiceſter</hi> on Friday night, and Captain <hi>Scudmore</hi> went with him, and he ſtaied all Saturday, and part of Sunday. And while he was there, there came ſeveral Perſons to him, particularly Capt. <hi>Yarborough</hi> Son of Sir <hi>Thomas Yarborough,</hi> and another Perſon with him; they came as far as <hi>York</hi> to meet with the Priſoner at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and ſeveral other Perſons, and there was a great Reſort to them at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> at that Time. Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> came back to <hi>Buſhy</hi> on Monday Night, and acquainted <hi>Sweet</hi> again, that he had been his Journey to <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and met ſeveral Gentlemen from the North and the Weſt, and found them all fully engaged in the Deſign for the Service of the late King <hi>James,</hi> and that there was no danger of the miſcarrying of it; this was in <hi>January</hi> laſt that this Expedition was made by the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

Afterwards you will have a farther Account of the Horſes of the Priſoner, it was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate that thoſe Horſes were generally brought to Town the Evening before the Day the King was to be Aſſaſſinated. <hi>Feb.</hi> 14. Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> being in Town the Day before, ſent to his Groom to bring up three of his Horſes the 14th of <hi>February</hi> in the Afternoon; which Horſes were all furniſhed for Troopers, and had Saddles and Piſtols for that purpoſe: And his Servant brought them according to his Order, and acquainted him <hi>Friday</hi> in the Afternoon, <hi>February</hi> the 14th that he had brought them (he lodged in <hi>Norfolk ſtreet</hi> with Mr. <hi>Charnock);</hi> Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> pretended to him at firſt, that he would go out of Town that Evenening; but then changed his Mind, and told him he muſt get them ready on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15th, the firſt Day the Aſſaſſination was intended: And in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when his Man came to him to know when his Horſes were to be got ready, he told him he had changed his Mind, he would not go that Day, he would not go out of Town till <hi>Monday;</hi> for the Deſign miſcarried by the King's not going abroad; and then Major <hi>Homes,</hi> who was one of the Conſpirators, went out of Town with him, as you will hear, and they came to Town again the 21th of <hi>February,</hi> which was the day before the Day of the intended Aſſaſſination; then there were more Horſes brought up, four or five, and all of them with Piſtols, Jack-boots, and other Furniture proper for Troopers. They came up on <hi>Friday</hi> to the <hi>George,</hi> and the Priſoner gave order to this particular Servant that came up with him, <hi>James Ewbanck,</hi> who was his Groom, to go very early the next Morning to <hi>Kenſington,</hi> it was <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22th, and he was to go to one <hi>Brown,</hi> as he ſaid, that was concerned in the King's Kitchin or his Confectionary, and lived about two Doors above the Gate turning to the King's Houſe; and that he was to tell him he was Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> Servant, and that he came from a Man that lodged at a Confectioners Houſe over againſt <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> which, by the Deſcription of the Perſon, will appear to be Sir <hi>George Berclay,</hi> and he would give him an Anſwer. The Man went accordingly about eight a Clock, and ſpoke with this <hi>Brown,</hi> and told him that he was Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi>'s Man, and that he came from the Gentleman that lodged at the <hi>Confectioners</hi> over againſt <hi>Grays-Inn. Brown</hi> ſaid he had nothing to ſay to him, but bid him give him his Almanack, and wrote in it, that he would be in Town himſelf in two Hours, and bid him to carry that to the Man that lodged at the <hi>Confectioners</hi>'s. This Man you will hear was one of thoſe orderly Men lodged at <hi>Kenſington</hi> to give Notice; this Man went by the Name of <hi>Chambers,</hi> he will tell you what he was, he was a Scotchman, ſpoke very broad, by which it will appear ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particularly and plainly it was Sir <hi>George Berclay.</hi> This Servant came back to his Maſter, Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> asked him what he had done; he told him that he had been at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> and that <hi>Brown</hi> had ſet it down in his <hi>Almanack,</hi> that he would be in Town himſelf in two Hours. Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> bid him go to the Gentleman at the <hi>Confectioner</hi>'s, and tell him ſo much: and accordingly he went, and brought Word to Sir <hi>W. Parkins,</hi> that the Gentleman would be ready at home. Now you will find this was on <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning. About Eleven a Clock Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> with one Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> that I mentioned before, came to the <hi>George-Inn;</hi> and there <hi>Porter</hi> asked this Groom one <hi>Ewbank,</hi> whether he had received above two Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles or no, for there had been Orders given for two and twenty Saddles to be carried to the <hi>George-Inn</hi> by Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi>'s Order to furniſh other Horſes beſides his, for Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> had told his Groom there were other Horſes of his Friends that ſtood there, and bid him take care to ſee them well fed. The 22th of <hi>February</hi> when they came thither, they thought there had been more Saddles delivered than thoſe two, and he asked his Groom if he had no more than two Saddles delivered; no, ſays he, I had but two. Now Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, by the Evidence you will ſee he had provided thirty Saddles, under the Notion of buying them for the uſe of the Marqueſs of Regiment; Then, ſays Sir <hi>W. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> there is a miſtake, I have had but Two and Twenty of the Thirty, for there is but Two brought in here. This you will hear fully proved by the Evidence that will be given againſt the Priſoner. And that there may be no room to doubt but that the Priſoner was engaged in this horrid Conſpiracy, it will be proved to you by his Servants, ſo many of his Horſes coming up that day, with Piſtols and Jack-Boots, and other Arms, upon <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> at Four a Clock; and that on <hi>Saturday,</hi> after they were diſcovered and diſappointed, they ordered all away in great Hurry and Confuſion. I have opened and ſtated to you the nature of the Evidence, we ſhall call our Witneſſes and give you no further Trouble.</p>

               <p>Some Weeks before I heard of this deſigned Aſſaſſination, I came to lodge at a Houſe in <hi>Norfolk-ſtreet,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> lay, and Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> for the moſt part when he was in Town; and moſt commonly in an Evening Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> and I uſed to go to drink a Bottle. One Morning I was going out, and met him, and ask'd him where I ſhould meet him at Night? He told me he ſhould be in private Company. Muſt not I be there, ſaid I? if it be not very private, let me go with you. No, ſays he, ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are come over from <hi>France,</hi> and the Buſineſs is kept very private, there is ſomething going to be done. Then pray, ſaid I, let me be concerned in it. Says he, they ſee no body yet; in a little time you will hear more of it. A little while after I was taken with the Gout, and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> came to ſee me, and told me, Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> was come from <hi>France,</hi> and ſeveral Officers with him, and that he had a Commiſſion from the late King <hi>James</hi> to raiſe and levy War againſt the Body, upon the Perſon of King <hi>William.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Charnock.</hi> He ask't me whether I could procure any number of men? I ſaid a great many would, but I could not truſt them. Some days after they brought me to Sir <hi>G. Berclay</hi> and one <hi>Homes,</hi> a little while after I was got well of the Gout. And then there were ſeveral Meetings, one at the <hi>Globe</hi> Tavern, one at the <hi>Nags-head,</hi> where Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> was preſent, one at the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where we conſulted the beſt way to aſſaſſinate the King as he came from <hi>Richmond.</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> told me, that Sir <hi>G.

Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> asked me how many I could bring? he told me, he could bring in twenty. I told him I could bring ſeven or eight. Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> was to furniſh five Horſes, and to mount three of them with his own Men, and the other two were to be mounted with my Men, and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> was to mount the reſt.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> came in, and told us the thing was diſcovered. I ſaid, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fancy it could be diſcovered, for we could not have been there if it had been known; and thereupon we reſolved to go on with it again: And I asked Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> if his Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were in Town? and he ſaid they were to come that night. Said I, my Horſes are one ſick, and another lame. Said Sir <hi>W. Parkins,</hi> if I had known that, I could have brought more Horſes out of the Country; but juſt now I have ſent to Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe to the Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> I believe he will help me to more Horſes. And I ſent a note to Sir <hi>W.

               <p>I did not ſee him the 22d: Some of us did meet at the <hi>Blue Posts</hi> at <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> and having notice that the thing was diſcovered, I went out of Town.</p>

               <p>No truly, I do not, for I never kept an account of the Horſes coming in or out. The laſt time of his coming with Horſes, he came with four or five Horſes, to the beſt of my Knowledge, the <hi>Friday</hi> before the Plot broke out: And then he gave order to his Groom to have his Horſes ready to go out of Town on <hi>Saturday</hi> morning; but he did not go out with all his Horſes, according to his Order. But two Gentlemen went out with two of them, and ſtaied about two or three Hours, and they ſeemed hard rid. And theſe four or five Horſes went out of Town in the Afternonn; and he gave an account to his Servant that he intended to be in Town again about <hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Monday</hi> following.</p>

               <p>The Preparation was his own Troop.</p>

But I muſt tell you, Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> if any Perſon does deſign and contrive that the Realm be invaded, the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and another ſet upon the Throne, that is Treaſon, and the ſame Species of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon within the 25th of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. as that of imagining, compaſſing and deſigning his Death and Deſtruction is Now the queſtion is, Whether there be another Witneſs to prove Overt-Acts of this deſign.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>That you bought Arms.</p>

               <speaker>Sir <hi>W. Parkins.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>W. Parkins.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>After all, I did not buy thoſe Arms, and I could prove to your Lordſhip, if I had time, that thoſe Arms were in Boxes, and all ruſty, when I came firſt to my houſe in <hi>Warwickſhire.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>But why were they bury'd in your Garden? they were at Mr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s houſe before, and removed by your direction, and then carry'd to your own Houſe, and bury'd in the Garden, juſt when the Plot broke out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>W. Parkins.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, It is eaſily imagined, that no body at ſuch a time would care to have it known that he had Arms, tho' never ſo innocent, found upon him at that time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Soll. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>But you had Horſes, and Holſters, and Furniture for Horſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>W. Parkins.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I uſed to come with three or four Horſes, according as I had Friends or Servants with me; and I never uſed to keep leſs than ſeven or eight Horſes this twenty Years, and ſometimes more; and they were little Horſes, and no way fit for that ſervice that is pretended.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I hope, as to the Aſſaſſination, I am clear. Perhaps the World may think I have had an Inclination to King <hi>James,</hi> and perhaps they may not think amiſs in it; but I never had any opportunity of doing any thing, nor never did any thing for him. And I hope, by Interpretations, my Life ſhall not be taken away, and I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will pleaſe the King that I be found guilty upon ſlight Grounds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>No queſtion, it will better pleaſe the King, and every body elſe, rather that you be found innocent than guilty, if you be not guilty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>W. Parkins.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Therefore. I hope, you will not find me guilty upon Inferences, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that old ſaying, <hi>Better five guilty Men eſcape, than one innocent Man ſuffer.</hi>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>You are under a miſtake in thinking it neceſſary to have two Witneſſes to one Overt-Act; for if one Witneſs be to one, and another to another, of the ſame Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Treaſon, it is all the Law requires.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>But this is not the ſame Species of Treaſon, Levying War is one thing, and Aſſaſſinating is another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>One way by Aſſaſſination, the other by Invaſion.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>One Witneſs? it is two Witneſſes for the deſign of the Invaſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of King <hi>James.</hi>

               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkins.</speaker>
               <p>Was it poſſible for that to be true? Which way ſhould I have his Word, when I was not out of <hi>England?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>But you had Horſes, and Arms, and a Troop, and you bought Saddles, you had Thirty Saddles in order to furniſh a Troop.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkins.</speaker>
               <p>Does any Body ſwear it was in order to that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>When you talkt of the King's Landing, and that you had his Word for it; at the ſame time you had Thirty Saddles, and you ſaid your Troop did conſiſt of old Soldiers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>It wou'd be, but it was not done; I hope your Lordſhip will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that. The preſervation of Subjects, I hope, will be more acceptable than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>We will do the King right, and you too. The King and Kingdom is very nearly concerned at this time. <hi>Sir William,</hi> have you any more to ſay?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>I think there is but one Witneſs, and all the reſt is nothing but Words; and one Witneſs is not ſufficient by the Law of <hi>England.</hi> This is all I have to ſay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>I have told you my Opinion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, your Lordſhip has known me many years; my way was not for fighting, but the Gown; I was always a peaceable Man all my time, and very unlike this all my time: And now in my Old Age, that I am troubled with the Gout, and have loſt the uſe of my Right Hand, it is very unlikely that I ſhould do ſuch a thing as this. Therefore I hope you will interpret all in a milder Senſe, and that you will be favourable to me, and not inrerpret any thing to my deſtruction: And ſo I humbly ſubmit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Treby,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir William,</hi> my Lord Chief Juſtice deſires to have our Opinion. We ought to be tender in caſe of Blood; your Life is at ſtake, and we ought to be very careful concerning it. But in matters of Treaſon, the Life of the King and of all the People are likewiſe at ſtake; We muſt be indifferent in this caſe, and by the Grace of God I will be ſo. The Queſtion you propoſe, is, Whether there be Two Witneſſes in this Caſe for the matter you are Indicted for? The matter is compaſſing and imagining the King's Death. There is one Witneſs that does poſitively prove that you did agree to that deſign of Aſſaſſinating the King's Perſon, and that you did promiſe, provide, and Contribute to furniſh Horſes and Men for that Action. This is proved but by One Witneſs it is true; and if it went no further, you Objection would have good ground, there would be a defect of another Witneſs. But this compaſſing the King's Death may be made more evident by other Overt-Acts, beſides that of Aſſaſſinating. The Conſpiring with a Foreign Prince to invade this Kingdom, and providing Arms, are Overt-Acts to compaſs the King's Death; for it cannot be ſuppoſed, but that he that would have an Inſurrection and Invaſion here againſt the Perſon of the King, did intend the deſtruction of the King; He that would take away his defence, and leave him to his mortal Enemies, he can have no deſign that the King ſhould ſurvive, and call him to an account, and render vengeance to him. And therefore this being in its nature Treaſon, the providing Arms, and going up and down to raiſe Men, to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkins.</speaker>
               <p>That is not ſaid, my Lord; This is not ſaid, That I met with any, with an intent to raiſe Men, no, by no Evidence: It is ſaid I went to meet with ſome Friends; Pray, my Lord, go not beyond what the Evidence is?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>Your Words I think I did take, and I will do you no wrong. You ſaid, you went into <hi>Leiceſter-Shire,</hi> and that it was to meet your Friends; He ſays, the King's Friends. By Friends, it is plain King <hi>James</hi> his Friends, and not King <hi>William</hi>'s; As you ſpake of the King's Landing, and that at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, when every body knows King <hi>William</hi> was here, and had been ſo for ſometime.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkins.</speaker>
               <p>That of Landing was at <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> the Journey was long after.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>The coupling I make, is, that at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> you uſed the Word King, and he ſays you meant K. <hi>James;</hi> now the queſtion is, if you meant by the Word King, the ſame in <hi>January,</hi> as in <hi>December.</hi> And you ſaid further, that you found the <hi>Weſt</hi> as well inclined to the King as the <hi>North,</hi> and that a Lord's Brother was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. If by King were meant King <hi>William,</hi> how impertinent were this Diſcourſe? To ſay that the <hi>Weſt</hi> was as well inclined to King <hi>William</hi> as the <hi>North,</hi> and that a Lord's Brother was concerned; in what? in being true to King <hi>William?</hi> What a ſtrange kind of diſcourſing is this I was willing to hear you explain this as well as you can. But here is this of providing of Arms proved by Four or Five Witneſſes, and ſecreting of them in this manner: And you have no Witneſſes to prove that you provided theſe for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65373:15"/>
the uſe of the Government. It is not lawful to provide Arms, as you did: And to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vide Arms for a whole Troop, and ſecret them in this manner is the gleateſt Evidence to me that there was no other uſe of them. Whether you had provided for a whole Troop or no, I may not be skillful enough to know that? But it is plain to me, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was intended. If you had found them in your Houſe in <hi>Warwick-Shire,</hi> you ought to have diſcovered them, and have uſed them for the Government; and that when you had a Commiſſion, and not before. Then he ſays, you had a Troop.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkins.</speaker>

               <speaker>L. Ch. Just. Treby.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>Where was it, and when were they bought, and made ready? It does not appear; and I do affirm, and can prove to your Lordſhip, if you give me but one days time, that they were at my Houſe in <hi>Warwick-Shire</hi> when I firſt came there, Two years ago, or I will be Crucified, if it be not proved to your ſatisfaction that they were at my Houſe in <hi>Warwick-Shire,</hi> long before any thing of this diſcourſe was had or thought on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Rookby,</speaker>
               <p>If your Lordſhip deſire my Opinion, I ſuppoſe it is to the matter of Law propounded by <hi>Sir William Parkins.</hi> He ſays there ought to be Two Witneſſes to the ſame Overt-Act. I take the Law to be this, that there need not be Two Witneſſes to the ſame Overt-Act; But if there be One Witneſs to one Overt-Act, and another to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Overt-Act of the ſame ſpecies of Treaſon, this is Two Witneſſes in Law. Now it ſeems to be one ſpecies of Treaſon, for it is a compaſſing and deſigning the Death of the King ſeveral ways, one by Aſſaſſinating his Perſon, the other by bringing in Foreign Forces, and preparing Arms to meet that force here. Now here are many Witneſſes to prove Arms prepared and found, and ſome were preſent when the Boxes were opened, and proved that theſe Arms were directed by you the Priſoner to be ſent to <hi>Heywood</hi>'s Houſe. It is true, <hi>Mr. Charnock</hi> writ the Letter, but it was by <hi>Sir William</hi>'s directions, and <hi>Sir William Parkin's</hi> Servants fetcht them away from this place; this is as plain as any thing in the World: And this I take to be another Overt-Act, and proved by ſeveral Witneſſes, touching the ſame Treaſon, the compaſſing and imagining the Death of the King. <hi>Sir William Parkins</hi> tells you of being Educated to the Gown; I do not know what occaſion a Gown-Man ſhould have for ſo many Arms.</p>

               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>If you pleaſe to let me ſend for ſome Witneſſes, I will prove that were there Two years ago.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>It requires Two Witneſſes, and there are not Two Witneſſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Just. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>That I muſt leave to the Jury, whether the Witneſſes do not prove an Overt-Act to demonſtrate a deſign you had to depoſe the King: For if ſo be here be a deſign to deſpoſe the King from his Throne, and that be manifeſt by any Overt-Act, that is High-Treaſon by this very Act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>That I agree to; but there muſt be two Witneſſes to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, ſuppoſe the deſign be to dethrone the King one way or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one way by an Aſſaſſination, the other way by joyning in an Inſurrection or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion; there muſt be a Witneſs to each Overt-act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>There muſt be two Witneſſes to each Overt-act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>To each? No, for the new Act which commences to Morrow, declares it to be ſufficient to have one Witneſs to one Overt-act, and another to another Overt-act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>But it muſt be one Species of Treaſon.</p>

               <speaker>J. Rookby,</speaker>
               <p>That that I deliver'd my opinion in, was, that one Witneſs to one Overt Act, and another to another Overt Act. of the ſame Species of Treaſon, is good now; and I am fully confirmed by this Act of Parliament, which commences in a day or two. Let the Act be read.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>A deſign to depoſe the King, which is manifeſt by ſome Overt Act, that is an Overt Act to prove the deſign of depoſing the King; for he that deſigns to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him from his Kingly State and Dignity, if that deſign be manifeſt, that is an Overt Act for deſigning his Death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>But it muſt be manifeſted, it muſt not be by interpretation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>If that be proved, if the next Overt Act be proved, that you deſign the Kings depoſition, then it is apparent you deſign his Death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>But they are different things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Treby,</speaker>
               <p>Sir <hi>Will. Parkyns,</hi> we have ſeen a King depoſed, and yet alive, it is very true, and yet not the Succeſs that always does it. But whenever Perſons agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to bring in Foreign Forces, and prepare Arms to meet them, and make Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection againſt the King in poſſeſſion; this is reckoned an Overt Act by my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Cook;</hi> and yet thoſe Men are reckoned to be the moſt tender Men in theſe Caſes: And the reaſon is very plain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>If your Lordſhip pleaſe, let that be read.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Treby,</speaker>
               <p>For any Act that has a natural tendency to the deſtruction of the King, that is the expreſſion of an internal thought of compaſſing and imagining his Death: Providing of Arms, and making an Inſurrection againſt the King, is an Overt Act, and an agreeing to ſhoot him, is an Overt Act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>I deſire it may be read, and I am ſatisfyed.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>The new Act was then read.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Rookby,</speaker>
               <p>I believe in a great Cauſe in Parliament, my L. <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Caſe, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for Law, that one Witneſs to one Overt Act, and another to another, was declared ſufficient in Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>I believe it has been done. But yet if your Lordſhip pleaſe, here is a beneficial Law, which, if your Lordſhip had pleaſed to put off my Tryal another day, I might have had the benefit of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Rookby,</speaker>
               <p>It would have been the ſame thing as to an Overt Act, for this is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative of the ſame Law in ſeveral particulars.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, but I could have had Witneſſes to have taken them off; but here it turns upon the matter of <hi>Sweet;</hi> and it is manifeſt, he has ſpoken what cannot be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that I had the Kings word for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Rookby,</speaker>
               <p>If a Man write a Note to you, that he will do a thing, that might be ſaid to be his word, though by a Letter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>If I had it from his own Mouth, not elſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>It is not impoſſible but you might ſpeak with him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>No? It is impoſſible; for can I ſpeak from hence to <hi>France?</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> went over, but I never went over.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Rookby,</speaker>
               <p>If any man ſhould have ſaid the latter end of the laſt Month, I believe there is an Aſſaſſination intended againſt K. <hi>William,</hi> meerly becauſe he had his Word for it, we might ſay, we had the King's Word for it, that is a proper expreſſion, if it come by Letter or publick Fame.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>He might ſend you word ſo by a Meſſage.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>He manifeſtly contradicts himſelf, backward and forward, in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Captain <hi>Porter</hi> ſwears for to ſave his own Life, and the other contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Rookby.</speaker>
               <p>Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s Teſtimony has been ſufficiently confirmed by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of dying Perſons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Sir <hi>William,</hi> have you any more to ſay?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then the King's Learned Counſel ſumm'd up the Evidence to this Effect.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am of Counſel for the King in this matter, and it is my turn to ſum up the Evidence that has been given againſt the Priſoner at the Barr. He ſtands indicted for compaſſing and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the death of the King, for deſigning to depoſe the King, and by an Inſurrection, incouraging and abetting the King's Enemies, and doing what he could to procure an Invaſion upon his own Countrey. Some of theſe Crimes run into one another; deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the death of the King, the Aſſaſſinating, and depoſing of the King, amount to the very ſame thing, it is compaſſing and imagining the death of the King. My Lords the Judges have given you their Opinion in that point of Law, and it is, I think, agreeable to all the reſolutions ſince the making of that Statute. I think this Statute made in the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. was explained in the time of his Succeſſor, <hi>Rich.</hi> 2d. but I am ſure in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65373:16"/>
time of <hi>Henry</hi> 4th. when it was deſigned to ſet up <hi>Richard,</hi> it was adjudged High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for compaſſing and deſigning the death of the King. For depoſing of him, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying him in his politick Capacity, and Aſſaſſinating of him, was to deſtroy him in his natural Capacity. The deſign was to overthrow the preſent Government eſtabliſh'd by Law, whereby every Man injoys his own Property, every Man injoys his own Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and thoſe that will be quiet, may have their own Liberty, as well as at any time they ever had it. But ſome People are very impatient, they are not contented to have ſervitude themſelves, but would bring it upon their Fellow Subjects. And it would not be very ill, if thoſe that be in love with it, would go where they may fill their Bellies with it, in another place where they may have it, and not bring it upon thoſe that would be very impatient under it, as we all are, and I hope ſhall always be.</p>
               <p>To prove the Invaſion, we have Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> and he tells you he had ſeen a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Late K. <hi>James,</hi> all written with his own hand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>I beg your pardon, he does not ſay ſuch a word. I beg, my Lord, the Witneſſes may be called.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>If I remember right, Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ſaid you had read the Commiſſion, and it was writ with K. <hi>James</hi>'s own hand, and he ſaid it was becauſe he could not truſt his Miniſters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord, he ſaid not ſo; but all I ſaid, was that <hi>Scudmore</hi> was to take one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> give my Lord and the Jury an account what Sir <hi>Will. Parkyns</hi> told you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt. Porter,</speaker>
               <p>I askt Capt. <hi>Charnock,</hi> if I might not ſee the Commiſſion; he told me he never ſaw it himſelf, but that Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> had, and that it was written with K. <hi>James</hi>'s own Hand. He ſaid, Sir <hi>Will. Parkyns</hi> ſaid it was to raiſe War againſt the King's Perſon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>By whoſe Hand was it writ?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt. Porter,</speaker>
               <p>With the King's own Hand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did he give you any reaſon why it was written with his own Hand?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt. Porter,</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe he would not truſt his Miniſters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>I would not do Sir <hi>William</hi> wrong in any reſpect: I well rember Mr. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi> told him he had ſeen it, but I would not offer that as an Evidence againſt the Priſoner. But Captain <hi>Porter</hi> ſays, Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> ſaid he had ſeen it, and ſaid it was written with King <hi>James</hi>'s own Hand. And Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ſays, they had meetings at ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and he names you the places where; the <hi>Nags</hi>'s<hi>-Head</hi> Tavern, the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> the <hi>Globe</hi> Tavern in <hi>Hatton-Garden;</hi> and particularly that it was agreed, that Mr. <hi>King</hi> that was executed, and Mr. <hi>Knightly</hi> and himſelf, ſhould go and view a place that was moſt proper for the Aſſaſſination, and they were to come and give an account what place they thought moſt proper. And that accordingly they did go to view a place, and came home at Night, and met at the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Parkyns</hi> was there; and there they gave an account what place they had viewed that was proper, and all agreed to it. He ſays indeed, that Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> was not to execute this deſign in Perſon, but one <hi>Scudmore</hi> was to be a Man to be employed. And Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> did ſay it was very neceſſary to be done, for that it would facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the introduction of K. <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is likewiſe concurring Evidence with Captain <hi>Porter;</hi> he ſays, that Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> was to procure five Horſes, three for himſelf to mount Men upon, two to lend Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> to mount Men upon; and if there were further occaſion for Horſes, he could procure them from one Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> Gentleman to the Lord <hi>Feverſham.</hi> Accordingly we have produced you three Witneſſes, <hi>Freeman, Tartle,</hi> &amp;c. and they give you an account, that upon <hi>Friday,</hi> the day before the fixt day deſigned for the Aſſaſſination, there did come three Horſes to Town from Sir <hi>Will. Parkyns;</hi> but the buſineſs being put off upon a diſappointment, they were ſent out of Town again, to return the <hi>Friday</hi> afterwards, the day before the Diſcovery. Then four Horſes were brought to Town, and a fifth Horſe was borrowed of this <hi>Lewis,</hi> a Roan Gelding.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will. Parkyns,</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir, obſerve what ſort of Horſes they were, what heighth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Soll. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>They were about fourteen hands high, Sir <hi>William,</hi> ſo four were brought to Town, and the fifth was brought from <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> ſo that there were the five Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Captain <hi>Porter</hi> ſpeaks of, three whereof were to be mounted by Sir <hi>William Parkyn</hi>'s own Men, the other two were to be lent to Captain <hi>Porter</hi> to mount his Men. And this is concurring Witneſs to Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s Evidence, and it is very near two Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to prove this Species of Treaſon.</p>
               <p>And then Captain <hi>Porter</hi> goes further, and he proves that Sir <hi>William</hi> told him that he had a Commiſſion to raiſe a Regiment of Horſe, and that he was providing ſo to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65373:16"/>
Then we call Mr. <hi>Sweet,</hi> and he gives you an account that he had been acquainted with Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> for three Years paſt; and that talking with him about the King, his preſent Majeſty, and ſometimes about K. <hi>James,</hi> he ſays the King was to Land very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and that he had a Troop conſiſting of old Soldiers, and ſeveral Voluntiers to follow him. He ſaid, he was to take a Journey into <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> and accordingly he went. And when he return'd, he told him he found the <hi>West</hi> as well inclined as the <hi>North.</hi> And this is all the Evidence we produce from Mr. <hi>Sweet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then to prove he did go into <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> we produce his Servants, that he did go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and met with ſeveral Perſons. What was done there they cannot prove; but they corroborate Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi>'s Teſtimony, that he did go, and we have all the reaſon to believe he went upon that deſign that Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> ſaid he did.</p>
               <p>Then, as a further concurring Evidence, that he was to raiſe a Regiment, or a Troop, whether a Troop or Regiment, is not material; here is the matter of his Arms. There were four Dozen of Swords found in his Houſe, thirty two Carbines, and five and twenty Caſes of Piſtols; theſe were hid in his Garden. We have trac'd theſe Arms, and find they were ſent from his Houſe to Mr. <hi>Heywood</hi>'s. But there he thought they did not lye very ſafe, therefore Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> ſent for them very privately; and they were brought back to his Houſe, and there they were buried. The ſame Perſon ſays he ſaw them taken up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; ſo that they were one and the ſame Arms that he ſent away, and that were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards buried in his Houſe. So that this is a concurring Evidence with what Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> ſays, and with what Captain <hi>Porter</hi> ſays. And theſe are three Witneſſes to that Treaſon he had a Commiſſion to proſecute.</p>
               <p>Now againſt all this, he makes but very ſmall Objection. For the matter of two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes he has been over-ruled by the Court. For the Arms, he ſays, they were in his Houſe, and he found them there when he came there firſt: But of this he has no manner of Evidence. But if they had been there when he came, how came he at this time to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret them? Why might they not have been as publick now as before? He might have kept them, and given ſome Reaſon why he did ſo. But when he gives no manner of Reaſon why he ſecreted them, he gives you a juſt Suſpicion that they were for that end for which the Witneſſes ſay they were deſigned, that is, to Arm that number of Men he was to raiſe, that were to be ready to aſſiſt King <hi>James</hi> when he came to Land here. So that if you believe what the Witneſſes have ſworn, I think, with Submiſſion, you cannot but find him guilty of the Crimes for which he ſtands Indicted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Cooper.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> has given us a good Caution, which I ſhall take care to obſerve, that is, not to ſtrain either Fact or Law to his Prejudice. But, my Lord, when a Crime of this nature is ſo far proved againſt the Priſoner, as no Man can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit him in his Judgment; then, I think, it is good Service to the Publick, to make it ſo plain, as to be out of doubt to the Juries Conſcience, and Satisfaction of all that think themſelves concern'd in this Crime, and that it is worth their while to hear this Tryal. My Lord, Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> his Indictment is divided into Two Parts; one that accuſes him for Aſſaſſination; The other to invite the <hi>French</hi> into this Kingdom, and to meet them with an Armed Force.</p>
               <p>For the firſt part, I muſt do him that right, there is but one poſitive Evidence for his being concern'd in the Aſſaſſination. But that Evidence ſays he agreed to it in ſeveral Meetings; and in one that he ſaid, it was neceſſary in order to the other Deſign he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in, and that it would facilitate the Deſcent of the late King <hi>James</hi> into this Kingdom. But that one Evidence is confirmed by ſeveral concurring Circumſtances: By his ſending for his Horſes to Town the day before the firſt <hi>Saturday</hi> that the King was to be Aſſaſſinated: By his ſending them out of Town upon that Diſappointment; and ſending for them again before the ſecond <hi>Saturday</hi> when the King was to be Aſſaſſinated: By his having more Horſes than uſual, and taking care of three Horſes that were none of his own, brought by a Perſon unknown: And all theſe Eight Horſes carried away that <hi>Saturday,</hi> upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, by the King's not going, as they hoped he would, a Hunting.</p>
               <p>And, my Lord, I muſt obſerve to you, that upon the Meſſage that was ſent by Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Parkins,</hi> one of thoſe Horſes was brought from <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> and brought by Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who it is apparent was privy to this Deſign. Beſides this, there is another Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Evidence, that has not been obſerved; And that was the ſending for Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> up to Town before the ſecond time that the King was to be Aſſaſſinated. The firſt time he came up, he was asked in what Condition he had left his Family, how they were provided for; And he ſaid, he had left them without Mony: Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> then chid him, and ſaid he might as well have ſtaid at home; And ſaid, he had once a Deſign to have uſed him in a Matter he had for him to do in Town, but he had Compaſſion on his Family, and therefore would not make uſe of him. All theſe favour of that Deſign which Captain <hi>Porter</hi> poſitively accuſes him for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:65373:17"/>
But as to the other part of the Indictment, which is his Deſign to meet the <hi>French</hi> with an Armed Power, that is ſworn to by two Witneſſes. Captain <hi>Porter</hi> tells you he was at the two Conſults, where that was reſolved upon, the <hi>Old King's head Tavern</hi> in <hi>Leaden-Hall-ſtreet,</hi> and at Mrs. <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s in <hi>James-ſtreet.</hi> They all agreed to meet the late King with 2000 Horſe, when he was to Land with a Foreign Power; and Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> was with them. And Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> tells you, Sir <hi>William</hi> acquainted him with the Deſign, and ſaid he had a Troop of old Soldiers; My Troop, in the Preſent Tenſe he ſpoke it: He did himſelf that right to examine into that matter: And the Evidence repeated it, <hi>My Troop conſists of all Old Soldiers,</hi> and he was to have ſeveral Gentlemen Voluntiers that were to join him.</p>
               <p>As to the Joining with the <hi>French,</hi> the Raiſing of Rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> and Depoſing the King, which is Killing him in his Politick Capacity, two Witneſſes go home to that. And the Evidence as to that is corroborated by ſeveral ſtrong Circumſtances: The Journey that Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> ſaid he would undertake into <hi>Leiceſter ſhire,</hi> he did go: He comes back in <hi>February,</hi> and makes report to Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> of the Succeſs of that Journey; That the King's Friends (by which terms he meant the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Friends) were well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, That the King would Land. That when he ſpoke of King <hi>William</hi> (as ſometimes he did) he called him the Little Gentleman, ſometimes King <hi>William,</hi> ſometimes the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> But whenever he ſpoke of the King by way of Execellency, he always meant King <hi>James.</hi> And when he ſpoke of the King's Landing, it could not be meant of King <hi>VVilliam,</hi> as every body knows.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner has ſaid in his defence, that the Man that was ſent to <hi>Kenſington</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi>'s Servant, and that Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> deſired him to let him go on a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for him. But yet, my Lord, I muſt obſerve, that the Evidence ſwears poſitively that he was ſent by Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkins,</hi> and brought back the Meſſage in his Almanack, to the Perſon that lodged at the Confectioners, to whom Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkins</hi> had directed him to reſort, to that Perſon that lodged at the Confectioners over againſt <hi>Grays-Inn Gate;</hi> who did not remit him to Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> but to Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkins,</hi> to tell him that he would be at home till Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkins</hi> ſhould be ready for him.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkins</hi> has complain'd, that if he could have had time to get his Evidence, he could have proved that theſe Arms had been at his Houſe two Years, and that he ſound them at his Houſe. But if Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkins</hi> could prove that he had theſe Arms in his Houſe two years, and that he found them at his houſe, we would confeſs, and avoid it: They were recommended by a Letter from Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> (a very ſuſpicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this matter) to be diſpoſed of, and they were hid, and lay conceal'd at Mr. <hi>Heywood</hi>'s Houſe, till this deſign was diſappointed, and then carried to Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkins</hi>'s Houſe, and were buried in his own Garden for the better ſecuring of them: And this on the breaking out of the Plot. Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> ſays they were Ruſty. But now it appears they were clean, and the Hilts off, packt up together, and all fit for uſe.</p>
               <p>My Lord, in the laſt place, he has recourſe to Arguments of Pity, which is the moſt mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all: He has told us of his Age, and Family, and Education. I am very unfit to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuch Arguments, and unwilling to extinguiſh Pity: But this we muſt anſwer, That he did not Pity himſelf at that time when he might have done it: And he ſhould have had Pity upon his Country, upon the Beſt of Kings and Men, when they thought they had him in their Power. But then they had no Pity on him, for it is plain they perſiſted in their Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; after one Diſappointment, they proceeded to a ſecond, and ſo their Deſign was fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>My Lord, This is the Sum of the Evidence, and of his Defence, as well as I could recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it. And though theſe Conſiderations may not quite extinguiſh your Pity, yet we hope it will incline you to do the King and Kingdom Juſtice; And this is all we ſhall ask of you.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> Holt <hi>directed the</hi> Jury <hi>to this Effect:</hi>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkins,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, is as you have heard, Indicted for High-Treaſon, that is, for Compaſſing, Imagining and Deſigning the Death of the preſent King. There have been ſeveral Witneſſes produced, to make this evident upon his Indictment. The firſt of them is Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> that has been a Witneſs heretofore againſt ſeveral upon the like Occaſion. And he gives you this Account, That about the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> or beginning of <hi>June</hi> laſt, there was a Meeting of divers Perſons at the Old Kings head Tavern in <hi>Leaden-Hall ſtreet,</hi> in this City, where they Dined together. There was Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkins</hi> himſelf, Sir <hi>John Femwick,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that he has mentioned to you. At that Meeting they did Conſult together which way the late K. <hi>James</hi> might be reſtor'd; and it was thought very neceſſary that there ſhould
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65373:17"/>
be a French Force ſent over to act here in his behalf, towards his Reſtoration. And they did among themſelves agree and determin what number might be convenient, and did propoſe 10000 Men: and that a Meſſenger ſhould be ſent over to K. <hi>James,</hi> to endeavour to prevail with the French King to furniſh him with ſuch a number of Men, to be ſent over into <hi>England.</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> that was then in the Company, was agreed upon among them to be the Meſſenger to go over to King <hi>James.</hi> He accepted of it on their Promiſe that they would raiſe among themſelves 2000 Horſe, to meet King <hi>James</hi> at ſuch time as he ſhould Land. This being at that time determined, and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> having accepted of the Employment, by what I perceive, the Meſſenger did make a preparation to go forward. A few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, about a Week, or thereabouts, there was another Meeting, at which moſt of the ſame Perſons were, that were preſent at the former, and among them Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> was one: And this was at one Mrs. <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s Houſe, that keeps a Tavern in St. <hi>James</hi>'s<hi>-Street<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> There they did diſcourſe of what they had formerly agreed upon, and did conſider whether or no they ſhould proceed in that Deſign, that was before reſolv'd upon in the former Meeting: And they did all of them agree to perſevere in the ſame Deſign, and did determin that Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> ſhould go over with that Meſſage. Accordingly Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> did go; for Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> met him afterwards, about five or ſix Weeks after; and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> told him he had been there; and that he had been with thoſe ſeveral Gentlemen that were at thoſe Meetings, and had acquainted them with the ſucceſs of his Errand; which was, that King <hi>James</hi> did tell him, That at that juncture of time, the French King had ſuch occaſion for his Forces, that he could not that Year furniſh him with them. So that is one thing proved by Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> againſt Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> in which Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> is very peremptory and poſitive.</p>
               <p>But then Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> tells you further, That there was a deſign of Aſſaſſination ſet on foot, and that Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> was engaged in it; who about the latter end of <hi>January</hi> laſt, or the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> was ſent over hither with a Commiſſion from the Late King <hi>James.</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> and divers others, had ſeveral Meetings, in ſeveral Places; at the <hi>Globe</hi> Tavern in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> the <hi>Nag</hi>'s<hi>-Head,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and other Places. And at theſe Meetings it was taken into conſideration, which was the beſt and moſt effectual way to bring about their Deſign, to reſtore King <hi>James:</hi> And it was agreed among them all, That the beſt courſe that could be taken, was to kill King <hi>William:</hi> And at all theſe Conſults, at which theſe Reſolutions were taken, Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> vvas preſent. And when Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> was asked, whether Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> did conſent to that Reſolution, he ſays, he ſaid he thought it very convenient. This is Sworn by Mr. <hi>Porter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This deſign of the Aſſaſſination being ſo reſolved upon, the next thing was, how it might be effected: And there were ſeveral ways that were propoſed. One way was to Aſſaſſinate him on the other ſide of the Water, the King going frequently once a Week a Hunting, when he had a mind to Divert himſelf, uſing to come back in the Evening. Then it was propoſed to do it by falling upon the Guards on this ſide of the Water. The place not being agreed on where it ſhould be done, they did ſend it ſeems three Perſons to view the Ground; there was Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. King, and one <hi>Knightly.</hi> So ſome days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 15th of <hi>February,</hi> theſe Perſons viewed the Ground; and having viewed the Ground, they returned in the Evening to a Tavern, where theſe Perſons met together, Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> Sir <hi>George Berclay,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkins;</hi> and they made their Report upon the view of the Ground: And upon that Report thoſe Perſons made, it was then agreed, That the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſhould be made on this ſide of the Water, that is, in a Lane that the King was to come through; a Lane between <hi>Turnham Green</hi> and <hi>Brentford.</hi> And when the Attack was to be made thereabouts, Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> was to furniſh five Horſes, whereof three were to be mounted by Men of his own providing, the other two by Men of Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. It was Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> and one <hi>Rookwood,</hi> that were to be principally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; and the number of Men were to be about Forty, or ſomewhat more: And Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> with his Party, were to Attack the King in his Coach, while <hi>Rookwood</hi> and the other Party fell upon the Guards. Well, the time agreed upon at firſt, was <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15th of <hi>February,</hi> that day it was expected the King would go out a Hunting; and there were two Men Planted at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> and they were to give notice when the King went, and thoſe Perſons were to go and lye in ſmall Parties thereabouts; and when notice was given that he was out, they were to make the Attack. But it ſeems this Deſign was diſappointed by the King's not going abroad that day, ſo they loſt their end at that time. But it ſeems notwithſtanding this, the Deſign was not at an end; they were not ſo diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at this diſappointment, but they did agree to make another Attempt: And there was another Meeting that Captain <hi>Porter</hi> tells you of; And that was on <hi>Friday</hi> following, the 21ſt. of <hi>February,</hi> at the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> if I miſtake not: And at that Meeting was Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> Sir <hi>George Berclay,</hi> and <hi>Rookwood:</hi> And they did agree to do
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65373:18"/>
the Buſineſs the next day, in the ſame manner and method they formerly had agreed to. Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> was not to be one himſelf, tho he was to provide others. You are told further, that Captain <hi>Porter</hi> having the misfortune to have two of his Horſes fall Lame, he acquainted Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> with it; and Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> promiſed to help him to two more, and Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> was to furniſh them.</p>
               <p>You are told further, that before this, Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> ſent to Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> to come to Town; he ſent to him about the 11th of <hi>February;</hi> Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> comes to Town about the 12th of <hi>February;</hi> there he had Diſcourſe with him, and tells him he had ſome Work for him; and ask'd him how he had left his Family; whether he had ſettled his Family? No, ſays <hi>Sweet.</hi> Then ſays Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> you are not fit for that Employment that I intended for you; you may go out of Town again. Then he comes the <hi>Friday</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; then his Groom was to bring ſome Horſes to Town, and he does bring four to Town. Then Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> came to Town; and on <hi>Saturday</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> ſays that he would go out of Town that Afternoon; but he ſtayed till <hi>Monday,</hi> and then he went out of Town. <hi>Friday</hi> following the Horſes came to Town again, and were ſet up at the <hi>George Inn.</hi> The next day was to be the <hi>Aſſaſſination.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> was to furniſh Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> with two Horſes; five Horſes were to be furniſh'd upon Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi>'s account; and five Horſes Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> had there at that time: This is proved to you by the Hoſtler. Then Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> himſelf comes on <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Afternoon, to ſpeak with Sir <hi>William Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> to enquire for him; but Sir <hi>William</hi> was not in the way. Theſe are Circumſtances that prove and confirm Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s Evidence, as to Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> providing Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: He had five Horſes, and Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> was the Perſon to furniſh him with one, and it may be might be prevailed upon to furniſh Captain <hi>Porter</hi> with more: But it ſeems there was no occaſion for more, for the King did not go abroad that Saturday; this was the laſt <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> ſo the Deſign perfectly fell.</p>
               <p>Then further, concerning the Commiſſion; he told you at firſt, That he asked Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> if he might ſee the Commiſſion; he ſaid, he had not ſeen it himſelf, but that Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> had ſeen it. Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> was earneſt with Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> to know if he had ſeen the Commiſſion; and Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> told him he had ſeen it and read it, and the Commiſſion was writ with King <hi>James</hi>'s own Hand: This Captain <hi>Porter tells</hi> you. And, what was the ſubſtance of it? <hi>To make War upon the Perſon of the King;</hi> called in the Commiſſion by the name of the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> He had read it, and it was writ with King <hi>James</hi>'s own Hand. So that, Gentlemen, as to the buſineſs of the Aſſaſſination, the Commiſſion was the foundation upon which they went. This is the ſum and ſubſtance of Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s Evidence, ſo confirmed by theſe Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>But then there is another Witneſs, and that is Mr. <hi>Sweet,</hi> an Acquaintance of Sir <hi>William Parkins;</hi> and he tells you, that about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, he was aſſured by Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> that the King would Land. By the King he underſtood he meant the Late King <hi>James.</hi> He asked him how he knew it? Says he, I have his Word for it; and, ſays he, I have 30 Saddles, and I have a Troop of old Soldiers; My Troop, conſiſts of all old Soldiers: This he poſitively ſays. And beſides theſe, there were to be ſome Voluntiers, and they were to be old Officers. And he tells you, he was to go into <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and he did go at the latter end of <hi>January;</hi> and on <hi>Thurſday</hi> he vvent to <hi>Stratford,</hi> and lay there the firſt Night, and the next day to <hi>Leiceſter:</hi> There went with him one <hi>Scudmore,</hi> and afterwards there was with him one <hi>Yarbury:</hi> And when he came back, he ſaid, he found the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Weſt very well affected to the King's Intereſt, and as well diſpoſed as thoſe of the North.</p>
               <p>Then, in the next place, you are told, that about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt, Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> at his deſire, ſends a Letter into <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Heywood,</hi> to receive ſome Goods to his Houſe that were to come from Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> and lay them up carefully: And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly were thoſe Boxes, thoſe Cheſts ſent; and they continued to lye there until the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>February</hi> laſt; at which time, Mr. <hi>Heywood</hi> ſays, he being in Town, met Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Parkins,</hi> and ſpoke to him concerning thoſe things at his Houſe, and ask'd him what he ſhould do with them, how ſhall I diſpoſe of them ſays he? Whereupon Sir <hi>William</hi> ſays, we will ſhortly take care of them. Upon this Sir <hi>William</hi> ſends his Servant into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and notice vvas given upon <hi>Aſh Wedneſday</hi> that thoſe things ſhould be removed, and his Servant goes in the Evening vvith Cart and Horſes to fetch them home: There theſe Cheſts and Boxes vvere found, three great Cheſts, out of vvhich the leſſer vvere taken, and all carried avvay about Nine or Ten a Clock at Night, from that Place, to Sir <hi>William Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Warwickſhire.</hi> When they were carried there, they vvere buried, till ſuch time as they vvere aftervvards taken: When they vvere dug up, upon the breaking open of the Cheſts, it did appear vvhat ſort of Goods they vvere; truly they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65373:18"/>
were Arms, a conſiderable quantity of Arms; There were four Dozen of Swords without Hilts, 25 pair of Piſtols, and 32 Carbines, and there was a parcel of Hilts ready to be put to the Swords. This Gentlemen, is Sworn to you by the Evidence againſt Sir <hi>William Parkins:</hi> It was in the Night, about the time that the Plot broke out and was diſcover'd. And it ſeems the Arms were not ruſty Arms, but they were very bright and good Arms, they did not want any ſcouring and cleanſing; bright Arms, very fit for Service.</p>
               <p>And there is one Circumſtance more, that ſeems to affect Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> about the Aſſaſſination; And that is a Letter that was ſent on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15th of <hi>February</hi> to one call'd <hi>Brown,</hi> at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> early in the Morning, by Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi>'s Man; and this <hi>Brown</hi> writ in his Almanack, and this was ſent to a Man that Lodged at a Confectioners in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> over againſt <hi>Grays-Inn-Gate,</hi> (Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> remaining in Town) and he goes to that Perſon, who ſeemed to be a <hi>Scotch-</hi>Man and talkt like a <hi>Scotch-</hi>Man; and he bid him go to Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> and tell him he would be at home till he was ready to come to him. This now is the Subſtance of the Evidence given againſt Sir <hi>William Parkins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> ſays for himſelf, that he does admit, that for what Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> does ſay, it is a very poſitive Evidence; but that is but one VVitneſs: And no Perſon by Law, in Caſes of High-treaſon, ought to be Convicted upon the Teſtimony of one Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let him be never ſo poſitive. For that he is in the right; no man is to be Convicted by one Witneſs. But the Queſtion is, whether there be not two Witneſſes for one and the ſame Treaſon, which I told you at firſt was for Compaſſing, Imagining and Deſigning the Death of the King? Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> is clear as to the Aſſaſſination; and there is no other Witneſs to the ſame Overt-act; But <hi>Sweet</hi> is for the Original Deſign, which was the Reſtoring the late King <hi>James,</hi> and for which Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> was to be ſent into <hi>France</hi> in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> laſt, and ſo it was determined at the Conſult held as aforeſaid. But then what does Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> ſay to that, which was ſtill a part of the ſame Deſign, tho' at another time? Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> ſpeaks of King <hi>James</hi>'s Landing, of a Deſign of having a Force in readineſs to meet King <hi>James,</hi> and to Aſſiſt him after he had Landed: And this is now to the ſelf-ſame purpoſe, even as ſtrictly as Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> himſelf can deſire. Now if there were no more in the Caſe, if we leave out the buſineſs of the Aſſaſſination, and conſider only what was determined at the <hi>Kings-Head,</hi> and at Mrs. <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s Tavern, and what was the advice of Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> afterwards; That ſure tended to the ſame End, the bringing about the ſame ſort of Deſign that Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> was ingaged in even in the Summer, that is, to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Aſſiſt King <hi>James</hi> if he had Landed at that time. Now if the buſineſs of the Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination had been left out of the Indictment, and there had been no more than a deſign and purpoſe to Depoſe this King, and ſet up the late King upon the Throne; that had been High-treaſon within the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3d. that were an Overt-act to prove a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for the Depoſing of King <hi>William.</hi> So that if the Aſſaſſination were out of the Caſe, there had been a full Proof, if Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> does prove any ſuch matter, which by and by is to be conſidered. But then ſuppoſing the meeting at the <hi>Kings-Head,</hi> and at Mrs. <hi>Mountjoys</hi> had been omitted, then the Caſe had been no more than this, than a deſign to Depoſe the King, that is, an Overt-act of a deſign to Depoſe the King, never that I know contradicted. But then there is ſeveral ways thought of. Firſt the Deſign was by Arms, without any relation to killing the King, but only by Arms. Then they come to think further, and to conſider that the late King <hi>James</hi> cannot be Reſtored, unleſs King <hi>William</hi> be Killed; and then they determine upon That. Now the deſign of Reſtoring the late King by Arms, is one Overt-act; And the deſign of Aſſaſſinating the King, is another Overt-act. So although, the Law does require there ſhould be two Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the ſame ſort of Treaſon; yet the Law does not require two Witneſſes to every Overt-act: For if one Witneſs prove one Overt-act, and another Witneſs prove another Overt-act, there is two VVitneſſes within the meaning of the <hi>Statute.</hi> And that has been always practical, and never denied that I know of. Beſides, as my Brother mentioned before, the New Act of Parliament, that has not yet taken Effect, ſays, that there ſhall be one Witneſs to one Overt-act, and another to another, of the ſame Species of Treaſon. Now it doth appear, that theſe are Overt-acts of the ſame Species of Treaſon.</p>
               <p>But then Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> does object, that Mr. <hi>Sweet,</hi> and the other Witneſſes beſides Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> do not prove any Overt-act againſt him at all. Now then you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the force of Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi>'s Evidence, and I will open to you firſt the Diſcourſe at <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> about the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Landing. He told him he had his word for it, and that his Troop conſiſted of ſuch a Number, and his providing of Arms. He ſays theſe are only Words. Now then conſider alſo whether theſe words are not Overt-acts. That Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Parkins</hi> had Arms, beyond what he as a Private Man had occaſion to uſe, that is moſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65373:19"/>
plain, he does not give any account about it. He ſays he wants Witneſſes, and that he had not time to provide Witneſſes; he does not give any account to what purpoſe he ſhould have them, or what he was to do with them. Being a private Man, certainly he had not occaſion for theſe Arms. Then the removing theſe Arms to Mr. <hi>Heywood</hi>'s Houſe, and then afterwards carrying them away in the Night to his own Houſe, and burying them, a little after the Plot was diſcovered; then what kind of Arms theſe were. If providing of Arms were an Overt-act, having of Arms was certainly an Overt-act. And then, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he had a Troop; his Troop conſiſted of old Soldiers, and he had Arms. Now Mens Diſcourſes and Words muſt explain their Actions. An indifferent Action may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by words. it is Lawful for a Man to Buy a Horſe and Piſtols; but if he tell any one he will buy a Piſtol, and with that immediately go and Murther the King; If he tell you he will buy a Horſe, and go with it and lie in wait for the King, and kill the King; There his own words are an Explication what he bought his Horſe and Piſtol for. Now when he ſays the late King is to Land, and Arms are found upon him, I muſt leave it to your Conſideration to what purpoſe he would uſe his Arms, ſeeing he gave no account what they were for. But he tells you he found them at his Houſe in <hi>Warwickſhire</hi> two Years ago. But to have ſuch a quantity of Arms, was no way ſuitable to the Circumſtances he was in.</p>
               <p>Then another thing was his going into <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> with Capt. <hi>Scudmore;</hi> there meets him one Mr. <hi>Yarbury:</hi> And he comes back on <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and home to <hi>Buſhy</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> Night; and tells Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> he found the Gentlemen of that Country were very well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the King, as well affected in the <hi>West</hi> as they were in the <hi>North.</hi> What King muſt he mean? He had no Commiſſion from King <hi>William,</hi> he does not pretend to it, to go into <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> to know the Minds and Affections of Men there; he had no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from King <hi>William</hi> to go upon ſuch a deſign. And then ſpeaking that the King would Land, whether he means King <hi>James</hi> or no, I muſt leave it to your Conſideration. It is very true, it is not fit that there ſhould be any ſtrained or forced Conſtruction made, when a Man is upon a Trial for his Life; that is out of queſtion, you ought to have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſatisfactory Evidence to convince you that a Priſoner is guilty of what he is charged with. But however you are to conſider, not only the things, but the Circumſtances that do attend thoſe things, and the Circumſtances Men are under, when they do or act any thing whatſoever. For to pretend in this caſe, that Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> went to know the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the People in <hi>Licesterſhire</hi> to King <hi>William;</hi> and that he meant thoſe in the <hi>Weſt</hi> were as well affected to him as thoſe in the <hi>North,</hi> cannot be imagined. And Mr. <hi>Sweet</hi> tells you, that always when he did ſpeak of the Kings Landing, he underſtood him to mean the Late King <hi>James.</hi> And indeed that muſt be meant: For King <hi>William</hi> was in <hi>England,</hi> and Landed before, and it does not appear that Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to engage himſelf in King <hi>William</hi>'s Service. So that I muſt upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leave it to your own conſideration; If you are ſatisfied that Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> is guilty of this Matter wherewith he is charged, then you are to find him Guilty; You have heard the Evidence, and you are to conſider of it. If you are not ſatisfied in the matter for which he ſtands charged in the Indictment, then you are to acquit him.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the</hi> Jury <hi>withdrew to conſider of their Verdict, and an Officer was Sworn to keep them, according to Law, till agreed; and about a quarter of an Hour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they returned into Court, and the Priſoner was brought to the Barr.</hi>

               <p>You the Priſoners at the Bar, Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> have been Indicted for High-treaſon, in conſpiring the Death of the King; for Tryal thereof you have put your ſelves upon your Countrey, which Countrey have found you Guilty</p>
               <p>The Crimes you are Convicted of, are the greateſt a Man can commit. Murder and Robbery are Injuries but to private Perſons: But to contrive the Deſtruction of the King, is letting in Ruin upon Thouſands of People. For Robbery and Murder there may be ſomething pleaded for Juſtification, as for private Revenge <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to Set, Conſpire, and Debate the Deſtruction of a Prince, the beſt of Men, the Father of his Countrey, no Man ever had any colour of Excuſe for that. I would not add to your Unhappineſs, I am ſorry for the ſevere Judgment that you have brought upon your ſelves. All that remains for me to do, is, to Pronounce on you the Sentence. And the Court doth award,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THat You, and each of You, be carried to the Place from whence you came, and from thence be drawn on a Hardle to the Place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and be there ſeverally Hanged, but cut down while you are alive; that your Privy Members be cut off; that your Bowels be taken out, and burnt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Faces; that your Heads be ſever'd from your Bodies, and your Bodies be divided into four Quarters, and your Quarters to be at the King's Diſpoſal: And the Lord have Mercy on your Souls.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>KNowing that I muſt immediately give Account to God of all my Actions, and that I ought to be eſpecially careful of what I ſay in theſe Laſt Hours, I do ſolemnly profeſs, That what I here deliver is from my very Soul, with all the Heartineſs and Sincerity of a Dying Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The Cauſe I am brought hither to ſuffer for, I do firmly believe to be the Cauſe of God and True Religion, and to the beſt and utmoſt of my Knowledge and Information agreeable to the Laws of the Land, which I have evermore heard do require a firm Duty and Allegiance to our Sovereign; and that as no Foreign, ſo neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Domeſtick Power can alienate our Allegiance. For it is altogether new and unintelligible to me, that the King's Subjects can depoſe and dethrone him on any account, or conſtitute any that have not an immediate Right in his place. We ought, I think, not to do this; and ſurely when it is done, to aſſiſt him in the Recovery of his Right, is juſtifiable and our Duty. And however things may ſeem at preſent, I do <hi>believe,</hi> I am ſure I heartily <hi>pray,</hi> That he ſhall be one day Reſtored to his Rightful Throne and Dominions.</p>
               <p>As for any ſudden Deſcent of his Majeſty upon theſe his Dominions, in order to the Recovery of them, I declare I had no certain knowledge of it, nor can I tell what grounds there was to believe it, ſo little reaſon had I to be in a preſent Preparation for it. I ſuppoſe it is not expected I ſhould here endeavour to clear my ſelf of the Aſſaſſination, which was not the Thing alledg'd againſt me; however, it was mention'd, through what means I know not: As it was inſinuated to my diſadvantage, I forgive ſuch as were therein inſtrumental: And I do alſo from the very bottom of my Soul, freely forgive, and beg of God to do ſo too, ſuch as were any ways ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary towards the taking away my Life, which I really look upon to be their Misfortune more than mine.</p>
               <p>I profeſs my ſelf, and I thank God I am ſo, a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though, God knows, a moſt unworthy and unprofitable part of it; of that Church which ſuffers ſo much at preſent for a ſtrict adherence to Lovalty, the Laws, and Chriſtian Principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For this I Suffer, and for this I Dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though I have a perfect Charity for people of all Profeſſions, and do heartily wiſh well, and would endeavour ſo to do, to all my Fellow-Subjects, of what Perſuaſions ſoever. And indeed, I have met with a great deal of Uprightneſs and Sincerity among ſome people of very different Opinions in Religious Matters.</p>
               <p>And I hope and deſire it may not be taken as an uncharitable Cenſure, or undue Reflection, that I objected to the Legality of Popiſh Evidence, being adviſed ſo to do for my better Security, upon the foundation of a Statute Law.</p>
               <p>Having owned my ſelf a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I muſt take this opportunity, and I do it for God's Glory, to apply my ſelf to you that are Royaliſts of that Church, and of the ſame Faith and Principles with my ſelf: And I beg of you for God's ſake, and the love of your Souls, to be very conſtant and ſerious in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Offices, and holy Duties of Divine Worſhip and Service, which I have too much neglected, as I own to my great Sorrow: Let no Excuſe, no Dangers, prevent or hinder you in theſe moſt neceſſary and ſerious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and be, I beſeech you, very careful and circumſpect in all your Actions, Behaviour, and Converſation, as I earneſtly exhorted all that came to me.</p>
               <p>I have, I thank God, a great deal of Satisfaction in my preſent Sufferings, and have found it ſo ever ſince I have been under them: And bleſſed be God it doth continually increaſe upon me. And I do now lay down my Life with all Chearfulneſs and Reſignation, in ſure and certain Hope of a Reſurrection to Eternal Life, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; through whoſe Merits alone I hope for the Pardon of my Sins, and the Salvation of my Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo, O Lord, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit, for thou haſt redeemed me, O Lord, thou God of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I do heartily and humbly beſeech Thee Almighty God, and my moſt Gracious Father, to forgive and bleſs this Sinful Nation; Deliver it from the Guilt of Rebellion, Blood, and Perjury, that is now on all ſides more than ever, and from all thoſe other Hainous Sins which cry aloud. Preſerve and Bleſs this Church. Comfort our Diſtreſſed King; Reſtore him to his Right, and his Miſled Subjects to their Allegiance: Bleſs alſo his Royal Conſort, Our Gracious Queen</hi> Mary; <hi>his Royal Highneſs the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>That he may grow in Stature, and in Favour with God and Man; Support and Strengthen all thoſe that ſuffer in any kind for a good Cauſe; give them Patience under all their Afflictions, and a happy Deliverance out of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forgive all mine Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pardon my former neglect, and remiſſneſs in Religious Worſhip, and Holy Duties, and all the Sins I have been guilty of to this very moment. Conſider my Contrition, Accept my Tears; And now thou art pleaſed to take me hence, take me into thy Favour, and grant that my Soul may be without ſpot preſented unto Thee, through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thy moſt dearly Beloved Son, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>IT hath not been my cuſtom to uſe many words, and I ſhall not be long upon this Occaſion, having Buſineſs of much greater Conſequence to employ my thoughts upon. I thank God I am now in a full diſpoſition to Charity, and therefore ſhall make no Complaints, either of the Hardſhips of my Trial, or any other Rigours put upon me. However one circumſtance I think my ſelf obliged to mention; it was Sworn againſt me by Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> That I had own'd to him, that I had Seen and Read a Commiſſion from the King, to Levy War upon the Perſon of the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> Now I muſt declare, That the Tenour of the King's Commiſſion, which I ſaw, was general, and directed to all his Loving Subjects, to Raiſe and Levy War againſt the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his Adherents, and to Seize all Forts, Caſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, I ſuppoſe, may be a cuſtomary Form of giving Authority to make War; but I muſt confeſs, I am not much acquainted with Matters of that nature: But as for any Commiſſion particularly levelled againſt the Perſon of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> I neither ſaw nor heard of any ſuch.</p>
               <p>It's true I was privy to the Deſign upon the Prince, but was not to act in it; and am fully ſatisfied that very few, or none, knew of it, but thoſe who undertook to do it.</p>
               <p>I freely acknowledge, and think it for my Honour to ſay, that I was entirely in the Intereſt of the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always firmly perſwaded of the Juſtice of his Cauſe, and looked upon it as my Duty, both as a Subject, and an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> to Aſſiſt him in the Recovery of his Throne, which I believed him to be Deprived of, contrary to all Right and Juſtice; taking the Laws and Conſtitutions of my Country for my Guide.</p>
               <p>As for my Religion, I Dye in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in which I was Educated.</p>
               <p>And as I freely Forgive all the World, ſo whoever I may any ways have injured, I heartily ask them Pardon.</p>
