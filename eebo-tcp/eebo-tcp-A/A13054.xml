            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="account">
               <head>A brief Collection how the Court of <hi>Requeſt,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Court of Conſcience</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> hath been eſtabliſhed and continued for many years paſt, for the relief of poor Debtors in <hi>London,</hi> and the liberties thereof, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FIrſt, I find that <hi>primo</hi> Februarii, <hi>Anno</hi> 9 <hi>H.</hi> 8. an Act of Common Council was made, that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the ſame City for the time being, ſhould monthly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and appoint two Aldermen, and four diſcreet Commoners to be Commiſſioners to ſit in the ſame Court twice a week, <hi>viz.</hi> Wedneſday and Saturday, there to hear and determine all matters brought before them between party and party (being Citizens and Freemen of <hi>London</hi>) in all caſes where the due debt or damage did not exceed forty ſhillings.</p>
               <p>This Act was to continue but for two years then next enſuing: But being found charitable and profitable for the relief of ſuch poor Debtors as were not able to make preſent pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Debts, and to reſtrain malicious perſons from proceeding in their wilful Suits: and alſo to be a great eaſe and help to ſuch poor perſons as had ſmall debts owing to them, and were not able to proſecute Suits in Law for the ſame elſewhere: The ſame Act hath ſithence been continued by divers other Acts of Common Council: and hereby (beſides the ſaid two Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men monthly aſſigned) the number of Commiſſioners were increaſed from four to twelve. And ſo by that Authority the ſame Court continued till the end of the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And then divers people, being Citizens and Freemen of <hi>London</hi> (contrary to their Oaths formerly taken) repining at the authority of the ſame Court, and not regarding the expence of any charges how great ſoever, ſo they might have their deſires upon their poor Debtors, and being often animated thereunto by divers Attorneys and Sollicitors (for their own particular gain) did daily commence Suits, for ſuch petty debts and cauſes againſt poor men (Citizens and Freemen of <hi>London</hi>) in the high Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> or elſewhere out of the ſaid Court of Requeſts, to avoid the Juriſdiction of the ſame Court, and to bar the ſaid Commiſſioners from ſtaying ſuch Suits, and examining the ſaid Cauſes, and thereby cauſed the ſaid poor men many times to pay ſix times as much charges as their principal debts or damage did amount unto, to the undoing of ſuch poor men, their wives and children, and alſo to the filling of the Priſons with the poor ſo ſued: where otherwiſe they might have got their Debts in the ſaid Court of Requeſts, for very ſmall charge and little trouble.</p>
               <p>For remedy whereof, and for the ſtrengthning and eſtabliſhing the ſaid Court, an Act of Parliament was then made in <hi>Anno primo Jacobi Regis,</hi> that every Citizen and Freeman of <hi>London,</hi> that had, or ſhould have any Debts owing to him, not amounting to forty ſhillings, by any Debtors (Citizens and Freemen of <hi>London,</hi> inhabiting in <hi>London</hi> or the Liberties thereof, ſhould or might cauſe ſuch Debtors to be warned to appear before the Commiſſioners of the ſaid Court; and that the ſaid Commiſſioners, or the greater number of them, ſhould from time to time ſet down ſuch Orders between ſuch parties, Plaintiff and Defendant, Creditor and Debtor touching ſuch Debts not exceeding forty ſhillings, as they ſhould find to ſtand with equity and good conſcience.</p>
               <p>But ſithence the making of that Act, divers perſons (intending to ſubvert the good and charitable intent of the ſame) have taken hold of ſome doubtful and ambiguous words therein, and have wreſted the ſame for their own lucre and gain, to the avoiding the juriſdiction of the ſame Court, contrary to the godly meaning of the ſaid Act.</p>
               <p>For remedy whereof, and to the intent that ſome more full and ample proviſion might be made for the further eſtabliſhing and ſtrengthening of the ſaid Court, and for the better relief of ſuch poor Debtors; another Act of Parliament was made, <hi>Anno 3 Jac.</hi> whereby the authority of the ſaid Commiſſioners was much inlarged, <hi>viz.</hi> that every Citizen and Freeman of <hi>London</hi> [<hi>and every other perſon and perſons inhabiting, or that ſhall inhabit within the City of</hi> London, <hi>or the Liberties thereof, being a Tradeſman, Victualler, or Labouring man,</hi>] which have or ſhall have any Debts owing to him or them, not amounting to forty ſhillings, by any Citizen or Freeman [<hi>or by any other perſon or perſons (being a Victualler, Tradeſman, or Labouring man) inhabiting within the ſaid City, or the Liberties thereof</hi>] ſhould or might cauſe ſuch Debtors to be warned to appear before the ſaid Commiſſioners of the Court of Requeſts. And the ſaid Commiſſioners, or any three or more of them, ſhall have power to ſet down ſuch Orders between Plaintiff and Defendant, Creditor and Debtor, touching ſuch Debts not amounting to forty ſhillings, as they ſhall find to ſtand with equity and good conſcience. Alſo the ſaid Commiſſioners, or any three, or more of them, have power (by the ſaid Act) to miniſter an Oath to the Creditor or Debtor, and to ſuch Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And by this laſt Act, the ſaid Court of Requeſt is eſtabliſhed and continued to this day; and God grant it may ſo long continue to the relief of the poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>A Remedy for Recovery of ſmall Debts, and for the Relieving of the poorer ſort in <hi>LONDON.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHereas by vertue of divers acts of Common Council made within the City of <hi>London,</hi> the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the ſame City, for the relief of poor debtors dwelling within the ſaid City, have accuſtomed monthly to aſſign two Aldermen, and twelve diſcreet Commoners to be Commiſſioners and ſit in the Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, commonly called the Court of Conſcience in the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> of the ſame City, there to hear and determine all matters of debt not amounting to the ſum of xl. s. to be brought before them: And whereas at the Seſſions of Parliament holden at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the nineteenth day of March, in the firſt year of the reign of our Soveraign Lord the Kings Majeſty that now is, for the further relief of ſuch poor debtors, and more perfect eſtabliſhing of the ſaid Court, there was made and provided an Act, intituled, An act for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſmall debts, and relieving of poor debtors in <hi>London:</hi> And whereas ſince the making of the ſaid act, divers perſons, intending to ſubvert the good and charitable intent of the ſame, and taking hold of ſome doubtful and ambiguous words therein, do wreſt the ſame for their own lucre and gain, to the avoiding the Juriſdiction of the ſaid Court, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the godly meaning of the ſaid act.</p>

And that the ſaid Commiſſioners, or any three of them or more, ſhall have power and authority by the vertue of this act, from time to time, to ſet down ſuch order or orders between ſuch party or parties plaintiff, and his or their ſuch debtor or debtors defendants, touching ſuch debts, not amounting to the value of forty ſhillings, in queſtion before them, as they ſhall find to ſtand with equity and good conſcience, All ſuch their order or orders to be regiſtred in a book, as they have been accuſtomed, and as well the party plaintiff, as the debtor defendant, to obſerve, perform and kéep the ſame in all points.</p>
               <p>And that for the more due procéeding herein it ſhall be lawful for the ſame Commiſſioners, or any three or more of them, to miniſter an oath to the plaintiff or defendant, and alſo to ſuch witneſſes as ſhall be produced on each party, if the ſame Commiſſioners, or any three of them or more ſhall ſo think it meet.</p>
               <p>And be it further enacted by the authority aforeſaid, That if any action of debt, or action upon the caſe upon an Aſſumpſit for the recovery of any debt, to be ſued or proſecuted againſt any the perſon or perſons aforeſaid, in any of the Kings Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> or elſewhere out of the ſaid Court of Requeſts, it ſhall appear to the Judge or Judges of the Court, where ſuch action ſhall be ſued or proſecuted, that the debt to be recovered by the plaintiff in ſuch action doth not amount to the ſum of xl s. and the defendant in ſuch action ſhall duly prove either by ſufficient teſtimony, or by his own oath, to be allowed by any the Judge or Judges of the ſaid Court where ſuch action ſhall depend, that at the time of the commencing of ſuch action, ſuch defendant was inhabiting and resiant in the City of <hi>London</hi> or the Liberties thereof, as above: That in ſuch caſe the ſaid Judge or Judges ſhall not allow to the ſaid plaintiff any coſts of ſuit, but ſhall award that the ſame plaintiff ſhall pay ſo much ordinary coſts to the party defendant, as ſuch defendant ſhall juſtly prove before the ſaid Judge or Judges, it hath truly coſt him in defence of the ſaid ſuit.</p>
