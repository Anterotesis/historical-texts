            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Murther of Doctor <hi>Andrew Clenche</hi> (from the manner of it) did very much diÅ¿turb the Thoughts of many M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n. But the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againÅ¿t <hi>Henry HarriÅ¿on,</hi> Gent. at his Tryal for that Murther, was Å¿o full and Å¿atisfactory to all that heard it, That it was then believed there was not any doubt left of his being one of the Actors of that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But there having been Å¿ome Endeavours Å¿ince by the AccuÅ¿ation of one <hi>John Cole,</hi> and others, to make the Å¿aid <hi>Henry HarriÅ¿on</hi> appear Innocent, and to Arraign the JuÅ¿tice of the Kingdom.

And conÅ¿idering it was done in the Dark, I think there will be given as clear an Evidence of it againÅ¿t Mr <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> the PriÅ¿oner, as can be expected. And that it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95781:4"/>
this occaÅ¿ion one Mrs <hi>Vanwicke</hi> a Widdow (between whom and Mr <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> there was a great KindneÅ¿s) prevailed with Dr <hi>Clenche,</hi> to whom Å¿he was indebted twenty Pounds, to lend her Å¿o much more as would make it up one hundred and twenty Pounds, and to take a Mortgage of a HouÅ¿e of hers in <hi>Buckingham Court</hi> near <hi>Charing-CroÅ¿s</hi> for his Security; and Mr <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> was preÅ¿ent with Mrs <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> at the lending of the reÅ¿t of the Money, and executing of the Mortgage, as he was wont to he at the Management of her Affairs; but when the time came that it was to be repaid, the Dr could not get his Money, and Mrs <hi>Vanwicke</hi> having but an EÅ¿tare for Life in the HouÅ¿e, and having long delayed the Doctor, he brought an Ejectment for the recovering of the HouÅ¿e, upon which the PriÅ¿oner came to Dr <hi>Clenche,</hi> and abuÅ¿ed him with very Å¿currilous Language, and his PaÅ¿Å¿ion growing higher, he laid his hand upon his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

And it will be proved further to you, that at another time the PriÅ¿oner Å¿aid, That Dr <hi>Clenche</hi> was a Rogue and a Villain, and deÅ¿erved to have his Throat cut. And Å¿ometime after this Mrs <hi>Vanwicke</hi> would have borrowed Å¿ome more Money of the Doctor, but he refuÅ¿ed to lend it her, whereupon Å¿he acquainting the PriÅ¿oner with it, he Å¿aid, leave him to me (Madam) I'll warrant you, I'll manage him, he is a Rogue, and deÅ¿erves to have his Throat cut. And afterwards about St <hi>Thomas</hi>'s day laÅ¿t, the PriÅ¿oner went to Mrs <hi>WeÅ¿t</hi> the Tennant, who dwelt in the HouÅ¿e mortgaged to Dr <hi>Clenche,</hi> and deÅ¿ired of Mrs <hi>WeÅ¿t</hi> to have Å¿ome Money for Mrs <hi>Vanwicke,</hi> and Å¿aid it Å¿hould be diÅ¿counted in part of the then next <hi>ChriÅ¿tmas</hi> Rent. But the Å¿aid Mrs <hi>WeÅ¿t</hi> refuÅ¿ed to pay him any, telling him that Å¿he and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band were forbid by Dr <hi>Clenche</hi> and the Ground Land-Lord, to pay any more to Mrs <hi>Vanwicke,</hi> and thereupon the PriÅ¿oner expreÅ¿Å¿ed his further Malice againÅ¿t the Doctor, and Å¿aid he is a great Rogue, and a Villain, and deÅ¿erves to have his Throat cut, and will not dye in his Bed. And, Gentlemen, Å¿oon after the PriÅ¿oner began to put his malicious DeÅ¿ign againÅ¿t the Doctor in Execution, and the Method he took was firÅ¿t to change his Lodgings, for on the day before <hi>ChriÅ¿tmas Eve</hi> laÅ¿t, he took new Lodgings at one Mr <hi>Garways</hi> in <hi>Thread-Needle-Å¿treet,</hi> near the <hi>Old Exchange,</hi> attended by a Foot-boy, pretending himÅ¿elf to be a Parliament Man, and that he was juÅ¿t then come out of the Country, and lay in his Lodging there every Night, until the firÅ¿t day of <hi>January</hi> following, but lay out that Night, and the two next Nights following. And whilÅ¿t he lodged at this Mr <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> this matter hapned, which does conduce Å¿omewhat towards the diÅ¿covery of this Murther. One Evening the PriÅ¿oner being in his Chamber there, and one Mrs <hi>JackÅ¿on,</hi> the Daughter of Mrs <hi>Garway,</hi> making a Fire for him, he did take out his Handkerchief, and held it before the Fire to dry it, which Å¿he took great notice of, becauÅ¿e it was courÅ¿e and dirty, and not Å¿it for his Quality (as Å¿he thought) it being made of ordinary <hi>Indian</hi> Å¿tuff, like her Mothers Maids
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95781:4"/>
Apron. And, Gentlemen, this very Handkerchief was the Å¿ame with which the Murther was committed, and this Mrs <hi>JackÅ¿on</hi> will Å¿wear it to be the Å¿ame, for it is a very remarkable one, and it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to you. And we Å¿hall Å¿hew you further, that on the Third Day of <hi>January</hi> (being the Day before this Murther was committed) he cauÅ¿ed a Å¿ham Letter to be left for him at his Lodgings at this Mr <hi>Garway</hi>'s, as written from a Friend of his that was Sick in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, earneÅ¿ly preÅ¿Å¿ing him to come quickly down to him: And we Å¿hall prove that the very Å¿ame Evening he being with Mrs <hi>Vanwick</hi> in <hi>WoodÅ¿treet-</hi>Counter, did again threaten Dr <hi>Clenche,</hi> and Å¿aid that he was a Rogue, and he would have his Blood. And upon the Fourth Day of <hi>January</hi> laÅ¿t he again changed his Lodgings, and took new ones at one Mr <hi>Jones</hi>'s a Cane-Chair-maker in St <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard, and there he pretended himÅ¿elf to be a Country Gentleman, juÅ¿t then come out of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and brought in a Portmanteau Trunk thither. And the Å¿ame Day he Å¿ent a Letter to Mrs <hi>Garway</hi> where he had lodged before, acquainting her that he was gone out of Town for a Week or ten Days. And, to give you farther Satisfaction, we Å¿hall prove that upon the Å¿ame Fourth Day of <hi>January</hi> in the Night of which this unfortunate Gentleman was Murther'd, the PriÅ¿oner was at one Mr <hi>Robert HumÅ¿ton</hi>'s Lodgings at the <hi>Golden-Key</hi> in <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿treet</hi> over againÅ¿t <hi>Fetter-lane</hi> End, at near Nine of the Clock at Night, and being ask'd by Mr <hi>HumÅ¿ton</hi> to Å¿tay and Sup with him, he Å¿aid he could not, for he had been about earneÅ¿t BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s that Day, which was to be done that Night, and that a Gentleman Å¿tayed for him in the Street to go with him about it, and Å¿o he went away. And Å¿oon after, about Nine of the Clock the Å¿ame Night, two Men Å¿tanding in <hi>FleetÅ¿treet</hi> at <hi>Fetterlane</hi> End, call'd for a Coach, and ask'd the Coachman if he knew Dr <hi>Clenche</hi> who dwelt in <hi>Brownlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿treet</hi> in <hi>Holborn;</hi> and the Coachman reply'd, he did know the Street, but not the Doctor, whereupon they went into the Coach, and ordered him to live to the End of <hi>BrownlowÅ¿treet,</hi> and when they came thither, one of them called to the Coachman and bad him go to Dr <hi>Clenche</hi>'s and tell him, that two Gentlemen in a Coach at the End of the Street deÅ¿ired him to go with them to a Patient that was very Sick, which the Coachman did. And he found the Doctor in his Night-Gown and Slippers, and juÅ¿t a going to Bed; but he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately dreÅ¿Å¿ed himÅ¿elf, and went to them into the Coach. And it fell out very happily for the further DiÅ¿covery of this Murther, that while this Coach Å¿tood at the End of <hi>BrownlowÅ¿treet,</hi> a Young Gentlewoman Å¿tanding at her own Door near it, and fancying that while the Coachman went on the Errand, the Gentlemen would Å¿hip out of the Coach (I think they call it Bilking) Å¿he watch'd them And a Lamp that lighted croÅ¿s <hi>Holborn</hi> over againÅ¿t <hi>BrownlowÅ¿treet</hi> End, and another about the middle of <hi>BrownlowÅ¿treet,</hi> gave Å¿uch a light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Coach, that Å¿he plainly Å¿aw one of the Men that Å¿ate in it, and Å¿ee him look out of the Coach after the Coachman, and heard him Å¿wear at the Coachman, becauÅ¿e he made no more haÅ¿te in going to the Doctor's HouÅ¿e, and Å¿he is very certain that the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar is the Å¿ame PerÅ¿on that look'd out of the Coach, and that did

For Å¿he hearing of this Murther and remembring theÅ¿e CircumÅ¿tances, Å¿he went to <hi>Newgate</hi> to Å¿ee the PriÅ¿oner, and hearing his Voice in another Room, before Å¿he Å¿aw him; Å¿he declar'd to the PerÅ¿ons that were then with her, that the Voice Å¿he then heard was the PerÅ¿ons Voice that Å¿he Å¿aw look out of the Coach, and that did Å¿wear at the Coachman; and afterwards when Å¿he came into the Room where the PriÅ¿oner was, though with Å¿everal other Men, Å¿he point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him as the PerÅ¿on, and Å¿he hearing him then Å¿peak again, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the PerÅ¿ons with her, that both by his Voice and by his Countenance Å¿he knew him to be the Å¿ame Man. And, my Lord, after thoÅ¿e Gentlemen had gotten the Doctor into the Coach, one of them called to the Coachman, and bad him make haÅ¿te and drive them to <hi>Leaden-Hall</hi> Market, and when they were come within <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn-Bars</hi> one of them called to the Coachman and bad him drive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter; whereupon the Coachman drove them very faÅ¿t through <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn</hi> to <hi>Leaden-Hall-Market-Gate,</hi> and when he came there, one of them bad him drive to the <hi>Pye</hi> without <hi>Aldgate</hi> (before which time, without doubt, the Murther was committed upon the Doctor, for his Hat was found next morning in <hi>Holborn</hi> near <hi>Fetter-lane</hi> End, but the driving Å¿o long about after is Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be done leaÅ¿t the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor might recover) and when they were come without <hi>Aldgate,</hi> one of them ordered the Coachman to ask there for one <hi>Hunt</hi> a <hi>Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon;</hi> which he did, and being anÅ¿wered that no Å¿uch PerÅ¿on was there, he ordered the Coachman to drive back again to <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> and when they came there, one of them called the Coachman and gave him Three Shillings and Six Pence, and bad him go into the Market there to one <hi>Hunt</hi>'s a Poulterer, and buy them a couple of Fowls, but the Coachman could not find any <hi>Hunt</hi> a <hi>Poulterer,</hi> but however he bought a couple of Fowls for Three Shillings, and when he came with them to his Coach, the two Gentlemen were gone and the Doctor left in the Coach murther'd with a Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief tied faÅ¿t about his Neck with a Coal in it (which will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the PriÅ¿oners Handkerchief.) BeÅ¿ides there was a Boy in the Street there who took notice of the Coachman's being Å¿ent of an Errand, and Å¿aw the two PerÅ¿ons come out of the Coach in great haÅ¿te, and Å¿he going towards the Coach before they went out of it, one of them did Å¿wear at him to be gone, and of him the Boy took moÅ¿t notice, and was as poÅ¿Å¿itive as any man can be to the PerÅ¿on of one that he never Å¿aw before, that the PriÅ¿oner now at the Bar was one of them, and was the PerÅ¿on that did then Å¿wear at him. But this WitneÅ¿s is Å¿pirited away and cannot be heard of, although he hath been deÅ¿cribed in the <hi>Gazettee,</hi> and diligent Å¿earch and inquiry has been made after him. But we have his Examination upon Oath before the Coroner; and we muÅ¿t Å¿ubmit to the Court how far that Å¿hall be admitted as Evidence.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr JohnÅ¿on,</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, I believe I Å¿hall Å¿ay nothing that <hi>Mr Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿on</hi> will contradict, I was Attorny for Dr <hi>Clenche</hi> between him and <hi>Mrs Vanwicke,</hi> and I Å¿ued <hi>Mr Rowe</hi> that was bound with <hi>Mrs Vanwicke</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95781:6"/>
in a Bond to perform Covenants for re-payment of the Money lent her by Dr <hi>Clenche</hi> upon <hi>Mortgage;</hi> and I adviÅ¿ed the Dr. and told him, don't let us trouble the Tenant, but let us take <hi>Rowe</hi> firÅ¿t; and I Å¿ued <hi>Rowe,</hi> and had him arreÅ¿ted, and after Å¿ome time, I Å¿aw that the <hi>Mortgage</hi> muÅ¿t do our buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, for <hi>Rowe</hi> could not pay the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> whereupon I cauÅ¿ed a Declaration in Ejectment to be delivered againÅ¿t <hi>Mrs Vanwick's</hi> Tenant of the HouÅ¿e <hi>Mortgaged</hi> by her to Dr <hi>Clenche,</hi> and then <hi>Mr HarriÅ¿on</hi> came to me, and he expreÅ¿Å¿ed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf againÅ¿t the Dr after a Å¿trange rate, and laid his Hand upon his Sword, Å¿o my Lord I Å¿aid to him, what a Fool do you make of your Å¿elf? muÅ¿t none go to Law, but they muÅ¿t ask you leave, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e <hi>Mr HarriÅ¿on</hi> cannot deny this. Then <hi>Mr HarriÅ¿on</hi> preferred a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lords CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners of the Great Seal for <hi>Mrs Vanwicke,</hi> and thereby Å¿uggeÅ¿ted to their LordÅ¿hips that Å¿he was wronged in the PurchaÅ¿e and in the <hi>Mortgage Money,</hi> and that twenty Pounds of it was a former debt of her Husbands; and he finding Å¿he could have no Relief before them without payment of the <hi>Mortgage Money,</hi> he grew troubleÅ¿ome; yet Å¿ays I, <hi>Mr HarriÅ¿on,</hi> What Å¿he hath done, I cannot help, but if Å¿he would pay the reÅ¿t, I told him I would abate her twenty Pounds, and the IntereÅ¿t <hi>Money</hi> alÅ¿o.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr Darnell,</speaker>
                     <p>Pray Sir, did the Dr deÅ¿ire you to act for him in your own Name, becauÅ¿e he had no mind to meet with <hi>Mrs Vanwicke</hi> and the PriÅ¿oner?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr JohnÅ¿on,</speaker>
                     <p>The Doctor did find himÅ¿elf too deeply concerned with them, and he did not care to have to do with them, whether it was that he was afraid of his Life, I cannot Å¿ay; but he Å¿aid to me, Pray Sir, go on, I will put all into your hands, and I will truÅ¿t you with all the Affair, and let them come to you, and not trouble me, own it to be your own; and I told him, I feared none of them, and the Doctor gave out that he had made over all to me, although he had not, and upon this I fear, comes this unfortunate BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s, and the Doctor's Lady muÅ¿t look after it her Å¿elf.</p>

                     <p>He Å¿aid the Dr. had cheated the Widdow, and he Å¿aid that he would be revenged on him, as near as my <hi>Memory</hi> will Å¿erve me, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e he will not deny it; whether he did this in a PaÅ¿Å¿ion, or to affright the Doctor or no, I cannot tell.</p>

                     <p>May it pleaÅ¿e your LordÅ¿hip, this Gentleman, the PriÅ¿oner, came to me two or three Days before St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Day laÅ¿t, and deÅ¿ired me to give him Å¿ome Rent for Mrs. <hi>Vanwick,</hi> and I told him, I had no Power to Pay him, becauÅ¿e I was warned by Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> to Pay no more; Å¿ays he to me again, Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> and <hi>Rowe,</hi> are great Rogues and great Villains. Sir, Å¿ays I to him again, I believe that the Doctor is a very honeÅ¿t Man: No, Å¿ays Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on,</hi> he is a great Villain, and he will never Die in his Bed; which of them he meant, Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> or Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> I cannot tell. And Mrs. <hi>Vanwick,</hi> and Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on,</hi> a little time before that, preÅ¿Å¿ed me, to let
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95781:7"/>
them have Å¿ome Shop Goods in part of her Rent, to grow due, and Å¿he made great Complaint, that her Children were ready to Starve, and I then told them, that Mr. <hi>JohnÅ¿on</hi> had fore-warned me to pay any more Rent to Mrs. <hi>Vanwick,</hi> and if I did, I Å¿hould pay it again; and therefore I would not pay any more Rent to her, or deliver her any Goods, until Å¿he had agreed with Mr. <hi>JohnÅ¿on,</hi> and then Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> Å¿aid, that Mr. <hi>JohnÅ¿on</hi> was a great Villain, and a great Rogue, and that they had all Combined together to Cheat the Widow. And Mr. <hi>JohnÅ¿on</hi> being at my HouÅ¿e, Mrs. <hi>Vanwick</hi> fell upon him in a great Rage, and Å¿aid, Å¿he would Tear his Throat out, and laid hold on him, and Mr. <hi>JohnÅ¿on</hi> got from her, and went away in great haÅ¿te. And the laÅ¿t time I Å¿aw Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> I preÅ¿Å¿ed very hard upon him, to let Mrs. <hi>Vanwick</hi> have more Money; and the Doctor Å¿aid, that Å¿he would never do any good with it, for Å¿he Å¿pent it all upon Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on;</hi> and I wiÅ¿hed him to let her have Twenty Pounds more, and he Å¿aid, that he adviÅ¿ed her to go to Service, and that he had wiÅ¿hed her to a Service of Twenty Pounds a Year, and Å¿he abuÅ¿ed him for it.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, on the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> laÅ¿t, being <hi>Monday,</hi> I was at the <hi>Play-houÅ¿e,</hi> and there I took up a Man and a Woman, and carried them into the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95781:9"/>
City; Å¿o I brought the Gentleman back again, to the <hi>Green Dragon</hi> Tavern in <hi>Fleet-Å¿treet;</hi> and then, he Å¿aid, he would pay me by the hour; he Å¿aid, that it was but much about Nine a Clock. Then I left him, and was driving up the Street towards the <hi>Temple,</hi> and two Men Å¿tood in <hi>Fleet-Å¿treet</hi> about <hi>Fetter-Lane</hi> End, and they asked me, if I knew Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> who Dwelt in <hi>Brownelowe-Å¿treet</hi> in <hi>Holbourn:</hi> I told them, that I did not know Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> but I knew the Street. So they went into my Coach, and one of them bad me Drive thither, and I did, and Å¿topt at the Streets End; becauÅ¿e the Gate at the other End was Å¿hut, Å¿o that I could not turn my Coach: And one of them, bad me go and tell the Dr. That there were two Gentlemen in a Coach at the Streets End, that would deÅ¿ire him, to go with them, to Å¿ee one that was not Well. The Doctor asked me, if I could tell, Who they were? Or, who it was, that he was to go to? I told him, that I could not tell The Doctor was in his Night-Gown and Slippers, and he DreÅ¿Å¿ed himÅ¿elf: And when he came to the Coach, one of them removed from his Place, and gave him the hinder-part of the Coach; and told him, That they had a Friend, that was not Well: And one of them, bad me Drive to <hi>Leaden-Hall-Market;</hi> and when I came about <hi>Holborn-Bars,</hi> one of them called to me, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, Why I drove Å¿o Å¿lowly? And bad me drive faÅ¿ter; Å¿o I Drove faÅ¿t, and came to <hi>Leaden-hall.</hi> And then one of them, bad me drive to the <hi>Pye</hi> Tavern without <hi>Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> and there Ordered me to Å¿top. And when I had Å¿topped there, one of them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to me, and told me, that I need not Å¿tir out of my Coach-Box; but call to the Boy at the Tavern, and ask for one <hi>Hunt</hi> a Chyrurgeon, which I did do: And when the Boy came to me again, he Å¿aid, there was no Å¿uch Man. Then one of them bad me Drive back again to <hi>Leaden-hall;</hi> and in the time I Å¿tayed there, and turned my Coach, <hi>Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> was Å¿hut; and when I came to the Gate, one of them gave Six Pence to the Watch, and the Gate was opened, and I drove to <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> Gate. And when I came there, I Å¿topped again, and one of them gave me Half a Crown, and bad me go and buy a Fowl of one <hi>Hunt</hi> a Poulterer; but after I had gone a little way from the Coach, he called me again, and Å¿aid, Here Coachman, you had as good take an other Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and buy a Couple: So I went, and bought a couple of Fowls, but I could find no Å¿uch Poulterer as <hi>Hunt,</hi> Å¿o I bought them of another, and I gave three Shillings for them. And when I came back to the Coach Å¿ide, I found Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> (as I thought) Å¿itting againÅ¿t the Fore-Å¿eat, with his Head againÅ¿t the CuÅ¿hion: I pull'd him, and cried, MaÅ¿ter, MaÅ¿ter, for I thought he had been in Drink, but I could not get one word from him; and then I went to the Watch, who were near; and when they came, we found him Strangled with a Handcherchief about his Neck, and a Coal in it placed, juÅ¿t upon his Wind-Pipe, but the other two Men were gone.</p>

                     <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                     <p>Gentlemen of the Jury; The PriÅ¿oner at the Bar, <hi>Henry HarriÅ¿on,</hi> Å¿tands indicted for the wilful Murder of Dr. <hi>Andrew Clenche,</hi> who was barbarouÅ¿ly murdered on the fourth day of <hi>January</hi> laÅ¿t: You have heard the WitneÅ¿Å¿es that have been Å¿worn; and upon their TeÅ¿timony, it doth appear that two PerÅ¿ons came to <hi>Brownlow-Å¿treet-</hi>End in a Coach after nine a Clock at night, and Å¿ent the Coach-man to the Doctor's HouÅ¿e, under pretence to get him to a Patient, a Friend of theirs, that was Å¿ick. By this Contrivance, they got him into their Coach, which they had brought for that purpoÅ¿e, and then they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Coach-man to drive to <hi>Leadenhall-Å¿treet;</hi> and when they came about <hi>Holborn-Bars,</hi> one of them ask'd the Coach-man why he drove Å¿o Å¿low, and bad him drive faÅ¿ter. When they came to <hi>Leadenhall-Å¿treet,</hi> then they bad him drive to the <hi>Pye-Tavern</hi> without <hi>Aldgate;</hi> where one of them bad the Coach-man ask for one <hi>Hunt;</hi> but he not being there, one of them bad the Coach-man return back, and gave Å¿ix Pence to the Watch to come through the Gate, which was Å¿hut in the mean time; and when they came to <hi>Leadenhall-Market,</hi> one of them gave the Coach-man three Shillings and Å¿ix Pence, and Å¿ent him to buy a couple of Fowls; which the Coach-man did buy, and brought them to the Coach; but when he came back, he found the Doctor in the body of the Coach leaning againÅ¿t the fore Seat of the Coach, a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief being tied about his Neck with a Coal in it, placed upon his Wind-pipe; which Hankerchief and Coal have been produced in Court.</p>
                     <p>The QueÅ¿tion is, Gentlemen, Whether the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar be Guilty of this baÅ¿e and barbarous Murder? To prove which, there have been a very long Evidence given, Å¿ome PoÅ¿itive, Å¿ome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantial. It has been proved that Dr. <hi>Clenche</hi> had Å¿ome Dealings with a Woman named <hi>Vanwicke,</hi> and had lent her one hundred and twenty Pounds, and had taken a Mortage for it. This PriÅ¿oner, Mr. <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on,</hi> was a great Acquaintance, and very intimate with this Woman; and did concern himÅ¿elf in the management of her Affairs: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e Dr. <hi>Clenche</hi> did refuÅ¿e to lend the Woman more Money, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had an AnimoÅ¿ity againÅ¿t Dr. <hi>Clenche.</hi> The Money not being paid to the Doctor as he did expect, he did call it in; and therefore this Gentlewoman did oftentimes repair to Dr. <hi>Clenche</hi> to deÅ¿ire far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time, or Forbearance, becauÅ¿e Å¿he could not raiÅ¿e or procure the Money elÅ¿ewhere. That about <hi>MichaelmaÅ¿s</hi> laÅ¿t it Å¿eems Å¿he came to a Coffee-houÅ¿e near <hi>Warwick-</hi>houÅ¿e in <hi>Holborn,</hi> and there was Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on;</hi> where they conÅ¿ulted what to do. And it was agreed, that the MiÅ¿treÅ¿s of the HouÅ¿e and Mrs. <hi>Vanwicke</hi> Å¿hould go to Dr. <hi>Clench</hi>'s; but Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> Å¿hould Å¿tay behind, for it was not thought convenient that he Å¿hould go, leÅ¿t he Å¿hould provoke the Doctor. When they came to the Doctor, Mrs. <hi>Vanwicke</hi> was very importunate to have Å¿ome more Money; but the Doctor would lend her no more. And when they returned to the Coffee-houÅ¿e again, Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what paÅ¿Å¿ed between the Doctor and Mrs. <hi>Vanwicke.</hi> She told him, that the Doctor would not furniÅ¿h her with any more Money, although Å¿he had preÅ¿Å¿ed him to do it, and urged her great NeceÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but adviÅ¿ed her to go to Service. Damn him, Å¿ays <hi>HarriÅ¿on,</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95781:16"/>
does he Å¿ay that a Woman of your Quality Å¿hould go to Service? He is a great Rogue, and deÅ¿erves to have his Throat cut; but let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, I will manage him.</p>
                     <p>At another place there was a DiÅ¿courÅ¿e betwixt Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> and one Mr. <hi>JohnÅ¿on;</hi> and that the PriÅ¿oner did then Å¿peak very hard and ill Words of Dr. <hi>Clenche:</hi> And that Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> came frequently to him; and one time laid his hand upon his Sword, uÅ¿ing Å¿ome mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Words, but what they were he cannot tell: But he likewiÅ¿e Å¿ays, that at Å¿everal times he did expoÅ¿tulate with him, and told him, That he would not do any good with Å¿uch DiÅ¿courÅ¿es as theÅ¿e are, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Mortgage-Money not being paid, it was thought fit, That there Å¿hould be a ProÅ¿ecution made to get poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged EÅ¿tate, and that the Tenants Å¿hould be forbid to pay their Rents. And Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> went to Mrs. <hi>WeÅ¿t</hi> the Tenant, Å¿ome few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Thomas</hi> day laÅ¿t, and demanded the Rent of her. To which Å¿he made anÅ¿wer, That Dr. <hi>Clenche</hi> had forbid the paiment of the Rent to Mrs. <hi>Vanwicke.</hi> Thereupon Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> grew very angry, and anÅ¿wered, That Dr. <hi>Clench</hi> was a Rogue and a Villain, and bid her that Å¿he Å¿hould not pay him any Rent. And the WitneÅ¿s Å¿aith further, That the Doctor being preÅ¿t to let her have Å¿ome more Money, refuÅ¿ed to do it, becauÅ¿e Å¿he would Å¿pend it all upon <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the CounÅ¿el for the King called Å¿ome WitneÅ¿Å¿es, who gave you account of the PriÅ¿oner's Å¿hifting his Lodgings the day before the Murder was done. He takes a Lodging at Mr. <hi>Garway</hi>'s in <hi>Thread-needle-</hi>Å¿treet, on the twenty third day of <hi>December,</hi> and there he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till about the firÅ¿t of <hi>January.</hi> The Å¿econd of <hi>January</hi> he was at <hi>Garway</hi>'s Shop; and on the Sunday night he came and fetcht away his Things. The Monday after, being the day that this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fact was committed, he Å¿ent a Letter to Mrs. <hi>Garway,</hi> to acquaint her that he was gone out of Town; but he left three half Crowns with her Maid to pay for his Lodging. But as to his going out of Town, it was falÅ¿e, for he never went into the Country, but took a Lodging at Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>'s in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard. It's obÅ¿ervable alÅ¿o, that he went for a Parliament-Man<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> when he lodged at Mr. <hi>Garway</hi>'s, and had his Footman to attend upon him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There it was that he was Å¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> to have an ordinary Handkerchief, and to hold it to the Fire; which was taken notice of by Mrs. <hi>JackÅ¿on,</hi> the Daughter of Mrs. <hi>Garway,</hi> which was not Å¿utable, as Å¿he thought, to a Parliament-Man's Quality, but rather fit for a Seaman, for it was like the Apron of the Maid in the HouÅ¿e: which hath been Å¿hewed in Court, and compared with the Handkerchief that was tied about Dr. <hi>Clench</hi>'s Neck. She Å¿aith it is the Å¿ame, or very like that which Å¿he did Å¿ee Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> hold in his hand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cartwright</hi> the Officer at the Compter, he tells you, that the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night, the day before the Murder, Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> came to <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿treet-</hi>Compter, and enquired for Mrs. <hi>Vanwicke,</hi> and that he only was in her Chamber, and no other Body on that Å¿ide of the HouÅ¿e but Mrs. <hi>Vanwicke,</hi> the PriÅ¿oner, and this <hi>Cartwright</hi> the Keeper, who Å¿tood at the Door, and heard <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> Å¿ay, That he would have the Blood of that Rogue, and named <hi>Clench,</hi> or <hi>Winch.</hi>

                     <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                     <p>No, he was not; but there were none on that Å¿ide the HouÅ¿e but You, <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Vanwicke.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:95781:16"/>
Now, on the Monday on which this Fact was committed, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken a Lodging at <hi>Jones</hi> his HouÅ¿e, he came thither with a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who brought his Portmantua-Trunk about eight a Clock at night; and after he had been there a little while, he went away.</p>
                     <p>And you are told, by a Gentleman that lodges at the Golden-Key againÅ¿t <hi>Fetter-lane</hi> end; That he had Å¿ome Acquaintance with the PriÅ¿oner, that he had lent him a Morning-Gown; and that about nine a Clock that very night, he came to his Lodging in a Cloak; and then the Gentleman asked him for his Gown; and he told him, that he had brought it with him. Thereupon the Gentleman invites Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> to Å¿tay and Å¿up with him. Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> Å¿aid, he could not Å¿tay, for he was engaged; he muÅ¿t be gone, for that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Å¿taid in the Street for him to go about extraordinary BuÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s.</p>
                     <p>The Coachman tells you, That near about that time two Men in <hi>Fleet-Å¿treet,</hi> near <hi>Fetter-lane</hi> end, hired his Coach of him to go to <hi>Brownlow-Å¿treet</hi> to Dr. <hi>Clench</hi>'s; but he can't poÅ¿itively Å¿ay, that the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar was one of them, but he Å¿wears, he does verily believe that he was one of them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>He Å¿aid before your LordÅ¿hip, That he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what I had on.</p>

                     <p>Well, well, he doth not remember it now; but being hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to go to Dr. <hi>Clench</hi>'s, he drove to the Street end and no further, becauÅ¿e the Gate at the lower end was Å¿hut up, and he could not turn his Coach in the Street; but he was Å¿ent by them to the Doctor's, to deÅ¿ire the Doctor to come out to them, and they Å¿at in the Coach in the mean time. The Doctor made haÅ¿te, and went to them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and they drove away to <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> and then to <hi>Aldgate;</hi> and they called at the Py-Tavern, and enquired for one Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> a Chirurgeon, as I mentioned to you before: He not being there, they returned to drive through <hi>Aldgate,</hi> gave the Watch Å¿ix-pence, and paÅ¿Å¿ed through the Gate without any manner of notice taken: but if the Watch had done their Duty, it might have been better diÅ¿covered. But further, the Coachman tells you, that when he came to <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> Street, they called to him, and directed him to buy one Fowl; and after that he had been gone a little way from the Coach, they called him back, and bad him take Å¿ome more Money and buy two Fowls. So he went and bought the Fowls; but when he came back, the two Gentlemen were gone, and he found the Doctor Å¿till in the Coach; and he not Å¿tirring, he thought he had been in Drink: but upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination, and calling the Watchman with his Candle, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that the Doctor was Å¿trangled with a Handkerchief and a Coal.</p>
                     <p>There is one Mrs. <hi>Elianor AÅ¿hbolt,</hi> who lives in <hi>Brownlow-Å¿treet</hi> with her Mother, and had been Å¿ent of an Errand; and between nine and ten of the Clock at Night, Å¿he Å¿aw the Coachman in <hi>Brownlow-Å¿treet,</hi> and thought that thoÅ¿e Men in the Coach might put a Trick upon him, by going away without paying him his Fare. And Å¿he Å¿ays further, That by the help of the Lamps Å¿he did diÅ¿cern the Face of this <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on</hi> in the Coach; he had a Cloak on, with a light Perriwig, and looked out of the Coach, and did Å¿wear at the Coachman; and by this means Å¿he knew him when Å¿he Å¿aw him again, to be the Å¿ame Man, both by his Face and Voice. This Woman indeed was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95781:17"/>
the Coroner, and Å¿he gives you this reaÅ¿on for it, becauÅ¿e her Mother was not willing Å¿he Å¿hould be concerned in Å¿uch a matter as this was; and what Å¿he could Å¿ay, was not known to <hi>Mrs. Clenche</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til after the Å¿econd SeÅ¿Å¿ions: And when he was in <hi>Newgate,</hi> Å¿he Å¿aw him there, and declared he was the Å¿ame Man.</p>
                     <p>There was another piece of Evidence, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the Boy's, who does not appear, he was examined before the Coroner. There has been Evidence given of ill practice to take him out of the way, and therefore his Affidavit is read for Evidence: He Å¿wears he Å¿aw two Gentlemen come out of the Coach when it Å¿tood in <hi>Leaden hall</hi> Å¿treet, and that having Å¿een the PriÅ¿oner in <hi>Newgate</hi> Å¿ince, doth believe him to be one. This, Gentlemen, is the Sum and SubÅ¿tance of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the King, to prove that the PriÅ¿oner was one of thoÅ¿e that committed the Murder.</p>
                     <p>You have heard likewiÅ¿e what the PriÅ¿oner Å¿ays for himÅ¿elf; he does undertake to prove that he was in another Place, (that is) that he Å¿hould come into <hi>Maccafee</hi>'s HouÅ¿e in Crown-Court over againÅ¿t Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants-Inn in <hi>Chancery-lane:</hi> and <hi>Maccafee,</hi> he tells you, that there were Å¿ome other Company there, and that <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> came in very cold, and that they went to Cards, and plaid for one Penny a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at Whisk; and that he did continue there from nine till eleven a Clock; and if he was there then, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible he Å¿hould be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Fact, for the Fact was done between the Å¿ame Hours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maccafee</hi>'s Wife tells you the Å¿ame, and they both tell you who were there beÅ¿ides, and who plaid together, and are poÅ¿itive that the PriÅ¿oner was there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Baker</hi> Å¿ays, That he went away about half an hour after ten at Night, and left <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> behind him. To confirm this Evidence, they have called two other WitneÅ¿Å¿es beÅ¿ides the Drawers at the King's-Head Tavern, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> the Surgeon, who lives in <hi>Stone-cutters</hi> Street, and Mr. <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿el:</hi> Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> Å¿ays, they had been at the HorÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hoe Tavern in <hi>Chancery-lane,</hi> and called for half a Pint of Sack at the King's-head Tavern when they came by: and as they Å¿at in the Coach, Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> came by accidentally, and one of them looking out of the Coach, cries <hi>Harry,</hi> or <hi>HarriÅ¿on;</hi> and he went to them, and they drank together another half Pint of Sack.</p>
                     <p>As to their meeting with <hi>HarriÅ¿on,</hi> and as to other PaÅ¿Å¿ages there, <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿ell</hi> Å¿ays the Å¿ame; but as to the time of Night he is not poÅ¿itive. And they Å¿ent one of the Drawers to a HouÅ¿e in Crown-Court to enquire for Å¿ome Body there.</p>
                     <p>The Drawers of the King's-Head Tavern, Å¿ay, That Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> and Mr. <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿ell</hi> did call there about that time; and that they drank two half Pints of Wine: and that when they were drinking, a Man came by with a Hanging-Coat or Cloak on, and drank with them. And one of the Drawers went to call Å¿ome Body in Crown-Court; and one of the Company up with his Muff and gave him a Å¿lap in the Face.</p>
                     <p>Now this is the Sum and SubÅ¿tance of the Evidence that you have heard on the behalf of the PriÅ¿oner, to induce you to believe that he was not the PerÅ¿on that was concerned in the Murder of Doctor <hi>Clenche.</hi>

                     <p>Well, well, Gentlemen, the People of the HouÅ¿e are not of very good Reputation, they keep a naughty and a diÅ¿orderly HouÅ¿e, (if you believe the WitneÅ¿Å¿es) you may conÅ¿ider of their Credit.</p>
                     <p>And as to Mr. <hi>Baker;</hi> About nine Years Å¿ince he was convicted of an arrant Cheat, which is no leÅ¿s than Forgery, for altering the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger's Rate for St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s PariÅ¿h, and therefore the leÅ¿s Credit is to be given to his Evidence; for now it appears that he is a Knave upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: and the very Record it Å¿elf was produced againÅ¿t him, which is true without doubt, notwithÅ¿tanding his pretence of Innocency. What is Å¿aid by Mr. <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿ell</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sutton,</hi> I muÅ¿t leave to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ideration; they had been a drinking, and the Drawer Å¿ays they were at the King's-Head Tavern at 11 of the Clock at Night. Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> the next day after the Murder, met a Gentleman at <hi>Joes</hi> Coffee-HouÅ¿e in <hi>Salisbury-Court;</hi> and though he had taken a Lodging in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-Yard, yet he Å¿aid that he was newly come to Town, and had been in <hi>Kent,</hi> and had remained there about three Weeks; and that he wanted a LaundreÅ¿s and a Lodging, although he had not been out of Town, and had taken a Lodging but the day before: And then he told the WitneÅ¿s who diÅ¿courÅ¿ed with him about the Death of Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> That he had formerly loved him, but he Å¿aid he had been of late a barbarous Rogue to a poor Gentlewoman a Friend of his; and that the juÅ¿t Judgment of God had fallen upon him for Å¿o doing, and that he would write to her to give her an account of it; and adviÅ¿e her to write to Mrs. <hi>Clenche,</hi> and to tell her that Å¿he was a Widow now as well as Mrs. <hi>Vanwick;</hi> and he thought by that Means to move Mrs. <hi>Clenche</hi> to pity her, being a Widow as well as her Å¿elf: And that whilÅ¿t they were talking thus, one Mr. <hi>RavenÅ¿croft</hi> tells him, that Dr. <hi>Clenche</hi> was murdered, and that a Bully of the Town, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to a Gentlewoman in the Compter, one Mrs. <hi>Vanwick,</hi> was Å¿uÅ¿pected. At which Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> was much Å¿tartled, and Å¿aid, That no one was concerned with that Gentlewoman but himÅ¿elf; and for ought he knew, he might be taken up for it. This is that which he Å¿aid.</p>
                     <p>Now what Å¿aid Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> farther for himÅ¿elf? Why, Å¿ays he, this Gentlewoman is not in PriÅ¿on at the ProÅ¿ecution of Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> and was not Å¿o affirmed, but Å¿o reported; and whether it were Å¿o or no is no great matter. Gentlemen, you ought to conÅ¿ider of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that you have heard againÅ¿t him, and alÅ¿o to weigh well the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence he hath brought for himÅ¿elf.</p>
                     <p>It is moÅ¿t plain, if you believe the WitneÅ¿Å¿es, that Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> was concerned for this Woman <hi>Vanwick,</hi> and hath threatned Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> called him Rogue and RaÅ¿cal, and Å¿aid, that he deÅ¿erved to have his Throat cut; that <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> went under a DiÅ¿guiÅ¿e for Å¿ome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Murder. You have had an Account of the Handkerchief, what kind of Handkerchief <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> had, and what Handkerchief was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95781:18"/>
taken about Dr. <hi>Clench</hi>'s Neck, you have Å¿een: And you heard what Evidence was given by Mr. <hi>HumÅ¿tond;</hi> how the PriÅ¿oner was with him about nine a Clock that Night; and how he refuÅ¿ed to Å¿tay and Å¿up with Mr. <hi>HumÅ¿tond.</hi> If Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> had no earneÅ¿t buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, one would have thought he might have Å¿taid with Mr. <hi>HumÅ¿tond</hi> better than to have gone to an Ale-HouÅ¿e in <hi>Crown-Court,</hi> and plaid at Cards at one Penny a piece a Corner; he might have had better Fare no doubt.</p>
                     <p>The WitneÅ¿Å¿es for the PriÅ¿oner Å¿ay for him, That he came to <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cafee</hi>'s HouÅ¿e about 9 a Clock at night, and Å¿taid till eleven: That is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that Evidence given for the King, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was in the Coach at <hi>Brownlow-Å¿treet</hi> End; for if he was at <hi>Maccafee</hi>'s HouÅ¿e all the time they mention, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible he Å¿hould be guilty. All thoÅ¿e things are under your Å¿erious ConÅ¿ideration. You had beÅ¿t go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and if you are not Å¿atisfied upon the Evidence you have heard, that he is guilty, then you ought to acquit him; but if you are Å¿atisfied that he did commit this Murder, then you ought to find him guilty.</p>
                     <p>Then the Jury withdrew, and the Court adjourned for half an hour; and when they were returned, the Jury came to give their Verdict; and being called over, anÅ¿wered to their Names; and Mr. <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> was brought to the Bar.</p>

                     <p>They came about Eight a Clock at Night, and this Man and the other Å¿tayed till after a Eleven a Clock; only <hi>Milward</hi> went out and returned preÅ¿ently, and then immediately he went out again, which was before Nine a Clock, and return'd not until Eleven a Clock or after.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. J. Dolben.</speaker>
                     <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, <hi>Cole</hi> the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar Å¿tands Indicted for Murthering Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> who, as it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, was Murther'd in a Coach by two PerÅ¿ons that were therein together with the Doctor. The queÅ¿tion now before you is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cole</hi> was one of theÅ¿e two?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gamble,</hi> the Coachman, Å¿wears, That the Night Doctor <hi>Clenche</hi> was killed, he took up Three Men in <hi>CheapÅ¿ide,</hi> Å¿et one of them down at <hi>Gray</hi>'s-Inn, and drove on to Doctor <hi>Clenche</hi>'s HouÅ¿e, the Doctor was not at home, then the third Man came in again to the Coach, and he drove to the <hi>Blew-Boar</hi>'s-Head an AlehouÅ¿e by <hi>Clement</hi>'s-Inn, and Å¿et thoÅ¿e Three Men down there, and 'twas then about Eight of the Clock.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sykes</hi> the Coachman, Å¿wears, he took up Two Men at <hi>Fetter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> End in <hi>FleetÅ¿treet,</hi> and by their directions drove to <hi>Brownlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿treet,</hi> where the Doctor lived, whom they got into the Coach, and he drove as far as <hi>Aldgate,</hi> and through the Gate, and then came back to <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> was Å¿ent by the Two Men in the Coach to buy a Fowl, when he returned they were gone, but the Doctor found Dead in the Coach; and 'twas now half an hour paÅ¿t Ten.</p>
                     <p>The QueÅ¿tion now, as I Å¿aid before, is whether <hi>Cole</hi> the PriÅ¿oner at the Bar, was one of theÅ¿e two men.</p>
                     <p>The Woman tells you, <hi>Milward</hi> her Husband told her, that he and <hi>Cole</hi> were in the Coach with Doctor <hi>Clenche,</hi> and that they Two Kill'd Doctor <hi>Clenche.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She likewiÅ¿e tells you, her Husband told her, that <hi>Cole</hi> and her Husband went out from the <hi>Blew-Boars-</hi>Head near <hi>Clement</hi>'s Inn, and left only <hi>Harper</hi> behind.</p>
                     <p>The Court hath already declar'd to you, that her Evidence, being only what her Husband told her, is no Evidence in Law to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a Man's Life, eÅ¿pecially when it is Å¿ingle without any Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance to confirm it, as here 'tis. But that is not all, there is a very great Evidence, that what Å¿he Å¿ays her Husband told her, is falÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>He told her, Å¿he Å¿ays, that he and <hi>Cole</hi> went from the <hi>Blew-Boars-</hi>Head and Kill'd the Doctor, leaving only <hi>Harper</hi> behind.</p>
                     <p>The MaÅ¿ter of the HouÅ¿e and his Servant (WitneÅ¿Å¿es which Å¿he produceth) both Å¿wear, That her Husband went out alone, and leÅ¿t Two Men behind, who both Å¿taid in the HouÅ¿e till <hi>Milward</hi> return'd, which was about Eleven of the Clock. The MaÅ¿ter, 'tis true, cannot Å¿ay that <hi>Cole</hi> is one of the two, but the Servant is very poÅ¿itive he is, and both are PoÅ¿itive, that the two Men, that <hi>Milward</hi> left-behind, continued in the HouÅ¿e till <hi>Milward</hi> returned
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95781:25"/>
at Eleven of the Clock. TheÅ¿e Two Mens DepoÅ¿itions do plainly contradict her Story, and if they Å¿wear true, <hi>Cole</hi> the PriÅ¿oner was not one of the PerÅ¿ons that Kill'd the Doctor.</p>
                     <p>You have all heard, I am Å¿ure, that one <hi>HarriÅ¿on</hi> hath been Convicted by a Jury in this Place for the Murther of Doctor <hi>Clenche:</hi> If he was one of the two, then <hi>Milward</hi> by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion (if his Wife Å¿wear true) was the other; but this you cannot take notice of, the Record is not produced, neither hath the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oner taken notice of it, the QueÅ¿tion is only whether <hi>Cole</hi> be Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Murther? which I leave to you upon the Evidence you have heard.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>The Jury having conÅ¿ider'd their Verdict, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, That the PriÅ¿oner was not Guilty.</p>
