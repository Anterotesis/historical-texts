            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt <hi>Henry Harriſon,</hi> Gent. at his Tryal for that Murther, was ſo full and ſatisfactory to all that heard it, That it was then believed there was not any doubt left of his being one of the Actors of that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But there having been ſome Endeavours ſince by the Accuſation of one <hi>John Cole,</hi> and others, to make the ſaid <hi>Henry Harriſon</hi> appear Innocent, and to Arraign the Juſtice of the Kingdom.

                     <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhips, and you Gentlemen that are ſworn, I am of Councel for the King and Queen againſt the Priſoner at the Barr, who ſtands Indicted for the Murther of Dr <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Clenche,</hi> which was as barbarous a Murther as any that hath been committed in this Age. And conſidering it was done in the Dark, I think there will be given as clear an Evidence of it againſt Mr <hi>Harriſon</hi> the Priſoner, as can be expected. And that it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95781:4"/>
this occaſion one Mrs <hi>Vanwicke</hi> a Widdow (between whom and Mr <hi>Harriſon</hi> there was a great Kindneſs) prevailed with Dr <hi>Clenche,</hi> to whom ſhe was indebted twenty Pounds, to lend her ſo much more as would make it up one hundred and twenty Pounds, and to take a Mortgage of a Houſe of hers in <hi>Buckingham Court</hi> near <hi>Charing-Croſs</hi> for his Security; and Mr <hi>Harriſon</hi> was preſent with Mrs <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> at the lending of the reſt of the Money, and executing of the Mortgage, as he was wont to he at the Management of her Affairs; but when the time came that it was to be repaid, the Dr could not get his Money, and Mrs <hi>Vanwicke</hi> having but an Eſtare for Life in the Houſe, and having long delayed the Doctor, he brought an Ejectment for the recovering of the Houſe, upon which the Priſoner came to Dr <hi>Clenche,</hi> and abuſed him with very ſcurrilous Language, and his Paſſion growing higher, he laid his hand upon his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ord, and would have drawn it, and if it had not been for one Mr <hi>Johnſon,</hi> 'twas thought he would have kill'd the Doctor at that time; ſo that the Doctor deſired Mr <hi>Johnſon</hi> to take the buſineſs upon himſelf, and to act in his own Name, he was ſo much afraid of him. And it will be proved further to you, that at another time the Priſoner ſaid, That Dr <hi>Clenche</hi> was a Rogue and a Villain, and deſerved to have his Throat cut. And ſometime after this Mrs <hi>Vanwicke</hi> would have borrowed ſome more Money of the Doctor, but he refuſed to lend it her, whereupon ſhe acquainting the Priſoner with it, he ſaid, leave him to me (Madam) I'll warrant you, I'll manage him, he is a Rogue, and deſerves to have his Throat cut. And afterwards about St <hi>Thomas</hi>'s day laſt, the Priſoner went to Mrs <hi>Weſt</hi> the Tennant, who dwelt in the Houſe mortgaged to Dr <hi>Clenche,</hi> and deſired of Mrs <hi>Weſt</hi> to have ſome Money for Mrs <hi>Vanwicke,</hi> and ſaid it ſhould be diſcounted in part of the then next <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Rent. But the ſaid Mrs <hi>Weſt</hi> refuſed to pay him any, telling him that ſhe and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band were forbid by Dr <hi>Clenche</hi> and the Ground Land-Lord, to pay any more to Mrs <hi>Vanwicke,</hi> and thereupon the Priſoner expreſſed his further Malice againſt the Doctor, and ſaid he is a great Rogue, and a Villain, and deſerves to have his Throat cut, and will not dye in his Bed. And, Gentlemen, ſoon after the Priſoner began to put his malicious Deſign againſt the Doctor in Execution, and the Method he took was firſt to change his Lodgings, for on the day before <hi>Chriſtmas Eve</hi> laſt, he took new Lodgings at one Mr <hi>Garways</hi> in <hi>Thread-Needle-ſtreet,</hi> near the <hi>Old Exchange,</hi> attended by a Foot-boy, pretending himſelf to be a Parliament Man, and that he was juſt then come out of the Country, and lay in his Lodging there every Night, until the firſt day of <hi>January</hi> following, but lay out that Night, and the two next Nights following. And whilſt he lodged at this Mr <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> this matter hapned, which does conduce ſomewhat towards the diſcovery of this Murther. One Evening the Priſoner being in his Chamber there, and one Mrs <hi>Jackſon,</hi> the Daughter of Mrs <hi>Garway,</hi> making a Fire for him, he did take out his Handkerchief, and held it before the Fire to dry it, which ſhe took great notice of, becauſe it was courſe and dirty, and not ſit for his Quality (as ſhe thought) it being made of ordinary <hi>Indian</hi> ſtuff, like her Mothers Maids
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95781:4"/>
Apron. And, Gentlemen, this very Handkerchief was the ſame with which the Murther was committed, and this Mrs <hi>Jackſon</hi> will ſwear it to be the ſame, for it is a very remarkable one, and it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to you. And we ſhall ſhew you further, that on the Third Day of <hi>January</hi> (being the Day before this Murther was committed) he cauſed a ſham Letter to be left for him at his Lodgings at this Mr <hi>Garway</hi>'s, as written from a Friend of his that was Sick in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, earneſly preſſing him to come quickly down to him: And we ſhall prove that the very ſame Evening he being with Mrs <hi>Vanwick</hi> in <hi>Woodſtreet-</hi>Counter, did again threaten Dr <hi>Clenche,</hi> and ſaid that he was a Rogue, and he would have his Blood. And upon the Fourth Day of <hi>January</hi> laſt he again changed his Lodgings, and took new ones at one Mr <hi>Jones</hi>'s a Cane-Chair-maker in St <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard, and there he pretended himſelf to be a Country Gentleman, juſt then come out of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and brought in a Portmanteau Trunk thither. And the ſame Day he ſent a Letter to Mrs <hi>Garway</hi> where he had lodged before, acquainting her that he was gone out of Town for a Week or ten Days. And, to give you farther Satisfaction, we ſhall prove that upon the ſame Fourth Day of <hi>January</hi> in the Night of which this unfortunate Gentleman was Murther'd, the Priſoner was at one Mr <hi>Robert Humſton</hi>'s Lodgings at the <hi>Golden-Key</hi> in <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi> over againſt <hi>Fetter-lane</hi> End, at near Nine of the Clock at Night, and being ask'd by Mr <hi>Humſton</hi> to ſtay and Sup with him, he ſaid he could not, for he had been about earneſt Buſineſs that Day, which was to be done that Night, and that a Gentleman ſtayed for him in the Street to go with him about it, and ſo he went away. And ſoon after, about Nine of the Clock the ſame Night, two Men ſtanding in <hi>Fleetſtreet</hi> at <hi>Fetterlane</hi> End, call'd for a Coach, and ask'd the Coachman if he knew Dr <hi>Clenche</hi> who dwelt in <hi>Brownlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Holborn;</hi> and the Coachman reply'd, he did know the Street, but not the Doctor, whereupon they went into the Coach, and ordered him to live to the End of <hi>Brownlowſtreet,</hi> and when they came thither, one of them called to the Coachman and bad him go to Dr <hi>Clenche</hi>'s and tell him, that two Gentlemen in a Coach at the End of the Street deſired him to go with them to a Patient that was very Sick, which the Coachman did. And he found the Doctor in his Night-Gown and Slippers, and juſt a going to Bed; but he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately dreſſed himſelf, and went to them into the Coach. And it fell out very happily for the further Diſcovery of this Murther, that while this Coach ſtood at the End of <hi>Brownlowſtreet,</hi> a Young Gentlewoman ſtanding at her own Door near it, and fancying that while the Coachman went on the Errand, the Gentlemen would ſhip out of the Coach (I think they call it Bilking) ſhe watch'd them And a Lamp that lighted croſs <hi>Holborn</hi> over againſt <hi>Brownlowſtreet</hi> End, and another about the middle of <hi>Brownlowſtreet,</hi> gave ſuch a light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Coach, that ſhe plainly ſaw one of the Men that ſate in it, and ſee him look out of the Coach after the Coachman, and heard him ſwear at the Coachman, becauſe he made no more haſte in going to the Doctor's Houſe, and ſhe is very certain that the Priſoner at the Bar is the ſame Perſon that look'd out of the Coach, and that did

For ſhe hearing of this Murther and remembring theſe Circumſtances, ſhe went to <hi>Newgate</hi> to ſee the Priſoner, and hearing his Voice in another Room, before ſhe ſaw him; ſhe declar'd to the Perſons that were then with her, that the Voice ſhe then heard was the Perſons Voice that ſhe ſaw look out of the Coach, and that did ſwear at the Coachman; and afterwards when ſhe came into the Room where the Priſoner was, though with ſeveral other Men, ſhe point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him as the Perſon, and ſhe hearing him then ſpeak again, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the Perſons with her, that both by his Voice and by his Countenance ſhe knew him to be the ſame Man. And, my Lord, after thoſe Gentlemen had gotten the Doctor into the Coach, one of them called to the Coachman, and bad him make haſte and drive them to <hi>Leaden-Hall</hi> Market, and when they were come within <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn-Bars</hi> one of them called to the Coachman and bad him drive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; whereupon the Coachman drove them very faſt through <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn</hi> to <hi>Leaden-Hall-Market-Gate,</hi> and when he came there, one of them bad him drive to the <hi>Pye</hi> without <hi>Aldgate</hi> (before which time, without doubt, the Murther was committed upon the Doctor, for his Hat was found next morning in <hi>Holborn</hi> near <hi>Fetter-lane</hi> End, but the driving ſo long about after is ſuppoſed to be done leaſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor might recover) and when they were come without <hi>Aldgate,</hi> one of them ordered the Coachman to ask there for one <hi>Hunt</hi> a <hi>Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon;</hi> which he did, and being anſwered that no ſuch Perſon was there, he ordered the Coachman to drive back again to <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> and when they came there, one of them called the Coachman and gave him Three Shillings and Six Pence, and bad him go into the Market there to one <hi>Hunt</hi>'s a Poulterer, and buy them a couple of Fowls, but the Coachman could not find any <hi>Hunt</hi> a <hi>Poulterer,</hi> but however he bought a couple of Fowls for Three Shillings, and when he came with them to his Coach, the two Gentlemen were gone and the Doctor left in the Coach murther'd with a Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief tied faſt about his Neck with a Coal in it (which will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the Priſoners Handkerchief.) Beſides there was a Boy in the Street there who took notice of the Coachman's being ſent of an Errand, and ſaw the two Perſons come out of the Coach in great haſte, and ſhe going towards the Coach before they went out of it, one of them did ſwear at him to be gone, and of him the Boy took moſt notice, and was as poſſitive as any man can be to the Perſon of one that he never ſaw before, that the Priſoner now at the Bar was one of them, and was the Perſon that did then ſwear at him. But this Witneſs is ſpirited away and cannot be heard of, although he hath been deſcribed in the <hi>Gazettee,</hi> and diligent ſearch and inquiry has been made after him. But we have his Examination upon Oath before the Coroner; and we muſt ſubmit to the Court how far that ſhall be admitted as Evidence.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, We will call our Witneſſes, and if they prove all this matter, I believe every Man here will be ſatisfied that the Priſoner at the Bar is Guilty of this baſe murther.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr Johnſon,</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, I believe I ſhall ſay nothing that <hi>Mr Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon</hi> will contradict, I was Attorny for Dr <hi>Clenche</hi> between him and <hi>Mrs Vanwicke,</hi> and I ſued <hi>Mr Rowe</hi> that was bound with <hi>Mrs Vanwicke</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95781:6"/>
in a Bond to perform Covenants for re-payment of the Money lent her by Dr <hi>Clenche</hi> upon <hi>Mortgage;</hi> and I adviſed the Dr. and told him, don't let us trouble the Tenant, but let us take <hi>Rowe</hi> firſt; and I ſued <hi>Rowe,</hi> and had him arreſted, and after ſome time, I ſaw that the <hi>Mortgage</hi> muſt do our buſineſs, for <hi>Rowe</hi> could not pay the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> whereupon I cauſed a Declaration in Ejectment to be delivered againſt <hi>Mrs Vanwick's</hi> Tenant of the Houſe <hi>Mortgaged</hi> by her to Dr <hi>Clenche,</hi> and then <hi>Mr Harriſon</hi> came to me, and he expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the Dr after a ſtrange rate, and laid his Hand upon his Sword, ſo my Lord I ſaid to him, what a Fool do you make of your ſelf? muſt none go to Law, but they muſt ask you leave, I ſuppoſe <hi>Mr Harriſon</hi> cannot deny this. Then <hi>Mr Harriſon</hi> preferred a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lords Commiſſioners of the Great Seal for <hi>Mrs Vanwicke,</hi> and thereby ſuggeſted to their Lordſhips that ſhe was wronged in the Purchaſe and in the <hi>Mortgage Money,</hi> and that twenty Pounds of it was a former debt of her Husbands; and he finding ſhe could have no Relief before them without payment of the <hi>Mortgage Money,</hi> he grew troubleſome; yet ſays I, <hi>Mr Harriſon,</hi> What ſhe hath done, I cannot help, but if ſhe would pay the reſt, I told him I would abate her twenty Pounds, and the Intereſt <hi>Money</hi> alſo.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr Darnell,</speaker>
                     <p>Pray Sir, did the Dr deſire you to act for him in your own Name, becauſe he had no mind to meet with <hi>Mrs Vanwicke</hi> and the Priſoner?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr Johnſon,</speaker>
                     <p>The Doctor did find himſelf too deeply concerned with them, and he did not care to have to do with them, whether it was that he was afraid of his Life, I cannot ſay; but he ſaid to me, Pray Sir, go on, I will put all into your hands, and I will truſt you with all the Affair, and let them come to you, and not trouble me, own it to be your own; and I told him, I feared none of them, and the Doctor gave out that he had made over all to me, although he had not, and upon this I fear, comes this unfortunate Buſineſs, and the Doctor's Lady muſt look after it her ſelf.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr Johnſon,</speaker>
                     <p>He ſaid the Dr. had cheated the Widdow, and he ſaid that he would be revenged on him, as near as my <hi>Memory</hi> will ſerve me, I ſuppoſe he will not deny it; whether he did this in a Paſſion, or to affright the Doctor or no, I cannot tell.</p>

And when I had ſtopped there, one of them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to me, and told me, that I need not ſtir out of my Coach-Box; but call to the Boy at the Tavern, and ask for one <hi>Hunt</hi> a Chyrurgeon, which I did do: And when the Boy came to me again, he ſaid, there was no ſuch Man. Then one of them bad me Drive back again to <hi>Leaden-hall;</hi> and in the time I ſtayed there, and turned my Coach, <hi>Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> was ſhut; and when I came to the Gate, one of them gave Six Pence to the Watch, and the Gate was opened, and I drove to <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> Gate. And when I came there, I ſtopped again, and one of them gave me Half a Crown, and bad me go and buy a Fowl of one <hi>Hunt</hi> a Poulterer; but after I had gone a little way from the Coach, he called me again, and ſaid, Here Coachman, you had as good take an other Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and buy a Couple: So I went, and bought a couple of Fowls, but I could find no ſuch Poulterer as <hi>Hunt,</hi> ſo I bought them of another, and I gave three Shillings for them. And when I came back to the Coach ſide, I found Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> (as I thought) ſitting againſt the Fore-ſeat, with his Head againſt the Cuſhion: I pull'd him, and cried, Maſter, Maſter, for I thought he had been in Drink, but I could not get one word from him; and then I went to the Watch, who were near; and when they came, we found him Strangled with a Handcherchief about his Neck, and a Coal in it placed, juſt upon his Wind-Pipe, but the other two Men were gone.</p>

                     <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                     <p>Gentlemen of the Jury; The Priſoner at the Bar, <hi>Henry Harriſon,</hi> ſtands indicted for the wilful Murder of Dr. <hi>Andrew Clenche,</hi> who was barbarouſly murdered on the fourth day of <hi>January</hi> laſt: You have heard the Witneſſes that have been ſworn; and upon their Teſtimony, it doth appear that two Perſons came to <hi>Brownlow-ſtreet-</hi>End in a Coach after nine a Clock at night, and ſent the Coach-man to the Doctor's Houſe, under pretence to get him to a Patient, a Friend of theirs, that was ſick. By this Contrivance, they got him into their Coach, which they had brought for that purpoſe, and then they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Coach-man to drive to <hi>Leadenhall-ſtreet;</hi> and when they came about <hi>Holborn-Bars,</hi> one of them ask'd the Coach-man why he drove ſo ſlow, and bad him drive faſter. When they came to <hi>Leadenhall-ſtreet,</hi> then they bad him drive to the <hi>Pye-Tavern</hi> without <hi>Aldgate;</hi> where one of them bad the Coach-man ask for one <hi>Hunt;</hi> but he not being there, one of them bad the Coach-man return back, and gave ſix Pence to the Watch to come through the Gate, which was ſhut in the mean time; and when they came to <hi>Leadenhall-Market,</hi> one of them gave the Coach-man three Shillings and ſix Pence, and ſent him to buy a couple of Fowls; which the Coach-man did buy, and brought them to the Coach; but when he came back, he found the Doctor in the body of the Coach leaning againſt the fore Seat of the Coach, a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief being tied about his Neck with a Coal in it, placed upon his Wind-pipe; which Hankerchief and Coal have been produced in Court.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtion is, Gentlemen, Whether the Priſoner at the Bar be Guilty of this baſe and barbarous Murder? To prove which, there have been a very long Evidence given, ſome Poſitive, ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial. It has been proved that Dr. <hi>Clenche</hi> had ſome Dealings with a Woman named <hi>Vanwicke,</hi> and had lent her one hundred and twenty Pounds, and had taken a Mortage for it. This Priſoner, Mr. <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> was a great Acquaintance, and very intimate with this Woman; and did concern himſelf in the management of her Affairs: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Dr. <hi>Clenche</hi> did refuſe to lend the Woman more Money, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had an Animoſity againſt Dr. <hi>Clenche.</hi> The Money not being paid to the Doctor as he did expect, he did call it in; and therefore this Gentlewoman did oftentimes repair to Dr. <hi>Clenche</hi> to deſire far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time, or Forbearance, becauſe ſhe could not raiſe or procure the Money elſewhere. That about <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> laſt it ſeems ſhe came to a Coffee-houſe near <hi>Warwick-</hi>houſe in <hi>Holborn,</hi> and there was Mr. <hi>Harriſon;</hi> where they conſulted what to do. And it was agreed, that the Miſtreſs of the Houſe and Mrs. <hi>Vanwicke</hi> ſhould go to Dr. <hi>Clench</hi>'s; but Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> ſhould ſtay behind, for it was not thought convenient that he ſhould go, leſt he ſhould provoke the Doctor. When they came to the Doctor, Mrs. <hi>Vanwicke</hi> was very importunate to have ſome more Money; but the Doctor would lend her no more. And when they returned to the Coffee-houſe again, Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what paſſed between the Doctor and Mrs. <hi>Vanwicke.</hi> She told him, that the Doctor would not furniſh her with any more Money, although ſhe had preſſed him to do it, and urged her great Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but adviſed her to go to Service. Damn him, ſays <hi>Harriſon,</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95781:16"/>
does he ſay that a Woman of your Quality ſhould go to Service? He is a great Rogue, and deſerves to have his Throat cut; but let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, I will manage him.</p>
                     <p>At another place there was a Diſcourſe betwixt Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Johnſon;</hi> and that the Priſoner did then ſpeak very hard and ill Words of Dr. <hi>Clenche:</hi> And that Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> came frequently to him; and one time laid his hand upon his Sword, uſing ſome mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Words, but what they were he cannot tell: But he likewiſe ſays, that at ſeveral times he did expoſtulate with him, and told him, That he would not do any good with ſuch Diſcourſes as theſe are, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Mortgage-Money not being paid, it was thought fit, That there ſhould be a Proſecution made to get poſſeſſion of the mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Eſtate, and that the Tenants ſhould be forbid to pay their Rents. And Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> went to Mrs. <hi>Weſt</hi> the Tenant, ſome few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Thomas</hi> day laſt, and demanded the Rent of her. To which ſhe made anſwer, That Dr. <hi>Clenche</hi> had forbid the paiment of the Rent to Mrs. <hi>Vanwicke.</hi> Thereupon Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> grew very angry, and anſwered, That Dr. <hi>Clench</hi> was a Rogue and a Villain, and bid her that ſhe ſhould not pay him any Rent. And the Witneſs ſaith further, That the Doctor being preſt to let her have ſome more Money, refuſed to do it, becauſe ſhe would ſpend it all upon <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the Counſel for the King called ſome Witneſſes, who gave you account of the Priſoner's ſhifting his Lodgings the day before the Murder was done. He takes a Lodging at Mr. <hi>Garway</hi>'s in <hi>Thread-needle-</hi>ſtreet, on the twenty third day of <hi>December,</hi> and there he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till about the firſt of <hi>January.</hi> The ſecond of <hi>January</hi> he was at <hi>Garway</hi>'s Shop; and on the Sunday night he came and fetcht away his Things. The Monday after, being the day that this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fact was committed, he ſent a Letter to Mrs. <hi>Garway,</hi> to acquaint her that he was gone out of Town; but he left three half Crowns with her Maid to pay for his Lodging. But as to his going out of Town, it was falſe, for he never went into the Country, but took a Lodging at Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>'s in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard. It's obſervable alſo, that he went for a Parliament-Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he lodged at Mr. <hi>Garway</hi>'s, and had his Footman to attend upon him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There it was that he was ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

She ſaith it is the ſame, or very like that which ſhe did ſee Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> hold in his hand.</p>

Now, on the Monday on which this Fact was committed, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken a Lodging at <hi>Jones</hi> his Houſe, he came thither with a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who brought his Portmantua-Trunk about eight a Clock at night; and after he had been there a little while, he went away.</p>
                     <p>And you are told, by a Gentleman that lodges at the Golden-Key againſt <hi>Fetter-lane</hi> end; That he had ſome Acquaintance with the Priſoner, that he had lent him a Morning-Gown; and that about nine a Clock that very night, he came to his Lodging in a Cloak; and then the Gentleman asked him for his Gown; and he told him, that he had brought it with him. Thereupon the Gentleman invites Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> to ſtay and ſup with him. Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> ſaid, he could not ſtay, for he was engaged; he muſt be gone, for that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtaid in the Street for him to go about extraordinary Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>The Coachman tells you, That near about that time two Men in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> near <hi>Fetter-lane</hi> end, hired his Coach of him to go to <hi>Brownlow-ſtreet</hi> to Dr. <hi>Clench</hi>'s; but he can't poſitively ſay, that the Priſoner at the Bar was one of them, but he ſwears, he does verily believe that he was one of them.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Harriſon.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>He ſaid before your Lordſhip, That he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what I had on.</p>

                     <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, well, he doth not remember it now; but being hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to go to Dr. <hi>Clench</hi>'s, he drove to the Street end and no further, becauſe the Gate at the lower end was ſhut up, and he could not turn his Coach in the Street; but he was ſent by them to the Doctor's, to deſire the Doctor to come out to them, and they ſat in the Coach in the mean time. The Doctor made haſte, and went to them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and they drove away to <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> and then to <hi>Aldgate;</hi> and they called at the Py-Tavern, and enquired for one Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> a Chirurgeon, as I mentioned to you before: He not being there, they returned to drive through <hi>Aldgate,</hi> gave the Watch ſix-pence, and paſſed through the Gate without any manner of notice taken: but if the Watch had done their Duty, it might have been better diſcovered. But further, the Coachman tells you, that when he came to <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> Street, they called to him, and directed him to buy one Fowl; and after that he had been gone a little way from the Coach, they called him back, and bad him take ſome more Money and buy two Fowls. So he went and bought the Fowls; but when he came back, the two Gentlemen were gone, and he found the Doctor ſtill in the Coach; and he not ſtirring, he thought he had been in Drink: but upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination, and calling the Watchman with his Candle, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that the Doctor was ſtrangled with a Handkerchief and a Coal.</p>
                     <p>There is one Mrs. <hi>Elianor Aſhbolt,</hi> who lives in <hi>Brownlow-ſtreet</hi> with her Mother, and had been ſent of an Errand; and between nine and ten of the Clock at Night, ſhe ſaw the Coachman in <hi>Brownlow-ſtreet,</hi> and thought that thoſe Men in the Coach might put a Trick upon him, by going away without paying him his Fare. And ſhe ſays further, That by the help of the Lamps ſhe did diſcern the Face of this <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in the Coach; he had a Cloak on, with a light Perriwig, and looked out of the Coach, and did ſwear at the Coachman; and by this means ſhe knew him when ſhe ſaw him again, to be the ſame Man, both by his Face and Voice. This Woman indeed was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95781:17"/>
the Coroner, and ſhe gives you this reaſon for it, becauſe her Mother was not willing ſhe ſhould be concerned in ſuch a matter as this was; and what ſhe could ſay, was not known to <hi>Mrs. Clenche</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til after the ſecond Seſſions: And when he was in <hi>Newgate,</hi> ſhe ſaw him there, and declared he was the ſame Man.</p>
                     <p>There was another piece of Evidence, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the Boy's, who does not appear, he was examined before the Coroner. There has been Evidence given of ill practice to take him out of the way, and therefore his Affidavit is read for Evidence: He ſwears he ſaw two Gentlemen come out of the Coach when it ſtood in <hi>Leaden hall</hi> ſtreet, and that having ſeen the Priſoner in <hi>Newgate</hi> ſince, doth believe him to be one. This, Gentlemen, is the Sum and Subſtance of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the King, to prove that the Priſoner was one of thoſe that committed the Murder.</p>
                     <p>You have heard likewiſe what the Priſoner ſays for himſelf; he does undertake to prove that he was in another Place, (that is) that he ſhould come into <hi>Maccafee</hi>'s Houſe in Crown-Court over againſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants-Inn in <hi>Chancery-lane:</hi> and <hi>Maccafee,</hi> he tells you, that there were ſome other Company there, and that <hi>Harriſon</hi> came in very cold, and that they went to Cards, and plaid for one Penny a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at Whisk; and that he did continue there from nine till eleven a Clock; and if he was there then, it is impoſſible he ſhould be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Fact, for the Fact was done between the ſame Hours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maccafee</hi>'s Wife tells you the ſame, and they both tell you who were there beſides, and who plaid together, and are poſitive that the Priſoner was there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Baker</hi> ſays, That he went away about half an hour after ten at Night, and left <hi>Harriſon</hi> behind him. To confirm this Evidence, they have called two other Witneſſes beſides the Drawers at the King's-Head Tavern, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> the Surgeon, who lives in <hi>Stone-cutters</hi> Street, and Mr. <hi>Ruſſel:</hi> Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> ſays, they had been at the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoe Tavern in <hi>Chancery-lane,</hi> and called for half a Pint of Sack at the King's-head Tavern when they came by: and as they ſat in the Coach, Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> came by accidentally, and one of them looking out of the Coach, cries <hi>Harry,</hi> or <hi>Harriſon;</hi> and he went to them, and they drank together another half Pint of Sack.</p>
                     <p>As to their meeting with <hi>Harriſon,</hi> and as to other Paſſages there, <hi>Ruſſell</hi> ſays the ſame; but as to the time of Night he is not poſitive. And they ſent one of the Drawers to a Houſe in Crown-Court to enquire for ſome Body there.</p>
                     <p>The Drawers of the King's-Head Tavern, ſay, That Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ruſſell</hi> did call there about that time; and that they drank two half Pints of Wine: and that when they were drinking, a Man came by with a Hanging-Coat or Cloak on, and drank with them. And one of the Drawers went to call ſome Body in Crown-Court; and one of the Company up with his Muff and gave him a ſlap in the Face.</p>
                     <p>Now this is the Sum and Subſtance of the Evidence that you have heard on the behalf of the Priſoner, to induce you to believe that he was not the Perſon that was concerned in the Murder of Doctor <hi>Clenche.</hi>
                     </p>

To which Evidence an Anſwer hath been offered;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, As to thoſe Witneſſes, <hi>Maccafee</hi> and his Wife, divers Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have been produced to prove, that they are People of doubtful Credit; it ſeems they keep an Houſe of ill Fame.</p>

                     <p>Well, well, Gentlemen, the People of the Houſe are not of very good Reputation, they keep a naughty and a diſorderly Houſe, (if you believe the Witneſſes) you may conſider of their Credit.</p>
                     <p>And as to Mr. <hi>Baker;</hi> About nine Years ſince he was convicted of an arrant Cheat, which is no leſs than Forgery, for altering the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger's Rate for St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Pariſh, and therefore the leſs Credit is to be given to his Evidence; for now it appears that he is a Knave upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: and the very Record it ſelf was produced againſt him, which is true without doubt, notwithſtanding his pretence of Innocency. What is ſaid by Mr. <hi>Ruſſell</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sutton,</hi> I muſt leave to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; they had been a drinking, and the Drawer ſays they were at the King's-Head Tavern at 11 of the Clock at Night. Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> the next day after the Murder, met a Gentleman at <hi>Joes</hi> Coffee-Houſe in <hi>Salisbury-Court;</hi> and though he had taken a Lodging in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-Yard, yet he ſaid that he was newly come to Town, and had been in <hi>Kent,</hi> and had remained there about three Weeks; and that he wanted a Laundreſs and a Lodging, although he had not been out of Town, and had taken a Lodging but the day before: And then he told the Witneſs who diſcourſed with him about the Death of Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> That he had formerly loved him, but he ſaid he had been of late a barbarous Rogue to a poor Gentlewoman a Friend of his; and that the juſt Judgment of God had fallen upon him for ſo doing, and that he would write to her to give her an account of it; and adviſe her to write to Mrs. <hi>Clenche,</hi> and to tell her that ſhe was a Widow now as well as Mrs. <hi>Vanwick;</hi> and he thought by that Means to move Mrs. <hi>Clenche</hi> to pity her, being a Widow as well as her ſelf: And that whilſt they were talking thus, one Mr. <hi>Ravenſcroft</hi> tells him, that Dr. <hi>Clenche</hi> was murdered, and that a Bully of the Town, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to a Gentlewoman in the Compter, one Mrs. <hi>Vanwick,</hi> was ſuſpected. At which Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> was much ſtartled, and ſaid, That no one was concerned with that Gentlewoman but himſelf; and for ought he knew, he might be taken up for it. This is that which he ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Now what ſaid Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> farther for himſelf? Why, ſays he, this Gentlewoman is not in Priſon at the Proſecution of Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> and was not ſo affirmed, but ſo reported; and whether it were ſo or no is no great matter. Gentlemen, you ought to conſider of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that you have heard againſt him, and alſo to weigh well the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence he hath brought for himſelf.</p>
                     <p>It is moſt plain, if you believe the Witneſſes, that Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> was concerned for this Woman <hi>Vanwick,</hi> and hath threatned Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> called him Rogue and Raſcal, and ſaid, that he deſerved to have his Throat cut; that <hi>Harriſon</hi> went under a Diſguiſe for ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Murder. You have had an Account of the Handkerchief, what kind of Handkerchief <hi>Harriſon</hi> had, and what Handkerchief was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95781:18"/>
taken about Dr. <hi>Clench</hi>'s Neck, you have ſeen: And you heard what Evidence was given by Mr. <hi>Humſtond;</hi> how the Priſoner was with him about nine a Clock that Night; and how he refuſed to ſtay and ſup with Mr. <hi>Humſtond.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> had no earneſt buſineſs, one would have thought he might have ſtaid with Mr. <hi>Humſtond</hi> better than to have gone to an Ale-Houſe in <hi>Crown-Court,</hi> and plaid at Cards at one Penny a piece a Corner; he might have had better Fare no doubt.</p>
                     <p>The Witneſſes for the Priſoner ſay for him, That he came to <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cafee</hi>'s Houſe about 9 a Clock at night, and ſtaid till eleven: That is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that Evidence given for the King, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was in the Coach at <hi>Brownlow-ſtreet</hi> End; for if he was at <hi>Maccafee</hi>'s Houſe all the time they mention, it is impoſſible he ſhould be guilty. All thoſe things are under your ſerious Conſideration. You had beſt go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and if you are not ſatisfied upon the Evidence you have heard, that he is guilty, then you ought to acquit him; but if you are ſatisfied that he did commit this Murder, then you ought to find him guilty.</p>
                     <p>Then the Jury withdrew, and the Court adjourned for half an hour; and when they were returned, the Jury came to give their Verdict; and being called over, anſwered to their Names; and Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> was brought to the Bar.</p>

                     <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, <hi>Cole</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar ſtands Indicted for Murthering Dr. <hi>Clenche,</hi> who, as it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, was Murther'd in a Coach by two Perſons that were therein together with the Doctor. The queſtion now before you is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cole</hi> was one of theſe two?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gamble,</hi> the Coachman, ſwears, That the Night Doctor <hi>Clenche</hi> was killed, he took up Three Men in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> ſet one of them down at <hi>Gray</hi>'s-Inn, and drove on to Doctor <hi>Clenche</hi>'s Houſe, the Doctor was not at home, then the third Man came in again to the Coach, and he drove to the <hi>Blew-Boar</hi>'s-Head an Alehouſe by <hi>Clement</hi>'s-Inn, and ſet thoſe Three Men down there, and 'twas then about Eight of the Clock.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sykes</hi> the Coachman, ſwears, he took up Two Men at <hi>Fetter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> End in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> and by their directions drove to <hi>Brownlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> where the Doctor lived, whom they got into the Coach, and he drove as far as <hi>Aldgate,</hi> and through the Gate, and then came back to <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> was ſent by the Two Men in the Coach to buy a Fowl, when he returned they were gone, but the Doctor found Dead in the Coach; and 'twas now half an hour paſt Ten.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtion now, as I ſaid before, is whether <hi>Cole</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, was one of theſe two men.</p>
                     <p>The Woman tells you, <hi>Milward</hi> her Husband told her, that he and <hi>Cole</hi> were in the Coach with Doctor <hi>Clenche,</hi> and that they Two Kill'd Doctor <hi>Clenche.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She likewiſe tells you, her Husband told her, that <hi>Cole</hi> and her Husband went out from the <hi>Blew-Boars-</hi>Head near <hi>Clement</hi>'s Inn, and left only <hi>Harper</hi> behind.</p>
                     <p>The Court hath already declar'd to you, that her Evidence, being only what her Husband told her, is no Evidence in Law to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a Man's Life, eſpecially when it is ſingle without any Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to confirm it, as here 'tis. But that is not all, there is a very great Evidence, that what ſhe ſays her Husband told her, is falſe.</p>
                     <p>He told her, ſhe ſays, that he and <hi>Cole</hi> went from the <hi>Blew-Boars-</hi>Head and Kill'd the Doctor, leaving only <hi>Harper</hi> behind.</p>
                     <p>The Maſter of the Houſe and his Servant (Witneſſes which ſhe produceth) both ſwear, That her Husband went out alone, and leſt Two Men behind, who both ſtaid in the Houſe till <hi>Milward</hi> return'd, which was about Eleven of the Clock. The Maſter, 'tis true, cannot ſay that <hi>Cole</hi> is one of the two, but the Servant is very poſitive he is, and both are Poſitive, that the two Men, that <hi>Milward</hi> left-behind, continued in the Houſe till <hi>Milward</hi> returned
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95781:25"/>
at Eleven of the Clock. Theſe Two Mens Depoſitions do plainly contradict her Story, and if they ſwear true, <hi>Cole</hi> the Priſoner was not one of the Perſons that Kill'd the Doctor.</p>
                     <p>You have all heard, I am ſure, that one <hi>Harriſon</hi> hath been Convicted by a Jury in this Place for the Murther of Doctor <hi>Clenche:</hi> If he was one of the two, then <hi>Milward</hi> by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (if his Wife ſwear true) was the other; but this you cannot take notice of, the Record is not produced, neither hath the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner taken notice of it, the Queſtion is only whether <hi>Cole</hi> be Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Murther? which I leave to you upon the Evidence you have heard.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>The Jury having conſider'd their Verdict, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, That the Priſoner was not Guilty.</p>
