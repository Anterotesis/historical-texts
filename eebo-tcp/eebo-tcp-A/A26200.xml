            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

judged by the Laws of the Land, as a Pharise, to weare a <hi>Phylactery</hi> in publick, and hast had thine Ears bored through according to the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law: And I fear thy pretended Conversion to Christianity, is but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to something else, even as the <hi>Mahometans</hi> (they say will not admit a Iew to turn Turk, unless he first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Christian. And that is the reason why thou art so cruel (like a Renegado) to those of thine own Sect, yea even unto those in whose quarrel thou hast lost Leather, for as one of thy Ears was cut off for <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> even so was the other for <hi>Independancy.</hi> But now I speak of thine <hi>Eares,</hi> give me leave to ask thee one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion I have heard that those who have lost their Legs, do somtimes nevertheless feel pains in their Toes; and I would fain know whether toward change of weather thou dost not feel a kind of itching and tingling in those defunct <hi>Parings</hi> of thine, especially when <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and Gover-nement are like to peep out again. For what else does thy rayling against the Bishops (as well as us) hold forth? but that thou art the very same <hi>Will.

For thou knowest not how to write in any other strain, and therefore to let thee see how easy it is to attain unto thy gifts, I will now speake unto thee a few words in thine own way. Dost thou not remember <hi>William Prynne,</hi> when the long Parliament according to the antient known fundamentall, established Custome, Practice, Usage, Example, of all Rebels, Traytors, Cades, Tylers, Straws, set open the Prisons, Goales, Dungeons, Cages, and tooke the Prisoners, Felons, Malefactors, Jayl-birds into their Protection, Patronage, Safeguard, Tuition, and among others, thy self <hi>William Prynne</hi> aforesaid, with thy Brethren Companions, Copemates, Associates, <hi>Burton, Bast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, Lilborn, Poe,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62765:4"/>
they will hardly hold till the Ink is dry, and when they are printed, not one of an hundred will endure the stiching, but turn to such homly uses as they are most fit and proper for. Truly <hi>William,</hi> if I were your friend I should advise you to leave this freak of the Deaths head, lest the young Gentleman of the House, surprise you again, as you know) they once did at midnight, and make you drink healths-Sickness in it again on your bare Marrow-bones. But I wonder in what part of the world thy Readers live, if there are any such Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in nature; verily they ought to have their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders grow about their heads, like <hi>John Mandevile</hi>'s Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Afrique,</hi> for there is more of labour and drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than understanding required, and they ought to have a large measure of <hi>Patience, Long-suffering</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> that can endure to read one Page of thine: For as in the <hi>North,</hi> the more durty and foul the High-waves are, the larger measure they allow to their Miles; even so dost thou to thy tedious dull Impertinencyes, in so much that some are of opinion that thy Readers ought to be Diet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (like Running-Nags, before they can be in breath to read thy long-winded Periods, which none but, such as thy self will submit to, for if few words do best with the Wise none of those will ever endure to have any thing to do with thee. And yet I have heard that thou dost not a little glory that thy works have past through all sorts of times, (but only those wherein they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by the hand of this old <hi>Antagonist</hi> the Hangman) without dispute or question.

as full and dul as thine own; But since so many <hi>Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> and <hi>Habberdashers</hi> of smal wares, have undertaken to confute thee, and proceeded so far therein already, it were an act of great imprudence to take the taske out of their hands who are best able to go through with it.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou Quaking Quack, Jesuitical Romish Franciscan Frog, See my <hi>Quaker unmasked,</hi> pag. 1. 13. Thou that art the Devils dice-box which he SHAKES, Rattles, wags, to gull, cheat, delude, and seduce the intoxicated giddy-headed, <hi>English Nation.</hi> Thou that art sick of thy Church, and hast catch'd thy Religion like a Palsey, Epilepsy, Ague, and art taken with Tertian, Quartan, Quotidian cold fits, at thy Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stious, Idolatrous Jesuitical Meetings, Assemblies, Conventicles. See my <hi>Healths Sickness,</hi> p. 150. The <hi>Northern blast,</hi> pa. 90. <hi>The Pope cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Cudgels,</hi> p. 297. Whereas thou saist I have no Eares, &amp;c. therein thou shewest that thou hast no Light, Reason, understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, For as a house is judged to be a house in Law as long as any part thereof is standing, and a light piece of Gold is good and lawful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Coyn, currant with allowance, although it be clip'd, filed, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed or worn; even so are my <hi>Eares,</hi> legal, warrantable, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Eares,</hi> and good in Law, however they have been clip'd; pared, crop'd circumcised, and I have a better Title to the Remainders then thou hast to thine, for they have been twice adjudged to me by the Laws of the Land, which thine never were. For those parcels, scraps, shreds, that I was deprived of, did but confirm my Right to those that are (see my own Abridgement at large, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. <hi>Lisle upon Gerrard, pa.</hi> 26. <hi>The Legality of Treason,</hi> in two parts, <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p>This shews that the light within thee, of which thou dost vapour, brag, vaunt, and extol thy self so much, is but a kind of dusky Owl-light,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62765:6"/>
a trembling, twinckling, stincking stuff, which thou carriest in thy Paunch, Guts, Bowel, as an Ox, Bull or Cow doth Tallow to make Candles of, or the Cattle of <hi>Lincoln shire</hi> do the Fewel of the Countrey, and thou knowest who it was that looked over <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and cryed, <hi>All's mine,</hi> as he will in time do over ye <hi>Quakers,</hi> Frogs, Vipers, See my <hi>Hidden works of darkness,</hi> p. 400. <hi>A Looking glass for a blind guide,</hi> p. 79. <hi>Fryers a Fry of Frogs, p.</hi> 220 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Whereas thou sayst, urgest, and objectest, that I would have made an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> therein thou art mistaken, deceived and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, for I would rather have marred, spoyled and perverted one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sense, judgement and opinion of the House (and <hi>ejus est interpretari eujus est condere,</hi> see <hi>Bra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

See <hi>The foot out of the snare, pag.</hi> 53. <hi>Prynnes Principles,</hi> p. 200. which is more then you can say, produce, or alledge for your selves, who are a generation, Spawn, Lit er of Vipers, Frogs, Serpents, so obstinate, peremptory, incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gib e, that you break the Act of Parliament, at the same time that it is put in Execution against you, like unto a Cut purse that picks a Pocket when he is going to be hang'd, for you croud, thrust and intrude your selves into Prisons by shoales, that you may in defyance of Law, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Authority, meet more then five together, although it be in the Goale. See my <hi>Sword of Christian Magistracy suppressed,</hi> p. 550. <hi>The Sectary dissected,</hi> p. 82.</p>
            <p>Whereas thou saist I write in the stile, form, language of a <hi>Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> therein I do according to my Profession, Calling, Vocation, and if thou hadst done so too, thou hadst been but a Mechanick still, and hadst not ordain'd thy self a Hedge-Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of an Orderless Order and unruly rule, the Original, Rise, or beginning, whereof is as uncertain as the Head or Heads of <hi>Nile,</hi> or the hatching of Woodcocks, for no body can cell from whence it came, (See, <hi>Truth Triumphing,</hi> pag. 79. <hi>The Jesuite a lebusite,</hi> p. 904.) a Church, or rather Chappel indeed, that is built upon a <hi>Quaking Dog</hi> (mark that) or flat quick sand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out supertor or inferior in it, like the Knights of King <hi>Arthurs</hi> (See the <hi>Seaven Champions of Christendome)</hi> Round Table, or the Serpent <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisbaena</hi> (of which, see <hi>Pliny</hi> (that has a head at both ends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> the false Prophet of the Turks, was the first Prophet, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, Founder of the <hi>Quakers.</hi> For he had trembling trances, and frantick fits of the <hi>Falling sickness,</hi> in which he had Revelations, dreams, Visions whisper'd into his ear by a Dove Pidgeon or Widge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he had instructed and taught, used to pick seeds out of his ear or ears; which seeds, are the seeds of your Church as well as his, for they produce the very same fruits, effects, workings in both, and both equally hope to be saved by him. And hence it is, that all your wishes, longings, desires are in the Turks overrunning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62765:6"/>
for as both they and you account Fooles, Ideots, Mad men, Saints; you do not doubt but to pass easily for such with them, for your great abilities in those gifts. And therefore as your Brethren the aforesaid Turkish <hi>Mahometan Fanaticks,</hi> devote, destine, damne, themselves to destruction, meerly to tire, weary, make work for, and put a stop to the Christians in their Wars: and fill up Ditches, grafts, trenches with their bodies, carcases, outward men for their fellow Mussel men to march over; even so ye also think to weary out the Officers of Justice, with your numberless numbers, and render your selves as hard to be cast out as Legion the Devil incorporate did, of whom ye are a Type. See <hi>The Stationers Beacon fired,</hi> p. 1000. <hi>The Sectary in Sippets,</hi> pa. 202.</p>
            <p>By all which, it appears that ye have a Turk as well as a Pope in your bellies, and that ye delight in Persecution, in affliction, Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as some old extravagent fantastick fornicators, find a pleasure in being whip'd, and out of these sores ingender one another, by aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal generation, as Flyes blows Maggots, which afterwards become Flys and blow others. See my <hi>Romes Masterpiece,</hi> p. 808. <hi>Settle brain for a Sectary,</hi> p. 9. <hi>A siringe for a sore sinner,</hi> p. 78.</p>
            <p>That you are Jesuitical, Romish Franciscan Frogs, Witches, Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, appears in that ye meet to quake, tremble, quiver, and converse with your Spirits, lmps, Familiars; and that ye came from <hi>Rome</hi> out of the North, from whence evil and destruction cometh, as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, cleared, demonstrated, and evinced in my <hi>Quaker unmask'd,</hi> p. 84. <hi>Lights Darkness,</hi> p. 26. For as the Needle in the Marriners Compass <hi>Trembles</hi> (mark that) and points to the <hi>North,</hi> even so do ye, ye trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Quivering, Shivering <hi>Quakers.</hi> And as Witches are most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in me <hi>North,</hi> and the colder a Climate is, the apter are the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof (see <hi>my first answer to thyself)</hi> to quake, &amp;c. It follows that <hi>Quakers</hi> and Witches are of the growth of the same place, and both of the same Nature, quality, and condition; For as Witches swim upon the water like light scum, even so are <hi>Quakers,</hi> the scum of the earth, that shake themselves like water-dogs when they come out of a Pond (see my <hi>Popish Royal Favorite,</hi> p. 800. <hi>Sweet sips of Soul-Savingness,</hi> p. 53. Lastly, as witches liquor their staves, and fly through the Air; even so do <hi>Quakers</hi> liquor their throats with inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Potions, and gape to suck in the air that it may fly through them, &amp; blow the light within them; (see <hi>Emmot and Gilpin,</hi> pa. 7. <hi>Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury bottle opened,</hi> p. 20.) at their Exorcisms rather then Exercises of Devotion. Whereas thou saist I was branded, burnt or Stigmatiz'd in the Cheeks, tis true, I was so, nor am I at all asham'd of, sorry for, or abashed thereat, but rather set a greater value on my self therefore, as I beleive I have very good reason, cause, consideration to do, for I was only us'd like a sealed measure, burnt, branded for being true. See my <hi>Verses</hi> written on this occasion in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London, in haec verba.</hi>

            <p>As for the Jesuites, who thou faist made use of the scraps of my Ears, to bewitch the Quakers, &amp;c. If they did so, it was no fault of mine, nor am I bound to answer for it; for when the aforesaid pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, scraps, shred, were sever'd from my freehold, they were no longer mine, nor am I to be accountable for the evil administration of them, when they were out of my power, charge, cuition. But if they had been in my own possession, and the Jesuites had stollen them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch the <hi>Quakers</hi> to listen to their enchantments: It is not Just that I should answer for their Ears and my own too. See <hi>Speculum Iesact.</hi> p. 95. <hi>I be frantick Franciscan,</hi> p. 700. <hi>A hole pick'd in the Popes coat,</hi> p. 30. Whereas thou saist the <hi>Brethren; Godly</hi> &amp;c, <hi>rode out with the sist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers helpers &amp;c.</hi> I do confess, thank, acknowledge their loving kindness therein; And if they did evil in sticking <hi>Rosemary</hi> and <hi>Bayes</hi> upon their Vessels, bodyes, outward Folkes, as thou saist against the doctrine and discipline of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church: It is no more then the Members, Tooles, Limbs of the Devil and thy Synagouge did to the Pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

See <hi>The Buckle of the Canonical Girdle, turn'd behind,</hi> p. 63. <hi>The Quaker Quash'd,</hi> p. 4.</p>
            <p>Whereas thou saist my works are bound up in Hatcases, &amp;c. If thou wouldst but buy one of those, and put thy hat therein, it would operate upon, and instill into thy Noddle, sconce Logger head more se se, reason, understanding; and teach thee better manners then to keep iron before a Court of Justice: by which thou dost but shew, declare, demonstrate, that thou hast a Crack, Flaw, soft place in thy Scull; and in that respect art very careful to keep it warm, least thy sickly brains (if thou hast any) should take cold. And as for those Chandlers and Haberdashers of small wares &amp;c. which thou saist have undertaken to oppose, answer, confute me.</p>
            <p>Verily they will find it a harder task then they are aware of, for I have already written, Printed, published, 160 odd Works, Books, Labours; and before they have done with those, do not doubt to have as many more in a readiness, and to find imployment, work, business, enough for them all; as long a Church and State can furnish, store, supply me with subject, matter. Provided I may have process enough to carry on the work; and can but procure, induce, engage our <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> brethren the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> to help, aid, and assist me, which (it being so much for their ow advantage, interest, concernment, and they having at present nothing else to do) I do not doubt to obtain.</p>
