         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Which, √¥ so sacred a sayeng (right worshipfull) hath made me, quite forgetting my impotencie, willingly to put on armour also against ignoraunce, and boldly to march towardes the castle of Arte, there to offer my seruice to scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, the generall.

            <p>Which good will in deede, is all that I am hable to shewe, and that taken away, my burden might easely presse me to the ground: for considering so ripe a world, such plenty of Artes, such profound wittes, such learned eares, and, there withall, such Tigrish whelpes of Momus pampering, if feare should haue surprised my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and there withall (if it had bene possible) vanquished my zeale, to the vtter ruine of these my labours, the wise would not haue meruailed at all.

Then was I wholly ouercome in this purpose, and then did I clearely see, how that to write Methodes or meanes to cure the affected partes of the body, the partes them selues beyng altogether vnknowen, or falsely imagined of, might rather be a meane to indurate the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taract of inscience, then to eate it through, or take it away.

For my part, amongest those very few bodies, which, also in very few yeares, though to my cost, yet for the very zeale I haue had thereto, I haue dissected, I haue found some of Galens Sceletons in sundry pointes.

So that first he excuseth not the head, but that he hath sene it sometime without seames, somtime with sundry seames, and those keepyng diuers orders, to haue bene compact together. The teeth in diuers numbers: and the neither iawe growne to the vpper. Of the necke, the first Vertebre inseparably growne to Occiput: the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Vertebres of the necke sometyme sixe, and sometyme eight with the like varietie at sundry tymes of the other Vertebres.

But aboue all these it is notable that he reporteth of a Sceleton, whose Bones all, from the head to the toes, were ioyned together, so that the partie in his lyfe tyme, beyng old, could moue no part saue his eyes, toung, brest, bellye, and yard. I passe with silence, the aboundaunce, or want of Muscles whereof he remembreth, and the sundry trases of Veynes, with their want, or extraordinarie diuisions. Of the kidneys he sawe the singular number, although that a greate one, and Splenes so large, as that eche one in waight peised twenty pound, beyng out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ouercouered with a Cartilage. So vlcers, and tumours in the hart. So the hedge that distinguisheth the Ventricles of the hart, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilaginous.

What then? he obserued stones in the lunges, liuer, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Porta, vrinarie wayes, in the bleddar, Hemorroidall Veynes, and in the nauell of sundry straunge abscesses, in diuers bodies obserued, the same authour also remembreth. But among all thynges that he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

            <p>As for my selfe, I confesse I haue in sundry places cited, and as it were enrolled Galen in sundry errours, yet not by halfe so oft as my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours haue prouoked me? for <hi>Vesalius</hi> chiefly, and <hi>Collumbus</hi> (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) haue spared him in no place.

            <p>In the meane tyme to come to the matter proposed, I commit to thy diligence in the begynnyng the History of Bones, the frame of the body, wherein (of truth) attentiuenes ought to be vsed, both to carie in mynde, together with thy eye, the direct sense of the present descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed part, or rather (if it may be) to conferre the same with the Scele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton it selfe, as also because it is an introduction to the whole History of Man, and may be called the keye of knowledge to Anathomie: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> wherof, the rest is not onely obscure, but almost vayne at all to read.

Then at length the spirituall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: and finally the animall. To these I haue added a ninth, least (otherwise) the marey, Periosteon, and the heares should haue bene sought in vayne in the History of Man.

Wherfore their Assertions are odious, and most lothsome to aunswere, who fantastically fayne, that all Bones are sensible, or els the t√©eth also destitute of any feelyng: as though it were asmuch requisite for the Solid partes of the body, and such as, no otherwise then the frame worke of a house, do supporte, the other members should retaine as delicate sense as other partes &amp; Organs of the body, whose functions without the same, were frustrate, for who knoweth not (as I haue also other where said) how inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>modious a thing<note place="margin">That it behoued not the bones to feele.</note> it were, if the sense of f√©elyng should be imparted to the bones: whilest so no man might endure halfe the vigour of his bodyes motion, without intollerable payne in all partes.

And we s√©e it hapneth (many tymes) that they are ruined, by such cruciable tormentes of <hi>Rheumaticke</hi> incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or other like affectes, that no Medicin may preuayle to procure the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts ease, till the same dolorous tooth be extirped &amp; plucked vp by the rootes: at which seperation, and departyng from the sensible <hi>Surcles</hi> or twigges of the <hi>Sinewe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayd,<note place="margin">It Nerues be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted to y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> rootes of the teeth, they must needes haue sense.</note> how paynfull it is, I referre it to the sentence of them that haue tasted the bitternes therof.

            <p>The first bone of the wrest is that, which appeareth vnto vs in the inner side <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the first ranke, towardes the thombe.</p>
            <p>The second succ√©edeth the first.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
            </p>
            <p>The thyrd, is with the second coherent, at the outer side towardes the litle fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or cubit.</p>
            <p>The fourth and least of all is knit vnto the thyrd.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
            </p>
            <p>The fift is the first of the second ranke, and next vnto the thombe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
            </p>
            <p>And so thence the vj. vij. and viij. do follow in order.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6,7,8"/>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, as you s√©e in number, and figure, they are different, so also in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and litlenes. For the greatest of all are the first, and vij. of which ij. it is hard to iudge the greatest: the second is lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> these but bigger then all the remnau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t: then chalengeth the viij. and after him the fift, the sixt next, so then the thyrd: the fourth of all others (as we sayd before) is least.</p>
            <p>Now as touchyng their vnion, &amp; order of composition: which ought aswell to<note place="margin">The vnion of the brachiall bones.</note> be knowen, and considered, as all that we haue hetherto, spoken of them.</p>
            <p>The first bone therfore (besides that it is articulate with <hi>Radius,</hi>) in the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> part therof, where it proturberateth round, cleaueth to the second, entryng the cauitie therof, and admitteth into it the round head of the seuenth: as also in the inferiour part, is coherent with the v. and vj.</p>
            <p>The second, not onely vpward, entreth the hollow of <hi>Radius</hi> together with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the first, but in the inferiour part, where it is hollow, is connected with the vij. and in the posteriour part with the thyrd.</p>
            <p>So likewise the thyrd is ioyned with the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d, and in the lower side toucheth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the viij. and in the hinder part inwardly, towardes <hi>Vlna,</hi> meteth the fourth.</p>
            <p>The which fourth we finde committed to none other.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
            </p>
            <p>The fift next, in the vpper part with the first, in the hinder part with the vj. &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is adherent to the prominent <hi>Processe</hi> of the second bone of <hi>Postbrachiale,</hi> (if by the way, we constitute, as <hi>Collumbus</hi> would, v. bones thereto, wherof more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) the inferiour portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> therof the first bone of <hi>Postbrachiale,</hi> which <hi>Galen</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth<note place="margin">Galen.</note> the first ioynt of the thombe, receiueth.</p>
            <p>The vj. is knit to the first, fift, &amp; seuenth, on that side where it respecteth them:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> but with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inferiour head, or swelling, it is fastened to the angular bosome of the <hi>Postbrachiall</hi> bones, from thence respecting the thyrd also of <hi>Postbrachiale,</hi> whose first, and longer produced portion it susteyneth.</p>
            <p>The seuenth endeth at the first, second, sixt, and vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Notwithstandyng in the inferiour part, it is rooted to a portion of the thyrd, and fourth bones of <hi>Postbrachiale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly the viij. which is highest, on the other sides is coupled with the second,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> thyrd, and vij. and in the inferiour part, it is a seate vnto the fourth, and fift bones<note place="margin">The bones of the wrest haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure mouing.</note> of <hi>Postbrachiale:</hi> to which also it is coarticulated, and knit.</p>

            <p>Further those <hi>Muscles</hi> together whilest yet they obserue their propper place, are reckned in figure like a Peare made sharpe beneath and broad aboue: whose sharpe end is their begynning, but the broad part or seat, their insertion. In their short space they are knit together to the visible Nerue, conteyning in the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (which by m√©etyng together they make) much hard fatte, which other where, in the description of the eyes we haue spoken of at large. Briefly all these sayd sixe <hi>Muscles,</hi> produced from the hard Membran of the brayne, coueryng the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Nerue, or in compassed sort inserted with Membraneous tendons in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior seat of the hard tunicle, neare to the sides of <hi>Iris.</hi> The first therfore, which is in the great corner, draweth the eye inward towardes the nose: the second ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the lesser angle, leadeth the eye there towardes: the thyrd lying beneath, bringeth it downewardes: the fourth aboue, toward the eye browes: and the fift, and sixt circumuerte, and turne the eye about ech way.</p>
            <p>Besides those vj Muscles, there is yet an other great one hid on ech side by<note place="margin">Galen. Ibid</note> the others, and compassed about with the aforesayd fat. This sheweth the same likenesse that the other vj. do figure together: for from the hard Membran mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng the visible Nerue, it hath his begynnyng, but somewhat more forward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the first sixe. His begynnyng is fleshie, as the rest of the bodye therof, that round compasseth the visible Nerue, and beyng stretched forth from the begynnyng to the foure partes like a Peare or pine apple, increaseth, and enlargeth by litle and litle untill it touch the posterior part of the eye, whereto it is emplanted as a circle.

And so much the lesse is the cauitie of the right eare, by how much the Orifice of the veniall arterie, is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower then the orifice of <hi>Uena caua.</hi> In mouyng also, ayre is more ready to folow then bloud, so that for this occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> also, the left auricle is made lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the right.</p>
            <p>THe hart of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> obtaineth within, two notable and large cauities, called of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Latins <hi>Ventriculi</hi> or <hi>Sinus,</hi> sited after the sides of the hart, one on the right, the other on the left. Wherof the right exc√©edeth the other in largenes, and both of them in fourme varie much one from an other.</p>
            <p>For the right descendyng more downwardes to the poynt of the hart then the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> left, hath his cauitie made like the Moone encreasing. As in the right side, anteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and posteriour part, like the inside of a halfe circle, there aunsweryng to the exteriour <hi>Superfice</hi> which is Gibbous. But on the left side of it, it is Gibbous like the outside of a halfe circle, by meanes of the hedge betwene the Uentricles, which as a thyng halfe round, bouncheth into the amplitude of the right Uentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. And this fourme the right Uentricle of the hart obserueth, from the seate down to the point. No otherwise then as the figure of the hart is made also from his seate narrower.</p>
            <p>The left Uentricle also begynneth with a large seate, but by litle and litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> streter towardes the poynt of the hart, obtaining as touching the whole <hi>Superfice,</hi> a round cauitie like a Pincapple. For the hedge that is betwene the Uentricles of the hart, on the left side, wherewith it maketh the right of the left Uentricle, is hollow contrary to the other side, which bouncheth into the right Uentricle, and hath equall thickenes and nature with the substaunce of the hart, constitutyng the anteriour and posteriour partes of the left Uentricle. But the whole substaunce of the hart, beside of the hedge of the Uentricles, constitutyng the amplitude of the right Uentricle, is very thinne. But that which effourmeth and compasseth about the left Uentricle, surmounteth much in thicknes the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of the right Uentricle, and is euery where a like thicke, sauyng the seate onely, where for the insertion of the vessels, so much substaunce must needes wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, as the amplitude of the Orifices do occupy space.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Superfice</hi> or inside of both the Uentricles is very vnequall, and beset as it were with many causes, d√©epely impressed into the fleshy substaunce. Neither do these consist onely in the sides where the right ventricle respecteth the left, but round about, throughout the whole <hi>Superfice</hi> of the ventricle: and that not onely in new dissected bodies, but perpetually apparau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t as oft as you lust to behold the hart: neither at any tyme not appearyng in a dryed hart besides this inequalitie, which in the left ventricle is something greater: both of them haue inwardly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

fleshy explantations or <hi>Processes,</hi> which are round and slender, and ceasse into Membranous <hi>Fibres,</hi> continuall or ioyned to the lower seate of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brans in their borders reposed. These <hi>Processes</hi> are chiefly discerned fleshy at the poynt, or lower part of the Uentricles, which make to the strength of the <hi>Fibres,</hi> which they conteyne.</p>
            <p>That through the hedge situated betwene these two Uentricles, bloud should<note place="margin">Col. Loc. cit.</note> passe, as it were by resudation, from the right into the left Uentricle, almost all Anathomistes hetherto haue affirmed. And that the same in passage also should be made thinner for the more easie generation of vitall spirites. But very wyde they wander, sayth <hi>Collumbus.</hi> For the bloud through the arteriall Ueyne is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the lunges, whence, beyng attenuated, it is caried by the veniall arterie into the left Uentricle of the hart together with ayre: which no man before his tyme noted, or at least haue left extant.</p>

            <p>Notwithstandyng, est√©eme not (as many suppose) that the hollow veyne doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> spryng from thence: for it goeth not into the hart, as falsely they imagine, but beyng deuided or cleft a sunder in that place, cleaueth onely to the Orifice of the right Uentricle.</p>
            <p>The arteriall veyne neither springeth from the hart, but from the liuer. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> note, if we behold the same whilest the infant as yet is shrouded within the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, we shall finde the hollow veyne to be continuall with the arteriall Ueyne. In somuch therfore as it is a Ueyne, it fetcheth the begynnyng from the liuer, but as touchyng that it is arteriall, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the hart. For of all artcries the hart is the fountaine. It goeth to the lunges to carie bloud for the nourishment of the instrument, and to the end, that the same may be altered for the hart. Sufficient great is this arteriall Ueyne, yea much greater then was n√©edfull, if the bloud had bene onely to be caried to the lunges, in so small sp√°ce aboue the hart. It is deuided into two trunkes or notable braunches, both to the right, and to the left lunges: thence forth into sundry braunches, as before is sayd in the lunges.</p>
            <p>The arterie named <hi>Aorta,</hi> which of all other arteries is the mother, sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth from the left Uentricle of the hart, and riseth vpward.</p>
            <p>But before we prosecute the description of this arterie, it s√©emeth m√©ete to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> speake of the veniall arterie, set to the left ventricle of the hart it is called an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, in that it serueth to spirites and arteriall bloud: but a veyne, because it hath the body or substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce of a veyne. It is a vessel sufficient large, which also through the lunges is deuided like the arteriall veyne.</p>
            <p>The opinion of other Anathomistes is, that the vse of these diuisions of this vessell into the lunges, is to cary vnto the lunges the altered ayre, which are as a fanwynde to the hart, to coole the same: they supposing also that then the lunges do receiue certaine I know not what fumes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the left ventricle. And this inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth meruailously delight them: because they imagine that in the hart sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the like is accustomed to be done as in chimneyes: as though in the hart were gr√©ene stickes, which whilest they burne, do make a smoke or fume. Thus much <hi>Collumbus</hi> writeth accordyng to the sentence of other Anathomistes. But he him selfe iudgeth cleane an other way: as thus, that this veniall arterie is made to cary from the lunges, bloud mixt with ayre, into the left Uentricle of the hart. Which thyng (sayth he) is as true, as that which is most true: not onely beyng apparant to euery inspection of dissected bodyes, but manifest also in quicke dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of creatures, how full of bloud this Ueyne is alway founde: which could
<pb facs="tcp:7321:104"/>
not be so, if it had bene made onely for ayre and vapours.</p>
            <p>It is to be noted that in the Orifices of the iiij. vessels, at the seate of the hart, xi. Membra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s do stand, called <hi>Trisulcae</hi> or iij. edged that is to say iii. to <hi>Vena caua,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>. to the arteriall veyne, iij. to the arterie <hi>Aorta,</hi> &amp; ii. to the veniall arterie: which are not all in figure alike. For those which are put to the hollow veyne, &amp; veniall arterie, are diuerse in fourme from the Membrans of the great arterie, and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall veyne. For the Membrans of these, are like iij. of those letters which the Latins call C: but the others are like arrowes. The vse of these is meruailous: and by their meanes, we learne and perceiue many thynges, that appertaine to the knowledge of the functions both of the hart and lunges. Know therfore, that as they are in figure diuers, so their vtilitie not all a like. The wickettes therfore (for so they may not much vnaptly be termed) of the hollow veyne and veniall arterie, are sited from within forth, as seruyng to the emission of bloud: but the wickettes of the other ii. vessels, contrariwise, from without forth, or inward, that so they might s√©eme vnto vs to be made, for the conteining of included bloud. This also note, that those litle wickets, which from within forth are opened, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound here and there with certaine filmentes or threedes, dispersed through the ventricles, made so to hold and strengthen them. By which filmentes peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Aristotle</hi> was deluded, supposing them to be Nerues: so therfore he assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the hart to be the roote of Nerues, and consequently of f√©elyng and mouyng. But to returne to the foure vessels: two of them are made to carie into the hart, whilest y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hart is dilated: but the other ii. to beare forth in the time of constriction.</p>
            <p>When the hart therfore is dilated, it receiueth bloud from the hollow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¶</desc>
               </gap>eyne into the right ventricle, as also from the veniall arterie, prepared bloud and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite into the left ventricle. Therfore those Membrans lye downe and yeld to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng in. For whilest the hart is coarcted, these are shut: left any thyng they haue receiued, should returne or go backe agayne the same wayes: and at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunt the Membrans, of the great arterie, and arteriall veyne are opened, and giue way to the goyng forth of the ayerie bloud, which throughout the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is dispersed, and to the naturall bloud caried forth to the lunges.</p>
            <p>The matter therfore is alway so, that when the hart is dilated, the Membrans first mentioned, are opened and the rest shut. So that you shall finde the bloud which is now gone into the right ventricle, not able any more to go backe agayne into the hollow veyne. By which sense we gather that the hart by no meanes is that member wherein bloud is engendred, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth, when as the bloud is from <hi>Vena caua</hi> distributed,</p>
            <p>This moreouer know for a suretie, that in the hart of man is no bone to be found, although in Oxen, Horses, and such great creatures it may be shewed, but in man no such thyng, except it chaunce, that in very aged persons the like be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented: as in the History of bones I haue protested my selfe once to haue found. Onely a <hi>Cartilaginous</hi> substaunce at the roote of the great arterie, towardes the arteriall veyne is sene, whiche a Bone in no wise may be called, although <hi>Galen</hi> him selfe would haue it so: whose sentence partly I haue set forth in the place afore cited.</p>
            <p>Suppose this assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> most approued in Anathomie, that all arteries proc√©ede from the hart, euen as all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>From the left Uentricle of the hart therefore, springeth that arterie named <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
               <hi>Aorta,</hi> of all other arteries in the body the mother. In quantitie it is sufficient large, and in substaunce thicke and white. The cause of the thicknes is first, least the bloud with filled spirite should easely vanishe and wast, and secondly least it in mouyng should be broken. For the Arterie moueth continually, yet not by it selfe but through spirites.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:7321:104"/>AFter that <hi>Aorta</hi> is gone forth from the hart, immediately it bringeth forth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a small arterie called the coronall, because it compasseth about the seate of the hart, to quicken and refresh his substaunce, in which it is diuersly dissemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: albeit you haue to note by the way that in some bodyes this coronall arterie is not onely one, but ij. and so <hi>Vesalius</hi> describeth it: but further ascendyng, it is deuided into ij. trunkes or stockes, one greater, the other lesser: the greater desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

            <p>The trunke ascending putteth forth an arterie from the left side, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> the <hi>Axillaris arteria,</hi> which stretcheth forth obliquely towardes the armehole, and sendeth braunches to the superiour ribbes, and goyng forth to the arme cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his iourney after the inside, to mate himselfe with the inner <hi>Basilica,</hi> but sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng a braunche vpwardes, commaundeth others to all those <hi>Muscles,</hi> which are about the shoulder, the scapple bone, and his cauitie, not faylyng the anteriour partes of the brest, nor the <hi>Glandules</hi> vnder the armehole.</p>

But in such order the right is vnited to the left, as that of both, one for the length of halfe a finger, is made: Into ij. it is afterward deuided: then agayne into many others, and first they reach to <hi>Dura</hi> and <hi>Tenuis meuinx,</hi> and then to <hi>Cerebellum.</hi> By these the begynnyng of the Spinall marey, <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and part likewise of the brayne, are reuined and quickned: and if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not begotten, these (sayth <hi>Collumbus</hi>) the posteriour partes of the Scull had wanted arteries.</p>
            <p>These ij. arteries, whiche through the transuerse <hi>Processes</hi> of the <hi>Vertebres</hi> do arise vpward, betwene the first <hi>Vertebre,</hi> &amp; the bone of the hinder part of the head, enter into the inner region of the Scull betwene the same <hi>Vertebre,</hi> &amp; the spinall marey. But after they are entred into the cauitie of the Scull by the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>gth of halfe a finger, they are ioyned together, and of ij. made one onely arterie.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse they are agayne forthwith deuided, and that into a right and a left, from which, arteries are to the ij. Membrans of the brayne, and to <hi>Cerebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> suborned. And further, through the substaunce of these partes, in the vpper part, through the halfe space of the Scull, most large is the distribution of these arteries. The rest of the Scull is reuined by the ramification of the ij. arteries <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rwtides,</hi>

For nothyng els shall he finde there, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine litle Arteries, ministryng lyfe to these partes, and to the bone <hi>Spheno√Ødes.</hi> The same Arteries, which thus constitute the marueilous nette, do send their power through the substaunce of the brayne: whiche thyng of no other Anatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, saue onely of <hi>Collumbus,</hi> hath bene written.</p>
            <p>And this is the end of the description of the superiour trunke of the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, without you make accompt of those Arteries to be described, which flow forth to the right superiour ribbes. This by the way is worthy to be noted, that not one Arterie tendeth to the lunges, whereby they might receiue vitall spirites from the hart. And this is a sentence most approued in Anathomie, that (exceptyng the lunges onely) all other partes of mans body are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with beatyng Arteries. By whiche reason, <hi>Collumbus</hi> protesteth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient authoritie to what seuere disputer soeuer, shall goe about to proue, that in the hart it selfe are not begotten the vitall spirites. But of this matter is other where sayd.</p>
            <p>The greater trunke of the great Arterie called (as we haue often sayd) <hi>Aorta,</hi> tendyng downewardes, declineth towardes the left side, and is to the body of the <hi>Vertebres</hi> adherent, whiche to the superiour trunke is not inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For that, no otherwise then <hi>Vena caua,</hi> is distaunt from the <hi>Vertebres.</hi> This inferiour trunke therefore, whilest it descendeth, out of his hynder part profereth Arteries to the spaces of the ribbes: and these agayne charge others to the Spinall marey, to the <hi>Vertebres,</hi> and to the <hi>Muscles,</hi> in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriour part of the brest sited. But where it commeth downe to <hi>Septum trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersum,</hi> bringyng forth two a lyke Arteries, whiche are into the same distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, it passeth vnder the same, and still cleauyng to the body of the <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi> marcheth downe to the last <hi>Vertebre</hi> saue one of the loynes. But so soone as it hath passed the midreif, it produceth an Arterie to the liuer, in place whence <hi>

            <p>Moreouer a litle lower it begetteth two Arteries, and those very notable, called the <hi>Emulgent</hi> Arteries, which enter into the kidneys. Under the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Ueynes, a litle more bendyng downe, it produceth the two seminall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, whiche haue their begynnynges from the body of the great Arterie, but not from the left Emulgent (except in very fewe) as to <hi>Galen</hi> it s√©emed. These descendyng, are folded together with the seminall Ueynes downe to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, both in man, and young mayde, and in women to the body of the matrice, yea to the inner part of the matrice: and from these the vmbellicall Arteries of the infant, take their begynnyng.</p>
            <p>Under these seminall Arteries, in the middest of the trunke emergeth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arterie, whiche is caryed to the <hi>Mesenterium</hi> of the straight gutte, and to part of the intestine <hi>Colon,</hi> after the left side of <hi>Ileon.</hi> But the Arteries of the strayght gutte, downe to the extreme part of the fundament, together with the Meseraicall Ueynes of <hi>Vena porta,</hi> do descend, wherfore there are made both Ueynes &amp; Arteries called <hi>Haemorroidales:</hi> in the posteriour part out of the same Arterie vnder the midreif, Arteries make egresse to the <hi>Vertebres,</hi> to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall marey, to the <hi>Muscles</hi> of the backe, and to the <hi>Muscles</hi> of the bellye.</p>
            <p>But so soone as it is come to the last <hi>Vertebre</hi> of the loynes but one, and in some bodyes to the last of all, it is first deuided into two and those great braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whiche <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>From those Arteries whiche the bleddar receiueth, others also are purchased, whiche beyng brought to the inner part of <hi>Os sacrum,</hi> through whose holes they tend, both to the same, and to the Spinall marey: but without, to the <hi>Muscles</hi> seruyng the thighe. Lyke as also from the great diuision of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, some issue forth, whiche with vitall bloud, do nourishe the <hi>Muscles</hi> of the thighe, whiche are within the belly situated. But of those Arteries whiche after <hi>Os sacrum</hi> and <hi>Coccix</hi> do descend, some together with certaine Ueynes of <hi>Vena caua,</hi> do flowe to the <hi>Muscles</hi> called <hi>Sphincter:</hi> the whiche Arteries, may also be called <hi>Hemorroides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer out of the great diuision of the great Arterie, two other Arteries spryng, whiche are reflected vpwardes, and passing through <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> do ascend vnder the straight <hi>Muscles</hi> aboue the nauell: and in many braunches are ended among the <hi>Muscles</hi> of <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this diuision two Arteries, called <hi>Vmbelicales,</hi> are set downe, whiche are the first Arteries that in the infant are begotten. For after that they make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunce from the Nauell: they marche through <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> in what place it is double, vnto the sides of the bleddar, and doe begette these Arteries, of whiche somewhat before is sayd. But after the begynnyng of the <hi>Vmbelicall</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:7321:107"/>
Arteries, the hart it selfe is begotten: but to returne agayne to the <hi>Vmbeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Arteries, for of any such partes I determine not further to speake. These, after our bodyes are brought to light, are dryed vp, and vsurpe the office of two <hi>Ligamentes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But furthermore the two armes of the great trunke, whiche are caried downe into the legges, passe vnder the fift <hi>Muscle</hi> of the loynes bowyng the thigh, and goyng forth towardes <hi>Abdomen</hi> aboue <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> and <hi>Pubis,</hi> are ioyned in fellowshyp with the inner veynes of this place, whiche marche among the <hi>Muscles.</hi> And like as those veynes are deuided: so in lyke sorte we s√©e these Arteries to all the <hi>Muscles</hi> of the legge, foote, toes, and their extremities, disparcled. Finally, they commend their force by braunches, to the <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules</hi> of the flanke, to the purse of the Testicles, and vnder the skinne to the yard.</p>
            <p>Now diligent Reader note, that not the Bones them selues are destitute of Arteries, least so they should lacke vitall warmth also: without which, no part in the body lyueth.</p>

For els it may s√©eme, that we vse this word medullous impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly: since that is onely marey, which nourisheth the Bones. To which in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng this is like: neither yet is the Spinall marey (though <hi>Galen</hi> him selfe<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cal.</hi> in errour.</note> would haue it so) softer, then that, wherewith the bones are nourished.</p>
            <p>And had not the almighty creator thus produced it of two thynges, the one<note place="margin">The necessitse of the spinall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey.</note> had come to passe. For either all the partes of the body vnder the head, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Nerues of the vi. payre and admittyng no braunches of the sinewes of the brayne, should haue bene destitute of the arbitrarious mouyng, and frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of sense, whereby now so exquisitely they haue the knowledge of euery an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyaunce: or els of necessitie to euery part of the body a nerue from the brayne must haue bene deriued. But if they had wanted induyng, then no more had man aunswered the fourme of a liuyng creature, but a picture rather of stone, or clay: and on the other side, from the brayne to reach both small &amp; great nerues to euery part, had bene the part of a workeman, litle wayeng the securitie of the nerues.</p>
            <p>Therfore the Spinall marey was prouided, that there hence Nerues might<note place="margin">The vse of the spinall marey.</note> spring to fulfill all other partes of the body with sence, and mouyng: which are otherwise destitute, for any of the vj. payre of the brayne, that visiteth them. Then that this marey should be of affinitie with the brayne, which prouideth so noble partes to the body, who can doubt, gayne say, or inueigh to the contrary, vnlesse he beare armour agaynst truth.</p>
            <p>IT is described by Anathomist√©s diuersly, as touchyng the partes of sinewes traduced from the Spinall marey: but because we will consume no tyme to aunswere, and reply vpon euery selfe opinion, for s√©emyng ouer correctiue, as some are ready to obiect, we wil fall to the onely distribution of Nerues.
