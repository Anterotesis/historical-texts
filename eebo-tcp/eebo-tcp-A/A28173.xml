            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are three things which concur to make man miserable; sin, condemnation, and affliction: Every one may observe, <hi>that man is born unto trouble, as the sparks flie upward</hi>; that his dayes here are few and evil, <hi>he possesses moneths of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed for him,</hi> Job. 5.6, 7. and 7.3. <hi>He is of few dayes, and full of trouble,</hi> Job. 14.1. Heathens have had many meditations of the misery of man's life; and in this have out-stript the most part of Christians. We recount, amongst our miseries, only some afflictions and troubles, as poverty, sickness, reproach, banishment, and such like: they again have numbred even these natural necessities of men amongst his miseries, to be conti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ually turned about, in such a circle of eating, drinking, and sleeping: What burden should it be to an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal spirit to roll about perpetually that wheel? We make more of the body than of the soul: They have accounted this body a burden to the soul; they placed prosperity, honour, pleasure, and such things, which men pour out their souls upon, amongst the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est miseries of men, as vanity in themselves, and vexation, both in the injoying and losing of them: But, alace! they knew not the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59468:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fountain of all this misery, <hi>sin</hi>; and the accomplishment of this misery, <hi>condemnation.</hi> They thought trouble came out of the ground and dust, either by a natural necessity, or by chance; but, the Word of God, discovereth unto us the ground of it, and the end of it: the ground and beginning of it, was mans defection from God, and walking according to the flesh; and from this head have all the calamities and streams of miseries in the world issued; it hath not only redounded to men, but even to the whole creation, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it to vanity, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. of this Chapter. Not only shalt thou, O man (saith the Lord to <hi>Adam</hi>) eat thy meat in sorrow, but thy curse is upon the ground also, and thou who was immortal, shalt return to that dust which thou magnified above thy soul, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. But the end of it is suitable to the beginning; the beginning had all evil of sin in it, and the end hath all evil of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in it. These streams of this lifes misery, they run in to an infinit, boundless, and bottomless ocean of eternal wrath. If thou live according to the flesh, thou shalt die: It is not only death here, but eternal death after this. The miseries then of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life, are not a proportionable punishment of sin; they are but an earnest given of that great sum, which is to be payed in the day of accompts; and that is <hi>condemnation, everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and the glory of his power.</hi> Now, as the Law discovers the perfect misery of mankind, so the Gospel hath brought to light a perfect remedy of all this misery. Jesus Christ was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to take away sin, and therefore his Name is <hi>Iesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. This is the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. Iudgment was by one unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of all,</hi> but now <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus</hi>; so these two evils are removed, which indeed have all evil in them. He takes away the curse of the Law, being made under it; and then he takes away the sin against the Law by his holy Spirit. He hath a twofold vertue, for he came by <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>water,</hi> 1 <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.6, 7. by <hi>blood,</hi> to cleanse away the guilt of sin; and by <hi>water,</hi> to purifie us from sin it self. But in the mean time, there are many afflictions and miseries upon us, common to men: Why are not these removed by Christ? I say, the evil of them is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, though themselves remain. Death is not taken away, but the sting of death is removed; death, afflictions, and all a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e overcome by Jesus Christ, and so made his servants to do us good:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59468:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The evil of them is Gods wrath and sin, and these are removed by Jesus Christ. Now they would be taken away indeed, if it were not good they remained, for <hi>all things work together for the good of those that love God,</hi> ver. 28. So then we have a most compleat delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in extent, but not in degrees: Sin remains in us, but not in dominion and power: wrath sometimes kindles because of sin, but it cannot increase to everlasting burnings. Afflictions and miseries may change their name, and be called instructions and tryals, good, and not evil: but Christ hath reserved the full and perfect delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry till another day, which is therefore called <hi>the day of compleat redemption,</hi> and then, all sin, all wrath, all misery shall have an end, and <hi>be swallowed up of life and immortality,</hi> ver. 23.</p>
               <p>This is the sum of the Gospel; and this is the substance of this Chapter. There is a threefold consolation answerable to our three-fold evils: <hi>There is no condemnation to those that are in Christ.</hi> Here is a blessed message to condemned lost sinners, who have that sentence within their breasts, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. This was the end of Christs coming and dying, that he might deliver us from sin as well as death, and the righteousnesse of the Law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us; and therefore he hath given the holy Spirit, and dwels in us by the Spirit, to quicken us who are <hi>dead in sins and trespasses.</hi> O! what consolation will this be to souls, that look upon the body o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But because there are many grounds of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sadnesse in this world, therefore the Gospel opposes unto all these, both our expectation which we have of that blessed hope to come, whereof we are so sure, that nothing can frust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at us of it. And also the help we get in the mean time, of the Spirit to bear our infirmities, and to bring all things about for good to us, <hi>vers.</hi> 28. And from all this the believer in Jesus Christ, hath ground of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and boasting before the perfect victory. Even as <hi>Paul</hi> doth in the name of believers, from <hi>vers.</hi> 31. to the end. Upon these considerations, he that cryed out not long ago, <hi>O miserable man, who shall deliver me?</hi> doth now cry out, <hi>Who shall condemn me?</hi> The distressed wrestler becomes a victorious triumpher: the beaten Souldiour becomes more than a Conquerour. Oh that your hearts could be perswaded to hearken to this joyful sound! to embrace Jesus Christ for grace and salvation; how quickly would a song of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59468:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
triumph in him swallow up all your present complaints and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?</p>
               <p>All the complaints amongst men, may be reduced to one of these three. I hear the most part bemoaning the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Oh miserable man that I am, who will take this disease away? who will shew me <hi>any good thing?</hi> Psal. 4. any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good? But if ye knew and considered your latter end, ye would cry out more; ye would refuse to be comforted, though these miseries were removed. But I hear some bemoaning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more sadly, they have heard the Law and the sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is within them; the Law hath entred and killed them: Oh! <hi>what shall I do to be saved? Who will deliver me from the wrath to come</hi>? What is al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> present afflictions and miseries, in respect of eternity? Yet there is one moan and lamentation beyond all these, when the soul finds the sentence of absolution in Jesus Christ, and gets its eyes opened to see that body of death and sin within, that perfect man of sin diffused throughout all the members; then it bemoans it self with <hi>Paul, Oh miserable man, who shall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Rom. 7.24. I am delivered from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law, but what com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ort is it, as long as sin is so powerful in me? Nay, this makes me often suspect my delivery from wrath and the curse, seing sin it self is not taken away.</p>
               <p>Now, if ye could be perswaded to hearken to Jesus Christ, and embrace this Gospel, O! what abundant consolation should ye have? what a perfect answer to all your complaints? they would be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in such a triumph, as <hi>Pauls</hi> are here.

               <p>You have in this verse three things of great importance to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, The great and precious priviledge, the true nature, and the special property of a Christian. The priviledge is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

All these three are of one latitude, none of them reaches further than another; that rich priviledge and sweet property concenters and meets together in one man, even in the man who is in Jesus Christ: whoever enters into Jesus Christ, and abideth in him, he meets with these two, Justification and Sanctification, these are no where else, and they are there together.</p>

O! what weight is in that word, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Ye shall be punished with everlasting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction from the presence of the Lord, and glory of his power</hi>? if it were duely apprehended, it would weigh down a mans soul, and make it heavy unto death. This condemnation includes both <hi>damnum &amp; poenam, poenam damni &amp; poenam sensus,</hi> and both are infinite in themselves, and eternal in their continuance. What an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant and bitter life would one lead, that were born to a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and yet to be banished it, and losse it? But what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable losse is it, to fall from an heavenly kingdome, which heart cannot conceive, and that for ever? <hi>In Gods favour is life, and in his presence are rivers of pleasures for evermore.</hi> When your petty penny-losses do so much afflict your spirits, what would the due apprehension of so great a losse do? would it not be death unto you, and worse then death, to be separated from this life, to be eternally banished from the presence of this glory? If there should be no more punishment but this only; if the wicked were to endure for ever on earth, and the godly whom they despised and mocked, were translated to heaven, what torment would it be to your souls to think upon that blessednesse which they enjoy above? and how foolishly ye have been put by it for a thing of no value? what would a rich man's advantages and gaines be to him, when he considereth what an infinite loser he is? how he hath sold a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for a dung-hill? Now if there were any hope, that after some years his banishment from heaven might end, this might refresh him, but there is not one drop of such consolation: he is banished, and eternally banished from that glorious life in the presence of God, which these do enjoy, whom he despised, If a man were shut up all his lifetime in a pit, never to see the light once more, would not this be torment enough to him? but when withall there is such pain joyned with this losse; when all this time, he is tormented within with a gnawing worm, and without with fire: these senses that did so greedily hunt after satisfaction to themselves, are now as sensible in the feeling of pain and torment; and when this shall not make an end, but be eternal; O! whose heart can consider it? It is the comfort and ease of bodily to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59468:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be immortal, that destruction cannot quite destroy it, but shall be an everlasting destruction, and living death.</p>
               <p>This is the sentence that is once past against us all in the Word of God, and not one jot of this Word shall fall to the ground: Heaven and earth may fail sooner. Ye would think it were an irrepealable decree, if all the Nations in the earth, and Angels above, conveened to adjudge a man to death, did pass sentence upon him: Nay, but this Word that is daily spoken to you, which passeth this sentence upon you all, is more certain; and this sentence of death must be executed, unless ye be under that blessed exception made here, and elsewhere in the Gospel. I beseech you consider what it is to have such a Judge condemning you. Would not any of you be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, if ye were under the sentence of a King? if that judgment were above your head, Who of you would fit in peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Who would not flee from the wrath of a King, that is like the roaring of a Lion? But there is a sentence of the KING of Kings and Nations, above your heads: <hi>Who would not fear thee,</hi> to whom it doth appertain, <hi>O King of Nations!</hi> It is not a great man that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy thy body that is against thee; it is not he who hath power to kill thee, and he hath also a great desire so to do; this were indeed much: but it is the great and eternal Jehovah, <hi>who lifts up his hand to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and swears he lives for ever,</hi> he is against thee: he who hath all power over body and soul, is against thee, and so is oblidged to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his omnipotency against thee: <hi>He can kill both soul and body, and cast them into hell,</hi> and by vertue of this curse he will not spare thee, but pour out all the curses in this book. Thou would be at no peace if thou wert declared rebell by the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but alace! that's a small thing, they can but reach thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nay, neither can they alwayes do that; thou may flee from them, but whither canst thou flee from him? thou cannot go out of his dominions, for the earth is his, and the sea, and all that therein is: darkness cannot hide thee from him, he may spare long, because he can certainly overtake when he pleases: men may not, because they have no assurance of finding. I beseech you then, consider this, it is of soul-consequence; and <hi>what hath a man gained, if he gain the world and lose his soul</hi>? if the gainer be lost, what is gained? And it is of eternal consequence, and what is many thousand years to this? You can look beyond all these, and might comfort your s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59468:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more before than is past; nay, there is nothing past, it is still as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
               <p>O that ye would consider this curse of God that stands registrate upon us all; What effects had it in Christ, when he did bear it? it made his soul heavy to death, it was a cup that he could scarcely drink, he that supported the frame of this world, was almost near succumbing under the weight of this wrath; it made him sweat blood in the garden: He that could do all things, and speak all things, was put to this, <hi>What shall I say?</hi> When this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was so terrible to him, who was that mighty One upon whom all help was laid, what shall it be to you? No mans sorrow was ever like his, nor pain ever like his, if all the scattered torments were united in one; but because he was God he overcame, and came out from under it. But what do you think shall be the estate of these who shall endure that same torment? and not for three dayes, or three years, or some thousands of years, but beyond imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to all eternity.</p>
               <p>I beseech you consider this condemnation which ye are adjudged unto, and do not ly under it. Do ye think ye can endure what Christ endured? Do ye think ye can bear wrath according to Gods power and justice? and yet the judgment is come upon all men to this condemnation. But, alace! who fears him according to his wrath? Who knows the power of his anger? Ye sleep secure, as if all matters were past, and over your head. We declare unto you in the Lords Name, that this condemnation is yet above you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you have not judged your selves: It is preached unto you that ye may flee from it, but since ye will not condemn your selves, this righteous Judge must condemn you.</p>
               <p>Now since it is so, that such a condemnatory sentence is past on all men, what a priviledge must it be, to be delivered from it, to have that sentence repealed by some new act of Gods mercy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Skin for skin, and all a man hath he will give for his life</hi>: These riches and advantages and pleasures
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59468:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that men spend their labour for, all these they will part with in such a hazard. The covetous man he will cast his Coffers over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ere he lose his life: The voluptuous man he will suffer pain and torment in cutting off a member, ere he die. But if men knew their souls, and what an immortality and eternity expects them, they would not only give skin for skin, and all that they have for their soul, but their life also: Ye would choose to die a thousand deaths to escape this eternal death. But <hi>what shall a man give in exchange for his soul,</hi> Mat. 16.26. though he would give, yet what hath he to give? There are two things endears any priviledge to us, and hightens the rate of it; the necessity of it, and the preciousness of it: and these two are eminent here. Is it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be, to live, and have a being? All men think so, when they will give all they have to redeem themselves: All other things are accidental to them, they are nearest to themselves; therefore all must go ere themselves go. But I say this is more necessary, to be well eternally, than to be simply; to escape this condemnation, than to have a being. And this shall be verified in the last day, when men shall cry for <hi>hills and mountains to fall on them, and save them from the wrath of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 6.16. Men will choose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to be, than to fall in that wrath. O how acceptable would a mans first nothing be to him in that great day of wrath? who shall be able to stand in it? When Kings and Princes, bond and free, great and small, shall desire mountains to grind them into powder, rather then to hear that sentence of condemnation, and yet shall not obtain it. <hi>O blessed are all they that trust in him, when his wrath is kindled but a little,</hi> Psal. 2.12. Ye toil and vex your selves, and spends your time about that body and life, but for as precious as they are to you now, ye would exchange them one day for immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and freedom from this wrath and curse.

as there be breaches of the Law of God, whereof they are found guilty; and then all these will seek into corners, and cry for mountains, but there is no covering from his presence.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God hath found it: It is with him, he hath given his Son a ransome for many, and his blood is more precious than souls, let be gold and silver. Is not this then a great priviledge, that if all the kingdoms of the world were sold at the dearest, yet they could not buy it?

O how should ye walk as priviledged men, as redeemed ones.</p>
               <p>I beseech you all to call home your thoughts, to consider and ponder on this sentence that is past against us; there is now hope of delivery from it, if ye will take it home unto you, but if ye will still continue in the wayes of sin, without returning, know this that ye are but multiplying those curses, platting many cords of your iniquities, to bind you in everlasting chains; ye are but digging a pit for your souls, ye that sweat in your sins, and travel in them, and will not embrace this ransome offered: the key and lock of that pit is eternal despair. O consider how quickly your pleasures and gains will end, and spare some of your thoughts from present things, to give them to eternity, that threed spun out for ever and ever; the very length of the dayes of the Ancient of Dayes, who hath no beginning of dayes, nor end of time.

               <p>All men would desire to have priviledges beyond others, but there is one that carries it away from all the world, and that is the believer in Jesus Christ; who is said to be in Christ, implanted in him by faith as a lively member of that body whereof Christ is the head; Christ Jesus is the head of that body, the Church; and this head communicats life unto all the members, for <hi>be fills all in all</hi>; there is a mighty working power in the head, which diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

Nay this union is so strict, that it is mutual, <hi>I in them, and they in me.</hi> Christ dwelleth in us by faith, by making us to believe in him, and love him; we dwell in Christ by that same faith and love, by believing in him, and loving him. Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is our house where we get all our furniture; he is our store-house and treasure, our place of strength and pleasure, a city of refuge, a strong tower, and a pleasant river to refresh us.

                  <hi>ALL the promises are yea, and Amen, in Christ Iesus,</hi> they meet all in him, and from him are derived unto us. When man was in integrity, he was with God, and in God, and that immediatly, without the intervention of a Mediator; but our falling from God, hath made us without God: and the distance is so great, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> speaks to the rich man, that <hi>neither can these above go down to him, nor he come up to them</hi>: There is a gulf of separation between God and us, that there can be no meeting. And so we who are <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God,</hi> are <hi>without hope in the world, Eph.</hi> 2 12. no hope of any more access to God as before. The tree of life is compast about with a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59468:15"/>
flaming fire and a sword; God is become a consuming fire unto us, that none can come near these everlasting burnings, much less dwell with them. Since there can be no meeting so, God hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound out the way how sinners may come to him and not be consumed: He will meet with us in Jesus Christ, that living Temple, and this is the trysting place. There was a necessity of this Mediator, to take up the difference, and make a bridge over that gulf of separation, for us to come to God; and this is his Humane Nature, <hi>the new and living way, the vail of his flesh. God is in Christ</hi> therefore, <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world to himself</hi>: All the light of consolation and salvation that is from God, is all embodied in this Sun of Righteousness: All the streams of grace and mercy runs in the channel of his well-beloved Son. It follows then, that God is not to be found out of Jesus Christ; and whoever is <hi>without Christ,</hi> is <hi>without God in the world. God is in Christ reconciling the world,</hi> and <hi>therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ</hi>; but God out of Christ is condemning the world, and therefore condemnation is to all that are not in Christ. When all the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> were declared re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, because of his and their own rebellion, the Lord hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a City of refuge, that whosoever is pursued by the avenger of blood, may enter in to it, and get protection and safety. Without is nothing but the sword of the avenger, Justice reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the world beside; within this City, Justice may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take out any into condemnation: and therefore those souls that flee for refuge, <hi>to lay hold on the hope set before them</hi> in Jesus Christ, Justice may pursue them to the Ports of this City, condemnation may follow them hard, till they enter in; but these may not enter into the Ports of the City. What a miserable estate then are these souls in, that ly in their own natures, in the open fields without this City? How many foolish men apprehend no danger? but sport about the Ports of the City of Refuge, and will not enter in. O! the avenger of blood shall be upon thee ere thou know: and if it find thee out of the City, woe unto thee, all thy prayers and intreaties will not prevail; Justice is blind and deaf, cannot deal partially, or respect persons, cannot hear thy supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is strange, that men are taken up with other petty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable things, and yet neglect to know what this is, to be in Jesus Christ, upon which their salvation depends.</p>
               <p>Faith in Jesus Christ is the souls flight in to the City of Refuge,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59468:16"/>
now none flyeth but when they apprehend danger, or are pursued: This danger that a soul apprehends, is, perishing and condemnation for ever: The pursuer is the Law of God, and his Justice; these have a sword in their hand, the curse of God, and the sentence of condemnation. God erects a Tribunal in his Word, wherein he judgeth men; whosoever he hath a purpose of good-will unto, he makes the Law to enter into their Consciences, that the offence might abound: he sends out some messenger o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> affliction, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, to bring them before the Judgment-seat, and hear their accusation read unto them. There the soul stands trembling, and the conscience witnesseth and approveth all that the Word challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of; so that the sinners mouth is stopped, and can have no excuse to this accusation: then the Judge pronounces the sentence upon the guilty person, <hi>Cursed is every one that abideth not in all things,</hi> &amp;c. the soul cryes, guilty, O Lord, guilty, I deserve the curse indeed: Oh! <hi>what shall I do to be saved</hi>? Then the soul looks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout on the right hand, and on the left hand, to seek some refuge, but there is none. Whither shall he go from him? he looks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himself, and behold nothing within, but the accusing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing conscience becomes a tormenter: the fire is kindled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which feeds upon the fewell of innumerable sins; now the soul is almost overwhelmed, and spyes is there be any place to flee from it self, and from that wrath, and behold the Lord discovers a City of refuge near hand, where no condemnation is, even Christ Jesus, who hath sustained the curse, that he might redeem us from it. The vision of peace is here, and thither the soul flies out of it self, and from Justice, into that discovered righteousness of Christs, and so <hi>the more that the offence abounded</hi>: now, <hi>the more hath grace superabounded:</hi> so that <hi>there is now no more condemnation</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>I beseech you consider this, and let it be written on the table of your hearts: there are two tribunals that God sits upon, one out of Christ Jesus, another in Christ Jesus, there is a Throne of Justice, where no sentence passes but pure unmixed Justice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any temperament of mercy; and this all men must once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before. Ye know what a Covenant of Works God once made with us, <hi>If thou do these things thou shalt live,</hi> not, <hi>thou shalt die the death</hi>: according to this we must once be judged, that Justice suffer no prejudice. Therefore God speaks out of his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59468:16"/>
Law, upon this Throne, the language of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> he reads our charge unto us, and because all the world is guilty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sentence of death is once past upon all. Now whoever of you come before this Tribunal to be judged, know that it is a subordinate Court, there is a higher Court of Mercy and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both Justice and mercy mixed together; though mercy be the predominant, <hi>Iustice and Iudgment i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And whoever comes here, Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus sits on this Throne, to absolve him from that sentence. If you ask what equity is in it, is not this a prejudice to Justice, and an abomination to the Lord, to justifie the wicked and ungodly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? I say, it is no iniquity, because Jesus Christ hath payed the price for us, and <hi>was made a curse for our sins, that we might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Ye may answer Justice, I will not take this for Gods last word, I hear that all final Judgement is committed to the Son, that he may give life to whom he will: he calls me, and to him will I go, for <hi>he hath the words of eternal life,</hi> he will <hi>justifie, and who shall condemn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if any man, will not now arraign himself before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of Gods Justice, if he will not search his guiltiness till his mouth be stopped; and hear his sentence of condemnation read, and take with it: that man cannot come to Jesus Christ, to be absolved, for he justifieth none but self condemned, and lost sinners; so your day is but yet coming when ye must answer to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, the Tribunal of Mercy shall be removed, and Christ shall sit upon a Throne of pure Justice, to judge these who judged not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Alas for your loss! the most part of you: I pity you, ye live in great peace and quietness without the ports of the city of refuge. We declare unto you in the Lords Name, ye are under the curse of God: will ye yet sit secure, and put the evil day far from you.

not trouble your selves so much as to judge your selves, then ye shall be judged when there is no Mediator, to plead for you, none to appeal unto.</p>
               <p>But whosoever takes the sentence of condemnation unto them, and subscribes to the righteousness of the Lords curse upon them, we do invite all such in the Lords Name, to come in hither, even to Jesus Christ, <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in him.</hi> If ye stand scrupulous, making many questions in such a matter of so great necessity, ye wrong your own soul, and dishonour him; know this, that <hi>God is in Christ reconciling the world to himself</hi>: therefore thou condemned sinner may come to God in Christ: If ye ask any warrand, we think there should be no such questioning, when ye are in so great necessity. If a man we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is enough to cross all your objections, ye are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream necessity, and like to perish within your self, <hi>He is able to save to the utmost all that come to him.</hi> What should more, let there be then a closure between absolute necessity, and sufficient ability to save: will ye yet stand disputing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the city, when the avenger of blood is above your head? If ye will yet press for some more ground and warrand of believing, then I will tell you, all that I know is in the Word for a ground of Faith, ye have great misery and necessity within you; that ye grant; and it is your complaint; Christ hath mercy and sufficiency of grace in him, <hi>he is able to save to the utmost,</hi> that ye cannot deny: But I do add this third, he is willing also to save thee, whoever will be willing to be saved by him; nay, he is more willing than thou art. If ye question this, I desire you but to consider the whole tenor of the Gospel; How many invitations? How many perswasions? How many promises to those who come? Yea, how many commands, and that peremptory, to believe on him? Yea, how many threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings against you, if ye will not come to him to have life? Hath he given himself for the sins of the world, and will he not be willing that sinners partake of that he was at so much pains to purchase? Think ye that Christ will be content his death should be in vain? and it should be in vain, if he did not welcome the worst sinners; yea, it should be in vain, if he did not draw them to him, and make them willing. But besides this, he hath promised so absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59468:17"/>
and freely, and fully, as there should be no exception imaginable against it; <hi>Him that cometh I will not in any case cast out</hi> Joh. 6.37. Why do ye imagine any case where Christ hath made none? Why do ye sin against your own souls? Oh! if I were in Christ, say ye, I would be well; and, Oh! that he would welcome such a sinner. Christ answers thee in express tearms, <hi>Whosoever will, let him take and drink freely.</hi> Thou declares thy willingness in so speaking, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his willingness in so promising. Nay, thy looking afar off on him, is a fruit of his willingness: <hi>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and loved you first.</hi> If ye will not yet believe this, look upon his command; <hi>This is his command, that ye believe on the Son,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23. What warrand have ye to do any duty he commands? and why do ye more question this? Is not this his command? and is it not more peremptory, because a new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and his last command? And when withall he boasts us in to his Son, <hi>that we may have life.</hi> Oh! who should have the face to question any more his willingness? Other grounds than these I know none: And I think if any come to Christ, or pretend to come on other grounds, he comes not right. If the most holy man come not in among ungodly sinners, if he do not walk upon the grounds of his own extream necessity, and Christs sufficiency, he cannot come to Jesus Christ. There is a conceit among people, which if it were not so common as it is, I would not mention it, it is so ridiculous: How can I come to Christ so unclean and so guilty, nothing but condemnation in me? if I were such and such, I would come to him. Alace! there can nothing be imagined more absurd, or contrary even to sense and reason. If thou wert such and such, as thou fancies a desire to be, thou would not come to Christ, thou needed him not; that which thou pretends as a reason why thou should not come, is the great reason pressed in the Gospel, why thou should come. What madness is this? I am so unclean, I will not come to the fountain to wash: Wherefore was the fountain opened, but <hi>for sin and uncleanness</hi>? and the more uncleanness, the more need, and the more need, the more reason to come: Necessity is a great errand, and our e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I beseech you every one who useth those debates, and taketh a kind of delight in them, know what they mean, how they wrong your own souls, how they dishonour Christ, and so God the Father; nay, how foolish and ridiculous they are, that if it were not your perplexity indeed, they deserved no answer, but a rebuke, or silence. I have seen people take delight in moving objections against the truth, yea, and studying earnestly how to object against any answers given from the truth. Alace! thou medles to thine own hurt, thou art upon a way which shall never yeeld thee any comfort, but keep thy soul from establishment, as a wave tossed up and down. <hi>If ye believe not,</hi> but dispute, <hi>ye shall not be established.</hi>

               <p>IT is difficult to determine which of these is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est priviledge of a Christian, that he is delivered from condemnation, or that he is made to <hi>walk according to the Spirit,</hi> and made a new creature: whether we owe more to Christ for our Justification, or Sanctification? for he is made both to us: But it is more necessary to conjoyn them together, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with other; the one is not more necessary to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from wrath; than the other to walk according to the Spirit. I think it were an argument of a soul escaped condemnation, to have the great stream and current of its affections and endeavours towards Sanctification, not that they may be accepted of God, but because they are accepted of God. It is not said, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing condemnable in those that are in Christ, but <hi>there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them.</hi> There is indeed <hi>a body of death,</hi> and <hi>law of sin</hi> within them, a nature defiled with O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cy of God in Jesus Christ that removes the curse where the sin is, that takes away the condemnation, where all worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is. And thus the souls Justification is parallel to Christs condemnation; there was in him nothing condemnable, <hi>no sin, no guile in his mouth,</hi> yet there was condemnation to him, because he was in stead and place of sinners, <hi>our iniquities was laid on him,</hi> not in him; <hi>he who knew no sin was made a curse for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him</hi>: So then, the soul that flyeth in to Jesus Christ his righteousness, though it have in it, all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth condemnation, yet there is no condemnation to it, because his righteousness is laid upon it, and Christ hath taken away the curse. The innocent Son of God was condemned, therefore are guilty sinners absolved: The curse was applied unto <hi>him who had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59468:19"/>
no sin,</hi> but only <hi>was made sin,</hi> or sin laid on him, and therefore the sentence of absolution from the curse is applyed unto them who have no righteousness, but are made the righteousness of God by free and gracious imputation. This I speak, because of many unsavoury and unsound expressions in this loose generation, that there is no sin in the justified, that Justification removes it closs, as if it had never been at all. I say, as the condemnation of Jesus Christ did not blot out his innocency and holiness within him, but only Justice considered him in that account as a transgressour, who yet was the holy and spotless Lamb of God in himself, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the justification of a sinner before God, doth not remove or blot out the very corruption and defilement of our natures, but only scrapes out our names out of the roll of his debtors, as having satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in our Cautioner, and considers us as righteous in that account before God. And this likewise I speak for your use, that ye may loath and abhor your selves, as much in your selves, who are made clean by the blood of Jesus Christ, as if ye were not washen. Nay, so much the more ye ought to remember your own sins, which he doth not remember as debt any more; and to be ashamed and confounded because they are pardoned: It is ordinary for souls to look on themselves with an eye of more complacency in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they apprehend that God lookes favourably on them: I do not think that any soul can duely consider the gracious aspect of God in Jesus Christ to them, but they will the more loath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but I find it ordinary, that slight and inconsiderate thoughts of pardon, begets jolly conceits in mens hearts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and this is even the sin of Gods children, something is abated of our self abhorring, when we have peace and favour spoken in to us: but I beseech every one that believes there is no condemnation for them, to consider there is all things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it in them, yea, nothing but what deserves it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let that aspect of God beget self-loathing, and self-detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in you: the more you apprehend he is pleased with you, be ye the more displeased with your selves, because it is not your selves he is pleased with, but his own well-beloved Son. The day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is coming, when there shall be no condemnation, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing condemnable either: In Heaven you shall be so, but while ye are here, this is the most important duty ye are called to, to <hi>loath your selves, because of all your abominations, and because he is

               <p>Every one pretends a claim and right to this priviledge of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to be pardoned and absolved from condemnation, who doth not put it out of question, though in the mean time, <hi>their iniquities testifie against them</hi>; and their transgressions say in the heart of a godly man, that <hi>there is no fear of God before their eyes</hi>? Therefore the Apostle describes the man that is in Jesus Christ, to be such an one, <hi>That walks not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi> Not only to guard against the presumptuous fancy of those that live in their sins, that pretend to hope for Heaven, but to stir up every justified soul to a new manner of conversation; since they are in Jesus Christ. We would speak a word of two things from this: First, that the Scripture gives marks and characters of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified and reconciled persons, that they may be known by, both to themselves, and others. Next, that the Christian escaped con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, hath a new manner of walking, and is a new creature in Christ.</p>
               <p>It might seem a strange thing, that this fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st, were questioned in this generation; (if any the most clear and important truth could pass without scanning;) the very tenor of the whole Scripture holds out so much of it. I wonder that any man that reads this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the Epistles of <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> should have any more doubt of it. <hi>Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59468:20"/>
commands</hi>; Is not this a conclusion of our state and condition, from the conformity of our walking to the will of God? What di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth can we be sure of, if this be uncertain? When the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Disciple, who knew how to preach Christ, asserts it in express terms, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.13. <hi>These things have I written to you that believe, that ye may know ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the Name of the Son of God:</hi> this very thing was the great scope and purpose of that Evangelick and Divine Epistle.</p>
               <p>I find that Antinomians confound this question, that they may have the more advantage in their darkness. The question is not concerning the grounds of a mans believing in Christ, but concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our assurance, or knowledge of our believing. There is a great mistake in Christians practice, in confounding these two, it makes Christians very unreasonable in their doubtings and exercises, therefore let us have this before our eyes; Faith in its first and pure acting, is rather an adherence and cleaving of a lost soul to Christ, than an evidence of its interest in him, or of his everlasting love. You know all, that it is one thing to know a thing, or love a thing, and another thing to reflect upon it, and know that I know and love. <hi>Iohn</hi> did write to believers that they might know they did believe, and believe yet more. These things then are both separable, and the one is posterior to the other; <hi>After ye believed ye were sealed.</hi> The perswasion of Gods love, and our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ, is the Spirits seal set upon the soul: there is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual sealing here, the soul by believing and trusting in Jesus Christ, <hi>sets to its seal that God is true,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks, 3.33. When God speaks in his Law, the soul receives that testimony of his Justice and Holiness, subscribes to the equity and righteousness of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, by condemning it self. And when Christ speaks in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, the soul seals that doctrine of free Salvation, by approving and consenting with all its heart to the offer, subscribes to the way of Salvation in Christ, and truth of his promises: and thus is the truth of God and Christ sealed by the souls believing. Then the Spirit of Jesus Christ afterward, when he pleaseth, irradiats and shines upon the soul, and discovers these things that are freely given, and witnesseth to the conscience of the believer, that he is a son of God: thus the Spirit seals the believer, and gives his testimony to his truth.</p>
               <p>Now if we speak of the ground of the first, <hi>viz.</hi> Of believing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59468:20"/>
in Christ to salvation, I know none; but that which is common to sinners, and holden out in the Gospel generally to all. Our sin, and misery, and absolute necessity, and Christs invitation of all to come, and receive his full and perfect salvation. I think a man should seek nothing in himself, whereupon to build his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ, though it be true, no man can come to a Saviour, till he be convinced of sin and misery, yet no man should seek convictions as a warrand to come to Christ for salvation; he that is in earnest about this question, <hi>how shall I be saved</hi>? I think he should not spend the time in reflecting on, and examination of himself, till he find something promising in himself, but from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered sin and misery, pass straight way over to the grace and mercy of Christ, without any interveening search of something in himself to warrand him to come; there should be nothing before the eye of the soul, but sin and misery, and absolute necessity, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with superabounding grace, and righteousness in Christ: And thus it singly devolves it self over upon Christ, and receives him as offered freely, without money, and without price? I know it is not possible that a soul can receive Christ till there be some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory convincing work of the Law, to discover sin and misery: But I hold, that to look to any such preparation, and fetch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement or motive therefrom, to believe in Christ, is really to give him a price for his free waters and wine; it is to mix in together Christ, and the Law, in the point of our acceptation; and for souls to go about to seek preparations, for a time resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, not at all to consider the promise of the Gospel, till they have found <hi>them,</hi> and satisfaction in <hi>them,</hi> is nothing else, <hi>but to go about to establish their own righteousness; being ignorant of the righteousness of Christ.</hi> And therefore many do corrupt the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Gospel, by rigid exactions of preparations, and measures of them, and by making them conditions, or restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of Gospel-commands and promises: As in this, <hi>Come ye that are wearied.</hi> And from thence they seem to exclude persons not so qualified, from having a warrand to believe. Alas it is a great mistake of these and such words, certainly these are not set down of purpose to exclude any who will come, for, <hi>whoever will, let them come and take freely</hi>: but rather to encourage such wearied and broken souls, as conceives themselves to be the only pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59468:21"/>
true faith; that a soul must be beaten out of it self, ere it can come to Christ. Therefore I conclude, that not only it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ridiculous, and foolish conceit of many Christians that uses to object against believing; I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I were as such or such a person, if I did love God, if I had these fruits of the Spirit, if I walked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit, then I might believe. Alace! how directly opposite is this to the tearms of the Gospe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? I say, If thou place satisfaction in these, and from that ground, come to Jesus Christ, then thou dost not come really, thou dost indeed establish thine own righteousness. Doth any Saint, though never so holy, consider himself under such notions of grace, when he comes to be justified? No indeed; but as an ungodly man, rather, he must deny all that, though he had it. And besides, it is most unreasonable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous, to seek the fruits, before the tree be planted; and to refuse to plant the tree, till you can behold the fruits of it. But also, it is contrary to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ree and comfortable Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, for a soul to seek the discovery of any thing in it self, but sin before it apply to Jesus Christ. I say, there must be some sense o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> sin, otherwise it hath not rightly discovered sin; but a soul should not be at the pains to discover that sense of sin, and find it out, so as to make it a motive of believing in Christ: He ought to go straight foreward, and not return as he goes; he must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed examine himself; not to find himself a sensible humbled sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that so he may have ground of believing, but that he may find himself a lost perishing sinner; void of all grace and goodness, that he may find the more necessity of Jesus Christ. And thus I think the many contentions about preparations, or conditions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to believing, may be reconciled.</p>
               <p>Now if the question be (as it is indeed) about the grounds of our assurance, and knowledge of our own faith, certainly it is clear as the noon-day, that as the good tree is known by the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the fire by the heat thereof, so the in-dwelling of faith in the heart, is known by its purifying of the heart, and working by love, it makes a man a new creature; so that he, and others may see the difference. Neither is this any derogation to the free grace of Christ, or any establishing of our own righteousness (except men be so afraid to establish their own righteousness, that they will have no holiness at all, but abandon it quite, for fear of trusting in it, which is a remedy worse than the disease) because I make it not a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59468:21"/>
ground of my acceptation before God, but only a naked evidence of my believing in Christ, and being accepted of God: it being known that these have a necessary connexion together in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and it being also known that the one is more obvious and easie to be discerned then the other. Sure I am, the Lambs Book of Life is a great mystery, and unless this be granted, I see not but every mans regeneration and change shall be as dark and hidden, as the hidden and secret decrees of Gods Election; for the Spirit may immediatly reveal both the one and the other. Is it any deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the grace of Christ, to know what is freely given us? Doth it not rather commend his grace: When a soul looks upon it self, beautified with hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> comeliness, and adorned with his graces, and loaths it self in it self, and ascribes all the honour and praise to him. Is it not more injury to the fountain and fulness of grace in Christ, not to see the streams of it at all, nor to consider them, then to behold the streams of grace that flowes out of this fountain, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it? I think Christians may be ready to idolize their graces, and make them Mediators, when they are known; but is this a good remedy of that evil, to abandone all sight and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>things freely given us of God</hi>? Shall we not speak of the freeness of grace, because mens corruptions turn grace into car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal liberty, and wantonness? If these graces be in us, sure I am, 'tis no vertue to be ignorant of them, but rather a weakness and darkness: It must then be the light and grace of God, to know them, and from thence to conclude, that assurance of faith, which is not a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ungrounded perswasion, and strong fancy, without any disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered reason of it. Sure I am, the Apostles counsel is, <hi>to make our election sure,</hi> by <hi>making our calling sure.</hi> How shall any ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to look in to these secrets of <hi>the Lambs book of life,</hi> and read their name there, undoubtedly they belong not to us, they are a light inaccessible, that will but con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Christ, to flee unto him, as a lost sinner to a saving Mediator. But that every man is bound to perswade himself at the first, that God hath loved him, and Christ redeemed him, is the hope of the Hypocrite, like a spiders web, which when leaned to, it shall not stand; that mans expectation shall perish, he hath kindled sparks of his own, a wilde fire, and walketh not in the true light of the Word, and so must ly down in sorrow. Many of you deceive your selves, and none can perswade you that ye do deceive your selves, such is the strength of that delusion, and dream. Its the great part of the hearts deceitfulness, to flatter it self in its own eyes, to make a man conceive well of himself and his heart, I beseech you, do not venture your souls salvation to such groundless opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; never to question the matter, is to leave it alwise uncertain. If ye would judge your selves according to the Scriptures, many of you have the marks and characters of these who are kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, and are to have <hi>their part in the lake of fire.</hi> Is there no condemnation for you, who have never condemned your selves? Certainly, the more you are averse to condemn your selves, this sticks the closser to you. You are not all in Christ, <hi>all are not Israel, who are of Israel,</hi> many, (nay, the most part) are but said Christians, have no real union with Christ, or principle of life from him; your love you carry to your selves, makes you easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve well of your selves; know, that self-love can blind the eyes, and make you apprehend that God loves you also. Nay, every one readily fancies that to be, which he desires to be. I beseech you, consider if you have any ground for your hopes, and confidences, but such as these that will not bear out alwayes. It would be no disadvantage to you, to have your hope shaken, that in stead of a vain presumption, you may have the Anchor of hope, which shall be fixed within the vail. I think one thing keeps men far from the Kingdom of God, because they know not that they believe not in him: we had gained much ground on you by the Word, if we could perswade you, that ye believe not, and have not believed from the Womb. We might then say to you, as Christ to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>ye believe in God, believe also in me</hi>: Ye have given credit to God the Judge, and Law-giver, pronouncing a curse on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In the creation of man, man was composed of soul and body, there was a right order, and subordination of these, suitable to their nature, in his soul he reached Angels above, in his body he was like the beasts below; and this part, his flesh, was a servant to the Soul, that was acted and affected according to the desires and motives of the Soul. Now sin entring, as it hath defaced all the beauty of the creation, as it hath misplaced man, and driven him out from that due line of subordination to God his Maker, (for he would have been equal to God,) so it hath perverted this, beautiful order in men, and turned it just contrary, hath made <hi>the servant to ride on horses, and the prince to walk on foot.</hi> This is the just punishment of our first sin, <hi>Adams</hi> soul was placed by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation under the sole command of its Creator, above all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and his own senses, but in one sin, he proudly exalted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self above God, and lamentably subjected himself below his senses, by hearkening to their perswasion, <hi>he saw it was good, and tasted it, and it was sweet,</hi> and so he ate of it. What a strange way was this? to be like God, he made himself unlike himself, liker the miserable

beasts. Now I say, this is the deserved punishment of man, his soul that was a free Prince, is made a bond slave to the lusts of his flesh; flesh hath gotten the Throne, and keeps it, and lords over the whole man. Now therefore, it is, that, the whole man unregenerat, is called flesh, as if he had no immortal spirit, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the flesh is flesh,</hi> and this Chap. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. here a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of natural men, <hi>they that are in the flesh.</hi> Because flesh is the predominant part that hath captivat a mans reason and will. Nay, not only the grosser corruptions in a man, that have their use and seat in his flesh and body, are under that name, but take the whole nature of man, that which is most excellent in him, his Soul and Spirit, his Light and Understanding, the most refined principles of his conversation, all these are now but <hi>flesh</hi>: Nay, not only such natural gifts, and illuminations, but even the light of the Gospel, and Law of God, that someway enters his soul, changeth the nature and name, its all but darkness and <hi>flesh</hi> in him, because the flesh hath a dominion over all that, the clouds and vapours that ariseth from the flesh, bemists and obscures all these, the corruptions of the soul is most strengthned in this fort, and most vented here: Sins become connatural to the flesh, and so a man by the flesh, is ensnared and subjected to sin. Christ comprehends all our prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives and indowments under this, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.13. <hi>born not of flesh and blood</hi>: And <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.17. <hi>flesh and blood hath not revealed these things to thee.</hi> Even all the outwards of Religion, and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon priviledges of Christians may be called so: What hath <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> sound according to the flesh? <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. Which imports so much, that all those outward priviledges, many illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and reformations, may so far consist with the corruption of mans nature, may unite so with that, as to have one name with it; its not all able to conquer our flesh, but our flesh rather subdues all that, and makes it serve it self, till a stronger than it come, even the Spirit to subdue it, and cast it out of the house. Thus the Image of God in man is defaced: Nay, the very image and nature of man, as man, spoyled; the first creation, sin hath marr'd, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordere'd it. Now, when this second creation, or regeneration comes, the creature is made new, and formed again by the powerful Spirit of Jesus Christ, this change is made, flesh is put out of the Throne, as an usurper, the spirit and soul of a man, is put in a Throne above it; but is placed according to its due order, under a holy and spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual

                  </gap>s to dwell in. Now, the soul hath a new rule established, to act according to, and new principles to act from. He whose course of walking, was after the corrupt dictates, and commands of his fleshly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and was of no higher strain, then his own sparks of nature, and acquired light would lead him to, now he hath a new rule establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, the Spirit speaking in the Word to him, and pointing out the way to him: and there is a new principle, that Spirit leading him in all truth, and quickning him to walk in it: Now this is the souls perfect liberty, to be from under the dominion of sin, and lusts, and thus the Son makes free indeed, by the free Spirit, the Son was made a servant, that we might be made free, <hi>no more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of sin in the lusts thereof</hi>: and the Spirit of the Lord, where he comes, there is liberty, there the Spirit and reasonable soul of a man is elevated into its first native dignity; there the base flesh is dethroned, and made to serve the spirit and soul in a man. Christ is indeed the greatest friend of men, as they are men, sin made us beasts, Christ makes us men. Unbelievers are unreasonable men, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> brutish, yea, in a manner, beasts, this is an ordinary compellation in Scripture, faith makes a man reasonable, it gives the saving and sanctified use of reason; its a shame for any man to be a slave to his lusts and passions, its the character of a beast upon him, he that is led by senses and affections, is degenerated from humane nature; and yet such are all out of Christ, sin reigns in them, and flesh reigns, and the principles of light and reason within, are captivated, incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated within a corner of their minds. We see the generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived truths among men, <hi>that God is, that he is holy, and just, and good; that Heaven and hell is,</hi> these are altogether ineffectual, and have no influence on mens conversations, no more then if they were not known, even because the truth is detained in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, the corruptions of mens flesh are so rank, that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow all this seed of truth, and choaks it, as the thorns did the seed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.7. Now, for you, who are called of Jesus Christ, O know what ye are called unto. Its a liberty indeed, a priviledge indeed, ye are no more debtors to the flesh, Christ hath loosed that obligation of servitude to it. O let it be a shame unto you, who are Christians, to walk so any more, to be entangled any more in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59468:27"/>
that yoke of bondage. <hi>He that ruleth his spirit, is greater then the mighty, then he that taketh a city.</hi> Thus we are called to be more then conquerours; others when they conquer the world, they are slaves to their own lusts, but let it be far from you to be so, ye ought to conquer your self, which is more then to conquer the World; its not only unbeseeming a Christian, to beled with pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and lusts, but its below a man, if men were not now through sin below beasts. I beseech you aspire unto, and hold fast the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Christ hath obtained to you, be not fashioned any more accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to former lusts, know, ye are men, that ye have reasonable and immortal spirits in you, why will ye then walk as beasts? Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand O brutish, and <hi>ye fools, when will ye be wise?</hi> But I say more, know, ye are Christians, and this is more then to be a man, its to be a divine man, one partaker of the divine Nature, and who is to walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Christians are called to a new manner of walking, and this walking is a fruit that comes out of the root of faith, whereby they are implanted in Christ: You see these agree well together, <hi>these who are in Christ, walk not after the flesh,</hi> &amp;c. Walking after the flesh, is the common walk of the World, who are without God and without Christ: But Christ gives no latitude to such a walk; this is a new nature to be in Christ, and therefore, it must have new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, to walk <hi>after the Spirit.</hi> While we look upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations of the most part of men, they may be a commentary to expound this part of the words, what it is to walk <hi>after the flesh. The works of the flesh</hi> (saith the Apostle to <hi>Gal</hi> 5.19.) <hi>are manifest,</hi> and indeed they are manifest, because written in great letters on the out-side of many in the visible Church, that who runs may read them: do but read that Catalogue in <hi>Paul,</hi> and then come and see them in Congregations. It is not so doubtful and subtile a matter, to know that many are yet without the verge of Christ Jesus, without the City of refuge, you may see their mark on their brow. Is not drunkenness, which is so frequent, a palpable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this? your envyings, revilings, wrath, strife, seditions, fornications, and such like: Oh, do not deceive your selves! there is no room in Jesus Christ, for such impurities and impieties. There is no toleration of sin within this City and Kingdom; <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> are indeed pardoned, yea, received and accepted; drunkards, unclean persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not excluded from entering here, but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59468:28"/>
they must renounce these lusts, if they would stay here; Christ will not keep both, he must either cast out the sin, or the sinner with it, if he will not part with it. I beseech you, know what ye walk after; the flesh is your leader, and whither will it lead you? (O! its sad to think on it,) to perdition: <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die.</hi> Ye think <hi>flesh</hi> your great friend, ye do all ye can to satifie and please it; and, O how pleasant is the satisfaction of your flesh to you? Ye think it liberty to follow it, and counts it bonds and cords to be restrained: But, Oh! know and consider, that flesh will lead you by the Kingdom; that guide of your way, to which ye committed your self, will lead you by Heaven, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21. Its a blind guide; corruption, and humour, and will, have no eyes, no discerning of that pit of eternal misery: they choose the way that is best pathed and troden, that is easiest, and most walk into; and this certainly will lead you straight into this pit of darkness. Be called off this way, from following your blind lusts, and rather suffer them to be crucified; be avenged on them for your two eyes that they have put out, and their treacherous dealing to you, in leading you to destruction the high way. Come in to Christ Jesus, and ye shall get a new guide of the way, <hi>the Spirit, that shall lead you in all truth,</hi> unto the blessed and eternal life. Christ is the <hi>way</hi> ye must walk in, and the <hi>life</hi> that we must go in to at the end of our way, and the <hi>truth</hi> according to which we must walk; now he hath given his Spirit the Comforter to be our leader in this way, according to this rule and pattern, unto that life: In a word, the Spirit shall lead you the straight way, unto Christ; you shall begin in him, and end in him; he shall lead you from grace, to glory; the Spirit that came down from Heaven, shall lead you back to Heaven: All your walk is within the compass of Christ, out of him is no way to Heaven.</p>
               <p>But we must not take this so grosly, as if no other thing were a walking after the flesh, but the gross abominations among men, though even these will scrape a great number from being in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus; but it must be further enlarged, to the motions &amp; affections of the unrenewed spirit, and the common principles according to which men walk. And therefore the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3 and <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. nameth many things among the works of the flesh, and members of the old man, which I doubt, many will account so of: Some natural passions that we account nothing of, because common, as anger, wrath, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;

what man is there amongst us, in whom some of these men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned stirs not? Many of your hearts and eyes are given to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness; your souls bow downward as your bodies do, and many times before your bodies. Is not the heart of men upon this world, and cannot rise above to a treasure in Heaven? and therefore your Callings, otherwayes lawful, and all your pains and endeavours in them, hath this seal of the flesh stamped on them, and passeth no otherwayes with God. We see how rank the corruptions of men are, anger domineering in them, and leading them often captive; and this is counted a light matter, but it is not so in Scripture: How often is it branded with folly, by the wise man? and this folly is even the natural fleshly corruption that men are born with; and in how many doth it rise up to the elevation of malice and hatred of others? and then it carries the image of the devil, rather then of humane infirmity. And if we suppose a man not much given to any of these, yet what a spirt of pride and self-love is in every man, even these that carry the lowest sail, and the meanest port among men: these that are affable and courteous, and these that seem most condescending to inferiours, and equals, yet alas! this evil is more deeply engraven on the spirt. If a man could but watch over his heart, and observe all the secret reflections of it, all the comparisons it makes, all the desires of applause and favour among men, all the surmises and stirrings of spirit upon any affront, O how would they discover diabolick pride? This sin is the more natural &amp; inbred, for that it is our mother-sin, that brought us down from our excellency; this weed grows upon a glass-window, and upon a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, it lodges in Palaces and Cottages: nay, it will spring and grow out of a pretended humility, and low carriage. In a word, the ambitious designs of men, the large appetite of earthly things, the over-weaning conceit of our selves, &amp; love to our selves, the flir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our affections, without observing a rule, upon unlawful objects, or in an unlawful manner, all these are common to men, and men walk after them. Every man hath some predominant or idol, that takes him most up; some are finer and subtiler than others, some their pleasures and gains without, others their own gifts and parts, within; but both are alike odious before God, and both gross <hi>flesh</hi> and corruption before him.</p>
               <p>There are two errours among men, concerning this spiritual walking, the one is the Doctrine of some in these dayes, the other is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59468:29"/>
error of many of us. Many pretending to some near and high dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, as to Christ, and the Spirit, have fallen upon the most refined and spiritualized <hi>flesh,</hi> instead of the Spirit indeed; they separate the Spirit from the Word, and reckons the Word and Law of God, <hi>which was a Lamp to</hi> Davids <hi>feet,</hi> among the <hi>fleshly rudiments of the world.</hi> But if they speak not <hi>according to the Law and Testimony,</hi> (saith <hi>Isaiah</hi>) it is <hi>because there is no light in them</hi>: Thus their new light is but an old darkness, that could not endure even the darker light of the Prophets. If they speak not according to the Word, it is because there is no spirit in them. It is not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Comforter, which Christ promised to send to the Apostles, and <hi>all that should believe in his Name through their word</hi>? for that Spirit was <hi>a Spirit of truth, that should lead into all truth</hi>: and lest men should father their own fancies and imaginations on the Spirit of God, Christ adds, <hi>he shall bring all things to your remembrance</hi>: These things that Christ hath spoken, and we have here written. The holy Apostle to the <hi>Col.</hi> 3. when he reproves the works of the flesh, and declares they had put them off, he commends unto them, in opposition to these, <hi>Let the word of Christ dwell in your richly in all wisdom, teaching one another in Psalms and spiritual songs, with grace in your hearts to the Lord,</hi> ver. 16. Here the Spirit, not casting out the <hi>Word,</hi> but bringing it in plentifully, and sweetly agreeing with it. The Spirit that Christ sent, did not put men above Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but above corruptions, and the body of death in them: Its a poor and easie victory to subdue Grace and Ordinances, every slave of the Devil doth that: I fear, as men and Angels fell from their own dignity, by aspiring higher, so these that will not be content with the estate of Christ and his Apostles, but soar up in a higher strain of spirit, and trample on that ministration, as fleshly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, I fear they fall from Jesus Christ, and come into greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Its true indeed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>The Letter killeth,</hi> that is, the Covenant of Works preacheth now nothing but condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to men, but the Spirit of the Gospel giveth life; nay, even the Gospel separated from <hi>the Spirit of life</hi> in Jesus, is <hi>but a savour of death</hi> to souls. Shall we therefore separate the Spirit from the Gospel and Word, because the Word alone cannot quicken us? <hi>David</hi> knew how to reconcile this, <hi>Quicken me, O Lord, according to thy Word,</hi> Psal. 119.25. <hi>Thy Spirit is good, lead me into the land of uprightness, and quicken me,</hi> Psal. 143.10, 11. The Word was his

rule, and the Spirit applyed his soul to the rule: the Word holds out the present patte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n we should be conformed unto; now if there be no more, a man may look all his dayes on it, and yet not be changed, but the Spirit within, transforms and changes a mans soul to more and more conformity to that pattern, by beholding it. If a man shall shut his eyes on the pattern, he cannot know what he is, and ought to be; if he look only on the Spirits work within, and make that his rule, he takes an imperfect rule, and an incompleat copy; and yet this is the highest attainment of these aspirers to new light; they have forsaken the Word as their rule, and instead of it, have another Law within them, as much as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready written on their hearts, which is in substance this (as they suppose) I am bound to do no more then I have already power to do; I am not to endeavour more holiness then I have already. These men are indeed perfect here in their own apprehension; and do not know in part, and believe in part, and obey in part, because they are advanced the length of their own Law and rule, their rule being of no perfection. <hi>Paul</hi> was not so, but forgetting what he had attained, he followed on to what was before him, and was still reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward. Let not us, my brethren, believe every spirit, and every doctrine that comes out under that name; Christ hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned us. Let us pray for more of that Spirit, which may quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Word to us, and quicken us to obey the Word; there must be a mutual enlivening, the Word must be made the ministration of life, by the Spirit of Jesus, which can use it <hi>as a sword, to divide the soul and spirit</hi>; and we must be quickned to the obedience of the truth in the Word. The Word is the seed incorruptible; but it cannot beget us, or be a principle of a new life within us, except a living spirit come alongs to our hearts. Know that the Word is your pattern and rule; the Spirit your leader and helper, whose vertue and power must conform you that rule, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> joyns these two, the purification and cleansing of the soul, which Christ attributes to the Word, <hi>ye are clean through the word I have spoken,</hi> Joh. 15.3. <hi>Peter</hi> attributes it to the Spirit working accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the pattern of truth. Its true, the Spirit of God needs no pattern to look to; nay, but we must have it, and eye it, else we know not the Spirit of truth from a lie and delusion; we cannot try the spirits but by this rule, and it is by making us stedfastly look on this glorious pattern in the Word, and the example of Christ Jesus
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59468:30"/>
his life, that we are conformed unto Christ, <hi>as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. Certainly that must be fleshly walking, which is rather conformed unto the imaginations of a mans own heart, then the blessed will of God revealed in his Word. Can such walking please God, when a man will not so much as hearken to what is Gods will and pleasure? As other heresies, so especially <hi>this,</hi> is a work of the flesh.</p>
               <p>Now there is another principle amongst many of us, we account it spiritual walking, to be separated from the gross pollutions of the world; to have a carriage blameless before men: this is the notion that the multitude fancy of it. Be not deceived, you may pass the censure of all men, and be unreproveable among them, and yet be but walkers after the flesh. It is not what ye are before the world can prove you spiritual men, though it may prove many of your carnal. Your out-side may demonstrate of many of you, that ye walk after the flesh; and if ye will not believe it, I ask you, if ye think drunkenness, a walking in the Spirit? Do ye think ye are following the Spirit of God, in uncleanness? Is it not that Holy Spirit that purgeth from all filthiness? Look but what your walk is, ye that are not so much as conformed to the Letter of the Word in any thing; who cares not to read the Scriptures, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on them: Is this walking after the Spirit of truth? If drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, railing, contention, wrath, envy, covetousness, and such like, be the Spirits way, then I confess, many of you walks after the Spirit; but if these be the manifest works of the flesh, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly your way and work, then why dream ye that ye are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians?</p>
               <p>But I suppose, that you could be charged with none of these outward things, that you had a form of Religion, and Godliness, yet I say, all that is visible before men, cannot prove you to be spiritual walkers. Remember, it is a spirit ye must walk after; now, what shall be the chief agent here? sure, not the body, what fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship can your body have with him that is a Spirit? the body indeed may worship that eternal Spirit, being acted by the Spirit, but I say, that alone can never prove you to be Christians, we must then layaside a number of Professors, who have no other ground of confidence but such things as may be seen of men &amp; if they would enter their hearts, how many vain thoughts lodge there? how litle of God is there? God is not almost in all our thoughts, we give a morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59468:30"/>
salutation, but there is no more of God, all the day through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and is this walking <hi>after the Spirit,</hi> which imports a constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? And what part can be spared most, but the spirit of a man? The body is distracted with other necessary things, but we might alwayes spare our souls to God. Now, thus should a man obey that command, <hi>Pray alwayes,</hi> its impossible that he should do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but pray in an express formal way, but the souls walking with God, between times of Prayer, should compense that, and thus Prayer is continued, though not in it self, yet in meditation on God, which hath in it the seed of all worship, and is virtually Prayer and Thanksgiving, and all duties.</p>
               <p>Let us then consider, If our bodies be not more exercised in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion then our souls, yea, if they be not the chief agents, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impertinencies, and roveries, and wandrings, are throughout the day? the most part of our conversation, if it be not profane, yet it is vain, that is unprofitable in the World, it neither advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageth us spiritually, nor glorifies God, it is almost to no purpose and this is enough to make it all <hi>flesh.</hi> And for our thoughts, how do they go unlimited and unrestrained? like a wilde Ass, traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her wayes, and gadding about, fixed on nothing, at least not on God; nay, fixed on any thing but God. If it be spiritual ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, should it not carry the seal of our spirit and affection on it? We are as so many shadows walking, as pictures and statues of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, without the soul and life, which consists in the temper and disposition of the spirit and soul towards God.</p>

thing, and cannot make you to conceive it in the living notion of it as it is. Only we may say in general, It is certainly a divine thing, and another thing then our common or religious walk is. It is little experience, so we can know the less of it; but this much we should know, it is another thing then we have attained, its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us, and yet such a thing as we are called to aspire unto. How should it stir up in our spirits a holy fire of ambition to be at such a thing, when we hear it is a thing attainable; nay, when Christ calls us unto himself, that we may thus walk with him: I would have Christians, men of great and big projects and resolutions, of high and illimited desires, not satisfied with their attainments, but still aspiring unto more of God, more conformity to his will, more walking <hi>after the Spirit,</hi> more separation from the course of the World, and this is indeed to be of a divine spirit. The divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is here, as it were, in a state of violence, out of its own ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Now, its known by this, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We desire to speak a word of these three. 1. The nature of this spiritual walking; Next, Its connexion and union with that blessed state of non-condemnation; And then, of the order of this, how it flows from a mans being implanted in Christ Jesus: Which three, are considerable in the words.</p>
               <p>This spiritual walking is according to a spiritual rule, from spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual principles, for spiritual ends. These three being established aright, the walk is even the motion of a Christian within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of these, it is according to the word, as the holy rule, its from the faith &amp; love of Jesus Christ, as the predominant principle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Nay, from the Spirit of Jesus living in the heart by faith, and dwelling in it by love, as the first wheel of this motion, the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi>; and as it begins in the Spirit, so it ends there, in the glory of Jesus Christ, and our heavenly Father: Consider this then, it is not a lawless walking, and irregular walk, it is according to the rule, and the rule is perfect, and it is a motion to perfection, not a rest in what is now attained to. The course of this world is the way and rule of the children of disobedience, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. There is a spirit indeed that works in them, and a rule it works by; the spirit is that evil spirit, contrary to the holy Spirit of God, &amp; you may know what spirit it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59468:31"/>
is that works, by the way it leads men unto; a broad way, path'd and troden in by many travellers, its the Kings high street, the common way that most part walkes into, according as their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours do, as the most do. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat King is the Prince of this World, satan who blinds the eyes of many, that they may not see that pit of misery before them, which their way leads them to. A Christian must have a kind of singularity, not in opinion, but in practice rather, to be more holy, and walk more abstracted from the dregs of the worlds pollution, this were a divine singularity. Indeed men may suspect themselves, that separats from the godly in opinion, they have reason to be more jealous of themselves, when they offend against the generation of the just; but if this were the contention and design of men, to be very unlike the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men, nay, to be very unlike the multitude of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, in the affection and practice of holiness, humility, and spiritual walking, I think this were an allowed way, though a singular way. Men may aspire to as great a difference as may be, from the conversations and practice of others, if there be a tending to more conformity to the Word, the rule of all practice. <hi>The Law is spiritual and holy,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, but I am carnal</hi>; this therefore, were spiritual walking, to set that excellent spiritual rule before our eyes, that we who are carnal, may be transformed and changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to more likeness to that holy and spiritual Law. If a man had not an imperfect rule of his own fancy, and imagination before his eyes, he could not be satisfied with his attainments, but with <hi>Paul,</hi> would forget them, in a manner, not know them, but reach forward still to what is before, because so much length would be before us, as would swallow up all our progress, this would keep the motion on foot, and make it constant: A man should never say, <hi>Master, let us make tabernacles, its good to be here</hi>; no indeed, the dwelling place and resting would be seen to be above. As long as a man had so much of his journey to accomplish, he would not sit down on in his advancement, he would not compare with others, and exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self above others, Why? because there is still a far greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between him and his rule, then between the slowest walker and him. This made <hi>Paul</hi> more sensible of a <hi>body of death,</hi> Rom. 7 then readily lower Christians are Reflections on our attainments and comparisons with others, which are so often the work of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, are a retrograde motion, it makes no way, but spends the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59468:32"/>
time, is a returning as we go, whereas we ought to go straight forward. I beseech you, Christians, consider what ye are doing, if ye would prove your selves so indeed. I know not how you can evidence it better, then by honouring and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming his Word and Commandments exceeding large and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, no end of their perfection; the word is much undervalued in the opinions of many, but it is as little cared for in the practice of most; there is certainly little of God there, where this is not magnified and honoured. There must be darkness in that way, where this candle which was <hi>a lamp to Davids feet,</hi> shines not. Some promise to us liberty, but they themselves are the servants of corruption; it is no liberty to be above all law and rule: It was innocent <hi>Adams</hi> liberty to be conformed to a holy and just command, nay, this was his beauty: The Spirit indeed gives liberty where he is, but this liberty is from our sins and corruptions, not to them, it looses the chains of a mans own corrupt lusts off him, to walk at freedom in the way of his commandments, the Spirit inlargeth the prisoners heart, and then he runs, but not at random, but <hi>the way of his commands,</hi> Psal. 119.32. It was our bondage to be as wilde Asses, traversing our wayes, to be gadding abroad, to change our way. Now, here is the Spirits liberty, to bring us into the way, and that way is one. Let us then learn this one principle, the Word must be the rule of your walking, both common and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. Alas, its not spiritual walking, to confine Religion to some solemn duties: Remember, its a walk, a continued thing, without interruption, therefore, your whole conversation ought to be as so many steps progressive to Heaven, Your motion, should not be to begin only when ye come to pray, or read, or hear, as many men do, they are in a quite different way and element, when they step out of their civil callings, into religious ordinances, but Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, your motion should be continued in your eating and drinking, and sleeping, and acting in your callings, that when ye come to pray, or read, ye may be but stepping forward in the way, out of one darker obscurer path, into a more beaten way. Remember, this word can make us perfect to Salvation. It is a principle in the hearts of folks, which is vented now by many, that the Word doth not reach their particular carriages, and conversations, in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil matters, these are apprehended to be without the sphear and compass of the Word, while it is commonly cast up to Ministers,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59468:32"/>
meddle with the word, and spiritual things, and not with our matters. Truly I think, if we separate these from the Word, we may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly separat all Religion from such actions; and if such actings and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses be without the Court of the Word, they are also without the Court of Conscience; Conscience, Religion, and the Word, being commensurable. Therefore I beseech every one of you, take the Word for the ruling of your callings and conversations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, extend it to all your actions, that in all those ye may act as Christians, as well as men. It is certainly the licentiousness of the spirits of men, that cannot endure the application of the Word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their particular actions and conversations.</p>
               <p>Now this spiritual walk proceeds from spiritual principles: It is certain, the Spirit of Jesus Christ is he <hi>in whom we live, and move, and have our being</hi> spiritually, without him we can do nothing; and therefore Christians ought to walk with such a subordination to, and dependence on him, as if they were meer instruments, and patients under his hand; though I think in regard of endeavoured activity they should bestir themselves, and give all diligence, as if they acted independently of the Spirit: yet in regard of denial of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and dependence on the Spirit, each one ought to act, as if he did not act at all, but the Spirit only acted in him. This is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of <hi>Paul, I laboured more abundantly then they all, yet not I, but grace in me. I live, yet not I, but Christ in me.</hi> O how difficult a thing is it to reconcile these two in the practice of Christians, which yet cannot really be, except they be together? It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly one of the great mysteries of Christianity, to draw our strength and activity from another, to look upon our selves, and our actings, as these that can do nothing, as empty vines; and that notwithstanding of all in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whatever we ought to do, in judging and discerning of our condition, yet sure I am, Christians in the exercise and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of godliness, should look upon themselves void of any principle in themselves, either to do or think, <hi>not that we are sufficient of of our selves:</hi> The proficient and growing Christian, should look no mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59468:33"/>
Grace and Religion a kind of Art and Discipline, that use and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience makes expert into. Learn now this one thing, which would be in stead of many rules and doctrines to us, to shut out of your eyes the consideration of what ye are by Gifts or Grace, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: Do not consider that, but rather fix your eyes on the grace of Jesus Christ, and upon the power and vertue of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is given by promise; that when the way is all the easiest to you, both by delight and custom, yet ye may find it to your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principles as insuperable, as at the beginning; and may still cry, <hi>Draw me, and I will run after thee; lead me, and I will walk with thee.</hi> Do not measure thy call into duties, by the strength thou finds in thy self, but look unto him who strengtheneth us with all might. Now the Spirit worketh in us by subordinat spiritual principles, as believing in Christ, and loving of him, as our Lord and Saviour; and these two acts drives on a soul sweetly in the way of obedience. Fear, where not mixt in its actings with faith and love, is a spirit of bondage; but the Christian ought to walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Spirit of Adoption, which cryes, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> Yet how many Christians are rather in a servile and slavish manner dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on by terrours and chastisements to their duty, then by love: There is a piece of liberty in Christian-walking, when there is not a restraint upon the spirit, by this slavish fear; this, I say, is not beseeming these that are in Christ Jesus; ye ought to have the Spirit of your Father for your leader and guide. O! how sweet, and how certain and necessary also, would this walking be? The love of Christ would be an inward principle of motion, and would make our spiritual actings as easie and pleasant, as natural motions are. Fear is but a violent principle, that is like the impulse of a stone thrown upward, as long as that external impression remains, it moves, but still slower and slower, and at length evanisheth: But if ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him, and your hearts were engaged to love him, O! how would it be a pleasant and native thing to walk in his way, as a stone goeth downward. Consider your principles, that acts you to matters and duties of Religion: Many men there be, in whom appears no difference of their work to beholders; but, O! how wide a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence doth God discern in them? Ingines and artifice may make dead and lifeless things move and walk as orderly as things that have life. But the principle of this motion, makes a huge difference; the one is moved from without, the other from it self. The most
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59468:33"/>
part of us act as irrational and bruit beasts in Religion; nay, we walk as inanimat and senseless creatures: Its some one or other consideration without us, moves us. Custome, censure, education, and such like: Ah! these are the principles of our Religion. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would have no Religion, no form of it? if they were not among such company? and therefore we see many change it, according to companies, as the fish doth its skin, according to the colour of that which is nearest it.

                  </gap>ear of men, that constrained us. But, my brethren, let it not be so among you, you <hi>who are in Christ Iesus,</hi> let this be the predominant in your hearts to constrain you, not to live to your selves, but unto God, even this, that ye believe <hi>Christ hath died for sinners, that they might live from sin</hi>; and from this let your hearts be inflamed with his love, that it may carry you on in a sweet and blessed necessity to walk in all well pleasing: Let the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his love lay on a constraint, but a constraint of willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to live to him who hath thus loved you. But as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is spiritual, so must the end be; and I think these two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the mystery of the practice of Christianity, to act from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principle unto another end; even as these two make up the mystery o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and the end of them, which is proper to God. As the fall hath cut off the subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the soul to God in its actions, that it cannot now derive all from that blessed fountain of all-being, and well-being, so is this chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of reference of all our actions to God stopped, that they do not tend unto him, as they are not derived from him, and thus they return unto a mans self again. There is one point of <hi>self,</hi> and making it our aim and design, which possibly many doth not take heed unto. It is ordinary for us to act and walk in Christian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for our salvation, for obtaining of life eternal, as our chief and only end, which is but an inferiour end; because we ought not to walk mainly for life, but to life; we should not walk after the command, only, for Heaven, but in the way of it unto Heaven. Our spiritual walking can never purchase us right unto the lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

mercies; when we have done all, this should be our souls language, <hi>we are unprofitable servants,</hi> our <hi>righteousness extends not to thee. What gain is it to the Almighty that thou art righteous?</hi> Yet for the most part, we make our walking as a hire for the reward. The Covenant of Works, doing for life, is some way naturally imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our hearts, and we cannot do, but we would live in doing; we cannot walk unto all well-pleasing, but we would also walk unto pacifying of God. Self-righteousness is mens great idol, which when all other baser and grosser idols are down, they do still seek to establish. But Christians, observe this evil in your selves, and suffer this mystery of godliness to be wrought in you, the abasing of your selves, the denyal of your selves. I would have you, in respect of diligence and earnestness, doing, walking, and running, as if ye were to be saved by it only: But again, you must deny all that, and no more consider it, or lean weight upon it, then if ye ought to do nothing, or did nothing. But your ends should be more divine and high, as your nature is, <hi>to glorifie God in your mortal bodies, since ye are hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and bought with a price.</hi> O how ought ye not to be your own? The great purpose of your obedience should be, a declaration of your sense of his love, and of your obligation to him: Ye ought to walk in his way, because ye are escaped condemnation, and saved by him, and not that ye may be saved only. It is the glory of our Heavenly Father, and the honour of the Redeemer, for Christians to walk, even as he walked, and follow his footsteps; it commends the grace of Jesus Christ exceedingly. Therefore this cannot but be the choise and delight of a believing soul, to walk unto all well-pleasing, to have the glory of him as their great design to aim at; who for our salvation laid aside his glory, and embraced shame and reproach. We use to walk in obedience to God, that we may pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie God for our disobedience: but let a Christian abhor such a thought, Christs blood must pacifie, but the walking of his child pleaseth him in his welbeloved Son. When he is once pacified for sin, when he once accepts your persons, your performances are his delight: Now this should be the great scope of a soul, that all its powers should be fixed on, to please him, and live to him.</p>
               <p>Now these three being established, we must conceive that the chief agent and party in this walking must be spiritual; therefore mens bodies are not capable of this walk after the Spirit principally. Outward Ordinances are but the shell wherein the kirnel must be

inclosed; all our walkings that is visible to men, is but like a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or engraven Image and Statue, that hath no breath or life in it, unless the Spirit actuat and quicken the same. I say not only the Spirit of God, but the spirit and soul in man; for the Spirits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat and divine operations are upon such a suitable subject, as the immortal soul. <hi>Verily, there is a spirit in man, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the Almighty gives him understanding</hi>: We must not abolish the outward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A man is composed of a spirit and a body, acted and quickned by that spirit, without either of these, he is not a compleat man: So I say, he is not a Christian, that doth not worship God in the spirit, and in truth both; and it is not Religion that excludes either the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward soul-communion with God, or the outward ordinance, and appointment of God. But alace, this may be our complaint, we come and worship God, and <hi>drawes nigh with our bodies, but our hearts are far removed.</hi> Here is the death of many's worship, the soul is separated from the body of it, there are but pictures and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Christians; we have mouths and faces of Saints, but O! how little of divine-affection, or of soul-desires, breaths in us? We are denyers of the <hi>power of godliness,</hi> by resting in a form, and this is the great sin of this generation, the essentials, the vital-spirits of Christianity, are exhausted, and some dry bones, like an Anatomy of a Christian, remains behind.

               <p>IT is one of the greatest mysteries in a Christians practice, to joyn these two together, which the Gospel hath conjoined, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and sanctification, and to place them in their due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: There is much miscarrying in both these, either they are sep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith in Christ, for remission of sin, and righteousnesse, and not not only to joyn it, but also, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it from that principle: There is both an union between these, and an order established in Scripture. The most part of these that professe the Gospel, are of two sorts; they do either divide holinesse from imputed righteousnesse, or Christs righteousnesse from holinesse: I do not say, that any man truly seeks to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the righteousnesse of Jesus Christ, and to have his sins freely pardoned, but he will also study to walk before God, in all well-pleasing; but the truth is, many do pretend, and profess to seek salvation, and forgivenness in Christs blood, and have the mercy of God, and merits of Christ, alwayes in their mouth, who yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by their conversation, that they do not so much as desire, or purpose to seek after holinesse: I do not speak of these who are Antinomians in profession, but of a great multitude in the visible Church, who are more really Antinomians, to wit in practice, then most part of professed Antinomians. You hear all, of free grace, and free redemption in Jesus Christ, of tender, and induring mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in God, and this you take for the whole Gospel; and presently upon the notion of mercy and grace, you conclude unto your selves, not only immunity, and freedom from all the threatnings of the Word, and from hell, but likewise ye proclaim secretly in your own hearts, a liberty to sin so much the more securely; the door of mercy cast open in the Gospel, and the free accesse to Christ, manifested therein, through the corruption that is within

us, proves the very occasion of many's giving indulgence to their lusts; of delaying reformation, and turning to God. You all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that you seek to be justified, and saved by Jesus Christ; yea, you perswade your selves, to be escaped condemnation, by Christ: Now then, conjoyn that profession, and perswasion, with your walk, and O! how contrary you may find them to one another? your saith is vain, <hi>for ye are yet in your sins. Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The grace of God appearing to some men</hi> effectually, <hi>teacheth them to deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and to live righteously, soberly, and godly</hi> &amp;c. But if we may conjecture your teaching by your walking, it seems the notion of grace, and the Gospel that is formed in your minds, hath taught you another doctrine, to a vow <hi>ungodliness,</hi> and follow <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lusts.</hi> Is there so much as a shadow of this spiritual walking in many? I confesse, it is natural for every man to seek his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse; and it is the arm of God that must bow men, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Christs imputed righteousnesse; yet, the most part of men, seem to be so far from seeking any righteousnesse, that they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seeking the fulfilling of their own carnal lusts, <hi>working wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with greediness,</hi> not caring how little they have to put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence into; and yet, certain it is, that how much forever, a man attains to, of a form of Religion, or civil honesty, he is ready to put his trust in it, and to lean the weight of his soul upon it: But sei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, seing ye have it naturally engraven in your hearts, to establish your own righteousnesse, that ye labour not to have more of it to fill your eye withall.</p>
               <p>But again, on the other hand, there are some men, who have a form of Religion, and labour to be of a blamelesse conversation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, that possibly perswades themselves, they are seeking ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and walking spiritually; but alace, you may find it but a painted and seeming Religion, that is an abomination in the sight of God; because it is to them, all the ground of their acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before God. If ever this question was moved in some of you, <hi>What shall I do to be saved?</hi> You have condescended on such a walk, such a profession, for the answer of it; It is natural to all, even these who have least apperance of godlinesse: to seek heaven, by

doing Gods will; these that have no more to speak of, then their Baptism, or receiving the Lords Supper, or attending well the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn assemblies, will ground their hope of salvation on those things,: How much more, will civil and honest men (commonly so called) who pray, and read, and professe godlinesse, how much more, I say, will they establish that which they attain to, as the ground of their confidence before God? Now, this is a general, unknown ill that destroys the world, and yet few are convinced of it, how hard it is to be driven out of our selves, and to seek life in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. O! know, that it is in a manner, the crucifying of a mans self, thus to deny himself, to have a sort of righteousness, and not to trust in it. Who is he, that cannot indure to look upon himself, for moral vilenesse? Alace, men flatter themselves in their own eyes, looks with a more favourable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But who shall be found to abhore himself, for his most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and best actions? Who casts these out of their sight, as unclean and menstruous things? Therefore, I say, though thy righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse were equal to, or exceeded any Pharisees righteousnesse, thou cannot enter into heaven: The poor Publicane, that was a vile and profane sinner, yet his righteousnesse exceeded the Pharisees, though he had none of his own, yet he had a righteousnesse without blemish, of Christs purchasing, having by saith fled to the mercy of God, in, and through a Mediator. It is not more doing, more praying, more exact walking, that can make you more righteous in Gods account, in order to absolution from Law-condemnation, then the prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, God is said to dwell in the heart of the humble and contrite one, not for the worth of his humility, and repentance; No, no, but for the pleasure he hath in the well-beloveds righteousnesse; that is the beautiful garment, only in the eye of a humbled soul, that seeth nothing in it self desirable.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I wish, that this conjunction which is made in the Gospel, were also engraven in your hearts, and on your practices, that is, that you would <hi>seek after ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> though ye were to be thereby justified, seek it with that diligence and earnest study, as if ye were to be saved by it, and yet seek it, so as to be denyed to your diligence, or as if ye sought it not at all. How sweet a conjunction were this in the Christians practice, to walk and run so after the prize, as if his walking did obtain it, and yet to look upon his walking, as if it were not at all. Your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and seriousnesse in godlinesse should be upon the growing hand, as if doing did save you; yet you ought to deny all that, and look to the righteousnesse of another, as if nothing were done at all by you. How doth <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3.8. unite these in his practice, <hi>I count all losse and dung, to be found in Christ, not having my own righteousn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One of these two is the Original of many stumblings and wandrings in our Christian-way, either there is not a necessity and constraint laid upon the souls of many to walk in all well-pleasing, and to <hi>perfect holiness in the fear of God</hi>: We look on it as a thing indifferent, that is to be determined according to the measure of our receivings from God, or we look on it as a thing not urging all, but belonging to Ministers, or more eminent Professors, and hence there ariseth much carnal liberty, in walking without the line of Christian-liberty, because there is an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the spirit that gives that latitude in walking; or else there is not that following o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> holinesse in such a way, as can consist with the establishing of Christs righteousness. No denial of our selves, in our actions, we act as if we were sufficient of our selves and walks a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And by this means, the Lord is provoked, because we do not honour the Son, the Father counts himself despised, and the spirit is grieved and tempted to depart, and leave us to our own imaginations, till our idol which we esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, fall down, and our understanding return to us.</p>
               <p>As it would be of great moment to the peace of Christians, and increase of holinesse, to have that union of Justification and Sanctification stamped on their hearts, so especially to have the due and Evangelick-method and order of these impressed on their consciences, it would conduce exceedingly, both to their qucken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comforting: As there is nothing, that either so deadens or darkens, and saddens the spirits of the Godly, as darknesse in

this particular; the ignorance and mistake of the method and order of that well-ordered Covenant must certainly be very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the life and consolation tendered by the Gospel. This spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual walking, it flowes from the believers state of non-condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christ; he is once in Jesus Christ, and then he walks after the Spirit of Christ.

These are not living principles, but when once a soul hath embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Christ Jesus within it, he becomes in a manner, a soul to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at and to quicken that soul, he animates it, and moves it in Gods wayes, according to the Covenant of Grace, <hi>I will put my Spirit in you, and cause you walk in my wayes</hi>; there is first quickening, and then walking, <hi>You who were dead in sins, hath he quickned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Christ,</hi> Eph. 2.1, 5. and then it follows in due order, <hi>I will cause you to walk in my wayes,</hi> Ezek. 36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27.

               <p>Now if this Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles were duly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and believed. O what a change would it make on the lives and spirits of Christians? since this is the order established in the Gospel, and an order suitable both to his grace and our necessity, (as all that is in it speaketh forth an excellent contriver) when we go about to establish our souls in another method, how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that we should not weary and vex our souls in vain? how can we choose but torment our selves, and intricat our selves still more? Our method and way is just contrary, we perplex our souls how to find the fruits of the Spirit of Christ, how to walk after the Spirit, without fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is made an argument by many, to keep them from believing in Christ, because they do not find that spiritual life stirring in them. How cross is this to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared mind of Christ in the Gospel? It cannot choose but both darken the spirit more, and dry up the influences of the Spirit of God, because it keeps thee from the fountain of all consolation

You may disquiet your souls by this means, but you shall never make advantage this way, without him <hi>ye can do nothing</hi>: and yet ye will not come to him, because you have done nothing. Its strange how little reason is in it, if your eyes were opened; you refuse or delay to abide in the vine, till you bring forth fruit, and fruit you cannot bring forth, till you be in the vine: you would walk, and you will not have the life from which you must walk. <hi>Paul</hi> lived indeed, but what a life? <hi>the life that I live is by the faith of the Son of God</hi>; faith in Christ transported him out of himself to Christ, or received Christ into the soul, and Christ in the soul, was the life of his soul, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. your walking is as if a dead man essay to go. <hi>Will one expect figs of thorns, or grapes of thistles?</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, know what wrong ye do to your selves, and to Christ; ye wrong your selves, because ye stand in the way of your own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ye stand a back from your life, him that is <hi>the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> You would walk in the way, but no man can walk in this way, but by this way; Christ must quicken you to walk in himself, ye must get life in him, and not bring it.

               <p>YOU know there are two principal things in the preceeding verse, the priviledge of a Christian, and the property or character of a Christian, he is one that never enters into condemnation, <hi>he that believeth shall not perish,</hi> Joh. 3.15. And then he is one <hi>that walks not after the flesh,</hi> though <hi>he be in the flesh,</hi> but in a more elevat way above men, after the guiding and leading of the Holy Spirit of God.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59468:41"/>
let us gather our spirits to the consideration of these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>As the first, all men are under the bondage of a twofold Law, <hi>the law of sin within them,</hi> and the law of death <hi>without them. Man was created righteous, but,</hi> saith the wise man, <hi>he found out many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions</hi>; a sad invention indeed, he found but misery and slavery to himself, who was made free and happy. His freedom and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness was to be in subjection to his Maker, under the just and holy commands of his Lord who had given him breath and being; it was no captivity, or restraint, to be compassed about with the hedges of the Lords holy Law, no more then it is a restraint on a mans li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to have his way hedged in, where he may safely walk, that he may keep himself within it, from pits and snares on every hand. But alace! (if we may say, alace! when we have such a redemption in Jesus Christ.) <hi>Adam</hi> was not content with that happiness, but seeking after more liberty, he <hi>sold himself into the hands of strange lords,</hi> first sin, and then death. <hi>Other lords besides thee, O Lord, have dominion over us,</hi> Isa. 26.13. This is too true in this sense, <hi>Adam</hi> seeking to be as the Lord himself, lost his own lordship and dominion over all the works of Gods hands, and became a servant to the basest and most abominable of all, even that which is most hateful to the Lord, to sin and death: And this is the condition we are now born into. Consider it, I pray you, we are born cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and slaves, the most noble, the most ingenuous, and the most free of us all: <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of it as a priviledge, to be born free, to be free in mans Common-wealth. It is counted a dignity to be a free Citizen or Burgess of a Town: Liberty is the great claim of people now a dayes, and indeed it is the great advantage of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to enjoy that mother, and womb-priviledge, and right. But, alace! what is all this to be free-born in a civil society? it is but the state of a man among men, it reaches no further then the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, his life or estate. But here is a matter of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, know ye what state your souls are in? your souls are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more worth than your bodies, as much as eternity surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth this inch of time, or immortality exceeds mortality; your souls are your selves indeed, your bodies are but your house, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle ye lodge into for a season: Now then, I beseech you ask whether ye be born free or not; if your souls be slaves, ye are slaves indeed, for so the Evangelist changeth these; <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, in

Be not deceived, you are servants of sin, and therefore not free. There are two sorts, or rather two ranks of persons, in Gods house, Sons, and slaves; the son abides in the house for ever, the slave but for a time; when the time expires, he must go out, or be cast out.

But as there is the justice of God in it, so there is a voluntary choice and election, which gives sin a power over us; we choose a strange lord, and he lords it over us: We say to our lusts, Come ye and rule over us, we submit our reason, our conscience and all, to the guidance and leading of our blind affections, and passions; we choose our bondage for liberty, and thus sin h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

6.16.19. <hi>we yield our members servants to iniquitie</hi>; a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or commodity, is the bait that ensnares us to this, we give up our selves, and joyn to our idols, and God ratifies it, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and passeth such a sentence, <hi>Let them alone,</hi> he sayes, <hi>go ye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one and serve your idols,</hi> Ezek. 23. since ye would not serve me, be doing, go serve your lusts, look if they be better masters then I; look what wages they will give you.</p>
               <p>Now, let us again consider what power sin hath, being thus cloathed with a sort of authority. O! but it is mighty, and works mightily in men. It reigns in our mortal bodies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. here is the throne of sin established, in the lusts and affections of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and from hence, it emits laws, and statutes, and sends out com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to the soul, and whole man. Man choose at first, to hearken to the counsel of his senses, that said, it was pleasant and good, to eat of the forbidden fruit; but that counsel is now turned into a command, sin hath gotten a scepter there, to rule over the spirit which was born a free Prince, sin hath conquered all our strength, or, we have given up unto it all our strength; any truth that is in the conscience, any knowledge of God, or Religion, all this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carcerated, detained in a prison of unrighteous affections: sin hath many strong holds and bulwarks in our flesh, and by these, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the whole spirit and soul in man, and leads captive every thought to the obedience of the flesh. You know how strong it was in holy <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. what a mighty battel and wrestling he had, and how near he was to fainting and giving over: How then must it have an absolute, and soveraign, full dominion over men in nature, there being no contrary principle within by nature to debate with it, it rules without much controlment; there may be many convictions of conscience, and sparkles of light against sin, but these are quickly extinguised and buried: Nay, all these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of light, and knowledge in the conscience, do oftentimes strengthen sin, as some things are confirmed, not weakned by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; unequal and saint opposition strengthens the adversary, as cold, compassing springs, makes them hotter: So it is here, sin takes occasion by the command, <hi>to work all manner of concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> Rom. 7.8. Without the Law, sin is in a manner dead, but when any adversary appears, when our lusts and humors are crossed, then they unite their strength against any such opposition, and brings forth more sinful sin. The knowledge and conscience that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59468:43"/>
many have, serves for nothing, but to make their sins greater, to exasperat and imbitter their spirits and lusts against God: <hi>why tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thou me before the time?</hi> Its a devilish disposition that is in us all, we cannot indure the light, <hi>because our deeds are evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us but consider these particulars, and we shall know the power and dominion of sin. First, Consider the extent of its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, both in regard of all men, and all in every man: I say, <hi>all men,</hi> there is none of us exempted from it; the most noble, and the most base. Sin is the Catholick king, the universal king, or rather satan, who is the prince of this world, and he rules the world by this law of sin, which is even the contradiction of the Law of God. Who of you believes this, that satans kindom is so spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious? that it is even over the most part in the visible Church; this is the Emperour of the world. The Turk vainly arrogats this title to himself, but the devil is truly so, and we have Gods own testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for it: All Kings, all Nobles, all Princes, all People, rich and poor, high and low, are once subjects of this prince, ruled by this black law of sin. Oh! know your condition, whose servants ye are; <hi>think not within your selves, we have Abraham for our father,</hi> we are baptized Christians: No, know, that all of us are once the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of satan, and do his works, and fulfil his will. But, moreover, <hi>all that is in us,</hi> is subject to this law of sin; all the faculties of the soul, the understanding is under the power of darkness, the affections under the power of corruption, the mind is blinded, and the heart is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, the soul alienated from God, who is its life, all the members and powers of a man yielded up as instruments of unrighteousnesse, every one to execute that wicked law, and fulfill the lusts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the flesh. This dominion is over all a mans actions, even those that are in best account, and esteem among men; your honest, upright dealing with men, your most religious performances to God, they are more conformed to the law of sin, then to the law of God, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.14. <hi>this nation, and the work of their hands, and that which they offer, is unclean.</hi> All your works, your good works, are infected with this pollution; sin hath defiled your persons, and they defile all your actions, the infection is mutual, these actions again defiles your persons still more: <hi>To the impure, all things are impure, even their mind and conscience is defiled,</hi> Tit. 1.15. Do what you can, ye who are in nature cannot please God, its but obedience to the law of sin that is in you.</p>
               <p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 2. Consider the intensness and force of this power, how mighty it is, in working against all oppositions whatsoever, unless it be overcome by Almighty power. Nothing but <hi>All-might</hi> can conquer this power: The spirit that works in men by nature, is of such activity and efficacy, that it drives men on furiously, as if they were possessed, to their own ruine. How much hath it of a mans consent? and so it drives him strongly and irresistibly. Much will, desire, and greediness, will make corruption run like a River, over all its Banks, set in the way thereof, Counsel, Perswasion, Law, Heaven, Hell, yet mens corruption must be over all those: Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Threatnings, Convictions of Conscience, are but as flaxen ropes to bind a <hi>Sampson,</hi> sin within easily breaks them. In a word, no created power is of sufficient vertue to bind the strong man, it must be one mightier then he, and that is the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Do ye not see men daily drawn after their lusts, as beasts, following their senses as violently <hi>as a horse rusheth to the battel?</hi> If there be any gain or advantage to oyl the wheels of affection, O how runs men head-long? there is no crying will hold them. In sum, sin is become all one with us; its incorporat into the man, and become one with his affections, and then these command.</p>

There are many secret heart-jealousies among us, that Christ is a hard Master, and cannot be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But would you know the true original of our apparent and threatned bondage? Come and see, come and consider something expressed in these words. All your thoughts are busied about civil liberty, but you do not consider that you are in bondage while you are free, and that to worse masters than you fear. We are under a law of sin and death, that hath the dominion and sway in all mens affections and conversations; and when the glorious liberty of the Sons of God is offered unto us in the Gospel, when the Son hath come to make us free, we love our own chains, and will not suffer them to be loosed: therefore it is that a Nation that hath despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such a gracious offer of peace and freedom in Jesus Christ, is robbed and spoiled of peace and freedom. When this Law of the Spirit of life in Christ is published and proclaimed openly unto Congregations, unto Judicatories, and unto persons, yet few do regard it; the generality are in bondage to a contrary law of sin, and this they serve in the lusts thereof. Yea, (which most of all aggravats and heightens the offence) even after we have all of us professed a subjection to the Law of God, and to Jesus Christ, the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Law-giver,</hi> we are in an extraordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now what became of all this work, you may know, the generality of all ranks have rebelled against that Lord, and Prince, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from his allegiance, and revolted unto the same lusts and wayes, these same courses against which we had both by our profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christianity, and solemn oaths engaged our selves; and so men have voluntarily and heartily subjected themselves unto the laws of sin, and desires of the flesh.

The man most ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized, most abstract from the grosser outward pollutions, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, his heart within is but a temple full of idols, to the love and service of which he is devoted.

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:59468:45"/>Oh! that you would take this for bondage, to be under this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful necessity of satisfying and <hi>fulfilling the desires of your flesh and mind,</hi> Eph. 2.2. many account it only liberty and freedom, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they look upon the laws of <hi>the spirit of life,</hi> as cords and bonds, and consult <hi>to cast them off,</hi> and <hi>cut them asunder</hi>; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what a wretched life you have with your imperious lusts. The truth is, sin is for the most part its own punishment; I am sure, you have more labour and toyl in fulfilling the lusts of sin, then you might have in serving God; mens lusts are never at qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, they are continually putting you on service, they are still dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and dragging men headlong, hurrying them to and fro, and they cannot get rest; what is the cause of all the disquiet, disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, confusion, trouble and wars in the world? <hi>from whence do contentions arise, come they not hence,</hi> (saith <hi>Iames</hi> 4.1.) <hi>even of the lusts that war in our members.</hi> It is these that trouble the world, and these are the troublers of <hi>Israels</hi> peace, these take away both inward peace, domestick peace, and national peace: These lusts, Covetousness, Ambition, Pride, Passion, Self-love, and such like; do set nation against nation, men and men, people and people by the ears. These multiply businesses beyond necessity; these multiply cares without profit, and so bring forth vexation and torment. If a man had his lusts subdued, and his affections composed unto moderation and sobriety, O what a multitude of noysom and hurtful cares should he then be freed from, what a sweet calmness should possess that spirit. Will you be perswaded of it, Beloved in the Lord, that it were easier to serve the Lord, then to serve your lusts, that they cost you more labour, disquiet, perplexity, and sorrow, than the Lords service will; that so you may weary of such masters, and groan to be from under such a law of sin.</p>
               <p>But, if that will not suffice to perswade you, then consider, in the next room, if you will needs serve a law of sin, you must needs be subject to a law of death; if you will not be perswaded to quite the service of sin, then tell me, what think you of your wages? <hi>The wages of sin is death,</hi> that you may certainly expect; and can you look and long for such wages? God hath joyned these toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by a perpetual ordinance, they come in the world together, <hi>sin entered, and death by sin,</hi> and they have gone hand in hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether since: and think you to dissolve what God hath joyned?

But O! what a dreadful life is it, worse then death, when men will chose death rather then life? O! how terrible will it be, to hear that word, <hi>Hills and mountains fall on us, and cover us.</hi> Men newly risen, their bodies and souls meet again, after a long separation, and this to be their mutual enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment one to another, the body to wish it were still in the dust, and the soul to desire it might never be in the body: Surely, if we had so much grace as to believe this, and tremble at it, before we be forced to act it, there were some hope; if we could perswade our selves once of this, that the wayes of sin, all of them, how pleasant, how profitable soever, whatsoever gain they bring in, whatsoever satisfaction they give, that they are nothing else, but <hi>the wayes of death, and goe down to the chambers of hell,</hi> that they will delude and deceive us, and so in end destroy us: If we might once believe this with our heart, there were some hope that we would break off from them, and choose the untroden paths of Godlinesse, which are pleasantnesse and peace. However, this is the condition of all men, once to be under sin, and under a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

These all, and these only, who finding-themselves <hi>dead in sins and trespasses,</hi> under the power and dominion of sin, and likewise under the sentence of death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, begin to lift up their heads, upon the hope of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and to look unto their Redeemer, as poor prisoners, whose eyes and looks are strong intreaties, and in stead of many requests; such as give an intire renounce unto their former wayes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing lusts, and give up themselves in testimony of their sense of his unspeakable favour of redemption, to be wholly his, and not their own.

But, sin hath first conquered mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by blinding it, putting out the eye of the understanding, and then invaded the affections of men, drawn them over to its side, and by these, it keeps all in a most willing obedience. Now, what hopes are there then of delivery, when the prisoner accounts his bondage liberty, and his prison a palace; what expectation of freedom, when all that is within us conspires to the upholding that tyrranous dominion of sin, against all that would cast it out of its usurpation, as if they were mortal enemies?</p>
               <p>Yet there is a delivery possible, but such as would not have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the heart of man to imagine, and it is here expressed, <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life,</hi> &amp;c. this declares how, and by what means we may be made free: Not indeed by any power within us, not by any created power without us, sin is stronger then all these, because its imperial seat is within, far without the reach of all created pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; there may be some means used by men, to beat it out of the out-works of the outward man, to chase it out of the external members; some means to restrain it from such gross out-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the spirit of the mind: Untill at length some other spirit strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then our spirit come; till the Spirit of life which is in Christ, come and bind the strong man, and so make the poor soul free. You heard that we were under a law of death, and under the power of sin; now there is another Law, answering this law, and a power to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this power. You may indeed ask, by what law of authority can a sinner that is bound over by Gods Justice, unto death and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be released? Is there any law above Gods Law, and the sentence of his Justice? The Apostle answers, that there is a Law above it, a Law after it, <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life.</hi> Jesus Christ opposes Law unto law, the Law of life unto the law of death; the Gospel unto the Law, the second Covenant unto the first. Thus it is then, <hi>Iesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, full of grace and truth,</hi> did come in mans stead, when the law and sentence of death was past upon all mankind, and there was no expectation from the terms of the first Covenant, that there should be any dispensation or mitigation of the rigour of it, he obtains this, that so many as God had chosen unto life, their sins and their punishment might be laid on him, and so he took part of our flesh, for this end, that he might be made a curse for us, and so redeem us from the curse: Thus having satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Justice, and fulfilled the sentence of death, by suffering death, <hi>him hath God exalted to be a Prince and Saviour,</hi> and <hi>the head of all things.</hi> In compensation of this great and weighty work given him by his Father, <hi>all judgment is committed to him,</hi> and so he sends out and proclaims another Law in Sion; another sentence, even of life and absolution unto all, and upon all them <hi>that shall believe in his Name.</hi> Thus you see the law of death abrogated by a new Law of life, because our Lord and Saviour was made under the law of death, and suffered under it, and satisfied it, that all his seed might be freed from it, and might come under a life-giving law; so that it appears to be true, that was said at first, <hi>there is no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them that are in Christ,</hi> there is no Law, no Justice against them.</p>
               <p>But then another difficulty as great as the former, is in the way, though such a law and sentence of life and absolution be pronounced in the Gospel, in Christs Name, yet we are <hi>dead in sins and trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> we neither know nor feel our misery, nor can we come to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: as there was a law of death above our head, so there is a law of sin within our hearts, which rules and commands us; and there
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59468:48"/>
is neither will nor ability to escape from under it. It is true, life and freedom is preached in Christ, to all that come to him for life, to all that renounce sins dominion, is remission of sin preached: But here is the greatest difficulty, how can a dead soul stir, rise, and walk? how can a slave to sin, and a willing captive renounce it, when he hath neither to will nor to do? Indeed if all had been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for us, if eternal life, and forgiveness of sins, had been brought near us, and all the business done to our con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So then, as Christ Jesus hath law and right on his side, to free us from death, so he hath vertue and power in him to accomplish our delivery from sin, as he hath fair law to loose the chains of condemnation, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal the sentence past against us, without prejudice to Gods justice, he having fully satisfied the same in our name; so he hath suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power given him, to loose the fetters o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he hath pay'd the price, and satisfied the Father, so that justice can crave nothing: Yet, he hath one adversary to deal with, Satan hath sinners bound with the cords of their own lusts, in a prison of darkness, and unbelief; Jesus Christ therefore comes out to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer this enemy, and to redeem his elect Ones, from that unjust usurpation of sin, to bring them out of the prison by the strong hand; and therefore, he is one mighty, and able to save to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost, he hath might to do it, as well as right to it.</p>
               <p>Consider then, my beloved, these two things, which are the breasts of our consolation, and the foundation of our hope; we are once lost and utterly undone, both in regard of Gods justice, and our own utter inability to help our selves, which is strengthned by our unwillingness, and thus made a more desperat busine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let us not be discouraged in our apprehensions of Christ, when we look on our ruinous and desperat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We do proclaim in the name of Jesus Christ, that there is no sinner, howsoever justly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a sentence of death and damnation, but they may in him find a relaxation from that sentence, and that without the impairing of Gods justice, and this is a marvelous ground of comfort, that may establish our souls, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. even this, that law and justice is upon Christs side, and nothing to accuse, or plead against a sinner, that imploys him for his Advocat. But, know this also, that you are not delivered from death, that you may live under sin; nay, you are redeemed from death, that you may be freed from the law of sin, but that must be done by his almighty Spirit, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwayes done.</p>
               <p>I know not whether of these is matter of greatest comfort, that there is in Christ, a redemption from the wrath of God, and from hell, and that there is a redemption too, from sin, and corruption which dwells within us; but sure I am, both of them will be most sweet and comfortable to a believer, and without both, Christ were not a compleat Redeemer, nor we compleatly redeemed.

There is too much of this, even among the children of God, a strange narrowness of spirit, which admits not whole and intire truth; it falls out often, that when we think of delivery from death and wrath, we forget in the mean time the end and purpose of that, which is, that we may be freed from sin, <hi>and serve the living God without fear.</hi> And if at any time we consider, and busie our thoughts about freedom from the law of sin, and victory over corruption; such is the scantness of room and capacity in our spirits, that we loss the remembrance of delivery from death, and condemnation, in Christ Jesus; thus we are tossed between two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, the quick-sands of presumption and wantonness, and the rocks of unbelief and despair, or discouragement, both of which, do kill the Christians life, and make all to fade and wither.

I would have you correcting your misapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Gospel: do not so much look on victory and freedom from sin, as a duty and task, though we be infinitly bound to it; but rather as a priviledge and dignity conferred upon us by Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Look not upon it, I say, only as your duty, as many do; and by this

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59468:51"/>
must be the chief of the works of God, the rarest piece of them all, <hi>God to become man,</hi> the Creator of all, to <hi>come in the likeness of a creature, he by whom all things were created,</hi> and <hi>do yet consist,</hi> to come in the likeness of the most wretched of all. Strange, that we do not dwell more, in our thoughts and affections, on this subject: either we do not believe it, or if we did, we could not but be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished with admiration at it. <hi>Iohn</hi> the beloved Disciple, who was often nearest unto Christ, dwelt most upon this, and made it the subject of his preaching; <hi>that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, and seen, and handled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1. He speaks of that mystery, as if he were imbracing Jesus Christ in his arms, and holding him out to others, saying, <hi>Come and see.</hi> This divine mystery is the subject of these words read, but the mystery is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unfolded and opened up to you in them, yet so, as it will not diminish, but increase the wonder of a believing soul. It is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that magnifies other mysteries, which vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There are three things then of special consideration in the words, which may declare and open unto you something of this mystery:</p>
               <p>Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ground and reason of Gods sending his Son, is, because there was an impossibility upon the Law, to save man, which impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was not the Laws fault, but mans defect, by reason of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and impotency of our flesh, to fulfill the Law. Now God having chosen come to life, and man having put this obstruction and impediment in his own way; which made it impossible for the Law to give him life, though it was first given out as the way of life, therefore that God should not fail in this glorious design of saving his chosen; he choosed to send his own Son, in the likeness of flesh, as the only remedy of the Laws impossibility. That which Christ being sent into the likeness of flesh, did, is, the condemning of sin in the flesh, by a sacrifice offered for sin; even the sacrifice of <hi>his own body upon the crosse.</hi> He came in the likeness not of flesh simply, for he was really a man; but <hi>in the likeness of sinful flesh,</hi> though

Sin was the in-let of afflictions, of bodily infirmities and necessities, of death it self; and when the floods of these did overflow Christs Humane Nature, it was a great presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to the world, who look and judge according to the outward appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now he being thus in the likeness of a sinner, though not a sinner, he, <hi>for sin,</hi> that is, because of sin that had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon man, and made life impossible to him by the Law; by occasion of that great enemy of God which had conquered man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he <hi>condemned sin in his flesh,</hi> he overthrew it in its plea and power against us; he condemned that which condemned us, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came it in judgment, and made us free, by sustaining the curse of it in his flesh, he cut off all its plea against us. This is the great work and business, which was worthy of so noble a Messenger, his own Son, sent to conquer his greatest enemy that he hates most. And then in the third place, you see what benefite or fruit redounds to us by it: What was the end and purpose of it? <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>That the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us</hi>; that seing it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for us to fulfill the righteousness of the Law, and so became impossible to the Law, to fulfill our reward of life; it might be fulfilled by him in our name, and <hi>so the righteousness of the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fulfilled in us</hi> by Christ, the reward also of eternal life might be fulfilled by the Law to us; he having removed the impediment of our weakness, it might be not only possible, but certain to us.</p>

and mans obedience, this being broken, the one party falling off, that life and salvation becomes impossible to the promise alone, to perform. It is sin, that is the weakness and impotency of man; this is the disease, hath consumed his strength, and concluded man under a two-fold impossibility; an impossibility to satisfie the curse, and an impossibility to obey the command. There are three things in the Covenant of Works, A command of obedience, and a threatning of wrath and condemnation upon disobedience, and a promise of life upon obedience; sin hath disabled us every way, in relation to the curse and threatning, man cannot satisfie it, no price, no ransome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orth it is become impossible to yield any acceptable obedience to the Commandment: And hence it is, from our impossibility to obey in time to come, that there is a holy and faultlesse impossibility upon the promise, to give life unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; so you see that the law cannot do it, because of our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. If either man, while he was made upright, had continued in obedience, or man now fallen from uprightness, could satisfie for the fault done, and walk without any blemish in time coming, then it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus we may see clearly, that all mankind must needs perish, for any thing that man can do; and according to that first transaction of God with man, unlesse some other way and device be found out, which indeed was far from the eyes of all living, without the reach of their invention or imagination: I believe, if all the creatures high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or lower, that have any reason, had conveened to consult o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59468:52"/>
healed thee, and thou wouldest not,</hi> but rather thus, we would heal thee, but we could not, and thou wouldest not. This design which is here mentioned of repairing the breach, by destroying that which made it, <hi>sin</hi>; it lay hid in the depth of Gods wisdom, till it pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to vent and publish it unto poor forlorn and desperat man, who out of despair of recovery, had run away to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; a poor shift indeed, for him to think that he could hide himself from him to whom <hi>darkness is as light,</hi> and to flee from him whose Kingdom is over all, and who is present in all the corners of his universal Kingdom; in hell, in Heaven, in the utmost corners of the earth: But this silly invention shews how hopeless the case was.</p>
               <p>Though this be the case and condition of man by nature, yet strange it is, to see every man by nature attempting his own deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and fancying a probability, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though our strength be gone, yet like <hi>Sampson,</hi> men rise up and think to walk and rouse up themselves, as in former times, as if their strength were yet in them, and many never perceives that it is gone, till they be laid hold on by Satan, according to the Laws injunction, and bound into chains of everlasting darkness; but then alace its too late, for they cannot save themselves, and the season of a Saviour is gone; and this no doubt will be the accession of the bitterness and torment that damned souls shall be into, that they dreamed of attaining life by a Law, that now is nothing but a ministration of death, that they lost life by seeking their own righteousness; and made the Law more able to condemn them, by their apprehending in themselves an ability to satisfie it, and by resting in a form of obedience to it. There is something natural in it, <hi>Adam</hi> and all his posterity was once to be saved this way, so the terms run at fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> fault, and presumptuous madness in us, who have fallen from that blessed estate. If man doing his duty, expected a reward, according to the promise, it was commendable, but for man now rebellious and stubborn, and <hi>come short of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God,</hi> to look for a reward from God, against whom he warreth continually, and that for rebellion and enmity, it is damnable. But besides this, I think this principle of self-righteousness is much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59468:53"/>
in man now, by what it was in <hi>Adam</hi>; I conceive though <hi>Adam</hi> looked for life upon obedience, according to the promise, yet he rested not on, and trusted not in his obedience. I believe, a holy and righteous man would be a humble man too, and would rather glory in Gods grace, then in his own works; the sense of a free and undeserved promise, would not suffer him to reflect so much upon his own obedience, or put such a price upon it. But now, its conjoyned with unmeasureable pride, and arises only from self-love: There is no ground of mens looking to be saved by their own doings, but the in-bred pride and self-love of the heart, together with the ignorance of a better righteousness. <hi>Adam</hi> hid himself among the trees, and covered his nakedness with leaves, and truly the shift of the most part is no better. How vain and empty things do men trust into, and from them conclude an expectation of eternal life? the most part think to be safe in the midst or thick of the trees of the Church, if they be in the throng of a visible Church, and adorned with Church-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges as Baptisme, hearing the Word, and such like, they do perswade themselves, all will be well. Some have civility, and a blameless conversation before men, and with such acts of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, or rather wants of some grosse out-breakings, do many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their nakedness. If there be yet a larger, and finer garment, of profession of Religion, and some outward performances of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God, and duties to men, O then! men do in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But as the impossibility of the Laws saving us, by reason of the weaknesse of the flesh, was the ground and occasion of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the flesh, for to supply that defect, and take away that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility, so the sense and sight of this impossibility in us to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and fulfill the Law, and of the Law to give life, is the very ground and reason of a souls coming to Jesus Christ, for the supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this want. As the Son should not have come in the <hi>likeness of sinful flesh,</hi> unless it had been otherwise impossible, by mans doing or suffering, that life should be obtained, so will not a soul
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59468:53"/>
come to Christ, the Son of God, through the vail of his flesh, untill it discern and feel that it is otherwise impossible to satisfie the Law, or attain life. That was the impulsive cause, (if we may say that there was any cause beside his love) why Christ came, even mans misery, and remediless misery; and this is the strong motive and impulsive, that drives a poor sinner unto Jesus Christ, the sense and impression of its desperat and lost estate without him. As there was first sin, and then a Saviour dying for sin, because nothing else could suffice, so there must be in the soul, first, the apprehension of sin, and that remediless sin, incurable sin, by any created power or act; and then the sight of a Saviour coming to destroy sin, and the works of the devil, and destroying it, by dying for it. There is no imployment for this <hi>Physician,</hi> upon every slight apprehension of a wound, or sickness, till it be found incurable, and help sought else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, be seen to be in vain; indeed upon the least apprehension of sin and misery, men ought to come to Christ; we shall not set or prescribe any measure of conviction to exclude you, if you can but come to him indeed, upon the least measure of it, <hi>you will not be cast out,</hi> according to his own word, but as certain it is, that men will not come to this <hi>Physician,</hi> till they find no other can save them. These two things, I wish, were deeply and seriously thought upon, that you cannot satisfie Gods justice, for the least point of guilt, and then, that you cannot do any thing in obedience to please God. There is a strange inconsideration; yea, I may say, ignorance among us, when you are challenged and convinced of sin, (as there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science so benum'd, but in some measure it accuseth every man of many wrongs) what is the course you fall on, to pacifie it, or please God? Indeed if you can get any shadow of repentance, if it were but a bare acknowledgment of the fault, you excuse your selves in your own consciences, and answers the accusation, by it, either some other good works formerly done, occurre to you, or some resolution for amendment in time coming, and this you think shall pacifie God, and satisfie justice: But alace, you are far from the righteousness of God, and you do erre even in the very foundation of Religion, <hi>these are but sparks of your own kindling,</hi> and for all these, <hi>you shall lye down in darkness and sorrow</hi>; these are but the vain expiations and excuses of natural Consciences, which are led to some sense of a Deity, by the Law written in their heart. But, consider this once, you must fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Go then, and first suffer the eternal wrath of an infinit God, and then come and offer obedience if thou can. But now, thou art in a double error, both of which are damnable; One is, thou thinks thou art able by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and resolution, to perform some acceptable obedience to God; another, that performance of obedience, and amending in time coming, will expiat former transgressions: if either of these were true, Christ needed not to have come <hi>in the likeness of sinful flesh,</hi> because it had been possible for the Law to save thee. But now, the truth is, such is the utter disability, and impotency <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This then, I leave upon your consciences, beseeching you to lay to heart, the impossibility you are encompassed with on both hands; Justice requiring a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and you have none, and justice requiring new obedience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and you can give none; old debts urging you, and new duty pressing you, and ye alike disabled for both; that so finding your selves thus invironed with indigency, and impossibility within, you may be constrained to flee out of your selves, unto him, that is both able and willing. This is not a superficial business, as you make it, it is not a matter of fancy, or memory, or expression, as most make it; believe me, it is a serious business, a soul-work, such an exercise of spirit, as useth to be, when the soul is between despair and hope. Impossibility within, driving a soul out of it self, and possibility, yea, certainty of help without, even in Christ, drawing a soul in to him; thus is the closure made, which is the foundation of our happinesse.</p>

               <p>FOr what purpose do we meet thus together? I would we knew it, then it might be to some better purpose. In all other things we are rational, and do nothing of moment, without some end and purpose; but alace, in this matter of greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, our going about <hi>Divine Ordinances,</hi> we have scarce any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct or deliberat thought of the end and rise of them. Sure I am, we must all confess this, that all other businesses in our life, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most impertinent to the great end, <hi>the salvation of our souls,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of these, in which God, in a manner, trysts with men, and comes to dwell with them, these have the nearest and most imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat connexion with Gods glory, and our happiness, and yet, so wretched and unhappy are we, that we study, and endeavour a kind of wisdom and diligence in other petty things, which are to perish with the using, and have no great reach to make our condition ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better or worse; and yet, we have no wisdom nor considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or attention, to this great and momentous matter, the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our souls. Is it not high time we were shaken out of our empty, vain, and unreasonable custom, in going about such solemn duties? when the wrath of God is already kindled, and his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty arm is <hi>shaking terribly the earth,</hi> and shaking us out of all our nests of quietness and consolation, which we did build in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. God calls for a reasonable service, but I must say, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the most, is an unreasonable and bruitish kind of work, little or no consideration of what we are about, little or no purpose, or aim at any real soul-advantage. Consider, my beloved, what ye are doing, undoing your selves with ignorance of your own estate, and unacquaintedness with a better; whence it comes, that you live contented in your misery, and have no lively stirrings after this blessed remedy. That for which we meet together, is to learn
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59468:55"/>
these two things, and alwayes to be learning them, to know sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly our own wretched misery, and that blessed remedy, which God hath provided, it's the sum of the Scriptures, and we desire daily to lay it out before you, if at length it may please the Lord to awake you out of your dream, and give you the light of his salvation.</p>
               <p>You hear of a weaknesse of the flesh, but you would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it aright, its not properly and simply a <hi>weakness,</hi> that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth alwayes some life, and some strength remaining; its not like an infirmity, that only in disposeth to wonted action, in the wonted vigour; but its such a weaknesse, as the Apostle elsewhere, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. calls <hi>deadness,</hi> its such a weakness, as may be called <hi>wickedness,</hi> yea, <hi>enmity to God,</hi> as it is here; our souls are not diseased properly, for that supposeth there is some remnant of spiritual life, but they are <hi>dead in sins and trespasses,</hi> and so its not infirmity, but impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, such a weaknesse as makes life and salvation impossible by us, both utter unwillingnesse, and extream inability; these two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currs in all mankind, no strength to satisfie justice, or obey the Law, and no willingnesse either. There is a general practical mistake in this, men conceive, that their natures are weak to good, but few apprehend the wickednesse and enmity that is in them to God, and all goodness; all will grant some defect and inability, and its a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral complaint, but to consider that <hi>this inability is an impossibility,</hi> that this defect is a destruction of all spiritual good in us, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of this is given to few and to these only whose eyes the spirit opens. There may be some struglings and wrestlings of natural spirits to help themselves, and upon the apprehension of their own weakness, to raise up themselves, by serious consideration, and earnest diligence, to some pitch of serving God, and to some hope of heaven. But, I do suspect that it proceeds in many from the want of this through, and deep conviction of desperate wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, few really believes that testimony which God hath given of man, he is <hi>not only weak, but wicked,</hi> and not only so, but <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A strange character of man, given by him that formed the spirit of man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and made it once upright, and so knows best how far it hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the first pattern.

               <p>Thus man stands invironed with impossibilities, his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and wickedness, and the Laws impossibility, by reason of that; these do shut up all access to the tree of Life, and are instead of a flaming sword to guard it; our legs are cut off by sin, and the Law cannot help us, nay, our life is put out, and the Law cannot quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us; it declares our duty, but gives no ability, it teacheth well, but it cannot make us learn. While we are in this posture, God himself steps in to succour miserable undone man, and here is the way, he sends his Son in the likeness of sinfull flesh, and grace and truth comes by him, which doth remove these impediments, that stopt all accesse to life.</p>
               <p>This is a high subject, but it concerns the lowest and most wretched amongst us, and that is indeed the wonder of it, that there should be such a mystery, such a depth in this work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of poor sinners, so much business made, and such strange things done for repairing our ruines. In the consideration of this we may bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that meditation of the Psalmists, <hi>Ps.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou should thus magnifie him?</hi> and make him not a little lower then Angels, but far higher: <hi>for he took not on him the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Angels,</hi> Heb. 2.14, 16 <hi>But took part with the poor children, of flesh and blood.</hi> This de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, Oh! for such an ascending frame of heart as this deserves, its a wonder it doth not draw us upward beyond our own elem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nment to us.</p>
               <p>Every word hath weight in it, and a peculiar emphasis, there is a gradation that mystery goes upon, till it come to the top; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59468:56"/>
word hath a degree or step in it, whereby it rises high, and still higher. <hi>God sent,</hi> that is very strange, but <hi>God sent his Son,</hi> is most strange, but go on, and its still the stranger, <hi>in the likeness of flesh,</hi> and that <hi>sinfull flesh,</hi> &amp;c. In all which degrees, you see God is descending and coming lower and lower, but the mystery ascends, and goes higher and higher; the lower God come down, the higher the wonder rises up. Still the smaller and meaner that God appears in the flesh, the greater is the <hi>mystery of Godliness, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the flesh.</hi> If you would arise up to the sensible and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table understanding of this mystery, you must first descend into the depths of your own natural wretchedness and misery, in which man was lying, when it pleased God to come so low to meet him, and help him: I say, you must first go down that way in the consideration of it, and then you shall ascend to the use and knowledge of this mystery of Godliness.</p>
               <p>Gods sending, hath some weight of wonder in it, at the very first apprehension of it; if you did but know who he is, and what we are, a wonder it had been, that he had suffered himself to be sent unto, by us, that any message, any correspondence should passe between heaven and earth, after so soul a breach of peace and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, by man on earth. Strange, that heaven was not shut up from all intercourse with that accursed earth. If God had sent out an Angel to destroy man, as he sent to destroy <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.15. If he had <hi>sent out his armies to kill those his enemies,</hi> who had renounced the yoke of his obedience, it had been justice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.41, and 22.7. If he had sent a cruel messenger against man, who had now acted so horrid a rebellion, it had been no strange thing, as he did send an Angel with a <hi>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mming sword to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compasse the tree of life,</hi> he might have enlarged that Angels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to take veangence on man, and this is the wonder, he did not send after this manner. But what heart could this enter into? who could imagine such a thing as this? <hi>God to send,</hi> and <hi>to send for peace</hi> to his rebellious footstool: man could not have looked for acceptance, before the throne, if he had prevented and sent first up supplications and humble cryes to heaven, and therefore find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself miserable, you see he is at his wits end, he is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and gives it over, and so flees away to hide himself, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianly expecting that the first message from heaven, should be to arme all the creatures against him, to destroy him. But, O! what a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59468:56"/>
wonderful, yet blessed surprisal. God himself comes down, and not for any such end as vengeance, though just, but to publish and hold forth a Covenant of reconciliation and peace, to convince man of sin, and to comfort him with the glad tidings of a Redeemer, of one to be sent in the likeness of flesh. Its the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssable and affable. But, that the <hi>Lord of lords, and King of kings, who sitteth in the Circle of the Heavens, and before whom, all the inhabitants of the Earth, are as poor Grashoppers, or crauling worms, about whose throne, there are ten thousand times ten thousand glorious Spirits ministring unto him,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> saw him, Chap. 7. v. 9, 10. that such an one, should not only admit, such as we, to come to him, and offer our suits to his Highness, but himself first to come down unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and offer peace to him, and then send his own Son: And what were we, that he should make any motion about us, or make any mission to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>while we were yet enemies,</hi> that we were, when he sent: O, how hath his Love triumphed over his Justice! But, needed he fear our enmity that he should seek peace? no wayes, one look of his angry countenance, would have looked us unto nothing, <hi>thou lookest upon me, and I am not, one rebuke of his for iniquity, would have made our beauty consume as the moth,</hi> far more the stroak of his hand had consumed us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.11. But, that is the wonder indeed, <hi>while we were yet enemies, and weak too,</hi> neither able to help our selves, nor hurt him in the least, and so could do nothing to allure him, nothing to terrifie him, nothing to ingage his love, nothing to make him fear; yet, then he makes this motion, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to us, <hi>God sending,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>God sending, and <hi>sending his own Son,</hi> that is yet a step higher: Had he sent an Angel, it had been wonderful, one of these <hi>ministering Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> about the Throne, being far more glorious then man. But <hi>God so loved the world, that he sent his Son</hi>; might he not have done it by others? But he had a higher project; and verily, there is more my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery in the end and manner of our redemption, then difficulty in the thing it self; no question, he might have enabled the creature by his Almighty power, to have destroyed the works of the devil, and might have delivered captive man some other way; he needed not for any necessity lying upon him, gone such a round, as the Father to give to the Son, and the Son to receive, as God to send, and the Son to be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59468:57"/>
sent; nay, he might have spared all pains, and without any mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, immediatly pardoned mans sin, and adopted him to the place of Sons. Thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he had done the business, without his Sons, or any others travel and labour in blood and suffering. But this profound mystery, in the manner of it, declares the highness, and excellency of the end God proposed, and that is the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his love: <hi>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on us,</hi> 1 John 3.1. and, <hi>in this was manifested the love of God, toward us, that God sent his onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> begotten Son in the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.9. And truly for such a design and purpose, all the world could not have contrived such a suitable and excellent mean as this, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this could have declared such love; there is no expression of love imaginable to this, <hi>to give his Son,</hi> and <hi>only begotten Son for us.</hi> It had been enough, out of meer compassion, to have saved us, however it had been; but if he had given all, and done all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, he had not so manifested the infinit fulness of love; there is no gift so suitable to the greatness and magnificence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, as this, <hi>One that thought it no robbery to be equal with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> Any gift had been infinitly above us, because from him, but this is not only infinitly above us, but equal to himself, and fittest to declare himself.</p>
               <p>But then, there is yet a higher rise of the mystery, or a lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of God: for, its all one, <hi>God descending,</hi> is the wonder ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>he sent his Son,</hi> mans admiration is already exhausted in that, but if there were any thing behind, this which follows would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it, <hi>in the flesh.</hi> If he had sent his own Son, might he not have sent him in an estate and condition suitable to his glory, as it became the <hi>Prince and Heir of all things, him by whom all were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and do subsist</hi>: Nay, but he is sent, and that in a state of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and condescendency, infinitly below his own dignity. That ever he was made a Creature, that the Maker of all should be sent in the form of any thing he had made, O! what a disparagement? there is no such distance between the highest Prince on the throne, and the basest beggar on the dung-hill, as between the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father, who is <hi>the brightness of his glory,</hi> and the most glorious Angel that ever was made. And yet, it would be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the World, if a King should send his son in the habit and state of a beggar, to call in the poor, and lame, and blind, to the fellowship of his Kingdom. It had been a great mystery then, if

God had been manifested in the nature of Angels, a great abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Majesty; But O! what must it be for God, to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the flesh, in the basest, naughtiest, and most corruptible of all the Creatures, even the very d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>OF all the works of God towards man, certainly there is none hath so much wonder in it, as the sending of his Son, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man, and so it requires the exactest attention in us, let us gather our spirits to consider of this mystery; not to pry into the secrets of it curiously, as if we had no more to do, but to satisfie our understandings; but rather that we may see what this concerns us, and what instruction or advantage we may have by it, that so it may ravish our affections. I believe, there is very pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and grosse ignorance in thousands, of the very thing it self;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59468:58"/>
many who professe Jesus Christ, know not his Natures, or his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Person, do not apprehend either his highness as God, or his lowness as man. But truly, the thing that I do most admire, is, that these who pretend to more knowledge of this mystery, yet few of them do enter upon any serious consideration about it, for what use and purpose it is, though it be the foundation of our salvation, the chief ground of our faith, and the great spring of our consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet to improve the knowledge of it to any purpose of that kind, is a thing so rare, even among true Christians, that it is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the subject of their meditation. I think indeed, the lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this mystery of godliness, would be very effectual to make us really what we are said to be, that is, Christians. There is somthing to this purpose, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.2, 3, 15. and 5.1. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing and knowing that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, and is the Son of God, before his taking on flesh, is made a character of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man that dwelleth in God. Not that a bare external confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or internal opinion and assent to such a truth, is of so much value, which yet is the hight that many attain unto, but it is such a soul acknowledgment, such an heart approbation of this mystery, as draws alongst the admiration and affection after it, as fixeth the heart upon this object alone, for life and salvation. The <hi>devils confessed</hi> and <hi>believed,</hi> but they <hi>trembled at it,</hi> Luke 4.34, 41. He was afraid of what he knew, but <hi>Peter</hi> confessed and loved what he knew; yea, he did cast his soul upon that Lord whom he confessed. It is such an acknowledgment of Christ, as draweth the soul, and unites it to him, by a serious and living imbracement; such a sight of Jesus Christ, hath both truth and goodness in it, in the highest measure, and so doth not only constrain the assent of the mind, but is a powerful attractive to the heart, to come to him, and live in him. I pray you consider then what moment, is in this truth, that you may indeed apply your souls to the consideration of what is in Jesus Christ thus revealed, not simply to know it, but for a further improvement of it, to seek life in Him, that the stamp and impression of this Saviour may be set so deeply on your souls, as that you may express this in a real confession of him in your words and works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21. This is indeed to know and confesse that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, to fetch thence the ground of all our hope and consolation, and to draw thence the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59468:59"/>
most powerful motives to walking, <hi>even as he walked,</hi> to improve it for confidence in him, and obedience to him.</p>
               <p>I shall speak then a word of these two great ends and purposes, of Gods sending his own Son, <hi>in the likeness of sinful fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sh, his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and mans good.</hi> The song of Angels at his birth shews this, <hi>glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, and good will towards man.</hi> His glory is manifested in it, in an eminent manner, the glory of his wisdom, that found out a remedy. What a deep contrivance was it? How infinitly beyond all creature-inventiones? Truly there are riches of wisdom, depths of wisdom in it. I think it could never have entred in the thought of men or Angels: all men once to be drowned under a deluge of sin and misery, and made subject to Gods righteous judgement, and then to find out a way how to deliver and save so many, all the wisdom that shines in the order and beauty of the world, seems to be but a rude draught to this. Then herein doth the glory of his mercy and grace shine most brightly, that he transfers the punishment due to mans sin, upon his own Son, that when no ransome could be found by man, he finds it out, how to satisfie his own justice, and save us: truly, this is the most shining Jewel in the Crown of Gods Glory, so much <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> towards so miserable <hi>sinners,</hi> so much <hi>grace</hi> towards the <hi>rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> If he had pardoned sin, without any satisfaction, what rich grace had it been? but truly, to provide the Lamb, and sacrifice himself, to find out the ransome, and to exact it of his own Son, in our name, is a testimony of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> far beyond that. But then, his justice is very conspicuous in this work; and indeed these two, do illustrat one another, the justice of God, in taking and exacting the punishment of sin, upon his own well-beloved Son, doth most eminently highten the mercy and grace of God towards us, and his grace and mercy in passing by us, doth most marvellously illustrat the righteousness of God, in making his <hi>own Son a curse for us.</hi> What testimony can be given in the world, of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure at sin, of his righteousness in punishing sin, like this? There was no such testimony of love to sinners, and no such demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hatred at sin, imaginable. That he did not punish sin in us, but transfers it over on the most beloved Son, O what <hi>love</hi> and <hi>grace</hi>; and that he did punish his own Son, when standing in the place of sinners, O what <hi>righteousness</hi> and <hi>justice.</hi> This is that glorious mystery, the conjunction of these two resplendent Jewels,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59468:59"/>
                  <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>displeasure,</hi> in one chain of Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, <hi>into which the Angels desire to look,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12. And truly they do wonder at it, and praise from wonder. This is it, that the praises of men and Angels shall roll about eternally. David <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.19. foreseeing this day, foretold it, that <hi>Angels should praise Him,</hi> and now its fulfilled, when all these glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of holy and powerfull Spirits, welcome the Son of God into the world, by that heavenly harmony of praise, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>What lumpishness and earthliness in us, that we do not rise up above, to this melody in our spirits, to joyn with Angels, in this song; we, I say, whom it most concerns. The Angels wonder; and praises and wonders at this, because the glory of God shines so brightly in it, as if there were many Suns in one Firmament, as the light of seven dayes in one. These three especially, wisdom, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and grace, justice, and righteousness, every one of them look like the Sun in its strength, caried about in this orb of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, to the ravishing of the hearts of all the honourable and glorious companies above, and making them chearfully and willingly to contribute all their service to this work, to be <hi>ministring Spirits; to wait on the heirs of Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when the glory of the Highest, raiseth up such a melodious song above, among Angels, O what should both the glory of the highest <hi>God,</hi> and the highest <hi>good</hi> of man do to us! When the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est glory of God, and the chiefest advantage of man are linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this Chain, what should we do, but admire and adore, adore and admire; and while we are in this earth, send up our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to that harmony in Heaven?</p>
               <p>In relation to <hi>our good,</hi> much might be said, but we shall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew unto you, that it is the greatest confirmation of our faith, and the strongest motive to humility, that can be afforded. Now if we could be composed thus unto confidence and reverence, to glorifie him by believing, and to abase our selves, to believe in him, and walk humbly with him, upon the meditation of Christs coming in the flesh, this would make us true Christians indeed.</p>
               <p>There is nothing I know, more powerful to perswade us of the reality of Gods invitations and promises to us, then this; we are still seeking signs and tokens of Gods love, something to warrand us to come to God in Christ, and to perswade that we shall be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; and many Christians puddle themselves in the mire of their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59468:60"/>
own darknesse and discouragement, because they cannot find any thing in themselves, that can give but the least probable conjecture, that he will admit and welcome them to come to him, or that such precious promises, and sweet invitations, can belong to such sinners, as they conceive themselves to be. Truly my beloved, I think, while we exercise our selves thus, we are seeking the Sun with a candle, making that which is in it self as bright, as the light to be more dark. The evidence of Gods reality, in offering life to you in Christ, and his willingness to receive you, it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the compasse of his invitation, and yet you seek it where it is least to be found, that is, in your selves: But indeed, his invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the Gospel, carry the evidence in their bosome, that which is above all other signs and evidences, that he did ever send his own Son in the flesh for this purpose; is there any thing besides this, either greater, or clearer? I think we are like these, who, when they had seen many signs and wonders done by Christ, which did bear testimony to all the world of his Divine Nature, yet they would not be satisfied, but sought out another <hi>sign, tempting him,</hi> Mat. 16.1. And truly, he might return this answer to us, <hi>O wicked and adulterous generation, that seeketh after a sign, there shall no sign be given to thee, but the sign of the Prophet Ionas</hi>: the greatest testimony that can be imagined, is given already, that the Father should send his <hi>only begotten and well beloved Son,</hi> into the <hi>state of a servant,</hi> for man: If this do not satisfie, I know not what will. I see not how any work of his Spirit in us, can make so much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his reality, and faithfulnesse in the Gospel, and of his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness to welcome sinners. All the works of Creation, all the works of Grace, are nothing to this, to manifest his love to men, and therefore there is a singular note upon it, <hi>God so loved the world, that he sent his Son,</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>And in this was love manifested, that he gave his Son,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.9. If men and Angels had set themselves to devise and find out a pledge or confirmation of the love of God, they would have fallen upon some revelation unto, or some opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon their spirits; but alace, this is infinitly above that, <hi>his own express image, and the brightness of his glory,</hi> is come down to bear witnesse of his love: nay, he who is <hi>equal</hi> with himself in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is given as a gift to men, and is not he infinitly more then created gifts, or graces, who is the very spring and fountain of them all? <hi>God so loved the world,</hi> that truly he gave no such gift besides,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59468:60"/>
to testifie such a love: Therefore, when all that he hath done in this kind, cannot satisfie thy s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rupulous mind, but thou wilt still go on, to seek more confirmation of his readinesse to receive thee: I think it is a <hi>tempting of the Holy One,</hi> which may draw such an answer from him, O wicked and adulterous person, there shall no <hi>sign be given</hi> thee, but that which is darker then the former, that which thou shalt understand lesse; thou may get what thou seeks, perhaps some more satisfaction in thy own condition, but it shall plung thee more in the issue, thou shall alwayes be unsetled and <hi>unconstant as water, thou shalt not excell.</hi> I confesse indeed, if we speak of the manifestation of ones particular interest in these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and of an evidence of the love of God to thee, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, then there must needs be something wrought by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, on thy soul, to draw down the general testimony of Gods love to mankind, into a particular application to thy self. But, that I do not speak of now, because that is the sealing of the Spirit after believing, and because you are alwayes unsetled in the first, and main point, of flying unto the Son, and waiting on him for life, therefore have you so much inevidence and weakness in that which follows. That which I now speak of, is, that if this were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially believed, and seriously considered; that <hi>God sent his own Son in the flesh, to save sinners,</hi> you could not readily have any doubt, but that you coming to him for salvation, would be welcome, you could not say, that such precious invitations could not belong to sinners, or that he could not love the like of you. Truly, I think, if the general were laid to heart, that God hath so loved mankind, that he gave such a gift unto them, there is none could make any more question of his reality, when that gift is tendered to any in particular. Nay, I think it is the inconsideration of this general evidence, and manifestation of love to the world, that makes you so perplexed in particulars. Could you have so much difficulty to believe his love to you, if you indeed believe that he hath loved the world, that is, so many thousands like you? Is there so much distance, I pray you, between you and another, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and all? If then he loves so many miserable sinners, is there any impossibility in it, but he may love you? for what is in them, that might conciliat his love? I tell you, why I think the right apprehension of the general truths of the Gospel would be able, like the Sun in its strength, to scatter all the clouds and mists
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59468:61"/>
of our particular interest-debates; because I find, that these very grounds, upon which, you call in question your own particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, if you did consider them, you would find they go a further length, to conclude against all others, and either they have no strength in your case, or they will be of equal force to batter down the confidence of all the Saints, and the certainty of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. What is it that troubles you, but that you are sinners, and such sinners, so vile, and loathsome, from whence you do conclude, not only, that you have no present assurance of his love, but that he cannot love such a one as you are: Now, I say, if this hold good, in reference to you, take heed that <hi>you condemn not your selves in that which you approve,</hi> that is, that you do not di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so you do not only wrong your selves, but all others; and not only so, but you offer the greatest indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to him, that out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> love sent his Son, and to him, who out of love, came and laid down his life. O consider how you indignifie and set at nought that great manifestation of Gods love, <hi>God man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifested in the flesh,</hi> how you despise his love-pledge to sinners, a greater then which he could not give you, because as great as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. O that you could see the consequence of your anxious and perplexing doubts, that they do not only an injury to your own souls, but they are of a more bloody nature; if they hold good, they would cut off the life and salvation of all believers, and which is worse, they will by an unavoidable consequence, conclude an Ante-chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This may strengthen our faith, and minister much consolation, in another consideration too; that which is laid down, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. and 4.15. that he was <hi>partaker of our nature,</hi> and <hi>in all things like unto his brethren, that so he might be a merciful High Priest, able to succour us, and touched with the feeling of our infirmities.</hi> What strong consolation may be suckt out of these breasts? when it was impossible that man could rise up to <hi>God,</hi> because of his infinit highness, and holiness, behold, <hi>God</hi> hath come down to <hi>man,</hi> in his lowness, and ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59468:61"/>
may have easie coming up to it, and going up upon it to heaven: Therefore his flesh is called, a <hi>new and living way,</hi> because a poor sinner may be assured of welcome, and acceptation with one of his own kind, his <hi>Brother, (he was not ashamed to call us brethren,) flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone</hi>; this may <hi>make boldness of accesse,</hi> that we have not God to speak to, or come to, immediatly, as he is cloathed with glory and majesty, and as the Jews heard him on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and desired a Mediator between him and them; but that, that great Prophet promised to them, hath come, and we have him between us and God, as low as we, that we may speak to him, <hi>riding upon an ass, a low ass,</hi> that every one may whisper their desires in his ear, and yet as high as God, that he may speak to God, and have power with him. Truly, this is a sweet trysting place, to meet God in, that no sinner may have any fear to come to it, to this treaty of peace and reconciliation. How may it perswade us of that great priviledge, that we may <hi>become the sons of God,</hi> when <hi>the Son of God is become the Son of man,</hi> John 1.11, 12. Truly, though it be hard to be believed, that such as we should become <hi>the Sons of the great King,</hi> yet it is nothing so strange as this, that <hi>the eternal and only begotten Son of the great God,</hi> should become <hi>the Son of wretched man,</hi> that highness will be easily believed, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this lowness. It will not be so hard to perswade a soul, that there is a way of union, and reconciliation to God, of being yet at peace with him, if this be pondered, that God hath married his own nature with ours, in one person, to be a pledge of that union and peace. And then, how much quickening and comfort may it yeild us? that he was not only a man, but a miserable man, and that not through any necessity, but only the necessity of love and compassion; he had enough of mercy to save us as God, he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of love and compassion as man, but he would take on misery too, in his own person, that he might be experimentally merciful to us. Certainly, the experience of misery and infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mity, must superadd some tenderness, to the heart of our <hi>High Priest</hi>: But though it did not help him to be more pitiful, yet it was done for us, to help us to have more confidence in him, and boldness to come unto him. What an encouragement is it for a poor man, to come unto (once) poor Jesus Christ, who <hi>had not where to lay his head?</hi> He knows the evil of poverty, and he choosed to know it, that he might have compassion on thee. With what boldness may
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59468:62"/>
poor afflicted, and despised believers come to him? why? because, he himself had experience of all that, and he was familiarly acquainted with grief and sorrow, therefore, he can sympathize best with thee. Let us speak even of sinful infirmities thou art subject to, that there might be a suitableness in him to help thee; he came as nigh as might be, he was willing to be tempted to sin, and so he knows the power that temptations must have over weak and frail natures, but sin he could not, for that had been evil for us: Let this then, give us boldness to come to him.</p>
               <p>I would desire to perswade you to humility from this, according to the lesson Christ gives us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, I am meek and lowly</hi>; and the Apostle makes singular use of this mystery of the abasement of Majesty, to abate from our high esteem of our selves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>O should not the same mind be in us, that was in Christ. God abased, and man exalted,</hi> how unsuitable are these, think you? God lowly in condition and disposition, and man, though base in condition, yet high in his disposition, and in his own esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: What more mysterious, then God humbled? And what more monstrous, then man proud? Truly, pride it is the most defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thing in a man, but in a Christian, it is monstrous and prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. If he did humble himself out of charity, and love, who was so high and glorious, how should we humble our selves out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, who are so low and base? and out of charity and love too, to be conformed and like unto him. Nature may perswade the one, but Christianity teacheth the other, to be lowly in mind, and esteem every one better then our selves; to be meek, patient, long-suffering, reason may perswade it, upon the consideration of our own baseness, emptiness, frailty, and nothingness. But this lesson is taught in Christs School, not from that motive only, the force of necessity, but from a higher motive, the <hi>constraint of love</hi> to Jesus Christ: <hi>Learn of me.</hi> Suppose there were no necessity of reason in it, yet affection, might be a stronger necessity, to perswade conformity to him, and following his example, who became so low, and <hi>humbled himself to the death, even for us.</hi>

There is no object that God hath so pure and perfect displeasure at, as sin; therefore he sent to condemn that which he hates most, and perfectly he hates it, to <hi>condemn sin</hi>; and this is expressed as the errand of his coming, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5, 8. <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy

the works of the devil,</hi> all his wicked and hellish plots and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances against man, all that poyson of enmity and sin, that out of envy and malice he spued out upon man, and instilled into his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all these works of that Prince of Darkness, in enticing man from obedience to rebellion, and tyrannizing over him since, by the imperious laws of his own lusts; in a word, all that work that was contrived in hell, to bring poor man down to that same mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with devils; all that, Christ the only begotten Son of the great King, came (for this noble businesse) to destroy it: That Tower which Satan was building up against Heaven, and had laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it as low as hell, this was Christs business, down among men, to destroy that <hi>Babylon,</hi> that Tower of darkness and confusion, and to build up a Tower of light and life, to which Tower, sinners might come, and be safe, and by which, they might really ascend into Heaven. Some do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by these words, <hi>for sin,</hi> understand the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion and reason of Christs coming, that it was, because sin had conquered the world, and subjected man to condemnation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jesus Christ came into the world, to conquer sin, and condemn it, that we might be free from condemnation by sin. And this was the special cause of his taking on <hi>flesh,</hi> if sin had not entered in the world, Christ had not come into it; and if sin had not erected a Throne in mans flesh, Christ had not taken on flesh, he had not come in the likenesse of sinful flesh: So that this may administer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us abundant consolation. If this was the very cause of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that which drew him down from that delightful and blessed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of the Father, then he will certainly do that which he came for; he cannot fail of his purpose, he cannot misse his end: he must <hi>condemn sin,</hi> and save sinners. And truly this is wonderful love, that he took <hi>sin</hi> only for his party, and came only for <hi>sin,</hi> or against sin, and not against poor sinners: He had no commission of the Father, but this, as himself declares, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.17. For, <hi>God sent not his Son into the world, to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.</hi> As one observes well, Christ would never have hinted at such a jealousie, or suggested such a thought to mens minds, had it not been in them before; but this we are naturally inclined unto, to think hard of God, and can hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of his love, when once we are perswaded of our enmity. Indeed the most part of the world fancy a perswasion of Gods love, and have not many jealousies of it, because they know not their

but the fear of an eternal death, of an everlasting separation from the blessed face of God, might have seized upon all, and subjected them to bondage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. But <hi>the strength and sting of that is sin,</hi> it is sin that arms death and hell against us; take away sin, and you take away the sting, the strength of death, it hath no force, or power to hurt man; but <hi>death being the wages due for sin,</hi> Rom. 6.23. all the certainty and efficacy in the wages, flowes from this work of darkness, sin. But, <hi>Now the strength of sin is the Law,</hi> this puts a poysonable and destructive vertue in the sting of sin, for it is the sentence of Gods Law, and the justice and righteousness of God that hath made so inseparable a connexion between sin and death; this gives sin a destroying and killing vertue. Justice arms it with power, and authority, to condemn man, so that there can be no freedom, no releasment from that condemnation, no eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that fatal sting of death, unless the sentence of Gods Law, which hath pronounced, <hi>thou shalt die,</hi> be repealed, and the justice of God be satisfied by a ransome. And this being done, the strength of sin is quite gone, and so the sting of death removed.</p>
               <p>Now this had been impossible for man to do, these parties were too strong, for any created power; the strength of sin to condemn, may be called someway infinit, because it flows from the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able law of the infinit justice of God; now what power could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter that strength, except that which hath infinite sterngth too? Therefore, it behoved the Son of God, to come for this business, to condemn sin, and save the sinner. And being come, he yokes first with the very strength of sin, for he knew where its strangth did ly, and so did encounter, first of all, with that, even the justice of his Father, <hi>the hand writing of ordinances that was against us</hi>; for if once he can set them aside, as either vanquished, or satisfied, he hath little else to do. Now, he doth not take a violent way in this ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he doth it not with the strong hand, but deals wisely, and (to speak so with reverence) cunningly in it, <hi>he came under the Law, that he might redeem them who were under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4.4. force will not do it, the Law cannot be violented, justice cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to forgo its right; therefore, our Lord Jesus chooseth, as it were, to compound with the Law, to submit unto it, <hi>he was made under the Law,</hi> he who was above the Law, being <hi>Law-giver in mount Sinai,</hi> Acts 7.38. Gal. 3.19. he cometh under the bond and tye of it, <hi>to fulfil it. I came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it,

Mat.</hi> 5.17. he would not offer violence to the Law, to deliver sinners, contrary to the commination of it, or without satisfaction given unto it, for, that would reflect upon the wisdom and righteousness of the Father who gave the Law: But he doth it better, in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micable way, by submission and obedience to all its demands, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it craved of the sinner, he fulfils that debt, he satisfies the bond, in his own person, by suffering; and fulfils all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by obedience: And thus, by subjection to the Law, he gets power over the Law, because his subjection takes away all its claim, and right over us; therefore, it is said, that <hi>he blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances, which was against us, by nailing it to his cross, and so took it out of the way,</hi> Col. 2.14. having fulfilled the bond, he cancell'd it, and so it stands in no force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either against him or us; thus, <hi>the strength of sin which is the Law,</hi> is removed, and by this means, <hi>sin is condemned in the flesh, by the suffering of his flesh,</hi> it is fallen from all it's plea against sinners; for, that upon which it did hang, <hi>viz.</hi> the sentence of the Law, is taken out of the way, so that it hath no apparent ground to fasten any accusation upon a poor sinner, that flees in to Jesus Christ, and no ground at all to condemn him, it is wholly disabled in that point; for, as the Philistines found where <hi>Sampsons</hi> strength lay, and cutted his hair, so Christ hath in his wisdom, found where the strength of sins plea, against man lay, and hath cutted off the hair of it, that is, <hi>the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of ordinances which was against us.</hi>

Whatsoever you can pitch upon besides this, it is insufficient, and therefore you find a necessity of seeking some other grace or qualification to appease your consciences, even as they had need to multiply sacrifices; but now since this perfect and full propitiation is offered up for our sins, should not all these vain expiations of your own works, cease?

The truth is, it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now indeed to make these two shine together, in one work of the salvation of sinners, all the world could not have found out the like of this; to dispense with personal satisfaction, in the sinner,

which the rigour of the Law required, and so to admit a sweet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and relaxation, that the riches of his grace and mercy might be manifested, and yet withall, to exact that same punishment of another, willingly coming in the sinners place, to the end that all sinners may behold his righteousnesse and justice: and so this work of the redemption of sinners, hath these Names of God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by himself, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. to <hi>Moses,</hi> engraven deeply upon it, mercy and goodnesse spelled out at length in it, for love was the rise of all, and love did run alongs in all, yet so, as there is room to speak out his holiness, and righteousness, and justice not so much to afright sinners, as to make his mercy the more amiable and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull.</p>
               <p>I know not a more pressing ground of strong consolation, nor a firmer bulwark of our confidence, and salvation, then this conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mercy, and Justice, in the business: there might have been alwayes a secret hink of jealousie, and suspition in our minds, when God publisheth mercy and foregiveness to us freely, O! how shall the Law be satisfied, and the importunity of justice and faithfulness, that hath pronounced a sentence of death upon us, answered? Shall not the righteous Law be a loser this way, if I be saved, and it not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by obedience or suffering? how hard would it be to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade a soul of free pardon, that sees such a severe sentence standing against it? But now there is no place for doubting, all is contrived for the encouragment and happiness of poor sinners, that we may come to him with full perswasion of his readiness, and inclinableness to pardon, since Jesus Christ hath taken the Law and Justice of God off our head, and us off their hand, and since he hath reckoned with them, for what is due by us, and payed it without us, then we have a clear way, and ready accesse to pardon, and to believe his readiness to pardon. And this is it which is holden out here, <hi>Christ condemning sin in the flesh,</hi> or punishing sin in his own <hi>flesh</hi>; giving a visible and sensible representation of the justice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God, in punishing sin, and that in his own <hi>flesh,</hi> offering up himself as the condemned sinner, and hanging up to the view of all the world, as an evident testimony of the justice and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God against sin, and by this means cutting off the very strength of sin, the <hi>Law,</hi> by fulfilling it.

               <p>This is that which Christ sayes, <hi>I came not to destroy the Law,</hi> but <hi>to fulfill it</hi>; and which Paul seconds, <hi>Is the Law then made void by faith, God forbid,</hi> it is <hi>rather established,</hi> Matth. 5.17. Rom. 3.31. The Law and Justice comes better to their own, by our cautioner, then by us, there is no such way conceivable, to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them fully, as this, whether ye look to the Commandment or the Curse.</p>
               <p>The Commandment never got such satisfaction, in any person, as in Christs, he hath fulfilled it by obedience. <hi>It becomes us,</hi> saith he, <hi>to fulfill all righteousness,</hi> Matth. 3.15. Both Moral and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, so that <hi>there was no guil found in his mouth, he knew no sin, he was holy and harmless: His Fathers will was his souls delight, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy will,</hi> Psal. 40.8. It <hi>was more to him then his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary food, his meat and drink,</hi> there was so absolute a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency between his <hi>will,</hi> and Gods <hi>will,</hi> and between his way, and his will, that it was not possible that any difference should fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. His obedience had more good in it (so to speak) then <hi>Adam's</hi> disobedience had evil in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>Adam's</hi> disobedience was but the sin of a finite creature, but Christs obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was the work of an infinite person. I think there was more real worth in Christs obedience to the Commands, then in all the united service and obedience of men and Angels, all the love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, fear, and obedience flowing from these, take them in one bundle, as they will be extended and multiplied to all eternity, there is something in Christs, that elevats it above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That is more worth then all men and Angels <hi>made under it.</hi> It had been no humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather the exaltation of an Angel, to be obedient to God, that subordination to a law, is the highest top of the creatures ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement: but he was such a person, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You see then, how this Conclusion follows, <hi>that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> he having fulfilled it, and satisfied it so fully, both by obedience to the Commandment, and submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Curse; it is all one in Gods account, as if we had done it, because Christ was surety in our stead, and a common person re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting us, and therefore, his paying of the debt, acquits us at the hand of Justice, and whatsoever he did to fulfill <hi>all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> that is accounted ours, because we were represented in him, and judicially one with him: And therefore, we were condemned when he was condemned, we were dead when he died, and so the righteousness of the Law, in ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now consider this, my Beloved, for it is propounded unto you, as the greatest perswasive to move you to come to Jesus Christ, there is such a clear and plain way in him to Salvation. If this do not move your hearts, I know not what will: I do not expect that your troubles in this world, the frequent lashes of judgement, the impoverishing and exhausting of you, the plucking away of these things ye loved, the disquieting your peace so often, that any of those things that have the image of wrath upon them, can drive you to him, and make you forsake your way, when such a motive as this doth not prevail with you. O what heart could stand against

the power of this perswasion, if it were but righty apprehended? who would not willingly flee in to this City of refuge, if they did but know aright the avenger of blood that pursues them, and what safety is within? You are alwayes imagining vain satisfactions, to the Law of God; how great weight doth your fancy impose upon your tears, your confessions, your reformations? If you can attain any thing of this kind, that is it which you give to satisfie justice, it is that wherewith you pretend to fulfill the Law. But if it could be so, wherefore should God have sent his Son to condemn sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and purchase righteousness by him? I beseech you, once know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider your estate, that you may open your hearts to this Redeemer, that you may be willing to be stript naked of all your imaginary righteousness, to put on this, which will satisfie the Law fully. Will you die in your sins, <hi>because you will not come to him to have life?</hi> Will you rather be condemned with sin, then saved with Christs righteousness?

in Jesus Christ, without our works, when the mercy of God is proclaimed in its freedom, and fulness, the heart of man is subject to a wofull mis-conceit of Christ, as if by these a latitude were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and a liberty proclaimed to men to live in sin. That which is propounded as the incouragement of poor sinners, to come to God, and forsake their own wicked way, it is miserably wrested upon a mistake, to be an incouragement to revolt more and more. Righteousness and life, by faith in a Saviour, without the works of the Law, is holden out as the grand perswasion of the Gospel, to study obedience to the Law; and yet such is the perversness of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hearts, that either in opinion, or practice, they so carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as if there were an inconsistence, between Christ and the Law, between free Justification, and Sanctification, as if Christ had come to redeem us not from sin, but to sin. Now to prevent this, <hi>think not,</hi> saith he, <hi>that I am come to destroy the Law,</hi> do not fancie to your selves a liberty to live in sin, and an immunity from the obligation of a commandment, because I have purchased an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to this purpose, <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Do we then make void the Law by faith?</hi> It is so natural to our rebellious hearts, to desire to be free from the yoke of obedience, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If we had reckoned alone with the Law, we had been taken up eternally with satisfaction for the breaches of it, so that there could be no access to obedience of the command, and no acceptance either: a sinner must first satisfie the curse, for the fault done, before ever he can be in a capacity to perform new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the terms of acceptation of it with God.

The word is also, <hi>worshipped</hi>: Truly my beloved, this is the foundation of all Religion, free forgiveness, there had been no Religion, no worship of God, no obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands throughout all eternity, there should never have been any fear, any love, any delight in God, any reverence and subjection to him, if he had not <hi>forgiveness,</hi> a treasure of mercies with him, to bestow first upon sinners, and this makes access to stand and serve in his sight. The cloud of our transgressions is so thick and dark, that there could never have been any communion with God, if he had not found out the way to <hi>scatter and blot it out, for his own Names sake.</hi> Religion then must begin at this great and inestimable free gift of imputed righteousness, of accounting us, what we are not in our selves, because found so in another, it begins at remission of sins, but that is not all, this hath a further end, and truly it is but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductive to a further end; that so a soul may be made partaker of the gift of <hi>holiness</hi> within, and <hi>have that image of God renewed in holiness and righteousness.</hi> I would have you once perswaded to begin at this, to recieve the <hi>free gift</hi> of anothers <hi>righteousness,</hi> Rom. 5.17. And anothers <hi>obedience,</hi> to find your own nakedness and loathsomness without this covering, and how short all other coverings of your own works are. O that we could once perswade you to renounce your selves, to embrace this righteousness, then it were easie to prevail with you to renounce sin, to put on holiness. I say,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59468:71"/>
first, you must renounce your selves, as undone in all you do, as loathsome in all that ever you loved, and come under the wide and broad skirt of Christs righteousness, which he did weave upon the earth, for to hide our nakedness. You must once have the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Law fulfilled</hi> perfectly by another, before you can have access to fulfill on jot of it your selves, or any thing you do be accepted; and till this foundation be laid, you do but beat the air in Religion, you build on the sand.</p>
               <p>Now if once you were brought this length, to renounce all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in your selves, and to flee in to Christs righteousnesse, then it were easie to lead you a step further, to renounce the love of your most beloved sins: and the more lovely that Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is in your eyes, the more beauty would holinesse and obedience have in them also unto you; then you would labour to walk after the guidance of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>I would have the impression of this deep in your hearts, that the Gospel is not a Doctrine of licentiousnesse, but a Doctrine of the purest liberty, of the compleatest redemption. Many think it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to serve their lusts, and it is indeed as bonds and cords to restrain them. There is no man but would be content to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>from the wrath to come,</hi> and therefore many snatch at such sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Gospel, and take them lightly, without considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what further is in it. But truly if this were all, it were not compleat redemption; if there were not redemption from sin too, which is the most absolute tyrant in the world. I think a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian would account the service of sin bondage, though it were left at his own option; <hi>He that commits sin, is the servant of sin,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the freedom that Christ purchaseth, is freedom from sin, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.38. I will say more, we are delivered from wrath, that so we may be redeemed from sin, we have the righteousnesse of Christ imputed to us, that so the image of Christ may be renewed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, this is the very end of that. I am sure any that disce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt, but there is nothing in sin, but deformity and opposition to his Holiness, its pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil, and most purely hated of God: and if there were no more to perswade you that sin is infinitly more evil then pain, consider how our pain and punishment was really transferred upon the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59468:71"/>
Son of God, and that all this did not make him a whit the worse, but he was not capable of the real infusion of our sin, that would have made Christ as miserable, wretched, and impotent as any of us, that would have disabled him so far from helping us, that he would have had as much need of a Mediator, as we: all which were highly blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous to imagine. Look then how much distance and difference there was between suffering, dying Christ, and wretched men living in sin, none can say but he is infinitly better, even while in pain, nor the highest Prince in pleasure, so much disproportion there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween sin and pain, so much is the one worse then the other. Do not think then that Christ died to purchase an indulgence for you to live in sin, truly that were to take away the lesser evil, that the greater may remain; that were to deliver from one misery, that we may be more involved in that which is the greatest of all miseries. Nay, certainly if Christ be a Redeemer, he must redeem us from our most potent and accursed enemy, <hi>sin</hi>; he must take away the root, the fountain of all misery, <hi>sin</hi>; that which conceived in its womb all pains, sorrows, sicknesses, death and hell. You have the great end of redemption expressed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.75. <hi>That we being delivered from all our enemies, might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness.</hi> It was that, for which he made man at first, and it is that for which he hath made him again, <hi>created unto good works,</hi> Eph. 2.8. It was a higher design certainly, for which the Son of God became par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of our nature, then only to deliver us from hell, no doubt it was to make us <hi>partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. and this is the very nature of God, holiness and goodness. As sin is the very nature and image of the Devil, the great breach of the Creation was the breaking off of this Image of God, that was the heaviest fall of man, from that top of divine excellency, into the bottom of devillish deformity. Now it is this that is the great plot for which Christ came into the world, to make up that breach, to restore man to that dignity again, so that redemption from wrath, is but a step to ascend upon, to that which is truly Gods design, and mans dignity, conformity with God in holinesse and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>O that you could be perswaded of this, that Christs businesse in the world, was not to bring a notion of an imaginary righteousnesse only, by meer imputation, but to bring forth a solid and real righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse in our hearts, by the operation of his Spirit: I say im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59468:72"/>
or accounting righteous, is but a meer imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if this lively operation do not follow. He came not only to spread his garment over our nakedness and deformity, but really and effectually to be a Physician to save our souls, to cure all our inward distempers. The Gospel is not only a Doctrine of a righteousnesse without us, but of a righteousnesse both <hi>without, for,</hi> and <hi>within</hi> us too, <hi>that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> &amp;c. Christ without, happiness it self without, cannot make us happy, till they come in within us, and take up a dwelling in our souls. Therefore I declare unto the most part of you who pretend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect salvation by Jesus Christ, that you are yet in your sins, and as yet you have no fellowship in this redemption. Do you think to walk after the course of the world, and the lusts of the flesh, to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in these common pollutions and uncleannesses among men, <hi>swearing, lying, contention, railing, wrath, malice, envy, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, uncleanness,</hi> and such like, and yet be <hi>in Christ Iesus? Do not deceive your selves, God is not mocked: He that is in Christ, is a new creature,</hi> his endeavour and study, his affection and desire is toward a new walk, after the Spirit. Are not most of you carnal, all flesh; the flesh gives Laws, and you obey them? Are not your immortal souls enslaved to base lusts, to the base love of the world? Are they not prone to prostitute themselves to the service of your fleshly and bruitish part? Why do you then imagine that ye are in Christ Jesus, partakers of his righteousnesse? Consider it in time, that so you may be indeed, what you now are not, but pretend to be. It is the opinion that you are in Christ already, that keeps you out of him.</p>
               <p>But on the other hand again, there is nothing here to discourage a poor soul, that thinks subjection to sin the greatest slavery, who would as gladly be redeemed from the power of it, as from hell: I say to such, whose souls desire it is to be purged from <hi>all that filthiness of flesh and spirit,</hi> and whose continued aim it is to walk in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Though you have many sailings, and often fall, and defile yourself again, yet this comfort is holden out here unto you, there is no condemnation to you, Jesus Christ hath condemned sin, to save you, he hath fulfilled all righteousness for you, and therefore lay you the weight of your acceptation and consolation upon what he hath done himself, and not upon what is but yet a doing in you. Do you not find, I say, that the grace of Jesus Christ, revealed in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59468:72"/>
the Gospel, is that which melts your hearts most? Is not the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Lord that which perswades you most? and do not these make you loath your self, and love holiness? Encourage your selves therefore in him, hold fast the righteousness that is without you, by faith, and certainly you shall find that righteousnesse and holinesse shall in due time be fulfilled within you. I know no soul so wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but it may lay hold on that perfect righteousnesse of Christs, and go under the covering of it, and take heart from it, if so be the desire and affection of their soul be dire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted to a further end, to have his Spirit dwelling within them, for the renewing of their heart <hi>in righteousness and true holiness.</hi> I do not say that this is a condition which you must perform before you venture to lay lold on Christs righteousness without you, no wayes, but rather I would declare unto you the very nature of faith in Christ, that it seeks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery from wrath in him, not simply and lastly, but that a way may be made for redemption from sin, and that there may be a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of that Divine Nature, which is most in its eye.</p>

               <p>IF there were nothing else to engage our hearts to Religion, I think this might do it, that there is so much reason in it. Truly, it is the most rational thing in the world, except some revealed mysteries of faith, which are far above reason, but not contrary to it; there is nothing besides in it, but that which is the purest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Even that part of it which is most difficult to man, that which concerns the moderating of his lusts and affections, and the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his walk and carriage; there is nothing that Christianity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in these matters, but that which may be perswaded by most convincing reasons, to be most suitable, and comely for men, as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59468:73"/>
man; you may take it in the subject in hand, there is nothing sounds harsher to men, and seems harder in Religion, then such a victory over the flesh, such an abstractedness from sensual and earthly things; and yet, truly, there is nothing in the world, that more adorns and beautifies a man, nothing so elevats him above beasts, as this, in so much that many natural spirits, void of this saving light, have notwithstanding been taken with somewhat of the beauty of it, and so far enamoured with the love of it, as to account all the world mad, and bruitish, that followed these lower things, and inslaved themselves unto them. I take the two fountains of all the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, disorders, and defilements among men, to be the inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and ignorance of God, that eternal Spirit, and fountain-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the ignorance of our own souls, these immortal spirits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, which are derived from that fountain-spirit. This is the misery of men, that scarce do they once seriously reflect upon their own spirits, or think what immortal souls is within them, and what affinity these have to the fountain of all spirits; therefore, do men basely throw down themselves to the satisfaction of the lusts of the flesh. Now indeed, this is the very beginning of Christianity, to reduce men from these baser thoughts and imployments, to the consideration of their immortal souls within: And O! how will a Christian blush to behold himself in that light, to see the very i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of a beast upon his nature, to look on that slavery and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of his far better part, to the worst and bruitish part in him, <hi>his flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a man did wisely consider the constitution of his nature, from its first divine original, and what a thing the soul is, which is truly, and more properly, <hi>himself,</hi> then his body, what excellency is in the soul beyond the body, and so, what preheminency it advanceth a man unto, beyond a beast? He could not but account Religion the very ornament and perfection of his nature. Reason will say, that the spirit should rule and command the body, that <hi>flesh</hi> is but the minister and servant of the spirit, that there is nothing the proper and peculiar good of man, but that which adorns and rectifies the spirit, that all these external things which mens senses are carried after, with so much violence, do not better a man, as man, but are common to beasts, that in these things, mans happiness, as man, doth not at all consist, but in some higher and more transcending good, which beasts are not capable of, and which may satisfie the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59468:73"/>
immortal spirit, and not perish in the using, but live with it: All these things, the very natural frame and constitution of man doth convincingly perswade. Now then, may a soul think within it self, O how far am I departed from my original? how far degenerated from that noble and royal dignity, that God by the stamp of his image once put upon me? How is it that I am become a slave and drudge to that baser and brutish part, the flesh? I would have you retire into your own hearts, and ask such things at them. <hi>Man being in honour and understanding not, is even like the beasts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish:</hi> Truly we are become like beasts, because we consider not that we are men, and so advanced by creation far above beasts. The not reflecting on the immortal, spiritual nature of our souls, hath transformed us, in a manner, into the nature of beasts, perishing beasts. Christianity is the very transforming of a beast into a man, as sin was the deforming of a man into a beast: This is the proper effect of Christianity, to restore humanity, to elevat it, and purifie it from all those defilements and corruptions that were ingrossed and incorporated into it, by the state of subjection to the flesh; and therefore the Apostle delineats the nature of it unto us, and draws the difference wide, between the natural man, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p>The natures of things are dark and hidden in themselves, but they come to be known to us, by there operations and acting; their inclinations and instincts are known this way. Grace is truly a very spiritual thing, and the nature of it lyes high; yet, as <hi>Christ could not be hid in the house,</hi> neither can grace be hid in the heart, it will be known by its working; Christ can better be hid in a house, then in the heart, because, when he is in a heart, he is ingadged to restore that heart and soul, to its native dignity, and preheminency over the flesh; and this cannot but cause much disturbance in the man, for a season; to change governments, to cast out usurpers, and to restore the lawful and righteous owner, to the possession of his right, cannot be done secretly and easily, it will shake the very foundations of a Kingdom to accomplish it: so it is here, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the soul, to the possession of its right and dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the flesh, the casting out of that tyrannous and base usurper, the flesh, cannot be done, except all the man know it, feel it, and in a manner be pained with it. Now the nature of Christianity doth lay it self open to us in these two especially, in what it minds
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59468:74"/>
and savours, and how it causeth to walk, life is known especially by <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>motion</hi>: A feeling, thinking, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>avouring power, is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power, so a moving, walking power, is a living power, and these are here; the Christian is shortly described by his nature, he is one <hi>after the Spirit, not after the flesh,</hi> and by the proper characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical operations of that nature, first, <hi>minding or savouring the things of the Spirit,</hi> which comprehends his inward thoughts, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, intentions, and cogitations, all his inward senses are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed about such objects, and then he is one <hi>walking after the Spirit,</hi> his motions are in a course of obedience, proceeding from that inward relish or taste, that he hath of the things of God. It is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very good reason, that the name of a Christian is thus exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>essed, one <hi>after the Spirit,</hi> that is his character, that expressed, his nature unto us; whether ye look to the original of Christianity, or the prime subject of it, or the chief end of it, it deserves to be called by this name. The original of it is very <hi>high,</hi> as high as that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, as high as <hi>the God of the spirits of all flesh.</hi> Things are like their original, and some way participat of the nature of their causes; <hi>that which is born of the spirit, is spirit,</hi> Joh. 3.6. that which is born of God, who is a <hi>Spirit, must be spirit,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.1. How royal a descent is that, how doth it nobilitat a mans nature? Truly all other degrees of birth among men, are vain imaginary things, that hath no worth at all, but in the fancies of men, they put no real excellency in men. But this is only true nobility, this alone doth extract a man <hi>deface vulgi,</hi> out of the dregs of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. There is no intrinsick difference between bloods, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but what <hi>this</hi> make, this divine birth, this second birth; all other differences are but in opinion, this is reality; it puts the image of that blessed Spirit upon a man. Truly, such a creature is not begotten in the womb of any natural cause, of any humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <hi>intising words of mans wisdom,</hi> of any external mercy, or judgment; no instruction, no pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Christ Jesus came down from Heaven into the earth, and took on our flesh, that so the Almighty Spirit might come down to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our spirits, and lift them up from the earth to the Heaven.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59468:74"/>
We cast the seed into the ground of mens hearts, (and alace, it gets entry but in few souls, it is scattered rather on the high-way side, and cannot reach into the arrable ground of the heart) but it can do nothing without the influence of Heaven, except the Spirit beget you again, by that immortal seed of the Word. Therefore we would cease our wondering, that all the means of Gods Word, and Works do not beget moe true Christians; I do rather wonder that any of <hi>Adams</hi> wretched posterity should be begotten again, and advanced to so high a dignity, to <hi>be born of the Spirit.</hi> O that Christians would mind their original, and wonder at it, and study to be like it! If you believe and consider, that your descent is from that uncreated Spirit, how powerful might that be to conform you more and more to him, and to transform more and more of your flesh, into spirit? There is nothing will raise up the spirits of the children of Princes more, then to know their royal birth and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; how should the consideration of this make your spirits suitable to your state or fortunes, (as we use to say?) You would labour to raise them up to that hight of your original, and to <hi>walk worthy of that high calling.</hi> O that we could learn that instruction from it, which <hi>Paul</hi> gives, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, 31 <hi>But of him are ye in Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord</hi>: Truly, a soul possessed with the meditation of this royal descent from God, could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly glory in these inglorious baser things, in which men glory, and could not contain or restrain glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If this were minded alwayes, that we are of God, born of God, what power do ye think temptations, or solistations to sin, would have over us? <hi>he that is born of God sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, he keepeth himself, and the wicked one toucheth him not,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.18, 19. Truly this consideration imprinted in the heart, would elevate us above all these baser perswasions of the flesh, this would make sin loathsome and despicable, as the greatest indignity we could do to our own natures; The strength and advantage of sin, is to make us forget what we are, whom we have relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to drink us drunk with the puddle of the world, or then with our own jealousies and suspitions, that we may forget our birth

and state, and so be enticed to anything. If you would have, wherewith to beat back, all <hi>the fiery darts of the devil,</hi> take <hi>the shield of</hi> this <hi>faith,</hi> and perswasion, how would it silence temptations? <hi>Shall I who am a Ruler, flee,</hi> saith <hi>Nehemiah</hi>? Shall I who am born of the Spirit? shall I who am of God in Christ, abase my self to such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and base things? Shall I dishonour my father, and disgrace my self?</p>
               <p>Then Christianity its chief residence, its royal sent is in the spirit of a man, and so he he is one after the Spirit. <hi>Be ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the spirit of your minds,</hi> Eph. 4.23. As it is of a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, so it must have the highest and most honourable lodging in all the Creation, that is, the spirit of a man, without this there is no room else fit for it, and suitable to it, in this lower world; <hi>My son give me thine heart,</hi> saith wisdom, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23.26. It cares for nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if it get not the heart, the inmost Cabinet of the imperial City of this Isle of Man, for <hi>out of it are the issues of life,</hi> that flow into all the members.

Alas! poor souls, that you have never yet adverted, that you have spirits, immortal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings within you, which must survive this dust, this corruptible flesh; What will you do when you cannot have flesh to care for? when your spirits can have nothing to be carried forth into, but must eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally dwell within the bosome of an evil conscience, and be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with that worm, the bitter remembrance of the neglect of your spirits, and utter estrangement from them, while you were in the body? then you must be confined within your own evil consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and be imprisoned there for ever, because while yet there was time and season, you were alwayes abroad, and every where, but within your own hearts and consciences, and is not that a just recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>

And truly, this is the great excellency of true Religion above, all these things you are busied about, that it elevats the spirit of a man to God, that it will never rest, till it have carried it above to the fountain-spirit.

Do you think, my Beloved, while you are in the body, to bow down your selves to the Earth, to descend unto the service of the flesh all your time, never once seriously to rise up in the consideration of eternity, or lift up your heads above temporal and earthly things, and yet in the close to ascend unto Heaven?

The world apprehend no realities, but in what they see, but a Christian apprehends no solide reality in that he sees, but only in that he sees not, and therefore, as in his judgment he looks upon the one as a shadow, the other as a substance, so he labours to proportion and conform his affection to a suitable intertainment of them; to give a shadow or show of affection to the things of this life, but the marrow and substance of his heart to the things invisible of another life: Thus the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. <hi>&amp;c.

comely; but in the removal of the spirit, it becometh a piece of the most defiled, and loathsome dust in the world.</p>
               <p>Now, I say, such a vast and wide difference there is between a true Christian, and a natural man, even taking him in with all his common indowments and excellencies; the one is a man, the other a beast, the one is <hi>after the flesh,</hi> the other <hi>after the spirit.</hi> It is the ordinary compellation of the Holy Ghost, <hi>man being in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and understanding not, is like the beasts that perish,</hi> Psal. 49.20. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 94.8. <hi>Vnderstand ye bruitish among the people,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 92.6. <hi>The bruitish man understands not this</hi>: And <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3.18. <hi>That they themselves may know that they are but beasts.</hi> Therefore you find the Lord often turning to beasts, to insensible creatures, thereby to reprove the folly and madness of men, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.2. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.7.

If the spirit be indeed elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above all sensual and earthly things, to the life of Angels, that is, to communion with God, then a man is one <hi>after the Spirit,</hi> an Angel incarnat, an Angel dwelling in flesh; but if his spirit throw it self down to the service of the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>esh, minding and favouring only things sensual and visible, then indeed a man puts off humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hath associated himself to beasts, to be as one of them. And indeed, a man made thus like a beast, is worse then a beast, because he ought to be far better: it is no disparagement to a beast to mind only the flesh, but it is greatest abasement of a man, that which draws him down from that higher station God had set him into, to the lowest station, that of beasts; and truly a <hi>Nebu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now such is every man by nature, that <hi>which is born of the flesh, is flesh,</hi> even man, as he comes out of the womb, is degenerated, and fallen down into this bruitish estate, to mind, to savour, to relish nothing, but what relates to this flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or temporal being. The utmost sphear, and comprehension of man, is now of no larger extent then this visible world, and this present life: <hi>He is blind, and seeth not far off,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.9. Truly, such is every man by nature; whereas the proper native sphear of the spirits motion, and comprehension, is as large, as its endurance,

that is, as long as eternity, and as broad as to reach the infinitness of God, the God of all spirits, now through the slavery and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of mens spirits, to their flesh, its contracted into as narrow bounds, as this poor life in the flesh; he that ought to look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond time, as far as eternity, and hath an immortal spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And truly, if you compare the context, you will find, that whosoever doth not <hi>give all diligence to add to faith, vertue, to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, knowledge, to knowledge, temperance, to temperance, patience, and to patience, godliness,</hi> &amp;c. He that is not exercised and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about this study, how to adorn his spirit with these graces, how to have a victory over himself and the world, and in respect of these, accounts all things, beside, indifferent, such a man <hi>is blind, and seeth not far off</hi>; he hath not gotten the sight of eternity, he hath not taken up that everlasting endurance, else he could not spend his time upon the provision for the lusts of the flesh, but he behoved to <hi>lay such a good foundation for the time to come,</hi> as is here mentioned: If he saw afar off, he could not but make acquaintance with those courtiers of Heaven, which will minister an entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that everlasting Kingdom. But truly, while this is not your study, you have no purpose for Heaven, you see nothing but what is just before your eye, and almost toucheth it, and so you savour and mind only what you see.</p>
               <p>Is not this then a wide difference between the children of this world, and the children of God?

               <p>And indeed, when once the spirit is renewed, and dispossessed of that malignant humour of corruption, and fleshly affection, that did present all things, contrary to what they are, then it is like a healthful and wholsome pallat, that tastes all things as they are, and finds bitter bitter, and sweet sweet; or like a sound eye, that beholds things just as they are, both in colour, quantity, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: Then the soul savours the sweet smell of the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>vers.</hi> 22. <hi>Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, meekness, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> &amp;c. these are fragrant and sweet to the soul, and as a sweet perfume, both to the person that hath them, and to others round about him, and to God also; these cast a savour, that allures a soul to seek them, and being possessed of them, they cast a sweet smell abroad to all that are round about, and even as high as Heaven, a soul that hath these planted in it, and growing out of it, is <hi>as a garden inclosed,</hi> to God.

O what beauty hath gentlenesse, goodnesse, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in his eye? what sweetness is in the love of God to his taste? How ravishing is the joy of the Holy Ghost? How contenting is that peace that passeth understanding? These are things of the Spirit, that he minds and savours. Know, Christians, that it is to this ye are called, to mind these things most, and to seek them most; beware lest the deceitfulness of sin intise you, through the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and deceitful lusts that are yet living in your members: If you indeed mind these things, and out of the apprehension of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and savour of the sweetnesse, and smell of the fragrancy of them, would be content to quite all your corrupt lusts, for to be posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with them, then you are on that blessed and happy side of this great and fundamental division of men; you have indeed the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all others who are not renewed, what ever be your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world, you are of the <hi>Spirit</hi>; and this is better then to be rich, wise, great, and honourable: God hath not given you such things as the world go mad after, but envy them not, he hath given you better things, more real and substantial things, that makes you far better, and more excellent.</p>

Seing then we are into the body, and sent unto the world for this end, that we may passe through into an unchangeable eternal estate: Truly, of all things it is most concerning and weighty, what way we choose to this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end; seing the time is short, in which we have to walk, and it is uncertain too, we ought, as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, <hi>give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>; as long as the day remains, we should drive the harder, lest that eternal night overtake us. The shortness and uncertainty of time, should constrain us to take the present opportunity, and not to let it slip over as we do, seing it is not at all in our hand, either what is past, or what is to come; the one cannot be recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the other is not in our power, to call and bring forward, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the present moment that God hath given us, should be catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hold on, and <hi>redeemed,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.16. We should buy it at the dearest rate of pains, and expenses, from all those vain, impertinent, and trifling diversions, that take it up,

that we may imploy it as it becomes, suitable to eternity that is posting on. And then as the shortness of it makes it the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and considerable, in regard of the end of it, <hi>eternity</hi>: as the scantnesse of a thing increases the rate of it, so that same considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should make all worldly things, that are confined either in their being, or use, within it, to be incosiderable, as <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30, 31. shews, seing the <hi>time is short, it remaineth, that we should rejoice, as not rejoicing; weep, as not weeping; buy, as if we possessed not; use the world, as not abusing it</hi>: Seing all its worth is to be esteemed from the end of it, eternity, never ending; then certainly whatsover in time doth not reach that end, and hath no connexion with it, we should give it but such intertainment, as a passing bird, that is pleasant to the eye, gets of a beholder, while it is in its flight: the shortness of the day should make us double our diligence, and put on the harder in our walk or race, that so we may come in time to our place of rest; and that same should make the passenger give an overly and passing look to all things that are by the way, and which he must of necessity leave behind him. Seing these things then are so important, let us draw our hearts together to consider what the Lord speaks to us in this word, for in it you have two wayes, and two ends, opposite and contrary wayes and walks, and as contrary ends; the wayes are <hi>walking after the flesh,</hi> and <hi>walking after the Spirit</hi>; the ends to which they lead, are <hi>death</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> We spoke something of the wayes, and the wide difference that is between them, what excellency is in the one beyond the other; but truly it is hard to perswade you to take off your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed wayes and walks, because your inward sense, and the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of your hearts is wholly perverted and corrupted by nature. You know the moving faculty is subordinat in its operations, unto the knowing, feeling, and apprehending-faculties: The locomotive power is given for a subsidiary and help to the apprehensive and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitive powers, because things are convenient and disconvenient, good or evil, to the nature of the living creature, are without it; and it could not by meer knowledge, or desire, or hatred of things, either come in possession of them, or eschew them, therefore God hath given them a faculty of moving themselves to the prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and attainment of any apprehended good, or to the eschewing and aversion from any conceived evil.

               <p>What is the reason then that so many walk in the way to death; but because their flesh finds no straitning, no pressure in it? it is an easie way to their natures, because suitable to the corruption that is in them; therefore men walk on without consideration of what follows: its like a descent or going down a hill, so easie to our flesh; and on the other hand, the way to life, <hi>after the Spirit,</hi> is an ascent upward, and it is very difficult to our earthy and lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish flesh. Our spirits by communion with, and subjection to, the flesh, are made of an earthly quality, near the element of the flesh, and so they bow naturally downward; but if once they were purified and purged, and unfettered by the Spirit of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to their native purity, they would more easily and willingly move upward, as you see the flame doth: and till this be done in you, we cannot expect that you will willingly and pleasantly walk in these pleasant walks <hi>after the Spirit</hi>; your walk will never be free and unconstrained in the paths of godliness. You may from some external motives and impulses move upward for a season, in some particular duties of Religion, as a stone cast up; but that impression is not from an inward principle, so it will not be constant and durable, but you will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the true Christian hath a spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, the root of the matter in him, this carries him upward in the wayes of obedience, after the motions and directions of Gods Spirit. At the beginning, indeed it is strait and uneasie to his flesh, but the difficulty is overcome, if once you begin well: The beginning (as you use to say) is the half of the whole. Truly, to be well entred, is half progresse, afterward the bulksom and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome lusts of the flesh are stript off, at least in a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59468:87"/>
and then the spirit moves easily and willingly; this walk becomes a recreation, that at first was a labour. Now <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> are as <hi>wings</hi> to mount the soul aloft; now its the good pleasure of the soul to walk to all well-pleasing. Indeed the way of this world is dirty and filthy; and therefore a Christian had need to watch continually, and to gird up his loyns, that his thoughts and affections hang not down to the earth, else they will take up much fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We had need to flee aloft above the ground, and not to come down too low near it, thinking withall to double out our journey, for we shall find, that because of the remnants of flesh within us, that this world hath a magnetical attractive vertue, to draw us down to it, if we be within the sphear of its activity. It is not good coming near fire with flax; we would endeavour to keep our hearts at much distance, and disingage them from lower consolations. This world is like the pestiferous Lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that kills all that flees over it, and makes them fall down into it; If we flie low upon the surface of it, we cannot choose but that spiritual life will be much extinguished; but to prevent this, we would take our flight straight upward after the Spirit, (for that is the proper motion of the more pure and spiritual part of this world) and give no rest, till we be out of the reach of that infection, till you be fully escaped the pollutions of the world.</p>
               <p>But if you cannot be perswaded to come off this way, that seems so pleasant to your flesh, that way which is the very course of the world, (for these are joyned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2.)

As you did abase your spirits to the service of the flesh here, and all your plowing, and labouring, and sowing was about it, the seed which you did cast in the ground was Fleshly lusts, earthly things, for the satisfaction of your flesh; so you shall reap of the flesh, Corruption, death and destruction, that shall make your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal spirits mortal and corruptible, and subject them to death and corruption with the body, as far as they are capable; it shall deprive them of all that which is their proper life and refreshment, and separat them eternally from the fountain of blessedness, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them out of Heaven, unto the fellowship of devils; and Oh! that corruption of the incoruptible spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>UNbelief is that which condemns the world: it involves in more condemnation then many other sins; not only because more universal, but especially because it shuts up men in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and secludes them from the remedy that is brought to light in the Gospel. By unbelief, I mean not only that careless neglect of Jesus Christ offered for salvation, but that which is the root of that, The inconsideration and ignorance of our desperat sinfulness, and irremediless misery without Christ; which not being laid to heart seriously, makes such slight and superficial intertainment of a Saviour and Redeemer. Man is truly miserable and unhappy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he know it or not; but truly it is an accession to his misery, that he knows it not, that he neither apprehends what he is now by nature, nor what he must shortly be made by Justice. Indeed, if there were no remedy to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

have a survey of both in these words, and the preceeding, of our despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat wickedness, and of our intollerable misery; for the present, by nature, we are enemies to God, and shortly we must be dealt with as enemies, as rebels to the most potent and glorious King, be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with death, an endless living death. Experience shews how hard a thing it is to perswade you that you are really under the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death: you will not suffer your hearts to believe your danger, left it interrupt your present pleasures of sin: Nay, you will flatter your selves with the fancied hope of immunity from this curse, and account it a cruel and rigorous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, That so many creatures made by God, should be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally miserable, or a sentence of it should be past on all flesh. Now, that which makes us hardly to believe this, is the unbelief and deep inconsideration of your sinfulnesse; therefore the Apostle, to make way for the former, adds, <hi>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God.</hi> Do not wonder then that your wayes and courses, your affections and inclinations bring forth that ghostly and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full end of death; seing all these are enmity to the greatest King, who alone hath the power of life and death: They have a perfect cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Amity and Unity is the very being and beauty of the world: This universe is made up of innumerable different kinds and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and all these climb and walk together by the bond of peace and concord among themselves, and with that <hi>One high understanding</hi> that directs all, and supream will of God that moves all. It is that link of union with God, that gives and preserves being and beauty in all the creatures, as the dependence of the ray upon the Sun, or the stream on the fountain, makes them what they are; which being interrupted, they cease to be what they were: <hi>All things continue as thou hast ordained them, for all are thy servants,</hi> Ps. 119.91. You see then this amity and union of subordination of the creatures to God, is not dissolved to this day: But wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted up unto, and priviledged with. Amity and friendship, you know, consists in an union of hearts and wills, and a communion of all good things; it makes two one, as much as two can be, by the conspiracy of their affections in one thing, and the joynt concurrence of their endeavours to communicat to one another what each hath, it takes away <hi>propriety,</hi> and it makes a <hi>community</hi> between persons. Now how happy was that amity? how blessed that friendship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man? Though mans goodness could not extend to God, yet his soul united to God by love and delight, and all that God had given him, returning that to the proper owner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his absolute dependence on him, and claiming inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and propriety in nothing, not in himself; and then on the other hand, the love and good-will of infinit God placed on man, and from that fountain all the streams of happiness issuing forth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man, the fulness of God opening up it self to him, and laying out it self towards him, God so far descending, as in a manner to become the creatures, to expose and dispose Himself, and all in him for poor mans use and comfort.</p>
               <p>How joyful was that amity! but the breaking of this bond of peace is as sad and grievous. There was a woful interposal between God and us, which hath separated these chief friends ever since the beginning, and that is <hi>sin,</hi> the seeds of all enmity and discord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this hath rent asunder the bond of amity, this hath made such a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

The carnal mind is not simply an <hi>enemy,</hi> but <hi>enmity</hi> it self; an <hi>enemy</hi> may reconcile again, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept terms of peace, but <hi>enmity</hi> cannot reconcile to amity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the very destruction of it self: the opposition of the heart is so perfect, that as soon may enmity unite with amity, and become one with it, as a carnal natural-mind can submit to Gods holy will. That which was at the beginning voluntary, is become necessary, and turned into the nature of an in-bred antipathy, that no art can cure. The <hi>fall</hi> was such a disjoynting of the soul from God, that no skill but infinit wisdom, no strength but Almighty power can set it right, and put it in the first posture again. It is true, there are not many who will openly and expresly denounce war against Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; it is not so incident that any man should have explicit plain thoughts of hatred against God, there are some common principles engraven by God in all mens minds, which serve as his witnesses against men, that God should be loved, served, adored, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped; that there is nothing so worthy of the desires of the soul. Now this general acknowledgment deludes the most part, for they take it for granted that they do love God with their heart, because their consciences bears witness that they ought to love him, as if it were all one to know our duty, and to do it. Who is there but he intertains himself with this good opinion of himself, that his heart is good and true to God; for, say you, Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such a confession of duty may be extorted from damned spirits, and therefore you would not draw this vail over the wretched wickedness of your natures, to the end that you may conceive well of yourselves:
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59468:91"/>
It is so far from extenuating or excusing, that the very conviction of the great obligation to love and obey God, is the greatest ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the enmity: it is this which makes it the purest ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

That you may know then wherein the enmity of your hearts consists, I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance it in three branches or evidences: There is an enmity in the understanding, that it cannot stoop to believing of the truth; there is an enmity in the will, that it cannot subject to obedience of Gods holy cammands; and this is extended also to a stubborn rebellion against the will of God, manifested in the dispensations of his providence: In a word, the natural and carnal mind is inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of faith, of obedience, and of submission. There are many truths revealed in the Scripture, that the natural man cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or know, for <hi>they are foolishness to him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. Some spirits there are lifted up above others, either by nature, or edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in which this rebellion doth more evidently appear; reason in them contends with Religion, and they will believe no more then they can give a reason for. There is a wisdom in some men, that despiseth the simplicity, or the inevidence of the Gospel, and accounts it foolishness: The carnal mind will needs start out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In these, and such like, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended wisdom of men hath taken liberty to act enmity, and to dispute against God. But truly, the rebellion and insubjection against the truth of God, is more generally practised even by the multitude of men, though in an unfree hidden way; How few do believe their own desperat wickedness, though God hath testified it of man?

Now you know (if you know any thing of your selves) how crosse and opposit, these hearts of yours are to His good pleasure; how they are set just contrary: and whence flowes all the murmurings, grudgings, discontents, griefs, cares and perplexities of men? but from this fountain, <hi>The rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the heart against God.</hi> There is nothing in all the creation, mutinous and malecontent, but the <hi>Heart of man.</hi> You see fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent examples of it, in the murmurations of the people in the wilderness.

But there is in some (and I fear a great many) not only an <hi>acted,</hi> but an <hi>affected enmity</hi> too. <hi>Enmity</hi> rising up to the maturity and ripness of <hi>malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and hatred of the Image of God, in all his children. Some are not willing to go to Heaven, yet they do not disturb others in their juorney: they can let others be religious about them, and rawly desire to be like them; but others there are, who will neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Heaven themselves, nor let others enter, as Christ speaks of the Pharisees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.13. They hate the light of anothers conversation, because their own deeds are evil, and are reproved and condemned by it. Its said <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.10. <hi>The witnesses tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them that dwelt on the earth.</hi> It is strange, what a torment it is to the world, that the godly are in it! piety is an eye-sore to many: if they could extirpat all that bears that image, they would think it sweet as bread, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. This is a more open and declared enmity against the God of Heaven; and yet I know it lurks under the mask of some other thing: you pretend to hate hypocrisie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Alas! what a scorn is it for profanity to hate hypocrisie? sure it is not because it is a sin, but for the very shaddow of piety it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: you hate the thing it self so perfectly, that you cannot indure the very picture of it. Do not deceive your selves, the true quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel is, because they run not to the same excesse of riot with you:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59468:95"/>
if they will lie, cozen, defraud, swear, and blaspheme as other men, you could indure to make them companions, as you do others; and the principle of that is, the <hi>enmity</hi> that was placed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: that mortal irreconciliable feud, betwixt the two fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, are two seeds, of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Satan.</hi>

               <p>But (as I told you) this enmity acts in a more subtile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible way in some, and is painted over with some fair colours, to hide the deformity of it: not only the grosser corruptions of men carry this stamp, but take even the most refined piece, or part in man; take his <hi>mind,</hi> take the <hi>excellency of his mind,</hi> even the <hi>wisdom</hi> of it; yet that hath <hi>enmity</hi> incorporated into it, and mixed with it throughout all; for <hi>the wisdom of the flesh is enmity with God,</hi> as it may be read, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the very <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of a natural man, which carries him to a distance from, and opposition with, the common defilements in the courses of men; yet that hath in its bosome, a more exquisite and refined <hi>enmity</hi> against God; and so the more spiritual and purified it be from grosser corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is the more active and powerful against God, because it is, as it were, <hi>the very spirit and quintessence of enmity.</hi> You see it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>how the wisdom of God is foolishness to the wisdom of the world,</hi> and then again, <hi>that the wisdom of the world is the greatest folly to the only wise God.</hi> Men, that have many natural advantages beyond others, are at this great disadvantage, They are more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to despise godliness, as too base and simple a thing, to adorn their natures: As Christ said of rich men, it may be said of wise men, of learned men, of civil and blameless persons, who have a smooth carriage before the world, <hi>how hard is it for such to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven? hard indeed,</hi> for they must be stript naked of that, ere they can enter through this narrow gate; I mean, the opinion and conceit, of any worth or excellency; and so dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in their own eyes, that they may go through this needles eye, without crushing.</p>
               <p>The stream of <hi>enmity</hi> runs under-ground often, and so hides it self under some other notion, till at length it burst forth openly: I find it commonly run in the secret channel of amity or friendship, to some other thing opposite to God: So <hi>Iames</hi> 4.4, <hi>the amity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59468:95"/>
Amity to the world, and Amity to our selves, <hi>self-love,</hi> and <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-love.</hi> We cannot denounce war openly against Heaven, but this is the next course, To joyn to, or associat with, any party that is contrary to God; and thus under the covert of friendship to our selves, and love to the world, we war against God, and destroys our own souls. I say, first, Amity to the world carries enmity to God in the bosome of it: and if you believe not this, hear the Apostles sharp and pungent question, <hi>you adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the Amity of the world is Enmity with God?</hi> He doth not speak only, to persons guilty of that crime, but to all natural men, who are guilty of an adultery or whoredome, of a more spiritual nature; but as abominable and more dangerous. There is a bond and special tye betwixt all men, and God their Maker, which oblidgeth them to consecrate and devout themselves, their affections and endeavours to his honour, especially when the Covenant of the Gospel is superadded unto that, in which Jesus Christ our Lord reveals himself, as having only right to us and our affections; as willing to bestow himself upon us; and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all the distance between him and wretched sinners, yet filling it up with his infinit love, and wonderful condescency, dimitting himself to the form of a servant, out of love, that so he might take us up, to be his chast Spouse, and adorn us with his beauty. This he challengeth of us, whoever hear and profess the Gospel: This is you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, this bond and tye, of a professed relation, to that glorious Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is foully broken by the most part, by espousing their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to this base world. Your hearts are turned off him unto stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that is, present perishing things: whereas the intendment of the Gospel is, <hi>To present you to Christ as pure Virgins,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.2. Truly your hearts are gone a-whoring after other things: the love of the world hath withdrawn you, or kept you in chains: these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent things are as snares, nets and bands; <hi>as an harlots hands and heart,</hi> Eccles. 7.26. they are powerful inchantments over you, which bewitch you to a base love, from an honourable and glorious love. O that you would consider it, my beloved! what opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is betwixt the love of the world, and the love of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59468:96"/>
Father; betwixt amity to that which hath nothing in it, but some present bait to your deceitful lusts; and amity to God, your only lawful Husband. Affection is a transforming and conforming thing, <hi>Si terram amas terra es,</hi> the love of God would purify thy heart, and lift it up to more similitude to him whom thou loves; but the love of the world assimulats it unto the world, makes it such a base and ignoble piece, as the earth is. Do you think marriage-affection can be parted? <hi>My wel-beloved is mine,</hi> therefore the Church is the <hi>Turtle,</hi> the <hi>Dove</hi> to Christ; of wonderful chastity: it never joyns but to one, and after the death of its marrow, it sighs and mourns ever after, and sits solitarily. You must retire, my beloved, and disingage from the love of other things, or you cannot love Christ: and if you love not Christ, you cannot have peace with the Father: and if you have not that peace, you cannot have life: this is the chain of life, the first link begins at the divorcement of all fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mer loves and beloved idols: once the soul must be loosed in desire and delight, and that link must be fastned upon the most lovely and desireable object, <hi>Christ, the desire of the Nations</hi>: and this draws alongs another link, of peace and life with it. Do not mistake it, Religion would not hinder or prejudge your lawful bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness in this world: O it were the most compendious way to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it, with more ease to your souls! But certainly it will teach you to exchange the love of these things, for a better and more heart-contenting love.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Amity to our selves is Enmity to God,</hi> and truly this is the last strong hold that holds out longest against God: when others may be beaten down, or surrendered: possibly a man may attain to this, To despise these lower things, as below his natural dignity and the excellency of his spirit: some may renounce much of that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with worldly and temporal things, as being fordid and base: but the <hi>enmity</hi> gets in to this strong and invisible tower of darkness, <hi>self-love,</hi> and <hi>pride</hi>: and therefore the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> makes this the last and chiefest, <hi>the pride of life,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.16. When the lusts of the eyes and flesh are in some measure abated, this is but growing: and what decreaseth of these, seems to accresce unto this: as if self-love and pride, did feed and nourish it self upon the ashes or consumption of other vices. Yea, it draws sap from <hi>graces and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> and grows thereby, till at length it kill that which nourished it: and indeed the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> seems to proceed to this, <hi>vers.</hi>

Is not <hi>self amity</hi> as well <hi>enmity,</hi> as the <hi>amity of the world</hi>? and therefore God opposes himself unto it, as the very grand enmity: <hi>self</hi> is the great <hi>lord,</hi> the <hi>arch-rebel,</hi> the head of all the opposition, that in which they do all center; and when all the inferiour Souldiers are captives, or killed, this is last in the fields, it lives first in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and dies last, <hi>prunum vivens, &amp; ultimum moriens.</hi> When a man is separated from many things, yet he may be but more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to <hi>himself,</hi> and so the further disjoyned from God. Of all the vile raggs of the old man, this is nearest the skin, and last put off: Of all the members, <hi>self</hi> is the <hi>heart,</hi> first alive, and last alive: When <hi>enmity</hi> is constrained to render up the outward members of the body, to yeeld them to a more smooth and fair carriage, to a civil behaviour, when the mind it self is forced to yeeld unto some light of truth, and knowledge of the Gospel; yet the <hi>enmity</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires into the <hi>heart,</hi> and fortifies it the stronger, by self-love, and self-estimation; as in winter, the encompassing cold, makes the heat to combine it self together in the bowels of the earth, and by this means the springs are hotter then in summer; so the surrounding light of the Gospel, or education, or natural honesty, drives the heat and strength of enmity inward, where it fortifies it self more: This is that accursed <hi>Antiperistasis,</hi> that is made by the concurrence of some advantages of knowledge, and civility, and such like. The blood of <hi>enmity</hi> against God, gets in about the heart when it is chased for fear out of the outward man: Therefore the very first and fundamental principle of Christianity, is, <hi>Let a man deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and so he shall be my Disciple</hi>; he must become a fool in his own eyes, though he be wise, that he may be wise, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. he must become as ungodly, though godly, that he may be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. he must forsake himself, that he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed find himself, or get a better self in another, he must <hi>not eat much honey, that is not good,</hi> it would swell him though it be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant: <hi>he must not search his own glory,</hi> or reflect much upon it, if he would be a follower and friend of Christ. Look how much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you engage to your selves, to esteem, or desire to be esteemed of others, to reflect with complacency on your selves, to mind your own satisfaction and estimation in what you do, so much you disingage from Jesus Christ, for these are contrary points: Its a direct motion towards Christ, its an inverse and backward motion
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59468:97"/>
towards our selves; and so much as we move that way, we promove not, but loses of our way, and are further from the true end. <hi>Ezekiels</hi> living creatures, may be an emblem of a Christian motion, <hi>he returns not as he goes,</hi> he makes a straight line to God, whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he turn him; but nature makes all crooked lines, they seem to go forth in obedience to God, but they have a secret unseen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection into its own bosom. And this is the greatest act of <hi>enmity To idolize God, and Deifie our selves</hi>: we make him a cypher, and sacrifice to our selves: his peculiar incommunicable property, of <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> that we do sacrilegiously attribute to our selves, the beginning of our motions, and end of them too.

               <p>IT is a kind of happiness to men, to please them upon whom they depend, and upon whose favour their well-being hangs. It is the Servants happiness to please his Master, the Courtiours to please his Prince, and so generally, whosoever they be that are joyned in mutual relations, and depend one upon another; that which makes all pleasant, is this, <hi>To please one another.</hi> Now, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly all the dependencies of creatures one upon another, are but shaddows unto the absolute dependance of creatures upon the Creator, <hi>for in him we live and move and have our being</hi>: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of the ray upon the Sun, of the stream upon the fountain, is one of the greatest in nature; but all creatures have a more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary connexion with this <hi>fountain-being,</hi> both in their being, and well being: they are nothing but a flux and emanation of his power and pleasure, and as the Psalmist expresseth it, <hi>he hides his face, and they are troubled, he takes away their breath, and they die, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their dust: he sends forth his spirit, and they are created, and he renews the face of the earth,</hi> Psal. 104.29, 30. You may extend this to the being and well-being, happiness and misery of creatures, our souls which animat our bodies, are but his breath which he breathed into the dust, and can retract it when he pleaseth: the life of our souls, the peace, and tranquility, and satisfaction is another breathing of his spirit, and another look of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and as he pleases to withdraw it, or interpose between his face and us, so we live or die, are blessed or miserable. Our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or well-being, hath a more indispensible dependance on him, then the image in the glasse hath upon the living face.</p>
               <p>If it be so, then certainly of all things in the world, it concerns us nearest <hi>how to please him</hi> and be at peace with him. If we be in good terms with him, <hi>in whose hand our breath is, and whose are all our wayes.</hi> Dan. 5.23. Upon whose countenance our misery or felicity hangs; then certainly, we are happy: if we please him, it

matters not whom we displease; for he alone hath absolute, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled and universal power over us, as our Saviour speaks, <hi>over both soul and body.</hi> We may expect that his good pleasure towards us will not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fied, but in communicating his fulness, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting his favour to us, especially since the goodness of God is so exundant, as to overflow even to the wicked world, and vent it self as out of superabundance, in a river of goodness throughout the whole earth; how much more will it run abundantly towards them whom he is well pleased with, and therefore the <hi>Psalmist</hi> cryes out, as being already full in the very hope and expectation of it, That he would burst, if he had not the vent of admiration and praise, <hi>O how great is His goodness, and how excellent His loving-kindness laid up for them that fear him</hi>! Psal. 31.19. <hi>and</hi> 36.7. But on the other hand, how incomparable is the misery of them, who cannot please God; even though they did both please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and all others for the present: to be at odds with him, in whom alone they can subsist, and without whose savour, is nothing but wretchedness and misery, O! that must be the worst and most cursed estate imaginable: to be in such a state, as do what they can, they cannot please him, whom alone to please is of only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, what can be invented to that? Now, if you ask who they are that are such? the words speak it plainly, in way of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the former doctrine, <hi>Therefore they that are in the flesh, cannot please God.</hi> Not, <hi>they in whom there is flesh</hi>; for there is remnants of that in the most spiritual man in this life: we cannot attain here to Angelick purity, though it should be the aim and endeavour of every Christian. But <hi>they that are in the flesh,</hi> or <hi>after the flesh,</hi> importing the predominion of that, and an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal thraldom of nature unto it, which indeed is the state of all men that are but once born, till a second birth come, by the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>The ground of this may be taken from the foregoing discourse, and it is chiefly twofold, one is, <hi>because they are not in Iesus Christ, in whom his soul is well pleased</hi>; another is, <hi>because they cannot suit and frame their carriage to his pleasure:</hi> since all mankind hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under the displeasure of the most high God, by sinning against him, in preferring the pleasure of the flesh, and the pleasure of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to the pleasure of God, there can be no atonement found to pacifie him, no sacrifice to appease him, no ransome to satisfie his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59468:100"/>
Justice, but that one perfect offering for sin, <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for the sins of the elect world. This the Father accepts, in the name of sinners; and in testimony of his acceptance, he did two several times, by a voice from Heaven, declare first to a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. and then to the beloved Disciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. and both times, with great Majesty and solemnity (as did become him) <hi>that this is his well-beloved Son, in whom his soul is well pleased.</hi> It pleased God, to make the stream of his love, to take another channel after mans sin, and not to run immediatly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wretched man; but he turned the current of his love another way, to his own Son, whom he choosed for that end, to reconcile man and bring him into favour: and his love going about, by that compass, comes in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssue, towards poor sinners, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er force. He hath appointed Christ <hi>the meeting-place</hi> with sinners, <hi>the dayes-man to lay his hands on both</hi>; and therefore he is <hi>God</hi> to lay his hand on <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> to lay his hand on <hi>man,</hi> and bring both into a peaceable, and amicable conjunction. Now then, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are not in Iesus Christ,</hi> as is spoken, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. certainly <hi>they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not please God,</hi> do what they can; because God hath made Christ the Center, in which he would have the good pleasure of sinners meeting with his good pleasure; and therefore <hi>without faith it is impossible to please God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. not so much for the excellency of the act it self, as for the well-pleasing object to it, <hi>Christ.</hi> The love of the Father is terminat in Him, His Justice is sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fied in Him. His love is well pleased with the excellency of His person: He finds in him an object of delight, which is no where else: and His Justice is well pleased with the sufficiency and worthiness of His ransome: and without this compass, there is neither satisfaction to the one, nor to the other: so then whatsoever you are, how high soever your degree in the world, how sweet soever your disposition, let your natures be never so good, your carriage never so smooth, yet certainly there is nothing in all, that can please God, either by an object of love, or a price for justice. You are under that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal displeasure, which will fall on and crush you to pieces: moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains will not be so heavy, as it will appear in that great day of his wrath, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. I say, you cannot come from under that imminent weight of eternal wrath, unless you be found in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that blessed place of immunity and refuge, if you have not forsaken your selves, and your own natures, and denied your own
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59468:101"/>
righteousnnss as dung, to be found in him, cloathed with his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and satisfaction. If the delight and pleasure of your soul, do not co-incide and fall in at one place, with the delight and good pleasure of the Father, that is, upon his well-beloved Son. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the pleasure and good will of God hath not as yet fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and met with you; therefore if you would please God, be pleased with Christ: and you cannot do him a greater pleasure, <hi>then believe in him,</hi> Joh. 5.23. that is, absolutely resign your selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, for salvation and sanctification.</p>
               <p>The other ground is, <hi>Such as are in the flesh cannot frame their spirits, affections and wayes, to Gods good pleasure</hi>; for their very wisdome, the very excellency that is in them, is <hi>enmity to God,</hi> and cannot subject to His Law; and therefore <hi>they cannot please him.</hi> I am sure, you may easily reflect upon your selves, and find not with much search, but upon all these, as the Prophet <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.34. speaks, that it is not the study and businesse you have undertaken, <hi>To please God,</hi> but the bent, and main of your aims and endeavours is, to please your selves, or to please men. This makes many mens pains, even in Religion, displeasing to God; because they do not indeed mind his pleasure, but their own, or others satisfaction: what they do, is but to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Truly, <hi>that which is in great account among men, is abomination to God,</hi> as our Saviour speaks of the very righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and professed piety of the Pharisees, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25. the more you please your selves and the world, the further you are from pleasing God. The very beginning of pleasing God, is, when a soul falls in displeasure at it self, and abhorrency of his own loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somness; therefore it is said, <hi>The humble and contrite spirit I will look unto, and dwell with him, and such sacrifices do please God,</hi> Isai. 66.2.

               <p>APplication is the very life of the Word, at least it is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary condition, for the living operation of it: the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Word to the hearts of hearers by Preaching, and the application of your hearts again to the Word by meditation, these two meeting together, and striking one upon another, will yeeld fire. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of <hi>a right dividing of the word of truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.13. not that ordinary way of cutting it all in parcells, and dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering it, by manifold divisions, which I judge makes it loss much of its vertue, which consists in union, though some have pleasure in it, and think it profitable; yet I do not see that this was the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick way, that either they preached it themselves or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it to others; but rather he means, the real distribution of the food of souls unto their various conditions, as it is the duty of a Steward to be both faithful and wise in that, to give every one their own portion: And as it is the Pastors duty thus to distribute
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59468:102"/>
the Word of God unto you, so it is your part to apply it home to your selves, without which application, the former division of the Word aright, will not seed your souls: If every man act not the Pastor to his own heart, it cannot profit. Now indeed, the right application of the Word to souls, is the difficultest part of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it is the hardest point of hearing; in which there needs both much affection and much direction, the one to be serious and earnest in it, the other to be wise and prudent in it: without suitable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it will not passe into the substance of the soul to feed it, no more then the stomack can digest meat, that wants convenient heat; and without discretion and wisdom, to choose our own por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will not yeeld convenient food, but increase humours and superfluities, or distemper our spirits. That which I look at in these words, is, the discretion and prudence of this wise Steward in Gods House, after he hath represented the wretched and woful estate of <hi>them that are in the flesh,</hi> how their natures cannot but act enmity against God, how their end is death and destruction, he subjoyns in due season a suitable encouragement to believers, <hi>you are not in the flesh,</hi> &amp;c. Because there is no man so sensible of that corruption that dwells within, as he that is in part renewed; as pain to a healthful body is most sensible, and as the abundance of light makes a larger discovery of what is disordered and defiled in the house; therefore such upon the hearing of the accursed estate of men in nature, of their natural rebellion against God, and Gods displeasure against them, they are most ready, I say, to apply suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus they are in Gods promise, and you would learn thus to look upon it, not according to their present inequality in strength, but that future inequality and difference, which is wrapt up in the promise of God, and the seed whereof is in you.</p>
               <p>As there is a woful penury and scantnesse of examination in the most part of men, who are wholly spent without, and take no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to recognize their own souls; so there is a miserable excesse, and hurtful superfluity of examination and disputation among many of Gods children, who are alwayes in reflection, and almost never in action, so much <hi>on knowing what is,</hi> that they take not much leasure to <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>pursue what is not.</hi> Truly, I think when the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But simply and plainly, I think, he intended to have Christianity begin at examination, as the first returning of a soul, must needs be upon some inquiry and search of the way, and

               <p>But I would tell a more profitable improvement of such repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of the sinfull and miserable estate of the ungodly world, then you use to make of it: and, I think, it is that the Apostles intend, in the frequent turning the eyes of Saints about, to the accursed state of the world; <hi>partly consolation, and partly some provocation to suitable walking</hi>: things that are opposite, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

it might do well here, when a Christian is grieved and disquieted, because he hath not attained to that desired measure of the Image of God, and fellowship with him, To cast a look about him, to the miserable and hopeless estate of so many thousands, who have the image of Satan so visibly engraven on them, and have no inward stirring after this blessed Image; and reflect a little backward, to the hole of the pit whence he was taken, to look upon that primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive estate that grace found him into, so loathsome as is described, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. Would not such a double sight, think you, make him break out in admiration, and be powerful to silence and compose his spirit? O to think, that I was once in that black roll, of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Kingdom! <hi>such were some of you,</hi> and then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, That my name was taken out, and washed by the blood of Christ, to be enrolled in the Register of Heaven; what an astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing is it! you see, in nature, God hath appointed contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and varieties to beautifie the world; and certainly, many things could not be known how good and beneficial they are, but by the smart and hurt of that which is opposite to them: as you could not imagine the good of light, but by some sensible experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the evil of darkness: Heat, you could not know the benefit of it, but by the vexation of cold. Thus he maketh one to commend another, and both to beautifie the world. It is thus in art, contrariety and variety of colours and lines, make up one beauty: diversity of sounds makes a sweet harmony. Now this is the art and wisdom of God, in the dispensation of his grace, He setteth the misery of some, beside the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of others; that each of them may aggravat another: he puts light beside darkness, spirit, sore-against flesh; that so Saints may have a double accession to their admiration at the goodness and grace of God, and to their delight and complacency in their own happiness: he presents the state of men out of Christ, that you may wonder how you are translated, and may be so abundantly satisfied, as not to exchange your portion for the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then,</hi> I say, <hi>this may provoke us, and perswade us to more suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able walking.</hi> Doth he make such a difference, O do not you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make it again! do not confound all again, by your walking after the course of the world: conformity to the world is a confusion of what God hath separated: Has infinit grace translated you from

that kingdom of darkness to light, O then walk in that light, as children of light! are ye such, owne your stations: consider your relations, and make your selves ashamed at the very thoughts of sin: he points out the deformed and ugly face of the conversation of the world, that you may fall in love with the beauty of holiness: as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> wont to let their child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Certainly, the Lord calls you to mind often what you have been, and what the world about you is; not to engage you to it, but to alienat your minds from the deformity of sin, and to commend to you the beauty of obedience. You would learn to make this holy use and advantage, of all the wickedness the world lyeth into, To behold in it, as in a glasse, your own image and likenesse; that when you use to hate or despise others, you may rather loath and dislike your selves, as having that same common nature; and wonder at the goodness of God that makes such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, where none was. This were the way to make gain of the most improfitable thing in the world, that is the sins of other men; for ordinarily the seeing and speaking of them, doth rather dispose us, and incline us to more liberty to sin. Many look on them with delight, some with contempt and hatred of these that commit them, but few know how to speak or look on sin it self with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or themselves, because of the seeds of it within them with abhorrency. I would think if we were circumspect in this, the worse the world is, we might be the better, the worse the times are, we might spend it better, the more pride we see, it might make us the more humble, the more impiety and impurity abounds it might provoke us to a further distance from, and disconformity with, the world: Thus if we were wise we might extract gold out of the dung-hill, and suck honey out of the most poysonable weed.

               <p>As for you, whose woful estate is here described, who are yet in the flesh, and enemies to God by nature, I would desire you to be stirred up at the consideration of this, that there are some who are delivered out of that prison, and that some have made peace with

He is one in whom the Spirit of Christ dwells, that makes him one after the Spirit, that makes him one of Christs, because it is the Spirit of Christ. As if you define what a man is, you could not do it better then thus, he is one endowed with a reasonable soul: So the Apostle gives you the very soul and form of a Christian, which differenceth from all others.

And from this woful defect, flows the alienation of the whole soul from the life of God; that primitive light being eclipsed, the soul is separated from the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Heaven: and as <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> soul acted only in a brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal way, when driven out amongst beasts; so the soul of man, being driven out from the presence of the Lord, may act in a way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to beasts, or in some rational way in things that concern this life, but it is wholly spoiled of that divine life of communion with God: it cannot taste, smell or savour such things.

absolute necessity is there of such a Spirit as this, to repair and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ruinous spirit of man, to quicken and enlighten the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mind of man! even <hi>that Spirit,</hi> that made it at first a glorious Palace for God, <hi>that Spirit</hi> that breathed the soul into the formed clay, must repair these breaches, and creat all again. Now when <hi>the Spirit of Christ</hi> enters into this vile and ruinous cottage, he repairs it, and reforms it, he strikes out lights in the heart, and by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful eye-salve, makes the eyes open to see: He creats a new light within, which makes him behold the light shining in the Gospel; and behold all things are new, <hi>himself,</hi> new, because now most loath-some and vile; the <hi>world</hi> new, because now appears nothing but vanity in the very perfection of it; and <hi>God</hi> new, because another Majesty, glory, excellency and beauty shines into the soul, then ever it apprehended. And as the Spirit enlightens, so He enlivens this Tabernacle or Temple, He kindles a holy fire in his affections, which must never go out; it is such as cannot be kindled i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The spirit within the soul is a fire to consume his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to burn up his drosse and vanity: Christ comes in like a refiner, with the fire of the Spirit, and purges away earthly lusts, and makes the love of the heart pure and clean, to burn upward toward Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This <hi>Spirit</hi> makes a Christian-soul move willingly toward God, in the wayes that seemed most unpleasant: It is an active prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within him that cannot rest, till it rest in its place of eternal rest, and delight in God. And then the <hi>Spirit</hi> reforms this house, by casting out all these wild beasts that lodged in it, these savage and unruly affections that domineered in man: this strong man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in casts them out: there is much rubbish in old waste Palaces, <hi>Neb.</hi> 4.2.

therefore the Spirit enters by blood and water. There are idols in the heart, to which the soul is much engaged, it unites and closes with them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. and these must be cleansed and washed out. There is much deceit in the heart, and this lyes clossest to it, and is engrossed into it: and indeed this will take the help of fire to separate it; for that is of the most active nature to separate things of a diverse nature: the Spirit must by these take out your drosse, and all this the Spirit will not do alone, but honours you with the fellowship of this work; and therefore you must lay your account, that the operation and reformation of this house, for so glorious a Guest, will be laborious in the mean time: But O how infinitly is that compensed! one hours fellowship with him alone, when all strangers are cast out, will compense all, will make all to be forgotten; the pain of mortification will be swallowed up in the pleasure of his inhabitation: <hi>When I shall awake I shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with thy likeness.</hi> When He shall take up house fully in you, it will satisfie you to the full.

It is that marriage between Christ and his Church, for which it would appear this world was builded, to be a Palace to celebrat it into; and especially the upper-house, Heaven, was made glorious for that great day, where it shall be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized. The first, <hi>in order of time,</hi> that was made by God himself in paradise, certainly to represent a higher mystery, The marriage of the second <hi>Adam</hi> with his Spouse, which is taken out of his bloody side, as the Apostle imports, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. Now there is the greatest inequality and disproportion between the parties, <hi>Christ and sinners</hi>; so that it would seem a desperate matter, to bring two such distant and unequal natures to such a neer union, as may cast a copy to all unions and relations of the creatures. But He, who at first, made a kind of marriage between Heaven and Earth, in the composure of man, and joyned together an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

                  </gap>easable: And truly, we may conceive the Lord was but making way for this greater mystery of the union of Christ with us, when he joyned the breath of Heaven with the dust of the earth: in this he gave some representation of another more mysterious conjunction. Now, the way, that the wisdome and love of God, hath found out to bring about this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, is this, Because there was such an infinite distance, between the only begotten Son of God, who is the expresse character of his Image, and the brightness of his Glory, and Us sinful mortal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whose foundation is in the dust; therefore it pleased the Father, out of His good-will to the match, To send his Son down among men, and the Son out of his love to take on our fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh, and so fill up that distance with his low condescendence, to be partaker of flesh and blood with the children. And now, what the Lord spoke of man fallen, in a holy kind of <hi>irony</hi> or mock, <hi>Behold he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as one of us,</hi> that men may truly say of the Son of God, not fallen down from Heaven, but come down willingly, <hi>Lo he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as one of us, like us in all things, except sin,</hi> which hath made us unlike our selves. This bond of union, you have in the <hi>vers.</hi> 3. Christ so infinitly above sinners, and higher then the Heavens, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down so low, to be as like sinners as might be, or could be profitable for us, <hi>in the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eness of sinful flesh,</hi> &amp;c. But yet this bond is not neer enough, that conjunction seemeth but general and infirm; both because it is in some manner common to all mankind, who shall not be all advanced to this priviledge. By taking on our nature, he cometh nearer to humane nature, but not to some beyond others; and besides, the distance is not filled up this way, because there is a great disproportion between that nature in Christ, and in us: In Him, it is holy, and undefiled, and seperated from sin; but in Us, it is unclean and immersed into sin; so that albeit he be nearer us, as a man; yet he is far distant and unlike us, a holy, perfect man: Now, what fellowship can be between light and darkness? as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of the marriage of Christians with Idolaters: much greater distance and disagreement, is between Christ and us. Therefore, it seemeth that some of us must be changed and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: But <hi>Him</hi> it may not be, he cannot become liker us than by partaking of our flesh; for if he had become a sinner <hi>indeed,</hi> he would have become so like us, that he could not help himself nor
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59468:109"/>
us either: this would eclipse the glory and happiness of the marriage: but in that he came as near as could be, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But since he can come no lower, and can be made no liker us in the case we are in; then certainly (if the match hold) We must become liker him, and raised up out of our miserable estate, to some suitableness to his holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore the love and wisdom of God, to fill up the distance compleatly, and effectuat this happy conjunction, that the creation seemeth to groan for, (<hi>for</hi> vers. 22. <hi>the whole creation is pained till it be accomplished</hi>) he hath sent his blessed <hi>Spirit to dwell in Vs,</hi> and to transform our natures, and <hi>make them partakers of the divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. as Christ was partaker of humane nature: and thus the distance shall be removed, when a blessed Spirit is made flesh, and a fleshly man made spirit, then they are near the day of espousals: and this indwelling of the spirit, is the last link of the chain, that fastens us to Christ, and maketh our flesh in some measure like His holy flesh. By taking on our flesh, Christ became bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh: But the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh mutual, when we receive the spirit; we become <hi>bone of His bone, and flesh of His flesh,</hi> as it is expressed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. In al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to the creation of <hi>Eve,</hi> and her marriage to <hi>Adam</hi>: the ground of the marriage is, That near bond of union, because she was taken out of man, and therefore because of his flesh and bone, she was made one flesh with him; even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea, it is nearer then that too; for we are said, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be <hi>one flesh</hi> with Christ, but <hi>one spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one spirit</hi>; because he is animated and quickned, by one Spirit, that same Spirit of Christ: and indeed <hi>spirits</hi> are more capable of union, and more fit to embosome one with another, then <hi>bodies</hi>; therefore the nearest union conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,

               <p>Now, my beloved, you see what way this great marriage, that heaven and earth are in a longing expectation after, shall be brought about. Christ he did forsake his Fathers house, when he lest that holy habitation, his Fathers bosome, a place of marvellous delight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. <hi>And descended into the lowest parts of the earth,</hi> Eph. 4.9. And, <hi>He came out from the Father into the world,</hi> John 16.28. This was a great journey to meet with poor sinners. But, that there may be a full and intire meeting, <hi>you must leave and forsake your fathers house too; and forget your own people,</hi> Psal. 45.10. You must give an intire renounce to all former lovers, if you would be His; all former bonds and engagments must be broken, that this may be tyed the faster: And to hold to the subject in hand, you must forsake and forget the flesh, and be possessed of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: as he came down to our flesh, you must rise up to meet him in the Spirit: the Spirit of Christ must indeed prevent you, and take you out of that natural posture you are born into, and bring you a great journey from <hi>your selves,</hi> that you may be joyned unto <hi>Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Spirit of Christ</hi> is his messenger and ambassadour, sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand to fit you, and suit you for the day of Espousals; and therefore he must have a dwelling, and constant abode in you. This <hi>indwelling,</hi> imports <hi>A special familiar operation, and the perpetuity or continuance of it.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> is every where in his <hi>being,</hi> and he worketh every where too; but here he hath a special and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar work in commission, To reveal the love of God in Christ, to engage the soul to love him again, to prepare all within for the great day of Espousals, to purifie and purge the heart from all that is displeasing to Christ, to correspond between Christ and his Spouse, between Heaven and Earth, by making intercession for her when she cannot pray for her self, as you find here, <hi>vers.</hi> 26. and so sending up the news of the souls panting and breathing after Christ, sending up her love, groans and sighs to her beloved, giving intelligence of all her necessities to Him, who is above, in the place of an <hi>Advocat</hi> and <hi>Interceeder</hi>; and then bringing back from Heaven light, and life, direction from her Head (for the Spirit must lead in all truth) and consolation, for Christ hath appointed the spirit,

to supply his absence, and to comfort the soul in the mean time till he come again: you have this mutual and reciprocal knot in 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, by the spirit that he hath given.</hi> It is much nearness <hi>to dwell one with another,</hi> but much greater, <hi>to dwell one in another</hi>: and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal, such a wonderful interchange in it, <hi>we in him,</hi> and <hi>he in us:</hi> for the Spirit carries the soul to Heaven, and brings Christ, as it were, down to the earth: He is the Messenger that carries Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters between both: our prayers to Him, and His prayers for us, and love-tokens to us, <hi>the anointing that teacheth us all things,</hi> from our husband, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27. and <hi>revealing to us the things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.12. giving us the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the Spirit where he dwells, hath gotten the command of that house: all the power is put in his hand, and resigned to him; for where he dwells, he must rule, as good reason is, He is about the greatest work that is now to do in the world, the repairing and renewing of the ruines and breaches of mans spirit, which was the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O, why are our hearts shut, when his hand is open! Again, I would exhort you in Jesus Christ, to intertain the Spirit suitably, and this shall keep Him. To this purpose are these exhortations, <hi>Grieve not the Spirit, Eph.</hi> 4.30. and <hi>quench not the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.19. There is nothing can grieve Him, but sin: and if you intertain <hi>that,</hi> you cannot retain Him. He is a Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If you make his holy Temple an unclean cage for hateful birds, or a Temple for Idols, how can it but grieve him? and if you grieve the Spirit, certainly the Spirit will grieve you, will make you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it at the heart.

               <p>GODS <hi>presence</hi> is his <hi>working</hi>: his presence in a soul by his Spirit, is his working in such a soul in some special manner, not common to all men, but peculiar to them whom he hath chosen. Now his <hi>dwelling</hi> is nothing else, but a continued, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and endlesse working in a soul, till he have conformed all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to the Image of His Son. The soul is the <hi>office-house,</hi> or <hi>work-house</hi> that the Spirit hath taken up, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rame in it the most curious piece of the whole Creation, even to restore and repair that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-piece which came last from Gods hand, <hi>ab ultima manu,</hi> and so was the chiefest, I mean, the Image of God, in righteousness and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. Now, <hi>this</hi> is the bond of union between God and us: <hi>Christ</hi> is the bond of union with God, but the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the bond of union with Christ. <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>peace</hi> between God and us, that makes of two one, but the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>link</hi> between Christ and us, whereby he hath immediat and actual interest in us, and we in Him. I find the union between Christ and a soul shadowed out in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, by the nearest relations among creatures, (for truly these are but shadows, and that is the body or substance) and because an union that is mutual, is nearest, it is often so expressed, as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports an interchangeable relation, a reciprocal conjunction with Christ. The knot is cast on both sides to make it strong, Christ in us, and we in him: God dwelling in us, and we in Him: and both by this <hi>one Spirit,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.13. <hi>Hereby we know that God dwelleth in us, and we in him, by his Spirit which he hath given us.</hi> You find it often in <hi>Iohn,</hi> who being most possessed with the love of Christ, and most sensible of his love, could best expresse it: <hi>I in them, and they in me: He that keepeth his commands dwelleth in Him, and he in Him</hi>; as the names of married persons are spelled through other, so doth he spell out this in-dwelling: its not <hi>cohabitation,</hi> but <hi>inhabitation</hi>; neither that alone singlely, but <hi>mutual inhabitation,</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:59468:112"/>
which amounts to a kind of <hi>Penetration,</hi> the most intimat, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat presence imaginable. <hi>Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pplication of a Saviour to a sinfull soul. It is the very applying of his blood and sufferings to the wound that sin hath made in the conscience: the laying of that sacrifice propitiatory to the wounded conscience, is that which heals it, pacifies it, and calms it. A Christian by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the offer of the Gospel cordially and affectionatly, brings in Christ offered into his house, and then <hi>salvation</hi> comes with him. Therefore, <hi>believing</hi> is <hi>receiving,</hi> John. 1. the very opening of the heart, to let in an offered Saviour; and then Christ thus possessing the heart by <hi>faith.</hi> He works by <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. Love</hi> hath this special vertue in it, that it transports the soul, in a manner, out of it self, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved: Cant. 1.9. <hi>anima est ubi amat non ubi animat</hi>: the fixing and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of the heart on God, is a <hi>dwelling in Him</hi>; for the constant and most continued residence of the most serious thoughts and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, will be their dwelling in the all fulness and riches of grace in Jesus Christ: as the spirit dwelleth where he worketh, so the soul dwelleth where it delighteth: its complacency in God, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a frequent issue or outgoing to Him in desires and breathings after Him: And by means of this same, God dwelleth in the heart: for <hi>love</hi> is the opening up of the inmost chamber of the heart to Him, it brings in the beloved in to the very secrets of the soul, <hi>to lye all night betwixt His breasts, as a bundle of myrrhe.</hi> Cant. 1.13. And indeed all the sweet odours of holy duties, and all the performing of good works, and edifying speeches, spring out only, and are sent forth from this bundle of myrrhe that lyes betwixt the breasts of a Christian, in the inmost of his heart, from Christ dwelling in the affections of the soul.</p>
               <p>Now, this being the bond of union betwixt Christ and us, it follows necessarily that whoever hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His, and this is subjoyned for prevention or removal of the misapprehensions and delusions of men in their self-judgings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Because <hi>self-love</hi> blinds our eyes, and maketh our hearts deceive themselves: we are given to this self-flattery, to pretend and claim to an interest in Jesus Christ, even though there be no more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for it, then the external relation that we have to Christ, as
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59468:113"/>
members of his visible body, or partakers of a common influence of his Spirit. There are some external bonds and tyes to Christ, which are like a knot that may easily be loosed if any thing get hold of the end of it, as by our relations to Christ by baptisme, hearing the word, your outward covenanting to be his people: all these are loose unsure knots: It is as easie to untie them, as to tie them, yea, and more easie; and yet many have no other relation to Christ then what these make. But it is only the <hi>Spirit of Christ</hi> given to us that intitles and interesseth us in Him, and Him in us; its the <hi>Spirit</hi> working in your souls mightily and continually, making your hearts temples, for the offering of the sacrifice of prayer and praises, casting out all idols out of these temples, that He alone may be adored and worshipped, by the affectionate service of the heart, purging them from all filthinesse of flesh and spirit; It is the <hi>Spirit,</hi> I say, thus dwelling in men, that maketh them living members of the true body of Christ, lively joyned to the head, <hi>Christ,</hi> this maketh him yours, and you his: by vertue of this He may command you as His own, and you may use and imploy Him as your own. Now, for want of this in most part of men, they also want this living, saving-interest in Christ: they have no real, but an imaginary and notional propriety and right to the Lord Jesus; for Christ must first take possession of us by His <hi>Spirit,</hi> before we have any true right to <hi>Him,</hi> or can willingly resign our selves to Him, and give Him right over us. What shall it profite us, my beloved, to be called Christians, and to esteem our selves so, if really we be none of Christs? shall it not highten our condemnation, so much the more, that we desire to passe for such, and give out our selves so; and yet have no inward aquaintance and interest in Him, whose name we love to bear? Are not the most part shadows and pictures of true Christians, bodies without the soul of Christianity, that is, <hi>the Spirit of Christ,</hi> whose hearts are treasures of wickednesse and deceit, and stor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It may be known what treasure fills the heart, by that which is the constant and common vent of it, as our Saviour speakes, <hi>Matth</hi> 15.19. and 12.34, 35. <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks,</hi> the feet walks, and the hand works: Consider then, if the Spirit of God dwelleth in such unclean habitations and dark dungeons, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no uncleanness or darkness of the house can hinder him to come in; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, my beloved, do you think this a light matter, To be disowned by Jesus Christ: Truly, the word of Christ, which is the character of all our evidences and rights for Heaven, disowns many, as bastards and dead members, withered branches; and certainly, according to this word He will judge you: <hi>the word that I have spoken shall judge you in the last day</hi>: O that is a heavy word! you have the very rule and method of proceeding laid down before you, now which shall be punctually kept at that great day: Now, why do you not read your ditty and condemnatory sentence here registred?

Now the death of the body succeeds thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> souls death, and that is the separation of the soul from the body, most suitable, seeing the soul was turned from the fountain spirit to the body, that the body should by his command return to dust, and be made the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that statute and appointment of Heaven hath thus linked it, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death comes Iudgment</hi>: Because the soul in the body would not be sensible of its separation from God, but was wholly taken up with the body, neglecting and miskenning that infinit losse of Gods favour and face; therefore the Lord commands it to go out of the body, that it maythen be sensible of its infinit loss of God, when it is separated from the body; that it may then have leasure to reflect upon it self, and find its own surpassing misery; and then indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit pain and infinit losse conjoyned, eternal banishment from the presence of that blessed Spirit, and eternal torment within it self, these two concurring, what posture do you think such a soul will be into? There are some <hi>earnest</hi> of this in this life, when God reveals his terrour, <hi>and sets mens sins in order before their face,</hi> O how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable is it! and more insupportable then many deaths.

Now, my beloved, if it be so now, while the soul is in the body, drowned in it, what will be the case of the soul sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the body, when it shall be all <hi>one sense</hi> to reflect and consider it self.</p>

This is the sting of death indeed, worse then a thousand deaths, to a soul that apprehends it; and the lesse it is apprehended, the worse it is; because it is the more certain and must shortly be found, when there is no brazen serpent to heal that sting. Now, what comfort have you provided against this day? what way do you think to take out this sting? Truly, there is no balm for it, no Physitian for it, but one; and that the <hi>Christian</hi> is only acquainted with: <hi>He in whom Christ is,</hi> he hath this soveraign antidot against the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Christ who giveth us the victory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.55. The ground of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and that which a Christian hath to oppose to all the sorrows and pains and fears of death mustred against him, is threefold, <hi>one,</hi> that death is <hi>not real,</hi> a <hi>second,</hi> that is <hi>not total</hi>; even that which is, <hi>and then</hi> that it is <hi>not perpetual.</hi> This last is contained in the next <hi>vers.</hi> the second expressed in this <hi>vers.</hi> and the first may be understood or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in it. That the nature of death is so far changed, that of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment it is become a medicine, of a punishment for sin, it is turned into the last purgative of the soul from sin; and thus the sting of it is taken away, that relation it did bear to the just wrath of God. And now the body of a Christian under appointment to die for sin, that is, for the death of sin, the eternal death of sin. Christ having come under the power of death, hath gotten power over it, and spoiled it of its stinging vertue, he hath taken away the poysonable ingredient of the curse, that it can no more hurt them that are in Him, and so it is not now vested with that piercing and wounding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of punishment: though it be true that sin was the first in-lett of death, that it first opened the sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

vents it self: therefore it hath pleased God in His infinit goodnesse, to continue the former appointment of death, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a new and living consideration, to take down this infected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed tabernacle, as the houses of leprosie were taken down under the Law, that so they might be the better cleansed, and this is the last purification of the soul from sin. And therefore, as one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients said well, <hi>That we might not be eternally miserable, mercy hath made us mortal.</hi> Justice hath made the world mortal, that they may be eternally miserable, but to put an end to this misery, Christ hath continued our mortality. Else he would have abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death it self, if he had not meant to abolish sin by death, and indeed it would appear this is the reason why the world must be consumed with fire at the last day, and new Heavens and earth succeed in its room, because as the little house, the <hi>body,</hi> so the great house, the <hi>world,</hi> was infected with this leprosie, &amp; so subjected to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and corruption because of mans sin; therefore that there might be no remnant of mans corruption, and no memorial of sin to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now, the next comfort is that which is, is but <hi>partial,</hi> it is but the dissolution of the lowest part in man, his <hi>body</hi>; so far from prejudging the immortal life of his spirit, that it is rather the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of that.

               <p>Therefore we may conclude with the <hi>Apostle,</hi> that all men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are miserable in <hi>life,</hi> but infinitly more miserable in death: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the man who is in Jesus Christ, in whose <hi>spirit</hi> Christ dwells, and hath made a temple of his <hi>body,</hi> for offering up reasonable service in it, that man only is happy in <hi>life,</hi> but far happier in <hi>death</hi>: happy that he was born, but infinitly more happy that he was born mortal, born to die ; for <hi>if the body be dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousnesse.</hi> Men commonly make their accompts, and calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat their time so, as if <hi>death</hi> were the end of it: truly, it were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse in the generality of men, that that computation were true, either that it had never beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if we make our accompts right, and take the right period, truly <hi>death</hi> is but the beginning of our Time, of endlesse and unchangeable endurance either in happinesse or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery: and this life in the body, which is only in the view of the short-sighted sons of men, is but a strait and narrow passage into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit ocean of eternity; but so inconsiderable it is, that according as the spirit in this passage is fashioned and formed, so it must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever; <hi>for where the tree falleth, there it lyeth.</hi> There may be hope that a tree will sprout again, but truly there is no hope that ever the damned soul shall see a spring of joy; and no fear that ever the blessed spirits shall find a winter of grief, such is the evennesse of eternity, that there is no shadow of change in it.</p>

               <p>It is no wonder then, that the Apostle reckon this Doctrine of the Resurrection amongst the <hi>foundations of Christianity,</hi> Heb. 6.1, 2, for truly these t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the mortal body,</hi> are the two ground-stones, or pillars of true Religion, which if they be not well settled in the hearts of men, all Religion is tottering and ruinous, and unable to support it self. That the soul cannot taste death, or see corruption, and that the body shall but <hi>taste</hi> it, and as it were <hi>salute</hi> it, and cannot alwayes abide under the power of it, these are the prime foundations upon which all Christian perswasion is built; for without these be laid down in the lowest and deepest part of the heart, all exhortations to an holy and righteous life are weak and ineffectual, all consolations are empty and vain; in a word, Religion is but an airy speculation, that hath no consistence but in the imaginations of men; it is an house upon sand, that can abide no blast of temptation, no wave of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but must straight way fall to the ground. From whence is it, I pray you, that the perswasions of the Gospel hath so little power upon men, that the plain and plentiful publication of a Saviour is of so small vertue to stir up the hearts of men to take hold on him? How comes it to passe that the preeepts and prohibitions of the most high God, coming forth under his authority, lays so little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint on mens corruptions? that so few will be perswaded to stop their course, and come off the wayes they are accustomed? that men pull away the shoulder, and stop the ear, and make their hearts as adamant, incapable of being affected with either the authority or love of the Gospel? that when He pipes unto us, so few dance, and when he mourns, so few laments? Is it not because <hi>these two founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are not laid, and mens hearts not digged deep by earnest consideration, to receive these ground-stones of <hi>Christianity, the belief of their souls eternal survivance after the dust,</hi> and of <hi>the revivance and resurrection of the body after it hath slept a while in the dust.</hi> I remember, <hi>Heathens</hi> have had some noble and rare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions about vertue, and some have laboured to enamour men with the native beauty of it, and to perswade them that it was <hi>a sufficient reward to it self</hi>; and truly it would far more become a <hi>Christian</hi> who knoweth the high and divine pattern of holinesse to be <hi>God himself,</hi> and so must needs behold a far surpassing beauty and excellency in the Image of God than in all earthly things; I say, it would become him to accustome himself to a dutiful observance of Religion, even without all respect to the reward of it: he would train his heart to do homage to God, out of a loyal affection and respect to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and from the love of the very intrinsick

beauty of obedience, without borrowing alwayes from such selfie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of our own <hi>happinesse</hi> or <hi>misery.</hi> Notwithstanding such is the posture of mans spirit now, that he cannot at all be engaged to the love of Religion, except some <hi>Seen advantage</hi> concilat it; and therefore the Lord makes use of such selfie principles in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to Himself, and keeping them still with Him: and truly considering mans infirmity, this is the spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is certainly Hope that is the key of the heart, that opens and shuts it to any thing. These the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 1. blesseth God heartily for the new birth, and in the expressing of it, makes hope the very term of that generation, and so it must be a substantial thing. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God who hath begotten us again to a lively hope</hi>: Hope hath a quickning power in it, it makes all new where it comes, and is full of spirit; it is the Helmet and Anchor of a Christian, that which bears the dint of temptation, and makes him steady in Religion: No man will put in his plough in this ground, or sow unto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but in <hi>hope,</hi> for he that soweth must sow in <hi>hope,</hi> else his Plough will not go deep, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. This then is the very spirit and life of Religion, <hi>the resurrection of the dead,</hi> without which <hi>our faith were in vain, and men would continue still in their sins.</hi> Certainly it is the deep inconsideration of this never-ending endurance of our souls, and restitution of our bodies to the same immortality, that makes the most part of men so slight and superficial in Religion, else it were not possible if that were laid to heart, but men would make Religion their business and chief business.</p>
               <p>We have here the two genuine causes of the resurection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Christians, the <hi>resurrection of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>inhabitation of his Spirit.</hi> The influence that the resurrection of Christ hath on ours, is lively and fully holden out by this <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. against them who deny the resurrection from the dead. <hi>If Christ be not raised, your faith is in vain, ye are yet in your sins, and they that are asleep are perished.</hi> Religion were nothing but a number of empty words of show; Preaching were a vanity and imposture; Faith were a meer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why? because all my sins were laid on Christ, and God hath in a most solemn manner acquited and discharged him from all, when he raised him from the dead; and therefore he cannot, and none other can sue me, or prosecute a plea against me, since my Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is fully exonered of this undertaking, even by the great Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, God himself. But then, his resurrection is a pawn or pledge of the spiritual raising of the soul from sin: as the death of Christ is made the pledge of our dying to sin, so his rising, of our living to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, 5. These are not meer paterns and examples of spiritual things, but assured pledges of that divine vertue and power which he being raised again should send abroad throughout the world: for as there are <hi>Coronation-gifts,</hi> when Kings are solemnly installed in office, so there are <hi>Coronation-mercies, triumphal gifts,</hi> when Christ rose and ascended, he bestowed then on the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.

               <p>But add unto this, that Christs rising is the pledge and pawn of the second resurrection that is of the body; for He is the head, and we the members; now it is most incongruous that the head should rise and not draw up the members after him, certainly he will not cease till He have drawen up all his mem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Doth the <hi>Clay</hi> owe so much to the <hi>Potter,</hi> who doth not <hi>make</hi> it, but <hi>fashion</hi> it only? and what owe we to Him that made us of nothing, and fashioned us while we were yet without form! Truly, all relations, all obligations evanish when this cometh forth; because all that a man hath it lesse then <hi>Himself,</hi> then his <hi>immortal spirit,</hi> and that he oweth alone to God; and besides what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever debt there is to other fellow-creatures in any thing, God is the principal creditor in that bond: all the creatures are but the <hi>Servants of this King,</hi> which at his sole appointment bring alongs his gifts unto us; and therefore we owe no more to them, then to the hands of the messenger that is sent. Now, by this accompt, nothing is our <hi>own,</hi> not <hi>our selves,</hi> not our <hi>members,</hi> not our <hi>goods,</hi> but all are <hi>His,</hi> and to be used and bestowed not at the will and arbitrement of creatures, but to be absolutly and solely at his disposal, who hath the sole soveraign right to them: and therefore, you may take up the hainousnesse of sin, how monstruous and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shappen a thing it is, that breaks this inviolable Law of creation, and withdraws the creature from subjection to Him, in whom alone it can subsist. O how disordered are the courses and lives of men! men living to <hi>themselves,</hi> their <hi>own lusts,</hi> after their <hi>own will,</hi> as if they had made themselves, men using their <hi>members as weapons of unrighteousnesse against God,</hi> as if their tongues and hands and feet were there own, or the devils, and not Gods. Call to mind this obligation, <hi>Remember thy Creator,</hi> that <hi>memento</hi> would be a strong engagement to another course then most take: how absurd would you think it, To please your selves in displeasing Him, if you but minded the bond of <hi>creation.</hi> But when there are other two superadded, what we owe to the <hi>Son,</hi> for coming down in the likenesse of sinfull flesh for us, and what we owe to the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> for quickening our spirits, and afterward for the resurection of our bodies, whose hearts would not these overcome and lead captive to his love and obedience.</p>

And these things are but the first fruits of the Spirit, any peace, or joy, or love, or obedience, are but an earnest of that which is coming: we shall be yet more beholden to Him, when the walls of flesh are taken down, he will carry forth the soul into that glorious liberty of the sons of God; and not long after he shall quicken our very dust, and raise it up in glory to the fellowship of that happinesse.

It is true, there is a secret <hi>drawing,</hi> withall necessary, the pull of the Fathers arm, and power of the Holy Ghost; yet that which is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible or sensible to the soul, is the framing of all things so, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage it upon rational terms: it is set between two contraries, <hi>death</hi> and <hi>life, death</hi> which it naturally abho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mortification</hi> sounds very harsh at first: the hearts of men say, <hi>It is a hard saying, who can bear it.</hi> And indeed I cannot deny but it is so to our corrupt nature; and therefore so holden out in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the words chosen to press it, express much pain and pains, much torment and labour: it is not so easie and trivial a business to forsake sin, or subdue it, as many think, who only think it easie, because they have never tryed it. It is a Circumcision of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin of the heart, and you know how it disabled a whole City, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. and how it enraged the heart of a tender mother, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4 26.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59468:137"/>
It is the incision or cutting off a member, and these the most dear and precious, be it the right hand or right foot, which is a living death, as it were, even to kill a man while he is alive. It is a new birth, and the pains and throws of the birth are known. <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> certainly hath a travelling pain within it, in so much that <hi>Paul</hi> travelled in pain till it were accomplished in these, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.19. Though men conceive sin in pleasure, yet they cannot be rid of that deadly burden without throws and pain: and to half this work, or to be remiss and negligent in it, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umbrances of sin. Much violence offered to it, and a total resignation of our selves to God, may be great pain, but it is short pain; then the pleasure is greater, and continues: But now Christians lengthen their pain, and draw out their crosse and vexation to a great extent, because they deal negligently in the businesse, they suffer the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> to live, and these are <hi>thorns and briers in their sides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. Then this businesse</hi> is called <hi>Mortification,</hi> as the word is here, and <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. which imports a higher degree of pain, for the agonies of death are terrible; and to hold it out yet more, the most painful and lingering kind of death is chosen to expresse it, <hi>Crucifiction, Gal.</hi> 5.24. Now indeed, that which makes the forsaking of sin so grievous to flesh and blood, is, the engagements of the soul to it, the <hi>onenesse</hi> that is between it and our natures, as they are now fallen: for you know pain ariseth upon the dissolution or division of any thing that is continued or united; and these things that are so nearly conjoyned it is hard to separat them without much violence. And truly as the Kingdom of Heaven suffers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, so we must offer violence to our selves, to our lusts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, who are almost our selves: And if ye would be truly Christians, this must be your businesse and imployment, to cut off these things that are dearest unto you, to cast out the very idols your hearts sacrifice unto: and if there be any thing more <hi>one</hi> with you than another, to endeavour to break the bond with that, and to be at the furthest distance with it: It is easie to perswade men to forsake some sins and courses, that they are not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Truly, my beloved, this will be a dead businesse if you be not animated and quickned by these consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, that Christ died to sin and lived to God, and that in this He was a publick person representing you, that so you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with <hi>Paul, I am crucified with Christ, Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>We are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him by baptism into his death,</hi> Rom. 6.4. Consider that mystical union with Christ crucified, and life shall spring out of his crosse, out of his grave to kill sin in you. That the great businesse is done already, and victory gained in our head, <hi>this is our victory, even faith.</hi> Believe, and then you have overcome, before you overcome; and this will help you to overcome in your own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.

               <p>Truly, not only the sense of our own imperfection, of our folly and ignorance in these things that belong to life, should make us willing to yeeld ourselves over to the Spirit of God, as blind men to their leader, as children to their nurses, as orphans to their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; but also because the Spirit is made our Tutor and leader: Christ our Father hath left us to the Spirit in his latter-will; and therefore as we have absolute necessity, so he hath both willingnesse and ability, because it is his office. <hi>O Lord, I know,</hi> saith Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, <hi>the way of man is not in himself, it is not in him that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to direct his steps,</hi> Jer. 10.23.

               <p>CHildren do commonly resemble their parents, not only in the outward proportion and feature of their countenances, but also in the disposition and temper of their spirits; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they are inclined to imitate the customs and carriage of their parents, so that they sometimes may be accounted the very living images of such persons, and in them men are thought to out-live themselves. Now indeed, they that are the <hi>sons of God,</hi> are known by this Character, that <hi>they are led by the Spirit of God</hi>: and there is the more necessity, and the more reason too, of this resemblance of God, and imitation of him in his children; because that very divine birth that they have from Heaven, consists in the renovation of their natures, and assimilation to the divine nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are possessed with an inward principle, that carries them powerfully towards a conformity with their heavenly Fathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And generally, in all his wayes of <hi>holinesse</hi> and <hi>purity,</hi> of <hi>goodnesse</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> we ought to be followers of Him, as dear children, who are not only oblidged by the common Law of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy between Parents and Children; but moreover engaged by the tender affection that he carrieth to us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1. Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God is high as Heaven, and his way and thoughts and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are infinitly above us, the pattern seems to be so far out of sight, that it is given over as desperat by many to attempt any conformity to it; therefore it hath pleased the Lord to put his own Spirit within his own Children, to be a bosom-pattern and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: and this is our duty to resign our selves to his leading and direction: the Spirit brings the copy near hand us, and though we cannot attain, yet we should follow after; though we cannot make out the lesson, yet we should be scribling at it; and the more we exercise our selves this way, setting the Spirits direction before our eyes, the more perfect shall we be.</p>
               <p>It is high time indeed to pretend to this, to be a <hi>son</hi> or a <hi>daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of God</hi>: its a higher word then if a man could deduce his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy from an interrupted line of a thousand Kings and Princes, there is more honour, true honour in it, and more profit too, that which enriches the poorest, and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, my beloved, this is the great design of the Gospel, to bestow this incomparable priviledge upon you, <hi>to become the Sons of God.</hi> But it is sad to think how many souls scarce think upon it, and how many delude themselves in it: but consider, that <hi>as many as are the Sons of God, are led by the Spirit of God,</hi> they have gotten a new leader and guider, other then their own fancy or humour, which once they followed in the ignorance of their hearts. It is lamentable to conceive how the most part of us are acted, and driven, and carried head-long, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then gently led, by our own carnal and corrupt inclinations; men pretending to Christianity, yet hurried away with every self-pleasing object, as if they were not Masters of themselves, furiously

Nay, the growth and increase of grace, is so far from exempting men from, or setting them above this duty of constant supplication, that by the contrary, this is the just measure of their growth and altitude in grace: as the degrees of the hight of the Water of <hi>Nilus</hi> in its over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing, are a sure sign of the fertility or barrennesse of that year; so the overflowings of the spirit of Prayer in one, gives a present account how the heart is, whether barren and unfruitful in the knowledge of Jesus Christ, or fruitful and lively and vigorous in it. It is certain that contraries do discover one another, and the more the one be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, that is, not only the more incompatible and inconsistent with the other, but gives the most perfect discerning of it. When grace is but as twi-light in the soul, and as the dawning of the day only, grosse darknesse and uncleanesse is seen; but the more it grow to the perfect day, the more sin is sin, and the more its hated, wants are discovered that did not appear; and therefore it exerciseth its self the more in opposition to sin, and supplication to God. To speak the truth, our growth here is but an advancement in the knowledge and sense of our own indigencey: Its but a further entry into the idolatrous Temple of the heart, which makes a man see daily new abominations worse then the former; and therefore you may easily know that such repeated sights and discoveries, will but presse out more earnest and frequent cryes from the heart, and such a growth in humility, and faith in Gods fulnesse, will be but as oyl to feed the flame of supplication. For what is Prayer indeed, but the ardency of the affection after God, flaming up to him in cryes and requests?</p>
               <p>To speak of this exercise of an holy heart, it would require more of the spirit of it then we have; but truly this is to be lamented, that though there be nothing more common among Christians in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward practice of it; yet that there is nothing more extraordinary and rare even among many that use it, then to be acquainted with the inward nature of it. Truly, the most ordinary things in Religion, are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est mysteries, as to the true life of them: we are strangers to the soul and life of these things, which consists in the holy behavior and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Spirits, before the Father of Spirits.</p>

It is the joynt exercise of all a Christian graces; seasoned with all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them give some peculiar fragrancy to it, as <hi>Humility, Faith, Repentance, Love,</hi> &amp;c. The acting of the heart in supplication, is a kind of compend and result of all these, as one perfume made up of many simples. But above all, as the incense, our prayers must be kindled by fire on the Altar, there must be some heat and servour, some warmnesse conceived by the holy Spirit in our hearts, which may make our spices send forth a pleasant smell, as many spices do not till they get heat. Let us lay this engagement on our hearts, to be more serious in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to God the Father of spirits, above all, to present our inward soul before him, before whom it is naked and open, though we do not bring it.
