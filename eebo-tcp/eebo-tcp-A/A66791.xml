            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This, is ſo great, and ſo extraordinary a <hi>Mercy,</hi> conſidering the many terrors, diſtruſts &amp; neceſſities, wherewith many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of better men are daily exerciſed &amp; proved, that I conceive my ſelf obliged in conſcience, openly to acknowledge it both to glorifie him who vouchſafes it, and to confirm in my ſelf and other men, our Chriſtian hopes, by delaring what GOD hath

done for my ſoul, who have nothing in my ſelf to deſerve it, but what is of his gift, and who have much more of my own, which rather deſerves the contrary.

You are my friends by the ſureſt ſide: For you were not made mine by my induſtry, merit, ſolicitation, or in reſpect of any carnal Relations, but meerly by GODS Mediation who inclined your hearts to that voluntary compaſſion, whereof I had fruit in due ſeaſon, ſufficient to preſerve me, without ſordid want or dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that condition wherein I am likely to be continued to fit me for that ſervice, which I have yet to do; and I am confident that he who made you my <hi>Friends,</hi> will ſo keep you; and make me thankful to him and you, whilſt we live in this world.

               <l>Confinement, in a houſe of ſtrength doth dwell,</l>

               <l>In furnitures, and in attendance poor,</l>
               <l>A <hi>Cerberus</hi> lies alwayes at the door</l>

               <l>But ever ſnarls while we continue there:</l>
               <l>Yet, I ſo quickly had found out his diet,</l>

               <l>I view not here the pleaſures of the fields</l>

               <l>Which were of late my daily recreation,</l>

               <l>Not only ſights of more eſſential things</l>
               <l>But an aſſurance of enjoyments too,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I could not be at that <hi>Solemnization</hi>

               <l>Yet in my ſolitarineſs, alone,</l>
               <l>What they were doing, I did think upon,</l>

With what ſhould elſe be done, that's not done yet</l>
               <l>And, which I wiſh we may not quite forget,</l>

               <l>Much real honour, and no little coſt;</l>
               <l>And which, perhaps, to bring now into mind</l>

               <l>I can conceive, as if I ſaw it made,</l>
               <l>And all which paintings thereunto can add.</l>
               <l>I know, as well as they who did behold</l>

               <l>I have ſeen all materials which were thither,</l>

               <l>Princes and Dukes, and Marqueſſes and Earls,</l>

               <l>As many thouſands as then preſent were</l>
               <l>I did as well imagine to be there</l>

               <l>Not only what is acted at ſuch Shows,</l>

               <l>Since firſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Triumphs were begun,</l>
               <l>And fancy by my ſelf ſuch glorious things</l>
               <l>As would quite beggar Emperors and Kings</l>
               <l>To repreſent them. So, by being there</l>
               <l>I had but ſeen a meaner Show than here</l>
               <l>My fancy could have made; and what had I</l>

               <l>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95689:8"/>
What had I gained then, by ſitting long</l>

               <l>What great contentment could I have deriv'd</l>
               <l>From what Mechanick Artiſts had contriv'd,</l>
               <l>Compar'd to that which my imagination</l>
               <l>Contriv'd in honour of that Coronation?</l>
               <l>At which the Trophies coſt, at moſt, no more</l>

               <l>I ſeldom took, at any time much pleaſure</l>

               <l>I did in my <hi>Confinement,</hi> for him pray</l>
               <l>As heartily as any perſon there,</l>
               <l>And, GOD, perhaps, aſſoon the ſame will hear,</l>

               <l>Thoſe Acclamations of the vulgar throng,</l>

               <l>Wing'd with Devotion (though it made no noiſe)</l>
               <l>Aſcended Heav'n, and may bring bleſſings down,</l>
               <l>Which will conduce to ſetling of his Crown,</l>
               <l>If he unfix it not by miſ-endeavour,</l>
               <l>Or, valuing of the <hi>Gift</hi> more than the <hi>Giver.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I do preſume his duties on that day</l>
               <l>He did diſcharge; and (wiſhing others may</l>
               <l>Perform their dues to him) do not envy</l>
               <l>The glory of that day's Solemnity</l>
               <l>To him, for whom 'twas purpos'd, nor the ſight,</l>
               <l>Thereof, to thoſe who took therein delight;</l>
               <l>But wiſh'd, both might be perfectly contented</l>
               <l>In what was at that preſent repreſented;</l>

And hope, nought was to him aſcribed then,</l>
               <l>Which rather appertains to GOD than <hi>Men:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For, when to <hi>Hereds</hi> eloquent Orations</l>
               <l>The people gave blaſphemous Acclamations,</l>
               <l>And he that honour to himſelf apply'd,</l>
               <l>Whereby, GOD ought to have been glorifi'd,</l>
               <l>The Doom, which that offence did on him bring,</l>
               <l>Made him a lifeleſs, and a louzie King.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Of theſe things my confinement did produce</l>
               <l>Some thoughts, which are perhaps of ſome good uſe.</l>
               <l>I, likewiſe exercis'd my Meditation,</l>
               <l>That day, on other things which have relation</l>
               <l>To what was then in act; and mus'd upon</l>
               <l>That, which occaſion gave of things then done,</l>
               <l>On ſome now paſt, and upon other ſome</l>
               <l>Which probably will be in time to come.</l>
               <l>I mus'd upon the <hi>Changes,</hi> and the Chances,</l>
               <l>The Publick Troubles, and Deliverances</l>
               <l>Which I have ſeen. I ſeriouſly did ponder</l>
               <l>GODS, and <hi>Mens</hi> actions joyntly and aſunder;</l>
               <l>Our fooliſh Projects, his wiſe Providences,</l>
               <l>Both in their Progreſs, and their Conſequences.</l>
               <l>I thought both on the <hi>People</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>What good or evil poſſibly might ſpring</l>
               <l>From their deportments towards one another</l>
               <l>Now by GODS mercy they are brought together.</l>
               <l>On thoſe too, in particular, I thought</l>
               <l>Whom, GOD into his power hath lately brought:</l>
               <l>How great, erewhile, his wants and ſufferings were,</l>
               <l>What, his enjoyments at this preſent are;</l>
               <l>And, on ſome other matters, not a few,</l>
               <l>Which theſe, to my conſideration drew,</l>
               <l>And which perhaps, that day had been by none</l>
               <l>Mus'd on, ſo much, had I not been alone.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95689:9"/>
Moreover it occaſion'd thoughts of that</l>
               <l>Which to a Nobler Object doth relate;</l>
               <l>Even to that Kingdom, King, and Coronation,</l>
               <l>That ſhould be thought on with more veneration</l>
               <l>Than all the <hi>Monarchs</hi> in their greateſt glory,</l>
               <l>Who now live, or are memoriz'd in ſtory.</l>
               <l>My <hi>Contemplation,</hi> with as much content,</l>
               <l>As others had, to me did repreſent</l>
               <l>That <hi>DAY</hi> wherein <hi>CHRIST</hi> through <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Rode meekly on an <hi>Aſs,</hi> whilſt after him</l>
               <l>The people throng'd or laqued by his ſide,</l>
               <l>And voluntarily <hi>HOSANNA</hi> cry'd,</l>
               <l>Yet afterward purſuing him with ſcorns</l>
               <l>Cry'd <hi>Crucifie,</hi> and crowned him with Thorns;</l>
               <l>And this, me thought, was ſo conſiderable,</l>
               <l>That it made all our Pomp ſeem deſpicable.</l>
               <l>For, then my Muſes drew me by degrees,</l>
               <l>To meditate on what my ſoul fore-ſees</l>
               <l>Concerning them, who, whilſt they do pretend</l>
               <l>CHRIST's <hi>Kingdom,</hi> do purſue another end;</l>
               <l>And that, which for his glory was beſtown,</l>
               <l>Make uſe of, for advancement of their own.</l>
               <l>Not ſeldom, likewiſe, I then thought upon</l>
               <l>Thoſe many thouſand families undone,</l>
               <l>Who ſit and weep through want of what that day</l>
               <l>Was waſtfully and vainly, thrown away,</l>
               <l>At ſuch a time, wherein both Man and GOD,</l>
               <l>Proceedings lookt for in another mode,</l>
               <l>And when, our publick hazards and diſtreſs,</l>
               <l>Requir'd another way of thankfulneſs.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Upon that ſolemn day, (not without wonder)</l>
               <l>I ſaw and heard, the Lightning, rain, and thunder</l>
               <l>Wherewith GOD ſeem'd to anſwer and out-vy</l>
               <l>Our Guns and fire-Works, (though I was not nigh)</l>
               <l>

And ſuch-reſemblance had the works of <hi>Art,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To Nature's, that they could not be apart</l>
               <l>Diſtinguiſh'd; but that, to prevent our error,</l>
               <l>The laſt was loudeſt, and infus'd more terrour.</l>
               <l>This, I obſerved well; and furthermore</l>
               <l>Took ſpecial heed, that nigh two Moneths before,</l>
               <l>And likewiſe ever ſince, from Rainy weather</l>
               <l>We were not oft free, one whole day together,</l>
               <l>Until that Royal Triumph was begun,</l>
               <l>Nor till that moment wherein it was done:</l>
               <l>Yet, durſt I not be ſo prophane, to ſay</l>
               <l>(As one hath writ) <hi>it dar'd not rain that day.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Nor at that time, <hi>Flaminian like,</hi> durſt I</l>
               <l>Conjecture by a <hi>Heatheniſh Augurie</hi>
               </l>
               <l>What GOD thereby intended: but, with awe</l>
               <l>Conſider'd upon what I heard and ſaw:</l>
               <l>And I confeſs, the <hi>Lightning, Rain,</hi> and <hi>Thunder</hi>
               </l>
               <l>At this our <hi>Seed-time,</hi> cauſed me to ponder</l>
               <l>On that, which <hi>Sumuel</hi> prayed GOD to ſend</l>
               <l>In Harveſt-time, and what that did portend;</l>
               <l>Which I conceive to be a Meditation</l>
               <l>Not then improper, for my Contemplation.</l>
               <l>And, though ſome peradventure may ſuſpect</l>
               <l>That theſe expreſſions, may ſome way reflect</l>
               <l>On what concerns them, it concerns him more</l>
               <l>Whoſe cauſe and honour I prefer before</l>
               <l>All earthly things; and can be not afraid,</l>
               <l>Who ere ſhall be diſpleas'd with what I've ſaid;</l>
               <l>For, I was barr'd from ſeeing what is done</l>
               <l>By men; that, GODS works might be muſed on.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Such things, although we then much mind them not,</l>
               <l>Should not amidſt our Triumphs be forgot;</l>
               <l>And, that, (which then by me was thought upon)</l>
               <l>Much more effectually, perhaps, was done</l>

In this condition which I now am in,</l>
