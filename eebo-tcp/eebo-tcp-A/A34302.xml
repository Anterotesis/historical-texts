            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi> and <hi>Middlesex, Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's Houshold, and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A Young Poet, is liable to the same Vanity and Indiscretion with a Young Lover; and the Great Man that smiles upon one, and the Fine Woman that looks kindly upon t' other, are each of 'em in Danger of having the Favour publish'd with the first Opportunity.</p>
            <p>But there may be a different Motive, which will a little distinguish the Offenders. For tho' one should have a Vanity in ruining another's Reputation, yet the other may only have an Ambition to advance his own.
<pb facs="tcp:62762:4"/>
And I beg leave, my Lord, that I may plead the latter, both as the Cause and Excuse of this Dedication.</p>
            <p>Whoever is King, is also the Father of his Country; and as no body can dispute Your Lordship's <hi>Monarchy</hi> in <hi>Poetry;</hi> so all that are concern'd, ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Your Universal Patronage: And it is only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming on the Priviledge of a Loyal Subject, that I have ventur'd to make this my Address of Thanks, to Your Lordship; which at the same time, includes a Prayer for Your Protection.</p>
            <p>I am not Ignorant of the Common Form of Poetical Dedications, which are generally made up of Panegyricks, where the Authors endeavour to distinguish their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, by the shining Characters they give them, above other Men. But that, my Lord, is not my business at this time, nor is Your Lordship <hi>now</hi> to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd. I am contented with the Honour I do my self in this Epistle; without the Vanity of attempting to add to, or explain Your Lordship's Character.</p>
            <p>I confess it is not without some strugling, that I behave my self in this Case, as I ought: For it is very hard to be pleased with a Subject, and yet forbear it. But I chuse rather to follow <hi>Pliny's</hi> Precept, than his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when in his Panegyrick to the Emperour <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan,</hi> he says,
<q>
                  <l>Nec minus considerabo quid aures ejus pati</l>
                  <l>possint, Quam quid virtutibus debeatur.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I hope I may be excus'd the Pedantry of a Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it is so justly apply'd. Here are some Lines
<pb facs="tcp:62762:4"/>
in the Print, (and which your Lordship read before this Play was Acted) that were omitted on the Stage; and particularly one whole Scene in the Third Act, which not only helps the Design forward with less Precipitation, but also heightens the ridiculous Character of <hi>Foresight,</hi> which indeed seems to be maim'd without it. But I found my self in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a long Play, and was glad to help it where I could. Tho' notwithstanding my Care, and the kind Reception it had from the Town; I could heartily wish it yet shorter: But the Number of Different Characters represented in it, would have been too much crowded in less room.</p>
            <p>This Reflection on Prolixity, (a Fault, for which scarce any one Beauty will attone) warns me not to be tedious now, and detain Your Lordship any longer with the Trifles of,</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:62762:7"/>We hope there's something that may please each Taste,</l>
            <l>And tho' of Homely Fare we make the Feast,</l>
            <l>Yet you will find variety at least.</l>
            <l>There's Humour, which for chearful Friends we got,</l>
            <l>And for the thinking Party there's a Plot.</l>
            <l>We've something too, to gratifie ill Nature,</l>
            <l>(If there be any here) and that is Satire.</l>
            <l>Tho Satire scarce dares grin, 'tis grown so mild;</l>
            <l>Or only shews its Teeth, as if it smil'd.</l>
            <l>As Asses Thistles, Poets mumble Wit,</l>
            <l>And dare not bite, for fear of being bit.</l>
            <l>They hold their Pens, as Swords are held by Fools,</l>
            <l>And are afraid to use their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Edge-Tools.</l>
            <l>Since the <hi>Plain-Dealers</hi> Scenes of Manly Rage,</l>
            <l>Not one has dar'd to lash this Crying Age.</l>
            <l>This time, the Poet owns the bold Essay,</l>
            <l>Yet hopes there's no ill-manners in his Play:</l>
            <l>And he declares by me, he has design'd</l>
            <l>Affront to none, but frankly speaks his mind.</l>
            <l>And shou'd the ensuing Scenes not chance to hit,</l>
            <l>He offers but this one Excuse, 'twas writ</l>
            <l>Before your late Encouragement of Wit.</l>

            <head>EPILOGUE</head>
            <head type="sub">Spoken at the opening of the New House, By Mrs. <hi>Bracegirdle.</hi>
            </head>
            <l>SURE Providence at first, design'd this Place</l>
            <l>To be the Player's Refuge in distress;</l>
            <l>For still in every Storm, they all run hither,</l>
            <l>As to a Shed, that shields 'em from the Weather.</l>
            <l>But thinking of this change which last befel us,</l>
            <l>It's like what I have heard our Poets tell us:</l>
            <l>For when behind our Scenes their Suits are pleading,</l>
            <l>To help their Love, sometimes they show their Reading;</l>
            <l>And wanting ready Cash to pay for Hearts,</l>
            <l>They top their Learning on us, and their Parts.</l>
            <l>Once of Philosophers they told us Stories,</l>
            <l>Whom, as I think they call'd—<hi>Py</hi>—<hi>Pythagories,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I'm sure 'tis some such <hi>Latin</hi> Name they give 'em,</l>
            <l>And we, who know no better, must believe 'em.</l>
            <l>Now to these Men (say they) such Souls were given,</l>
            <l>That after Death, ne're went to Hell, nor Heaven,</l>
            <l>But liv'd, I know not how, in Beasts; and then</l>
            <l>When many Years were past, in Men again.</l>
            <l>Methinks, we <hi>Players</hi> resemble such a Soul,</l>
            <l>That, does from Bodies, we from Houses strole.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Soul, of old that was,</l>
            <l>May now be damn'd to animate an Ass;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:62762:8"/>Or in this very House, for ought we know,</l>
            <l>Is doing painful Penance in some <hi>Beau,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And this our Audience, which did once resort</l>
            <l>To shining Theatres to see our Sport,</l>
            <l>Now find us toss'd into a Tennis-Court.</l>
            <l>These Walls but t<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>other Day were fill'd with Noise</l>
            <l>Of Roaring Gamesters, and your <hi>Damme Boys.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then bounding Balls and Rackets they encompass'd,</l>
            <l>And now they're fill'd with Iests, and Flights, and Bombast!</l>
            <l>I vow, I don't much like this Transmigration,</l>
            <l>Stroling from Place to Place, by Circulation.</l>
            <l>Grant Heaven, we don't return to our first Station.</l>
            <l>I know not what these think, but for my Part,</l>
            <l>I can't reflect without an aking Heart,</l>
            <l>How we shou'd end in our Original, a Cart.</l>
            <l>But we can't fear, since you're so good to save us,</l>
            <l>That you have only set us up, to leave us.</l>
            <l>Thus from the past, we hope for future Grace,</l>
            <l>I beg it—</l>
            <l>And some here know I have a begging Face.</l>
            <l>Then pray continue this your kind behaviour,</l>
            <l>For a clear Stage won't do, without your Favour.</l>

Does your <hi>Epictetus,</hi> or your <hi>Seneca</hi> here, or any of these poor, rich Rogues, teach you how to pay your Debts without Money? Will they shut up the Mouths of your Creditors? Will <hi>Plato</hi> be Bail for you? Or <hi>Diogenes,</hi> because he understands Confinement,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62762:10"/>
and liv'd in a Tub, go to Prison for you? 'Slife, Sir, what do you mean, to mew your self up here with Three or Four musty Books, in commendation of Starving and Poverty?</p>

                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, Sirrah, I have no Money, you know it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore resolve to rail at all that have: And in that I but follow the Examples of the wisest and wittiest Men in all Ages; these Poets and Philosophers whom you naturally hate, for just such another Reason; because they abound in Sense, and you are a Fool.</p>

                     <p>Aye, Sir, I am a Fool, I know it: And yet, Heav'n help me, I'm poor enough to be a Wit—But I was always a Fool, when I told you what your Expences would bring you to; your Coaches and your Liveries; your Treats and your Balls; your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Love with a Lady, that did not care a Farthing for you in your Prosperity; and keeping Company with Wits, that car'd for nothing but your Prosperity; and now when you are poor, hate you as much as they do one another.</p>

                     <p>Well; and now I am poor, I have an opportunity to be reveng'd on 'em all; I'll pursue <hi>Angelica</hi> with more Love than ever, and appear more notoriously her Admirer in this Restraint, than when I openly rival'd the rich Fops, that made Court to her; so shall my Poverty be a Mortification to her Pride, and perhaps, make her compassionate that Love, which has principally reduc'd me to this Lowness of Fortune. And for the Wits, I'm sure I'm in a Condition to be even with them—</p>

                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> and that he is not now turn'd away for any Misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour; but does voluntarily dismiss his Master from any future Authority over him—</p>

                     <p>Sir, it's impossible—I may die with you, starve with you, or be dam'd with your Works: But to live even Three days, the Life of a Play, I no more expect it, than to be Canoniz'd for a Muse after my Decease.</p>

The Man of the House would have been an Alderman by this time with half the Trade, if he had set up in the City—For my part, I never sit at the Door, that I don't get double the Stomach that I do at a Horse-Race. The Air upon <hi>Banstead-Downs</hi> is nothing to it for a Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet I never see it, but the Spirit of Famine appears to me; sometimes like a decay'd Porter, worn out with pimping, and carrying <hi>Billet-doux</hi> and Songs; not like other Porters for Hire, but for the Jests sake. Now like a thin Chairman, melted down to half his Proportion, with carrying a Poet upon Tick, to visit some great Fortune; and his Fare to be paid him like the Wages of Sin, either at the Day of Marriage, or the Day of Death.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>What you will allow an absent Lover—</p>

                     <speaker>Frail.</speaker>
                     <p>No, I'll allow a Lover present with his Mistress to be particular—But otherwise I think his Passion ought to give place to his Manners.</p>

                     <p>Marriage indeed may qualifie the Fury of his Passion, but it very rarely mends a Man's Manners.</p>

                     <speaker>Frail.</speaker>
                     <p>You are the most mistaken in the World; there is no Creature perfectly Civil, but a Husband. For in a little time he grows only rude to his Wife, and that is the highest good Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for it begets his Civility to other People. Well, I'll tell you News; but I suppose you hear your Brother <hi>Benjamin</hi> is landed.

                     <p>It's very true, Sister: Well since all's out, and as you say, since we are both Wounded, let us do that is often done in Duels, take care of one another, and grow better Friends than before.</p>

                     <p>Well, as an earnest of Friendship and Confidence: I'll acquaint You with a design that I have: To tell Truth, and speak openly one to another; I'm afraid the World have observ'd us more than we have observ'd one another. You have a Rich Husband, and are provided for, <hi>I</hi> am at a loss, and have no great Stock either of Fortune or Reputation; and therefore must look sharply about me. Sir <hi>Sampson</hi> has a Son that is expected to Night; and by the Account I have heard of his Education, can be no Conjurer: The Estate You know is to be made over to him:—Now if I cou'd wheedle him, Sister, ha? You understand me?</p>

So, when I ask you, if you can Love me, you must say no, but you must Love me too—If I tell you you are Handsome, you must deny it, and say I flatter you—But you must think your self more
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62762:25"/>
Charming than I speak you:—And like me, for the Beauty which I say you have, as much as if I had it my self—If I ask you to Kiss me, you must be angry, but you must not refuse me. If I ask you for more, you must be more angry,—but more complying; and as soon as ever I make you say you'l cry out, you must be sure to hold your Tongue.</p>

                     <p>Faith, Madam, you're in the right; no more I have, as I hope to be sav'd; I never had it in my Power to say any thing to a Lady's Prejudice in my Life—For as I was telling you Madam, I have been the most unsuccessful Creature living, in things of that nature; and never had the good Fortune to be trusted once with a Lady's Secret, not once.</p>

                     <p>Faith and Troth you're a wise Woman, and I'm glad to hear you say so; I was afraid you were in Love with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate; Odd, I was sorry for you with all my Heart: Hang him, Mungrel; cast him off; you shall see the Rogue shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and make Love to some desponding <hi>Cadua</hi> of Fourscore for Sustenance. Odd, I love to see a young Spend thrist forc'd to cling to an Old Woman for Support, like Ivy round a dead Oak: Faith I do; I love to see 'em hug and cotten together, like Down upon a Thistle.</p>

                     <p>Nay, You say true in that, it's but a folly to lie: For to speak one thing, and to think just the contrary way; is as it were,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62762:31"/>
to look one way, and to row another. Now, for my part d'ee see, I'm for carrying things above Board, I'm not for keeping any thing under Hatches,—so that if you ben't as willing as I, say so a God's name, there's no harm done; may-hap you may be shame-fac'd, some Maidens thof' they love a man well enough, yet they don't care to tell'n so to's face: If that's the Case, why silence gives consent.</p>

                     <p>Mess, <hi>I</hi> love to speak my mind—Father has nothing to do with me—Nay, <hi>I</hi> can't say that neither; he has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with me. But what do's that signifie? If so be, that I ben't minded to be steer'd by him; 'tis as tho'f he should strive against Wind and Tyde.</p>

                     <p>Aye, but my Dear, we must keep it secret, till the Estate be setled; for you know, Marrying without an Estate, is like Sailing in a Ship without Ballast.</p>

                     <speaker>Ben.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ben.</speaker>
                     <p>Break your Heart? I'de rather the <hi>Mary-gold</hi> shou'd break her Cable in a storm, as well as <hi>I</hi> love her. Flesh, you don't think I'm false-hearted, like a Land-man. A Sailer will be honest, tho'f may-hap he has never a Penny of Mony in his Pocket—May-hap I may not have so fair a Face, as a Citizen or a Courtier; but for all that, I've as good Blood in my Veins, and a Heart as sound as a Bisket.</p>

                     <p>Understood! She is harder to be understood than a Piece of <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Antiquity, or an <hi>Irish</hi> Manuscript; you may pore till you spoil your Eyes, and not improve your Knowledge.</p>

                     <p>they say so of a Witches Pray'r, and Dreams and <hi>Dutch</hi> Almanacks are to be understood by contraries. But there's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and Method in that; she is a Medal without a Reverse or Inscription; for Indifference has both sides alike. Yet while she does not seem to hate me, I will pursue her, and know her if it be possible, in spight of the Opinion of my Satirical Friend, <hi>Scandal,</hi> who says,
<q>
                           <l>That Women are like Tricks by slight of Hand,</l>

Odd, I have warm Blood about me yet, I can serve a Lady any way—Come, come, let me tell you, you Women think a Man old too soon, faith and troth you do—Come, don't despise Fifty; odd Fifty, in a hale Constitution, is no such contemptible Age.</p>

Hang your side-Box Beaus; no, I'm none of those, none of your forc'd Trees, that pretend to Blossom in the Fall; and Bud when they should bring forth Fruit. I am of a long liv'd Race, and inherit Vigour, none of my Family married till Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet they begot Sons and Daughters till Fourscore. I am of your Patriarchs, I, a Branch of one of your <hi>Antideluvian</hi> Families, Fellows, that the Flood could not wash away. Well, Madam, what are your Commands? Has any young Rogue affronted you, and shall I cut his Throat? or—</p>

                        <hi>Sampson,</hi> I have no Quarrel upon my Hands—I have more Occasion for your Conduct than your Courage at this time. To tell you the Truth, I'm weary of living single, and want a Husband.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir <hi>Samp.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Odsbud, and 'tis pity you should—Odd, wou'd she wou'd like me, then I shou'd hamper my young Rogues: Odd, wou'd she wou'd; faith and troth she's devilish Handsom.</p>
                     <stage>Aside.</stage>
                     <p>Madam, you deserve a good Husband, and 'twere pity you shou'd be thrown away upon any of these young idle Rogues about the Town. Odd, there's ne're a young Fellow worth hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—that is a very young Fellow—Pize on 'em, they never think beforehand of any thing;—And if they commit Matrimony, 'tis as they commit Murder; out of a Frolick: And are ready to hang themselves, or to be hang'd by the Law, the next Morning.—Odso, have a care, Madam.</p>

                     <p>Therefore I ask your Advice, Sir <hi>Sampson:</hi> I have For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune enough to make any Man easie that I can like; If there were such a thing as a young agreeable Man, with a reasonable Stock of good Nature and Sense—For I would neither have an absolute Wit, nor a Fool.</p>

                     <speaker>Sir <hi>Samp.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Odd, you are hard to please, Madam; to find a young Fellow that is neither a Wit in his own Eye, nor a Fool in the Eye of the World, is a very hard Task. But, faith and troth you speak very discreetly; For I hate both a Wit and a Fool.</p>

                     <p>She that marries a Fool, Sir <hi>Sampson,</hi> commits the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of her Honesty or Understanding to the Censure of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62762:48"/>
World: And she that marries a very Witty Man, submits both to the Severity and insolent Conduct of her Husband. I should like a Man of Wit for a Lover, because I would have such an one in my Power; but I would no more be his Wife, than his Enemy. For his Malice is not a more terrible Consequence of his Aversion, than his Jealousie is of his Love.</p>

                     <p>None of old <hi>Foresight's Sybills</hi> ever utter'd such a Truth. Odsbud, you have wone my Heart: I hate a Wit; I had a Son that was spoil'd among 'em; a good hopeful Lad, till he learn'd to be a Wit—And might have risen in the State—But, a pox on't, his Wit run him out of his Money, and now his Poverty has run him out of his Wits.</p>

                     <p>'Tis an unreasonable Accusation, that you lay upon our Sex: You tax us with Injustice, only to cover your own want of Merit. You would all have the Reward of Love; but few have the Constancy to stay till it becomes your due. Men are
