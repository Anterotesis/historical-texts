         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A DEFENCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF LOVE, Which are necessary to the <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> of Christians; and are delivered in a Book called <hi>The Cure of Church-Divisions.</hi> I. Inviting all sound and sober Christians, (by what name soever called) to receive each other to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the same Churches. II. And where that (which is first desirable) cannot be attained, to bear with each other in their distinct Assemblies, and to manage them all in Christian Love. Written to detect and eradicate all Love-killing, dividing, and Church-destroying Principles, Passions and Practices, and to preserve the weak in this hour of manifold temptation.</p>

               <p> This seemeth very absurd to many, that ungodly, or prophane, or wicked men, are cherished in the bosome of the Church: And very many being over morose under pretence of zeal, unless all things be composed to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, because absolute purity is no where to be found, do tumultuously depart from the Church, or by unseasonable rigidness do overthrow and destroy it. Therefore in my judgement, this is the simple scope of the Parable: that as long as the Church sojourneth in this world, bad men and hypocrites will be mixt with the good and sincere in it; that Gods Children may arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb facs="tcp:64624:3"/>
with patience, and among the offences that might trouble them, may retain unbroken faith and constancy:—Indeed this is a very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome condition, that the Church is burthened with Reprobates to the worlds end: But this is the space that Christ prescribeth us for patience, lest we flatter our selves with empty hopes—The Pastors indeed must diligently labour to purge the Church: And in this all godly men should help them, as far as their Calling doth allow. But when all men have done their best, they shall not so far have success, as to purge the Church from all defilements.—And Christ would bridle and moderate their Zeal, who think it unlawful to have Communion (or fellowship) with any but pure Angels—They that preposterously make haste to root out all that displeaseth them, do as much as in them is prevent Christs judgement, and snatch and usurp the Angels work.</p>

That matters were then very corrupt with the Jews, is known. All Religion was so collapsed, that it is no wonder that the manner of praying was rightly observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by few. And when the promised Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was at hand, it was meet that the minds of the faithful should by prayer be stirred up to desire and hope for it. <hi>Iohn</hi> might from several places of Scripture make up one certain prayer, which should be agreeable to the time, and might come nearer to the Spiritual Kingdom of Christ.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Rethren, why should I wonder at the fruits of those weaknesses which we are all subject to (some more, some less) in this state of imperfection? and which I so lately told you of at large, in my <hi>Character</hi> of and <hi>Directions</hi> for <hi>Weak-Christians.</hi> If a spirit of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> in <hi>Paul</hi> and other the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of our Lord, could not overcome these lamentable failings, in their hearers and followers, in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64624:9"/>
Church, why should such as I look for more success. If <hi>Paul</hi> thought his <hi>Galatians</hi> foolish and bewitched <hi>Gal. 3. 1.</hi> and his <hi>Corinthian</hi> Christians to be <hi>babes, yea Carnal</hi> and <hi>not Spiritual,</hi> because there were among them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>envying, strife,</hi> and <hi>divisions,</hi> or as the words sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, <hi>zeal</hi> or <hi>emulation, strife</hi> and <hi>separations</hi> or <hi>factions,</hi> or <hi>dividing into several parties,</hi> while one saith, I <hi>am of Paul, and another I am of Apollos;</hi> what wonder if we are no better now. But our sins are not the less because that others had the like, but the <hi>greater</hi> because we take not warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them, when the spirit of God hath so smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprehended them.</p>
            <p>I have as little reason as you to be ignorant what provocations the present militating and exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated parties do give each others; and how fair pretenses uncharitableness hath obtained. And I know but few of you that have either more openly put themselves into the breach, and attempted more to have prevented both <hi>severities against you,</hi> and the present <hi>divisions among us,</hi> than I have done, or that have undergone more <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>calumny</hi> (to mention no other kind of sufferings) for such attempts than I have done: you cannot justly think that it is for want of your provocations and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to discontent, that I am not of your mind. I have had as many and great provocations as most of you all: And I am not naturally without those passions, which would take advantage by such usage. A multitude of fierce and reproachful Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes are written against me, many of them abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with gross untruths in matter of fact; to all which I have for peace sake been silent to this day.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64624:9"/>
And none that know me do think, that it is to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape mens wrath that I have been more for peace and unity than you. I will do that right to them that have done me but little, as to testifie that I verily believe, could my Conscience comply with their Opinions and wills, I could as soon have their favour as most among you. But God is still the God of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Concord;</hi> and so must all his servants be: He changeth not, and <hi>we must not change</hi> from this which is his Image. <hi>This is my Religion;</hi> and if any mens provocations must change me from this, they must change my Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I am not for such fruits of suffering as some late eminent prisoners in <hi>London</hi> were, who turned Quakers in prison, and lost their Religion with their liberty; nor will I pretend Conscience for the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of my Conscience, and the forsaking of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred life of Love. Do you not your selves condemn a <hi>Carnal state?</hi> Remember then that they are <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> who are <hi>contentious dividers</hi> in the Churches, <hi>1 Cor. 3. 1, 2, 3.</hi> You will I doubt not joyn with me in disallowing of a <hi>fleshly mind</hi> and <hi>life:</hi> Remember then that the <hi>workes of the flesh are these,</hi> as <hi>adulteries, fornications, &amp;c.</hi> So also, <hi>hatred</hi> (or <hi>enmities) variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Dividings into parties) heresies, envyings, &amp;c.</hi> I know you will confess that <hi>if any man have not the spirit of Christ, the same is none of his, Rom. 8. 9.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member then that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ is the spirit of <hi>Love; Love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> is that <hi>Divine nature</hi> which God indueth all Christs members with. <hi>The fruit of the spirit is Love, joy, peace, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64624:10"/>
               <hi>temperance, Gal. 5. 20, 21, 22.</hi> When we think our selves <hi>wiser</hi> than those we differ from, let us not shew it by <hi>masterly censoriousness</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi> but by being as much <hi>more Loving</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> than they are. <hi>My brethren be not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Masters, knowing that ye shall receive the greater condemnation.</hi> And when other mens faults rise up before you, watch both your passions and your tongues, remembring that <hi>In many things we all offend: And if any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able to bridle the whole body. Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? Let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom: But if ye have a bitter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious zeal and strife in your hearts, glory not and lie not against the truth: This wisdom descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish: For where envying zeal</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work, Jam. 3. 1, 2, 13, 14, 15, 16.</hi> Brethren no change of times will allow me to change from this which is my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: No injuries from men will excuse me if I forsake it. I hope I shall not be such a changeling in this which is the Great Command of the Gospel, and the fulfilling of the Law, and the very <hi>Heart</hi> of all Religion, as to turn from it for a prison or a voluminous calumny and reproach. I confess I must change, but I hope it will be, to turn still to more and more Love and Concord, and not to Less. It is not thank worthy to Love those that Love us, nor to speak well of those that use us well, nor to take it patiently when we are bussetted or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our faults: But if we suffer for well doing,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64624:10"/>
and lose none of our Love or patience or integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by our sufferings, happy are we. Alas how sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do many mistake, that fear only yielding to those whom they suffer by, and do not fear those passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which would quench their Love, and turn them unto sects and heresies, in meer opposition to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicters.</p>
            <p>I know that the great objection is, <hi>That under pretence of Love, I would bring ungodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors into reputation, and tempt men to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Communion with them, and that I make an ill application of good principles, to hide the odiousness of their sins, that care so little for the souls of men, as their usage of Ministers and people doth openly declare. If I had only perswaded you to unite in Love to one another, and not to think better of the destroyers of the Church, nor to comply with them in their Idolatrous way of worship, you could have born it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Brethren, will you, that take it for injustice in a Iudge, who will condemn a man before he hear him speak for himself, be intreated but to repress your passions for a little while, till you have calmely considered these things following.</p>
            <p>1. Did I ever perswade you to think well of the faults of other men, while I perswaded you to love their persons? (unless you call the Communion a fault of which we are to speak anon) Did I ever seek to abate your dislike of the sins which you most speak against? Either malignity, cruelty, persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or any other.</p>
            <p>2. The thing which I perswaded men to in that book, was Communion with all Christians, (but differently as they differ in degrees of purity.) That
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64624:11"/>
which I motioned and pleaded for, I summed up in the latter end, with the contrary extreams; which you may there read in five propositions, <hi>1. To ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the primitive simplicity, and make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing necessary to our Concord and Communion which is not so. 2. To love your neighbours as your selves, and receive those to Communion whom Christ receiveth, and that hold the foresaid necessary things, be they Episcopal, Presbyterian, Independents, Anabaptists, Calvinists, Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Lutherans, &amp;c. so they be not proved he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical or wicked.</hi> Peruse the rest. When you come to your selves you will confess that this was no unreasonable nor unchristian motion? Which of all these <hi>Parties</hi> is it that you are angry with me for perswading you to Communion with? Must <hi>every one</hi> of the Parties renounce Communion with all the rest? O how unlike is this doctrine to that of the Holy Ghost? <hi>1 Cor. 1. 10. &amp; 3. 1, 2, 3. Rom. 14. &amp; 15. &amp;c.</hi> If not <hi>every one,</hi> which of them is it? Is any one of all these <hi>Parties,</hi> the whole <hi>Church</hi> of God? who dare say so? Why should I refuse Communion with <hi>any one</hi> of these, while I scruple not Communion with <hi>all the rest.</hi> Or if it must be but with <hi>one sort,</hi> how shall I know which of them it must be?</p>
            <p>I know some men judge of others by their <hi>Own opinions</hi> and <hi>self interest:</hi> But is that indeed the Christian Rule? Some of the Episcopal way are angry with me for including the Independents; when I doubt not but the far greater part of them are the sincere servants of Christ: And since their Synods late moderation, I know not many Churches in the world, besides the <hi>Waldenses</hi> of the <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64624:11"/>
               <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Hungarian</hi> Government, who are neerer to my own judgement, in Order and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline than those in New England are, and none that for Piety I prefer before them. Some are angry with me for taking in the Anabaptists: when it is not such as the <hi>Munster</hi> Anabaptists that we have to do with, but godly men, that differ from us in a point so difficult, that many of the Papists and Prelatists have maintained, that it is not determined in Scripture, but Dependeth on the tradition of the Church. I am not of their mind, and I have given them my reasons in my book for Infant Baptism: But having had more invitation to study the point throughly, and treat of it largely, than most of those that are offended herein, let them give me leave to say, that I know it to be a very difficult point; And I know as good and sober men of that mind, as of theirs that are most against them; And I know that in the dayes of <hi>Tertullian, Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene, Augustine,</hi> men had liberty to be baptized, or to bring their children, when and at what age they pleased, and none were forced to go against their Consciences: And I know not that our Rule or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is changed, or that we are grown any wiser or better than they. I once motioned terms of Concord to the Anabaptists, and was in as hopeful a way for Peace with them, as with most others, till—</p>
            <p>Some are offended that I put in the Arminians; when I am confident that there is not one of many hundreds, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are against Communion with them that know what Arminianisme is, and truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the difference. And the same men refuse not Communion with those <hi>Anabaptists</hi> who are <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians.</hi> And it hath been the work of not only
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64624:12"/>
               <hi>Mr. Dury,</hi> but many other excellent men, for many years, to reconcile the Lutherans with the Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists! and it hath justly been thought a blessed work to draw them to Communion with each other! And yet the Lutherans are not only of most of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minan opinions, but also have superintendents, litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, ceremonies, exorcisme, Church-images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When so much labour hath been bestowed in this work, and so many excellent Treatises written for it, by pious <hi>Dury, Junius, Paraeus, Calixtus, Ludov. Crocius, Joh. Bergius, Conrad. Bergius, Hatto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Amyraldus, Hall, Davenant, Morton, &amp;c.</hi> When all sober Protestants have prayed for their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, or approved this design, are we now come to that pass, that those that seem the zealousest for the Church and mutuall Love, shall think it to be a sin, either to hold Communion with the Lutherans, or to write for it?</p>
            <p>But the great offence is that I put in the <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,</hi> as fit for our Communion; which I suppose is principally because of their <hi>manner of worship,</hi> in which we must have Communion with them. Which foreseeing, I answered more objections <hi>against this</hi> than against the rest; which hath occasioned some falsly to affirm, that I write only to draw men to Communion with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> I will therefore here proceed to some further expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this point.</p>
            <p>3. Is there ever a word in all my Book, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you to Communion with a Diocesan Church, as such?</p>
            <p>4. Is there one word in it for your Communion with a national Church, that hath one political spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Constitutive Head under Iesus Christ; (though
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64624:12"/>
the Kings supremacie none of us question) Do I once <hi>meddle</hi> with any such thing?</p>
            <p>5. Is there a word to perswade you to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Persecutors?</hi> Though I am forced to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please you by answering that objection, and telling you that we should be <hi>Impartial,</hi> and remember what most parties or many have done to others; which you were not able it seems, to bear, though it was plainly necessary to the due resolution of the Case in question, whether any Persecutors may be Communicated with?</p>
            <p>6. Is there one word to perswade you that <hi>every Parish</hi> is a true Church, and fit to be Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with? If none of all this be there, I hope your Patience is not very hard put to it, if I do but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to repent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you have said that of it which is untrue, whoever told you so, or at least, not to proceed in untruths when you are so often warned of them.</p>
            <p>7. Do you think that it was done like tender conscienced Christians, for so many to say, that I write against <hi>your meetings,</hi> yea that <hi>I conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my self?</hi> And this before ever they saw my book, or ever spake with man that saw it? And that men dare yet continue such sayings while the book is visible to prove them false? and revile against it when they confess that they never read it? Is this the fruit of the spirit of Christ?</p>
            <p>But give me leave after these expostulations, to come a little nearer to your objection, and to tell you openly where we differ.</p>
            <p>1. You would have me speak for Love and Unity among the Nonconformists: (And I know no man that hath done it more frequently and more openly

than I have done; having these 24 years been offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or publishing terms of peace.) But God forbid that ever I should be of their opinion (if there be any such) who think that our union must be only with a Party, and not with the whole Church of Christ; or that we must Love none, or seek peace with none but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se, that are in such points of our own opinion? I am united first to Christ and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church, and consequently to all the parts as such; though in divers degrees as they differ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their Conformity to Christ.</p>
            <p>2. I beseech you endure me with patience to tell you, that I never took either the Non-conformists alone, or the Conformists to be the whole Church of Christ, or to be his only people in this Land: nor the only faithful Ministers of the Gospel.

Where in all the world, do you know a Kingdom, where the greater part are not too bad, and where those that are of the Rulers Religion, be it never so right, do not comply with it to serve their flesh? The Low Countries have no Bishops nor Ceremonies, nor no such Liturgie as most are offended at with us, but are under the Presbyterian Government: And yet what the Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n sort are there, and in other such Countries, I need not tell you. Forgive me for telling you, that if you know no godly persons (Ministers or others) of the Episcopal way, I do, and long have done: And as my acquaintance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth I know more and more. You that take me to be so bad, as the Antidote describeth me, will think it no great commendation to them, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64624:14"/>
to know those of them, whom I take to be much better than my self: Therefore I will say a greater word, that I know those of them whom I think as godly and humble Ministers, as most of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists whom I know. I doubt not but there are many hundred Parish Ministers, who are no Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, nor ever consented to Persecution! who Preach holily, and live holily, though I could wish that they were more. And what reason have you to charge any other mens sins on them? I am not ignorant what may be said to make them <hi>consequentially</hi> partakers. But I must say this in answer to all; that if God will charge <hi>undiscerned consequences</hi> upon them and us, there will none of us all be found meet for Church Communion, or for heaven.</p>
            <p>I am judged by your selves to be too <hi>censorious of you,</hi> and too sharp in telling <hi>you</hi> of that which I doubt not to be your sin: why then are you so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with me for being <hi>no more censorious</hi> and <hi>sharp</hi> towards others? was I ever thought to be kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>to them</hi> than <hi>to you?</hi> Is not every man <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> most favourable to those of his <hi>own opinion?</hi> Is it <hi>Conformity</hi> or <hi>Non-conformity</hi> which I have most <hi>defended?</hi> Is it as a <hi>Conformist</hi> or a <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist</hi> that I have been <hi>judged</hi> and used these 33. years? It is they that have lately written re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully against me: It is they that have—I need name no more. But for the Non-conformists I must bear witness of their kindness to me, that they never rejected me, never forbad me to preach (but one Sermon,) nor, (except particular angry parties whom I wrote against,) they never denyed me their good word. What then can you think should draw me to be <hi>too sharp against them,</hi> and too favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

But truth is truth, and the <hi>wisdom from above is without partiality and without hypocrisie.</hi> Do but mark how both parties <hi>justifie</hi> me, while both condemn me, (though I am too Conscious of my faultiness to justifie my self) The one side think that I am not half <hi>sharp enough</hi> against the Anabaptists, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Brethren, I think verily that I have as much to say against conformity, as it is required of us Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as most of you that are most angry have: And yet I tell you again, that I believe there are many hundred Godly Ministers in the Parish Churches of <hi>England,</hi> and that their Churches are true Churches, and that I think not my self worthy to be compared with Mr. <hi>Bolton, Whately, Fenner,</hi> Dr. <hi>Preston, Sibbes, White, Field, U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>selves,</hi> and if I again profess to you, that if they were all alive, and used now the same Liturgy and Ceremonies as they did then, I could not find in my beart to think their Communion in Prayer and Sacrament to be unlawful, nor to censure that man as injurious to the Church, who should write to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade others not to separate from them on that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. I am sure the Assembly of Divines that sate heretofore at <hi>Westminster,</hi> were so conformable when they went thither, that I never heard of five Non-conformists among them, besides the five dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting brethren: Their judgement was (as Mr. <hi>Sprints</hi>) that Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rmity was lawful in case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, rather than to be deprived of liberty to preach the Gospel; but that it was a burden which they should cast off as soon as they had liberty so to do: And I knew some who urged them to declare their Repentance for their former conformity, and to have confessed it to have been their sin. But I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of any considerable number of them that ever did it, or that changed their minds: And though <hi>Ministerial Conformity</hi> (as to <hi>Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>) is now much altered, many <hi>of them</hi> that are <hi>yet living</hi> do again conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>3. But what if in all this I be mistaken, and if Communion in the Liturgie prove unlawful? should you be so impatient as not to bear with one that in such an opinion differeth from you? As <hi>I</hi> write for <hi>my</hi> opinion, so do you for yours? And why should

O brethren, do not expose your selves and cause, so much to the censure of imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al men, and of posterity, as to let them know that you are grown so high, or that in the very day of our humiliation these terms seem so injurious to you, as these exceptions intimate.

of <hi>Parish Communion</hi> to be insufficient, so do I think of yours against it.</p>
            <p>I have read divers that charge the Liturgie with <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Did I ever lay so heavy a charge <hi>on you?</hi> Did I ever say that it is unlawful to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>with you,</hi> as you say it is to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with <hi>others?</hi> Why then should you not bear with <hi>lesser</hi> Contradiction, when others must bear with far <hi>greater from you?</hi> Will you proclaim your selves to be the more impatient?

            <p>Nay, is it seemly for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Is it meet for them who are offended with those that silence us and restrain

us of our liberty, to be so tender, as to shew by such language as this Excepter useth, and by such unjust fames as some others have dispersed, how little themselves can bear dissenters?</p>
            <p>I know that displeasure and impatience in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parties, is <hi>expressed</hi> different wayes; But O that yet you would consider, how near of kin the <hi>principles</hi> are, and how much defect of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> there is <hi>in you</hi> as well as <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And I intreat you to mark but what your own objection intimateth: You could endure it if I had only pleaded for <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> among the <hi>Non-conformists:</hi> But doth not this intimate, that <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> in it self is desirable, among all those that <hi>should agree</hi> and be <hi>united?</hi> Why, I am as well able to prove that <hi>all true Christians</hi> should have <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> for the strength of the Universal Church, as any of you all are able to prove, that any one Party should have Concord in it self. The Episcopal part would have all possible Concord among those that are Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal; and the Presbyterians among Presbyterians, and the Independents among Independents, and the Anabaptists among Anabaptists; no party is for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions among themselves, till the particular tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation doth prevail. And yet I am not <hi>pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> for motioning, that all sober Christians, as Christians, may have all possible Love, Peace and Concord among themselves.</p>
            <p>Brethren, I am sure that Christs body is but one: I do not despise all those words of Christ and the Spirit which I cited in my book: I know that the diversity of knowledge and gifts among true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, should not make <hi>diversities of Churches,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64624:17"/>
               <hi>1 Cor. 12.</hi> When <hi>I know</hi> this, and <hi>cannot choose</hi> but know it, why should any be angry with me <hi>for knowing it? I know</hi> that the Godly Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists and Non-conformists in <hi>England should be united,</hi> as well as each party among themselves; I know that our division gratifieth the Papists, and greatly hazardeth the Protestant Religion, and that more than most of you seem to believe or to regard; I <hi>know</hi> that our division advantageth Profaneness, and greatly hindereth the success of Ministers on both sides: I <hi>know</hi> that it greatly pleaseth Satan, and buildeth up his Kingdom, and weakneth the Kingdom of our Lord: His own mouth hath told us so: And shall I not believe him? As in our <hi>Worcestershire</hi> Agreement heretofore, we proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on terms which excluded not the <hi>Episcopal;</hi> so in our desires and terms of Concord, we must still go the same way, and shut out none from our Love and Communion, whom Christ receiveth and would have us receive. If <hi>they</hi> shut out <hi>us,</hi> that is not <hi>our sin</hi> but <hi>theirs.</hi> The hurt and loss is farr more to the <hi>excluder than the excluded;</hi> to him that <hi>loseth his Charity,</hi> than to him that loseth but <hi>Communion</hi> with others. And I know that as none shall take out of Christs hands, those that are given him by the Father, and he himself will in no wise cast them out; so he will at last give no more thanks either to <hi>Diotrephes</hi> or to any <hi>separating parties,</hi> that would rob him of his own, and say that his <hi>Children</hi> are <hi>not his Children,</hi> and that his <hi>Churches</hi> are <hi>not his Churches,</hi> and that his <hi>Worship</hi> is <hi>not his Worship,</hi> but <hi>Idolatry,</hi> than <hi>you</hi> will give to him that will turn out your Children and servants, and take away your

            </p>
            <p>Brethren, it grieveth me to the heart, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party <hi>Conformable</hi> or <hi>Non-conformable</hi> is more sensible of the sin and danger of our distance. (Though I know that in both parties there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wise and holy persons, who I suppose lament it more than I do.) It layeth my soul in daily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, to see how we run further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from each other; to the apparent danger of the Protestant Cause, and of the Kingdoms welfare, and of all the hopes of our posterity; And that in stead of repenting of those sins which every party is guilty of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and taking warning by our former experiences, or by the dreadful judgements of God upon us all, that yet we are daily losing the little Love that is left, and still flying further into more and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperations and distast; As if all the Church and Kingdoms hopes consisted in <hi>overcoming</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When our long experience telleth us, that <hi>subduing</hi> those that must still be <hi>members,</hi> is no Cure of a divided body; and that <hi>treading</hi> men <hi>down</hi> doth but alienate them the more.</p>
            <p>And I know that it is Concord and Union upon <hi>such terms</hi> in which we <hi>are all agreed,</hi> that must be our Cure, if ever we be Cured. And that <hi>no Covenant</hi> nor <hi>partial interest,</hi> can possibly justifie us, if we will stablish our union on <hi>such terms,</hi> as shall either <hi>exclude</hi> such on one side as <hi>Jewel, Grindal, Downam, Hall</hi> and other such Bishops, or such on the other side as <hi>Ames, Hildersham, Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright, Bayne, Egerton,</hi> and other such worthy persons that were Nonconformists:</p>
            <p>For my part, <hi>my terms</hi> should neither exclude, Episcopal, Independent, nor Anabaptist. But one
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64624:18"/>
that <hi>will separate</hi> and <hi>exclude himself,</hi> or one that will <hi>tyraniz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> and exclude <hi>all others,</hi> we cannot any otherwise have Concord and Communion with, than distantly by Christian principles and patience. But at long running they shall be all convinced, that the Cure of the Church is not by meer <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi> or <hi>Contempt</hi> of others; Nor by the Union and Concord of <hi>some Parties</hi> only, but of the <hi>whole;</hi> And that the sound and sober Conformists and Non-conformists, are the parts in <hi>England,</hi> that must be united; And that neither <hi>Violence</hi> nor <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just separating Censures</hi> are the <hi>healing way;</hi> And that which party soever it be that contriveth and endeavoureth a Union, by the extirpation and ruine of the other part, is schismatical, and taketh the way of desolation; And that it is the Devil, the Infidels, and the Papists, that will be the gainers by our continued divisions. And therefore though I know not the man alive, in <hi>England</hi> who hath more fair pretence, from the ungrateful usage of the differing partie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, to desist from any more such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliatory attempts, yet, let my hopes be never so low, seeing it is a thing that <hi>must be done,</hi> or we are <hi>undone,</hi> I will imitate honest Mr. <hi>Dury,</hi> and choose rather to wast my daies in vain attempts for Peace, than to go quarrelling and contending to the grave, as I have seen too many others do.</p>
            <p>And if both parties in this exasperated age, should never so much revile and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ander me, (though a surviving name be little of my interest) I make no doubt but our <hi>posterity,</hi> will be <hi>constrained by experience,</hi> to think better of <hi>Peace-makers</hi> than of <hi>Contenders.</hi> The names of <hi>Melanchthon, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Calixtus, Bergius, Burroughs, Hall,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:64624:19"/>
               <hi>Davenant, &amp;c.</hi> are far more grateful and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to after times, than the name of <hi>Flacius</hi> (though an excellent learned man) or of <hi>Schlus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selburgius, Calovius,</hi> or any of our fiery Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders or destroyers.</p>
            <p>To all this I add, that even the separated Churches themselves do find a necessity of Union and Concord for their preservation. Division else will pursue the several pieces, and the same principles which I write-against, if they go along with them, will crumble them all to dust. The separated Churches in <hi>Holland</hi> (of the English) fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this. Even those members in <hi>New-England,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> sadly told Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> and me, did withdraw and gather themselves to an unlearned Pastor, and would not be intreated by Magistrates or Ministers, yet when they were separated, would fain keep Concord among themselves. And if half of that separated body, should again have separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the rest, that fragment would fain keep themselves in Unity. And still nature teacheth them to feel that their Unity is their strength and life, and that their Division is their dissolution.</p>
            <p>5. And I must needs tell the world, that though I Conform not, it is greater things than the matters of Conformity, which are the chief parts of my Religion; And therefore it is not <hi>Non-conformity</hi> that we must all Unite in, so much as <hi>Christianity,</hi> and soundness in the Faith. And I doubt not but the Independents who offer to subscribe to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will say that they differ far more from the Quakers, and Seekers, and Familists, than they do from the Conformists. And
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64624:19"/>
so do I, though I would have Love and Gentleness exercised to them all.</p>
            <p>6. And if the present Conformable Ministry were more to be blamed than they are, yet they may <hi>learn</hi> and <hi>profit</hi> while they teach. Many of them are young, coming lately from the University; and may yet grow up to ability and piety, and greater usefulness in the Church: And many of them are prejudiced against their brethren, for want of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: And a Christian prudent Loving familiarity and Conversation with them, may make them in time become more serviceable to the truth, than we are: whereas a continued distance, estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedness, and censorious aversation, will feed their mistakes and uncharitable censure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of us, yea and their sharp severities against us, and will keep up a heart-war, and a Church-war in the land. And alas who knoweth either <hi>when</hi> or <hi>how,</hi> or in whose calamity it will End. For he that puts on his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour should not boast as he that puts it off.</p>
            <p>I do therefore conclude with this repeated profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that it is the Conformists and the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists that constitute the English protestant body; And it is the Conformists and Non-conformists that must at last, (when they are wearied with tearing and opposing one another) be brought together, and the faithful of both partyes must build up the Church in Love and Peace. And therefore the interest of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> must be much kept up by the means of the <hi>Parish Ministers,</hi> and by the <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> there performed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not by the Non conformists alone. And they that think and endeavour that which is contrary to this (of which side soever) shall have the hearty thanks and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Papists.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Him therefore that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations. Let not him that eateth despise him that cateth not. And let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: For God hath received him.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE number of Books written against me is so great, that if I should not be very suspicious of my self, lest I had wronged the truth, and the Church of God, and given men just occasion of all this oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy, I should be very defective in humility, and in that care, which I am obliged to for the avoiding of such injuries. And I find upon examination that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64624:22"/>
if I could have let all sides alone, and judged it consistent with my duty to be silent while the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious man sowed his tares, and not to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted any that I took to be injuring the Truth and Church, nor to have sounded the trumpet against any error which arose before us, I could as easily have escaped their wrath as others. And I find that whereas our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences both in Doctrine, and Worship, and Discipline, have engaged men of several minds in such writings against me. (Some Infidels, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Quakers, Papists, Antinomians, some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, some Anti-arminians, Anabaptists, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists, Levellers, Diocesans, &amp;c.) What one accuseth me of, another doth not only acquit me of, but ordinarily as sharply accuse me for the contrary, and for going no further from the rest. So that nothing but silence could put by their fiercest accusations, And silence it self will not please the Imperious sect, who think me crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, because I serve them not according to their own desire and way. And silence was not that which I promised God at my ordination, nor is it a doing of that work, to which I was then consecrated and devoted.</p>
               <p>But because some men speak in a more San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary dialect than others, and because the late charges of Disloyalty, ought not to be disregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a loyal subject, and because for the sakes of their own souls, it hath often made me pitty Mr. <hi>Durel,</hi> Dr. <hi>Boreman,</hi> and many others like them, who have published ugly falsehoods of me, I once thought to have here exercised so much Charity to them, as by a full Narrative of all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64624:22"/>
those actions of my life, which concern such matters as they accuse me of, to have rectified all their mistakes at once, and made them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, what it is, which they wrote of before they understood it: And the rather because this excepter followeth them, in telling me how guilty I was of the wars, and all the effects of them, and also that I wrote a flattering book to <hi>Richard Cromwell.</hi> And in this narrative I purposed to confess so much as had any truth in their accusations, and to stop them in their falsifications and calumnies as to the rest. But upon second tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ts, I cast it by, perceiving by too long experience, that they who are engaged against the Truth, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bear it, and take all for an unsufferable wrong to them, which detecteth the falsehood of their reports. And when men do (as Mr. <hi>Hink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>) importune me to publish the reasons of my Non-conformity, when they know that the Law forbiddeth it, and there is no expectation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing a Licence, or when the old stratagem is so visibly used, of drawing us by their challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into their Ambuscad'es; or when I am eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked to gape against an oven, while it is red or flaming hot; If I crave their patience, and exercise my own, till it be grown more cool, before I accept of such a challenge, and suffer them to use their Art (till repentance shall unteach it them) and to make my <hi>name</hi> a stepping stone, to those ends which they now aspire after, methinks they should be content, to talk on without a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and to be free from the light of that Truth, which they are not able to endure; Or at least should pardon me, if I imitate my Lord,

that was silent, even when false accusers sought his defamation and his blood. But, God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Before the King was restored, being then at London, I was called to preach two publick ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> one before the Parliament, the day before they voted the Kings return; The other before the Lord Major and Aldermen on a day of thanksgiving for the hopes of his return. In the latter I plainly shewed my sense of the case of the <hi>falling party,</hi> and the <hi>Armies actions,</hi> and gave as plain a warning to the then <hi>rising party,</hi> with some prognosticks thereupon. In the former (the first that ever I preached to a Parliament, and he last,) I spake some words of the facility of Concord with the sober godly moderate sort of the Episcopal Divines, and how quickly Arch-Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> and I came to an Agreement of the termes on which they might Unite. When this Sermon was Printed, this passage caused many moderate Episcopal Divines to urge me to tell them the terms of that Agreement; And they all professed their great desires and hopes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord upon such termes; viz. Dr. <hi>Gulston,</hi> Dr. <hi>Allen,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> and several others. Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> desired a meeting to that end of the several parties, but none came at the day appointed but he and Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64624:23"/>
Dr. <hi>Manton</hi> and I; where I spake these words, which he Printed without the limitation annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which I set right in my next Printed Book, viz. <hi>That I found (then) little or nothing in the doctrinal part of the Common prayer Book, which was not sound, having but as favourable an exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as good mens writings usually mnst have.</hi> He left out [<hi>the doctrinal part</hi>]</p>
               <p>At last when the Earle of <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ery</hi> perswaded me to be his Majesties Chaplain in Ordinary, and was present when the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi> gave me (and Mr. <hi>Ash</hi>) an oath of fidelity, it being he that first brought me acquainted with Bishop <hi>Usher;</hi> the mention of the same business fell in: Whereupon we shortly after were told by the Lord Chamberlain, that it was his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties pleasure, that there should be a treaty for Union between the Episcopal party and the Presbyterians: And Dr. <hi>Reignolds,</hi> Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> and my self being first Employed, when we had made some entrance, we desired that some might be chosen by the Ministers throughout the land, to signifie their sense, because we could speak in the name and sense of none but our selves; But his Majesty not consenting to that, we desired an addition of many brethren at hand, which was granted; and the liberty for all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters that would to meet with us, for consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as many did at Sion-Colledge and elsewhere. In this Treaty we all professed our Judgements for the Lawfulness of a Liturgie; and desired the Reformation of that which we had, with the addition of new forms in Scripture phrase, fitted to the several Offices, with Liberty to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64624:24"/>
to use this or that. Whereupon we drew up such a Liturgie our selves, which though it fell to my share, yet the rest of our brethren exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and approved of it, saving that Dr. <hi>Reignolds</hi> disliked the displeasing the Bishops by such large additions, and a Liturgie seeming entire of it self, instead of <hi>some additional</hi> prayers to theirs. How many weeks we were employed from first to last, in these debates, how fully and freely we took that opportunity to plead for reformation, and against unnecessary impositions, whilest the men that now quarrel with us said nothing that we know of: how hard a province fell to my own lot, as to the offending of the Bishops, under whose hot displeasure I thereby (in obedience to my Conscience) did cast my self, our writings (which somebody hath published for the greater part of them) shew; and our <hi>Savoy</hi> conference, and my prohibition to preach in <hi>Worcester</hi> Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess shortly after (before other Ministers were silenced) and the published writings against me, did all sufficiently acquaint the world: And the particulars of this business I now pass by.</p>
               <p>Only I think meet to make this twofold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, to the two parties on the Extreams;</p>
               <p>1. That the true reason why I wrote and spake so much, so long, and so vehemently, had it been possible to have prevented many Impositions, was principally because I undoubtedly foresaw how great a number of faithful worthy Ministers would else be silenced by them; and how ill the Church could spare those Ministers, while there are so many hundred thousands of ignorant and ungodly people in the land; and what sort of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64624:24"/>
Ministers in too many places must unavoidably succeed them, unless the Church doors should be shut up? and I foresaw how the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such Ministers would be affected to Religion, and to the Bishops, and Ministry? And I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw what multitudes of Religious persons would take the things imposed as unlawful, and would se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from Communion with the publick Churches; and would worship God in private meetings with the silenced Ministers. I foresaw how many Ministers and people that did Conform with a grudging Conscience, would do more at last to undermine the Impositions, than the Non-Conformists. I foresaw easily what jealousies; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spleasure, severities, imprisonments, &amp;c. would follow the private preaching of the silenced Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and the private meetings of the people: And I knew well that other Ministers as well as I, would judge it no better than perfidious sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to forsake the holy calling to which they were consecrated and devoted, and to desert so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand needy souls: But, above all, I foresaw, how certainly and sadly the Churches divisions would be hereby increased, and the Love of each party to the other would be abated, if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed: How hard it was for one side to Love and Honour the Non-conformists, that account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them Persecutors and unconscionable men: And how hard it was for the other side to Love and Honour those that they suffered by: And how little Reproaches, Fines, and Imprisonments, do use to increase mens Love to others.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64624:25"/>
were like enough to account them, Perjured Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Persecutors; and that in the midst of such thoughts, such words, such usage, Love was no more like to prosper, than fire in the sea. And I knew that whatever zeal be pretended for Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Order on one side, or for purity of Worship on the other, when Love dieth, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dieth; and they that are destroyers of Love, are destroyers of the Church and of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of the souls of men: and to increase <hi>Love</hi> is to <hi>save s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And I foresaw that the further they go in this way; the further they will go from God and Godliness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from peace and safety, and that it will be the longer the worse, till they retire: For one hard usage on one side, and hard censure on the other side, after another, will by degrees raise men to the height of bitterness, and make them think, that their interest con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>isteth in the hurt and ruine of each other.</p>
               <p>Also I foresaw that while we worried, and weakned one another, as all Sects would grow under the discontents of one party, so the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists were like to be the principal gainers; And they would be ready to offer their service to strengthen one of the parties against the other; and would be glad to take up the reproaches against the most religious people, that were by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry adversaries brought unto their hands; And that when we had made our selves a Common scorn by our manifold divisions, and by our bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and devouring one another, they would plead this as our shame, to draw people to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as the only stable and consistent Church;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64624:25"/>
and would make us giddy that we might rest on them as our Supporters; and when they saw us weak enough, would be ready to devour us all.</p>
               <p>And I easily foresaw how calamitous a thing it would be to the Kingdom, to have most Towns and Parishes set all together by the ears, and for the neighbours to be as <hi>Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lphes</hi> and <hi>Gibellines,</hi> every man employed in censuring and reproaching others, instead of living together in neighbourly and Christian Love.</p>
               <p>And I foresaw what an injury this would be to the King, to have the suffering party under these temptations, and wise men made mad, and his people weakned by such sad divisions; whereby their cheerfulness in his Love and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice would be abated, and forreign Enemies would be encouraged to attempts against our peace and safety, and if ever they should invade us, it maketh me tremble to think how our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions would debilitate us, and hazard all our common security and hopes. Yea, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable a thing it must needs be to the King, to rule such a divided people, that live in a heart-war among themselves, in comparison of ruling a loving, and concordant sort of men. In a word, I knew that a house or Kingdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided against it self would not stand: And though I could not make the Bishops <hi>believe me,</hi> I <hi>knew</hi> that <hi>divisions, lamentable divisions;</hi> were like to be the consequent, of the things which then I so importunately petitioned and intreated them to forbear: I <hi>kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And for these reasons I wrote, I pleaded, I earnestly contended with them as I did, while
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64624:26"/>
there appeared <hi>any hope,</hi> as being <hi>loth to have seen the things which I have already seen,</hi> and God knoweth to how much worse we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if Grace and Wisdom yet prevent it not. And though I exasperated the sore which I would have cured, and have ever since my self lain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their displeasure, yet I have peace in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of my Conscience, that I did my best, to have prevented our miseries while I had time.</p>
               <p>2. And I would give notice to the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that whilst I pleaded for their liberty, and against the Imposing of unnecessary things, I took not all the things in question for <hi>unlawful to be done,</hi> which I thought <hi>unlawful to be made necessary to our Communion or Ministration.</hi> All knew that my judgement ever was for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of <hi>kneeling</hi> at the Sacrament; (especially since the Rubrick is inserted, which disclaimeth both all Bread Worship and the Bodily real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.) And we all as is said, thought a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie lawful;</hi> and when we wrote our Reply to the Answer of our Exceptions, we said these words (which may tell you, whether I change my mind, and what was then our common sense) pag. 3. [<hi>While we took it to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, disorderly and inconvenient Mode of Worship, it would be our sin to use it of choice, while we may prefer a more convenient way, whatever we ought to do in case of necessity, when we must wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God inconveniently, or not at all.</hi>] And pag. 12, 13.

If you say, that this was but my own Opinion; I answer, Though as they wrote the particular Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without me, so I wrote this Defence of them by their appointment, yet it was examined and consented to by the rest, who were not men apt to take things on trust, nor to be imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sed on by such a one as me.</p>
               <p>When this Treaty was frustrate, and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of displeasure came upon us, (which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with the first) I saw also that the storm of mens passions and discontents would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow: And therefore according to my own judgement and advice to others, I endeavoured to practise my self; that is, neither to <hi>forsake my Calling,</hi> or <hi>omit any service</hi> I could do for the Church, nor yet to do it in a <hi>turbulent and unpeaceable, or dividing way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first, I thought <hi>writing</hi> was my greatest work, which made me not travail abroad to Preach (which also weakness disabled me from doing). But yet I never to my remembrance either forbad any from coming to my house, nor ever invited any to hear me. I had no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal Charge in <hi>London;</hi> nor could I live there with my health: My judgement was, that though
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64624:27"/>
so many hundred Ministers were silenced, and too many Congregations had such, as were to us mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of grief, yet the Interest of the Christian Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion in <hi>England,</hi> must be much kept up, by keeping up as much of Truth, Piety and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as was possible in the Parish Churches. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I never laboured or disputed to make any Minister a Non-conformist, unless he came to me, and by desiring my judgement, made it my duty (Though I oft openly professed, that if I conformed my self to what is required of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, I should take it to be no little or single sin) I remembred the saying of Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> who <hi>thanked God for the Churches sake, that some conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for the Truths sake, that some conformed not.</hi> I resolved that if I lived where was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Minister, I would not hear him, nor come near him, so as to encourage him in his sinful undertaking of that Sacred Office: But if I lived under an able, worthy, or tolerable man, I would joyn with him in publick (constantly if I had not <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> the liberty of better, and sometimes if I had) And I would help him by my private labours as well as I could, and live with him in Unity and Peace. Accordingly I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly joyned in the publick Prayers and hearing at the Parish Church where I lived (having no better that I could go to) and never Preached to my family, but between the times of publick Worship; and the people that came in to me, wen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with me to the publick Worship.</p>
               <p>In all this time many persons importuned me to indeavour that all Non-conformists might agree in one, by what measures to walk as to their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64624:27"/>
with the Parish Churches, and such other things, (for many reasons: And I ever shanned all such attempts; 1. Because it is the way that we have blamed so much in others, to make nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row measures for other mens practices, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary terms of Brotherly Concord: We must unite as Christians in necessary things; and if one man can, <hi>e. g.</hi> kneel at the Sacrament and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot, if one can joyn in Common-prayer, and another cannot; yea, if one can Conform to the Liturgie and Ceremonies, and another can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, it must not break our unity or peace. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Non-conformists are not all of the <hi>same judgement</hi> in every <hi>particular</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And how can they then agree upon the same <hi>practice</hi> in every point? If they <hi>should;</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>most scrupulous</hi> must come up to them that think that <hi>lawful</hi> which <hi>they scruple,</hi> or else the <hi>later</hi> must come to the <hi>former:</hi> If <hi>they</hi> yield that think the things <hi>unlawful,</hi> and do as the others do, they shall sin: And then they might as well Conform? And if they that hold more things to be lawful must agree in practice with them that hold the <hi>fewest</hi> lawful, than such must 1. Forsake their own understandings, and live in many sins; and 2. They must be alwayes at an uncertainty in their practice, because some may yet arise, that may count <hi>more</hi> things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; And so the whole party may change their practice every year, as new scruples or errors arise in any; 3. And so the most scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous though the most erroneous, must be the Standard and Rule of all the rest. 4. And so we should tempt others still to <hi>new scruples,</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64624:28"/>
to make more and more things <hi>sinful,</hi> that so they might obtain the Rule of all. I ever thought therefore that without any combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, our way is, every man to know the truth as well as he can, and practice accordingly; and live in Love and Peace with those that differ from him in tollerable things. And thus I hope most Non-conformable Ministers do.</p>
               <p>In the year 1663 divers learned and reverend Non-conformists of <hi>London</hi> met to Consider how far it was their duty, or lawful to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Parish Churches where they lived in the Liturgie and Sacrament: and we agreed the next day to bring in our several judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in writing with our reasons. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I brought in mine, in which I proved four propositions, 1. That it is Lawful to use a form of prayer: 2. That it is Lawful to joyn with some Parish Churches in the use of the Liturgie. 3. That it is <hi>lawful</hi> to joyn with some Parish Churches in the Lords supper. 4. That it is to some a <hi>duty</hi> to joyn with some Parish Churches three times a year in the Lords supper. They being long, I read over to them the last only, which being proved (by 20. Reasons) included all the rest. Upon Consideration whereof, no one of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren seemed to dissent, but to take the reasons to be valid; save only that <hi>one Objection</hi> stopt them all, to which I also yielded, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at the present to forbear Sacramental Communion with the Parishes: And that was, because it was a time when great severities were threatned against those that could not so far Conform; and most of the Independents and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64624:28"/>
some others were against it; And our brethren verily believed that if we should then Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, those that could not yield so far, would be the sharplier used, because they yielded not as far as we. I yielded to them readily, that <hi>God will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</hi> and even Gods worship otherwise due, as prayer, or preaching, or sabbath-keeping may be omitted for an <hi>act of Mercy,</hi> even to pull an Oxe or Ass out of a pitt. And therefore <hi>pro tempore</hi> I would forbear that sacrament, which was like to cause the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or undoing of my neighbour.</p>
               <p>In mentioning this, these three things are my end. 1. To tell the world the judgement of these Ministers; who are misjudged by their actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al forbearance of publick Communion, that they take it for a thing unlawful: whereas they are thus accidentally hindered from it (Besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other accidents not here to be mentioned, this before named is one.) 2. To shew the Prelates who and what it is that hath hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mens nearer Communion with them; And that while rigor and severity is trusted to as the only means to further it, it proveth the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal means of hindering it. 3. To shew the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, that we have been so far from dealing hardly or uncharitably with them, that we have forborn that Communion, which else our own judgements would have charged on us as our duty, either only, or chiefly for fear of being the least occasion accidentally of their sufferings: And if yet they are impatient with us for obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Consciences, who can help it</p>
               <p>What the rest did after this consultation in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64624:29"/>
their practices, I enquired not: But for my own part on the same argument I forbore Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Parish Churches in the sacrament a long time, till at last I saw that the Reason seemed to me to cease, and I durst not for I knew not what, go against my judgement: But lest it might possibly have any such hurtful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents, I chose a very private Country Parish to Communicate with, where I sometime so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed, and where there was neither that, nor any other reason to hinder me: But yet after many years further observation, lest men that know not of my practice, should be scandalized or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared, to think that I forbore Parish Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>as unlawful,</hi> and so to do the like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, I once chose an <hi>Easter day</hi> to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in a very populous Church in <hi>London,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely that it might be the further known: But having some reasons to forbear at the Parish where I lived most constantly, it so far provoked the Parson that—I may suppose no Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent suffered so much through <hi>my Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating,</hi> as I have done by forbearing for their sakes.</p>
               <p>At last in the year 1667. observing how mens minds grew every day more and more exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their sufferings, and whither all this tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what was like to be the issue, I wrote this book called <hi>The Cure of Church-Divisions;</hi> the Reasons whereof I am next to give you. But being not used to publish any thing unlicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, nor thinking it fit to break the Law of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without necessity, nor knowing how to get it Printed unlicensed if I would; I knew that if
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64624:29"/>
I put any thing into it very provokingly, it would not be licensed, and would frustrate all the rest. And yet my Conscience told me, that it looked so like partiality, to tell one party of their faults, and call them to their duty, and not the other, that I resolved to say as much to the Bishops and Imposing Clergy, as should sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie my judgement plainly to any intelligent man, and tell them what sense I had of narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Impositions and Severities, and what is the way of Unity and Peace, though not to cloath it in exasperating language: And if they would not not license it all together, I purposed to cast it all aside.</p>
               <p>And to confess the truth, the deep sense of the sin and infatuation of this age, hath long made me desirous to have written one Book, with the Title in dying <hi>Bradfords</hi> words, REPENT O ENGLAND; and that in several parts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing first, <hi>my own Repentance</hi> in several Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, then calling severally the <hi>Bishops and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> and the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> Corporations and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to Repent. But I knew the <hi>Bishops</hi> would not endure it, and I could not get it Licensed or Printed, and I had greater things to write, and many wise men whose judgements much rule me, disswaded me and laughed at my weakness, that I should think that such men would regard what I said, or that it would have any better effect than exasperation! And I long purposed not to speak to one sort, till I might speak to all, to avoid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and evil consequents.</p>
               <p>But at last considering, that by this rule I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64624:30"/>
might never tell any of their sins, nor preach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to them whilst I lived, and that I must not deny my duty and Charity to one sort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause another sort will not receive it, and seeing also necessity increase, and having already writen and said so much to the other party, I resolved to imitate those two excellent faithful Tractates, viz. 1. Mr. <hi>M. Pool</hi>'s <hi>Vox clamantis in deserto</hi> in Latine, calling the <hi>Non-conformable Ministers</hi> to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lewis Stukeley</hi>'s (<hi>a</hi> worthy Congregational Minister in <hi>Exeter,</hi> and a kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the late General <hi>Monkes</hi>) enumerating copiously most of the Common sins of <hi>Religious Professors,</hi> and calling them earnestly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to repentance, which since the writing of this, I find excellently done in a book called <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands danger and only Remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore I first published some old notes written eleven or twelve years ago called <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for weak Christians,</hi> and annexed to it <hi>The Character of a sound Christian;</hi> In both which I wrote that which was as like to have exasperated the impatient, as <hi>this</hi> book is; And yet I heard of no complaints, And afterward I wrote <hi>this</hi> which I now defend; and sent it to the Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, who upon perusal refused to License it; And so it lay by, and I purposed to meddle with it no more. But leaving it in the Booksellers hands that had offered it to be Licensed, after a long time he got it done; and so unexpectedly it revived.</p>
               <p>The Reasons of my writing it were no fewer than all these following, which I now sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the judgement of all men truly peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and impartial, who value the interest of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64624:30"/>
Christianity, and of the universal Church above their own.</p>
               <p>1. To make up my foregoing <hi>Directions to weak Christians</hi> more compleat. Having dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them about the private matters of their souls, I intended this as another Part, to Direct them in order to the Churches Peace.</p>
               <p>2. Many good people of tender Consciences and weak judgements, desiring my advice about Communion in the publick Assemblies, I found it meetest to publish this general Advice for all, to save me the labour of speaking to particular persons, and to serve those that lived further off.</p>
               <p>3. I saw those Principles growing up apace, in this time of prevocation, which will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increase or continue our <hi>divisions,</hi> if <hi>they</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and increase. I am sure that our wounds are made by <hi>wounding principles</hi> of <hi>doctrine;</hi> And it must be <hi>healing doctrines</hi> that must <hi>heal</hi> us: And I know that we cannot be healed, till <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal principles</hi> be healed. To give way to the prevalency of <hi>dividing Opinions</hi> is to give up our hopes of future unity and peace. And to give up our hopes of <hi>Unity and Peace,</hi> is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of all true <hi>Reformation,</hi> and happiness of the Church on earth. If ever the Church be reduced to that Concord, Strength, and Beauty, which all true Christians do desire, I am past doubt that it must be by such principles, as I have here laid down.</p>
               <p>4. But my grand reason was, that I might serve the Church of Christ, in the reviving and preservation of <hi>Christian Love.</hi> As it was an extraordinary measure of the Spirit, which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64624:31"/>
Christ made his Witness in the Gospel Church; so is it as extraordinary a measure of <hi>Love,</hi> which he maketh the New Commandment, and the mark of all his true Disciples: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afflicting on one side, and unmerciful and unjust censures, on the other side, one <hi>driving away;</hi> and the other <hi>flying away,</hi> be either a <hi>sign</hi> or <hi>means</hi> of Love: And whether taking others to be intolerable in the Church, and unworthy of our Communion, and separating from, or avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Worship where they are present, be likely to <hi>kindle</hi> Love, or to <hi>kill</hi> it, let any man judge, that hath himself the exercise of Reason, and unfeigned Love. I know that this is the hour of Temptation to the sufferers, to stir up passion and distaste; and that men have need of more than ordinary grace and watchfulness, and therefore of more than ordinary helps &amp; warning, to preserve due Love, and keep out an undue ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of those by whom they suffer. And how great a temptation also <hi>their censures</hi> and <hi>discontents</hi> will prove, to their <hi>Superiours,</hi> and others by whom they suffer, and what unspeakable hurt it may do <hi>their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uls,</hi> may easily be conjectured. This <hi>sin</hi> will prove our greatest <hi>loss.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Hereupon men will be engaged in <hi>sinful Actions</hi> of <hi>injustice</hi> and <hi>uncharitableness</hi> against each other. They will be glad to <hi>hear,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>believe</hi> hard and false reports of one another. And too forward to <hi>vent</hi> such behind one anothers backs: And there is no doubt, but many of each party already think worse of the <hi>other</hi> commonly, than they are: (Though, alas, we are all too bad, and some egregiously
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64624:31"/>
wicked.) And those <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> that would censure a man for Curses or Oaths, should also censure men for <hi>slanders</hi> and <hi>backbitings.</hi> And should I not do my best, to prevent such a course of daily sin?</p>
               <p>6. Both <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>separation</hi> tend to divide the <hi>builders themselves,</hi> and keep the <hi>Ministers</hi> in contending with, and Preaching and Writing against each other, which should be employed in an unanimous opposition to the Kingdom of Satan in the world, And when <hi>all their united wisdom</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> is too little against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ignorance and Prophaneness of the world, their <hi>division</hi> will disable them, and give sin and Satan opportunity to prevail.</p>
               <p>7. It may engage them on both sides in the dreadful fin of <hi>persecuting</hi> each other, one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the <hi>Hand,</hi> and the other by the <hi>Tongue,</hi> (even while they cry out of persecution:) And on both sides to hinder the Gospel and mens salvation, on one side by hindering the <hi>Preachers</hi> from their <hi>work,</hi> and on the other side (yea on both) by hindring the <hi>success.</hi> For what can be more done to make men despise the <hi>word,</hi> than to teach them to despise or abhor the <hi>Preacher?</hi> And what more can be done to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy mens souls, than to harden them against the <hi>Word?</hi> Is there any s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A man need not the Spirit of God, and supernatural Grace, nor much Self-denyal, nor Mortification of the flesh, to make him choose a certain <hi>fashion</hi> of external Worship, and think that now he and those that are of that <hi>fashion,</hi> are the only peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to reproach all of other <hi>fashions,</hi> as ungodly, and to think that he is therefore a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christian than the other, because his <hi>fashion</hi> of outward Worship seemeth the better to him. Not that <hi>any thing</hi> in Gods Worship should be denyed its due regard; But its pity that by an <hi>unproportionable</hi> estimation of mens several <hi>outward fashions, words</hi> and <hi>gestures,</hi> poor souls should be tempted to deceive themselves, and to forget that he is the best Christian that hath most Faith, Humility, Love and Heavenliness, which is the true Holiness, and Beauty of the soul.</p>
               <p>9. When men think a <hi>Lawful Communion</hi> (yea, a <hi>duty</hi>) to be <hi>unlawful;</hi> it will both keep them in the sin of <hi>omitting it,</hi> and cause them to add their sinful <hi>Censures</hi> of all those that <hi>use that Communion</hi> which they avoid. They do not only think that they are holier, because they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64624:32"/>
                  <hi>hear not,</hi> and <hi>pray not,</hi> and <hi>communicate not</hi> in the Parish Churches, but they look down with a supercilious pity upon those that do? And how many parties have I thus been pitied by? As I go along the Streets, the Quakers say, <hi>Poor man, thou art in darkness.</hi> The Papists pity me, for not being one of them: The Anabaptists pity me, for not being one of them: The Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists pity or disdain me, because I forbear not the Worship that they forbear: And this Excepter lamenteth my condition as passionately as any. It is not for [<hi>Not Worshipping with them</hi>] that they censure me (for I am ready to do it,) but for Worshipping with <hi>others,</hi> in <hi>Words</hi> which <hi>they</hi> like not. And whereas holiness was wont to be expressed most by <hi>Worship actions,</hi> now it must be characterized more by <hi>Negatives,</hi> even in external adjuncts. And if he be the best man that avoideth most the Communion of others which he taketh to be bad, I have, and have had, neighbours better than you all, that never communicate with any Church, nor ever publickly hear, or pray, or Worship God at all, because they think all your wayes of Worship to be bad.</p>
               <p>I remember <hi>Rivet</hi> marketh out <hi>Grotius</hi> by this, that while he forsook the Protestant Churches, and called us to unite with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (that is, <hi>with the Pope ruling not arbitrarily, but by the Laws of a General Council, not excluding that of</hi> Trent) <hi>he</hi> did <hi>actually communicate</hi> with none at all.</p>
               <p>10. When mens judgements are thus mistaken about Church Communion, their Worship of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64624:33"/>
God will be corrupted: They will in their hearts earnestly desiee that all others may be of their mind, and they will complain to God of that as a sin, which is mens duty: Especially among those of their own mind. And this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up of their mistakes to God, in earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as an acceptable service, is a sad polluting of holy things. So he that is famed to have written this Antidote, is said to have made my Book which was written for <hi>Christian Love,</hi> to be the matter of his <hi>publick Humiliation.</hi> And another of my friends, in dayes of prayer, maketh it his lamentation, [<hi>Lord, here are those that are one day here, and another day at Common-prayer:</hi>] As if the exercise of <hi>Knowledge and Love,</hi> in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Communion with all Christs Churches (not forcing us to sin) were a sin to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But I need not go further for instance, than this <hi>Antidote,</hi> where the Reverend Author taketh it for a service of God, to write against those <hi>necessary Precepts</hi> of <hi>Love and Unity,</hi> which he mistakingly opposeth. And so did Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> and Mr. <hi>Canne,</hi> who most confidently presented their Writings for separation, to God, as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which he had commanded them, and would own.</p>
               <p>11. This narrow judgement tempteth men on one side, to Anathematize all that say, There are any other true Churches in <hi>England,</hi> save of one form and fashion; and it tempteth others to deny the Parish Churches, to be at all true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and so to narrow the possessions of Christ. And hereupon it tempteth them to endeavour to disgrace and dissolve each other. It draweth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64624:33"/>
many to think, that it is the Interest of Religion now in <hi>England,</hi> to have the Parish Churches to be brought low in reputation and deserted, and Gods publick Worship, which they would have all Religious people use, to be only that of tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or more private Churches. By which they little know what they wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>nt Religion in this Land? Nor what hurt they would do, if in this they had their wills.</p>
               <p>12. These dividing Principles and Spirits which I oppose, will on one side give shelter to all the prophane malignant minds, that itch to be afflicting others, that fear God more than they: And on the other side, it will give shelter to all kind of Heresies and Sects; of which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience is too full a proof.</p>
               <p>13. Yea, before our eyes, the most pernicious Heresies, even those of Quakers, are still not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued, but increase. And we see men that to day condemn Communion with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Churches, and then with the Presbyterians; do shortly fly from Communion with the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents too. And mens passions in sufferings pervert their judgements; And frequently men are overcome by tryal, when they think they are most constant and have overcome. Its commonly known how many of late are turned Quakers; And what considerable persons lately in prison, fell to that unhappy Heresie. Yet they that by a Prison lost their Religion, no doubt thought themselves more honourable by their sufferings, than those that go to Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer. And shall we stand by and see this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64624:34"/>
work go on, and neither lament their sin, that <hi>drive</hi> men to this, nor warn them of the <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> that lead to it.</p>
               <p>14. Separation will ruine the separated Churches themselves at last, (By separation I mean the <hi>same thing that the old Non-conformists</hi> wrote against by that name) It will admit of no consistency. Parties will arise in the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Churches, and separate again from them, till they are dissolved. I beseech my deer brethren that are otherwise minded to open their eyes so far as to regard experience. Brethren, what now Comparatively are all the separated Churches or parties upon Earth? Would you have all Christs Churches, and all the interest of the Christian Religion to be as short lived, and to stand upon no more certain terms than they do? How few separated Churches do now exist, that were in being an hundred years ago? Can you name any? And would you have had all the Churches of Christ on Earth, to be dissolved, when <hi>they</hi> were dissolved? Or do you think that all <hi>were dissolved</hi> with <hi>them?</hi> This would make us all seekers indeed.</p>
               <p>15. Separating and narrow principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend not <hi>Godliness,</hi> as they pretend to do, but lamentably undermine it? If it were but by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving off and disaffecting the lower sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, whose Communion you reject. The Case of three or four Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> grieve my heart: But the Case of the <hi>Summer</hi> Islands as related to me by Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> a worthy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster lately discouraged and come from thence, would make a Christian heart to bleed; To
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64624:34"/>
hear how strict and regular and hopeful that plantation once was? And how <hi>one Godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi> by separation, selecting a few to be his Church, and rejecting all the rest from the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the <hi>rejected party</hi> are grown to doleful <hi>estrangedness from Religion,</hi> and the <hi>selected party</hi> much <hi>turned Quakers,</hi> and between both, how wofull are the fruits. But the Case of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (which I foretold in my book of Infant Baptisme) is yet a more lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table proof, what separation hath done against Religion, so <hi>full</hi> a proof, that it is my wonder that any good man can overlook it.</p>
               <p>16. Yea it tendeth to make <hi>Religiousness contemptible,</hi> and the professors of it, a common scorn, when we are perceived to place it in <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable separations,</hi> and <hi>singularities,</hi> and when we make men think that the greatest difference between those that they call <hi>Precise,</hi> or <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> is but this, that one of them prayeth <hi>without book,</hi> and the other by <hi>the book;</hi> that one of them will not joyn with those that use the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and the <hi>other will.</hi> If we let men see that in <hi>indifferent</hi> things we are <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> and that <hi>lesser</hi> evils we avoid <hi>as lesser,</hi> and <hi>greater</hi> evils, as <hi>greater,</hi> and that the great difference between us and the ungodly, is in our <hi>seriousness</hi> in our <hi>Christian profession,</hi> and in our <hi>heavenlyness,</hi> and <hi>true obedience</hi> to Christ, it would much convince them of their misery, and honour Religion in the world: But when they perceive that the greatest contention which our houses and our streets do ring of, is whether we shall hear a man that <hi>conformeth</hi> or <hi>not?</hi> Or whether we shall
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64624:35"/>
pray with them that use the <hi>Liturgie?</hi> Or whether we may sometimes <hi>Communicate</hi> with a <hi>Parish Church</hi> or not? This turneth the thoughts of the careless and carnal, the worldling and the sensualist, from the necessary condemning of himself for his ungodliness, and sets him on thinking, that these stricter people do differ from him in things of no importance, and that they are but an erroneous self conceited sort of persons, and that he is much the wiser man. Thousands in <hi>England</hi> are hardened into a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Godliness, to our suffering and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger of their own damnation, by occasion of the unwarrantable singularities, and the scandalous sins, especially of those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, that have been most addicted to sinful separations.</p>
               <p>17. I am not causelesly afraid lest, if we suffer the principles and practices which I write against, to proceed without our contradiction, Popery will get by it, so great advantage, as may hazzard us all, and we may lose that which the several parties do contend about. Three waies especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Popery will grow out of our divisions. 1. By the <hi>odium</hi> and scorn of our disagreements, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency, and multiplied sects; they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade people that we must either come for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to them, or else all run mad, and crumble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dust and individuals. Thousands have been drawn to Popery or confirmed in it by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument already: And I am perswaded that all the arguments else in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and all other books that ever were written, have not done so much to make Papists in <hi>England,</hi> as the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64624:35"/>
of sects among our selves. Yea some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Religious strictness, of great esteem for Godliness, have turned Papists themselves, when they were giddy and wearied with turnings; and when they had run from sect to sect, and found no consistency in any. For when they see so many, they say, How can I tell that this or that is in the right, rather than the other? This it is that they ring continually in our ears. <hi>Which of all these sects is in the right? And what assurance have they of it more than all the rest that are as confident? And how small a Church doth any one sect make? And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w late original</hi> (for the most.) But the poor deluded souls consider not, that in going to the Papists, they go but to <hi>another sect</hi> that is worse than any of the rest; And though <hi>greater,</hi> yet not past the third part of the Christians in the world: And that <hi>Christianity</hi> is but <hi>one:</hi> And that the way to rest, is to unite upon the common terms of <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Christianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And who knoweth not how fair a game the Papists have to play by the means of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions? Methinks I hear them hissing on each party, and saying to one side, <hi>Lay more upon them,</hi> and <hi>and abate them nothing?</hi> and to the other, <hi>stand it out and yield to nothing?</hi> And who is so blind then as not to see their double game and hopes. <hi>viz.</hi> that either our divisions and alienations, will carry men to such distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and practices, as shall make us accounted <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, rebellious,</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> to the publick peace, and so <hi>they</hi> may pass for <hi>better subjects</hi> than we; or else that when so many parties under suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64624:36"/>
are constrained to beg and wait for <hi>liberty,</hi> the Papists may not be shut out alone, but have <hi>Toleration</hi> with the rest. And shall they use <hi>our hands</hi> to do <hi>their works,</hi> and pull their freedom out of the fire? We have already unspeakably served them, both in this, and in abating the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of the Gun powder plot, and their other Treasons, Insurrections, and Spanish invasion (of which read <hi>Thuanus</hi> himself that openeth all the mystery.)</p>
               <p>3. And it is not the least of our danger (nor which doth least affect me) lest by our follies, extremities and rigors, we should so exasperate the Common people, as to make them readier to joyn with the Papists, than with us, in Case of any competitions, or their invasions, or insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections against the King, and Kingdoms peace. Sure I am that the Parliaments and peoples reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions against them, after the late fire, and in the time of the last war, when they were so much feared, did discourage and depress them more, than all the rest of their opposers. And though we cannot rationally believe that the people of <hi>England,</hi> much less wise and sober Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, will ever be such enemies to themselves, as to subject themselves to the Romish Tyranny, and to forget what <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> have seen and felt, yet because it is not only <hi>oppression that maketh wise men mad,</hi> let us do nothing by unlawful alienations and singularities, or fierce and disobedint oppositions, which tend to make the people like better of the Papists than of us.</p>
               <p>18. I am not able to bear the thoughts of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64624:36"/>
from almost all Christs Churches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth. But he that separateth from <hi>one</hi> or <hi>many</hi> upon a reason common to almost all, doth virtually separate from almost all. And he that separateth from all among us upon the account of the unlawfulness of our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all our Ministry, doth separate from them upon a reason common to almost all, or the far greatest part, as I conceive.</p>
               <p>19. Though <hi>Ministerial Conformity</hi> be <hi>to us,</hi> another thing (by reason of the new impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,) than it was to our predecessors yet to the <hi>people</hi> conformite is the same, if not easier (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to them that I now speak to:) For it is the Liturgie, Ceremonies and Ministry, that most alienate them (as I said before, and not so much the subscription against the obligation of the Covenant.) And the Liturgie is a little amended as to them, by the change of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, and some little words, and by some<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger prayers. And the Ceremonies are the same; and thirty years ago there was many bare Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not Preaching Ministers, for one that there is now: Therefore our case of separation being the same with what it was of old, I take it to be fully confuted by the antient Non-conformists. And I have so great a veneration for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy names (much more an estimation of the Reasonings) of Mr. <hi>Cartwright, Egerton, Hilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham, Dod, Amesius, Parker, Baines, Brightman, Ball, Bradshaw, Paget, Langley, Nichols, Hering,</hi> and many other such, that I shall not think they knew not why they chose this subject, and wrote more against separation than the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64624:37"/>
did. Nor do I think that the reasons of Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> and Mr. <hi>Canne,</hi> can stand before them. And it pittieth me to hear now many that differ from them say, <hi>we are grown wiser and have more light than they!</hi> when as our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings upon the same subjects shew that we are far in that below them? And in other parts of knowledge, al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, what are we to <hi>Reignolds, Ames, Parker</hi> and several of the rest? But the world knoweth, that the turn of the times put most of us into the sudden possession of our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, without one half of the study (it may be with most, not the hundredth part) which <hi>Cartwright, Ames, Parker,</hi> &amp;c. bestowed upon these points. And I never yet saw cause to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that our present Dividers, do learn more in a days study, than those learned holy men did in twenty. Nor do they shew more wisdom, or holiness in the main. I am very glad that the Pious Lectures of Mr. <hi>Hildersham,</hi> Mr. <hi>R. Rogers</hi> and such other old Non-conformists, are in so good esteem among good people, where they will read them urging the people not only against separation, but to come to the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the publick worship, and preferring it before their private duties.</p>
               <p>As for them that say, If <hi>Dod, Ames, Hilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham,</hi> &amp;c. had lived till now, they would have been of our mind. I desire them to prove it, or not affirm it? Is not the Liturgie, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and Ministery the same? And what signs of such mutability did they shew? Could your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have conquered them, more than Mr. <hi>Ainsworths, Iohnsons,</hi> or <hi>Cannes?</hi> They were
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64624:37"/>
not so Light, to be changed causelesly.</p>
               <p>And I pray you mark, that if <hi>you</hi> are wiser in this point of separation than all these old Non-conformists were, than <hi>Iohnson,</hi> and <hi>Canne,</hi> and <hi>Howe,</hi> were wiser also in that than they, which doth not appear to us by their writings: And then, for all the greater Light, that you think you have, yet <hi>Iohnson, Canne,</hi> and <hi>Howe,</hi> had as great Light, and were in this as wise as you, though <hi>Ames,</hi> and the rest of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists were not. O that our brethren would but seriously read over the writings of these men, especially <hi>Iacob, Paget, Ball,</hi> and <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> and <hi>Gifford</hi> against the separatists, and try whether the case was not the same.</p>
               <p>20. Yea I must confess, that when I think what Learned, Holy, Incomparable men, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the <hi>old Cenformits</hi> were, my heart ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth against the thoughts of separating from them! If I had come to their Churches, when they used the Common-prayer, and administred the Sacrament, could I have departed and said, It is not lawful for any Christian here to Communicate with you?

and lamentable hinderances from their sacred work, and called by God to fidelity as in a day of tryal, what guilt would be upon us, what shame would be our due, if we should all be silent whilest we see the principles of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion continually increase? The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> principles which the old Non-conformists confuted, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propagate themselves, through the smart which alienateth the peoples minds. And Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son doth so hardly prevail against <hi>Feeling,</hi> that all that we can say will prove too little. This is the true cause why they cry out now, [<hi>Oh the case is changed!

Therefore we had so easie a work comparatively to perswade men that the <hi>old separatists</hi> were mistaken, but can hardly now perswade them that the <hi>same principles</hi> are a mistake; because <hi>now they smart,</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> is not easily held in by reason. I can make shift to hold in a mettlesome horse, while he is not provoked; But if a Bishop will come behind me, and la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But sure if we must needs have to do with such men, it concerneth us to hold the reines the harder. And if after such grievous judgements, as plagues, flames, pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, reproach, and silencings, and sad confusions, which God hath tryed us with in these times, his Ministers should through passion, policie or sloth, sit still and let Professors run into sinful principles and extreams, it will be our Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:64624:40"/>25. And one reason why I set upon this work was, because I saw few others do it. If it <hi>must be done,</hi> and <hi>others will not,</hi> then I must take it for my duty.</p>
               <p>26. And another reason was, because I knew but few that I was <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>thrust</hi> upon it, so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly as <hi>my self,</hi> for fear of being the author of their <hi>sufferings.</hi> Many may be <hi>abler,</hi> that are not in other respects <hi>so fit.</hi> Some Ministers are young men. and like to live longer to serve God in his Church; and their Reputation is needful to their success: If they be vilified, it may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their labours. And experience telleth us, that the dividing spirit is very powerful and victorious in censorious vilifying of dissenters. But I am almost <hi>miles Emeritus</hi> at the end of my work, and can reasonably expect to do but little more in the world; and therefore have not their impediment: And for <hi>popular applause,</hi> I have tryed its vanity: I have had so much of it, till I am brought to a contempt if not a loathing of it. And whereas some brethren, say, that <hi>Censures will hinder the success of my Writings,</hi> I answer, No man shall do his duty without some difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and impediments. If my writings will not do good by the evidence of truth in them, and if the censures of Dividers are able to frustrate them, let them fall and fail. And some of my brethren have great Congregations to teach, which are so inclined to this dividing way, that they cannot bear their information. But when I preached in my house to the most, I knew scarce any of the Parish that came not to the Parish Church, but such as lived in my own
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64624:40"/>
house. Also many Ministers being turned out of all their maintenance, have families and nothing to maintain them, but what the Charity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious people giveth them. (Little do some know what the families of many godly Ministers suffer!) And some Independents are maintained by their gathered Churches, and if they cast them off, both reputation, work and maintenance would fail (For those that silence them will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honor them, nor maintain them). And though I suppose that these brethren would serve God in the greatest contempt and poverty, and self-denial, if they perceive that God doth call them to it, yet I think it a duty of Charity in me, to go before them, and do the more displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing work, to prevent the sufferings of such, or at least, not to thrust them on so hard a service. For I have no Church that maintaineth me, nor any people whose estimation I am afraid to lose, that are dividingly inclined, nor (through Gods mercy) have any need of maintenance from others, and therefore may do my duty at chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rates than they.</p>
               <p>27. And I will add one reason more of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing, though not of the writing of my book. When it had been long cast by, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dious, as men of erroneous, uncharitable, and ungover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable principles and spirits (Though we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to all the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) And I thought that the publication of this book, should leave a testimony to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to come, by which they might know
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64624:41"/>
whether we were truly accused, and whether our principles were not as much for Love and Peace as theirs, and as consistent with order and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>Is not the Non-conformists doctrine the same with that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when they subcribe to it, or offer so to do? Did not his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in his Declaration about Ecclesiastical affairs, complain of them (Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> I suppose) who pretended a difference between us in doctrine? If they say that the Non-conformists are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from the Major part, I answer, we provoke the willingest of their adversaries to prove, that either the Major part, or any thing near it, is of more erroneous doctrinal principles than themselves? The Independents as well as the Presbyterians offer to subscribe to the doctrine of the 39. Articles, as distinct from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy and Ceremony. And I must witness that when I was in the Country, I knew not of one Minister of ten that are now silenced, that was not in the main (as far as I could discern) of the same principles with my self. And though any Reproacher will blindly injure the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists, who shall judge of them throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> by the many parties in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where a great number of differing opinions alwaies inhabited; Yet I may add that even in <hi>London,</hi> the burning of the Churches, and the notorious necessity of many thousand souls, and the Acts which punish them by six moneths im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, if they come within five miles of a Corporation, (and therefore make them think it necessary to keep out of the Parish Churches,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64624:41"/>
where they <hi>may</hi> presently be both accused and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended) doth make the Practice of many very humble, godly, peaceable, and moderate men (by Preaching at the time of publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, when their hearers cannot well come at another time) to be such as causeth men to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake their principles.</p>
               <p>But Satan maligning the <hi>just vindication</hi> of the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> against these accusations, hath by false suggestions stirred up some, who differ from the rest as well as we, to clamour against this Book, which was published for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the innocent: And now they have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed it, they have renounced <hi>their own part</hi> in those peaceable Principles which they disown, and in <hi>this Vindication;</hi> But I must desire the next Accuser, to charge this Renunciation upon none but those that he can prove to be guilty of it, and not on the <hi>Non-conformists.</hi> And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because <hi>(by a self confutation)</hi> they have shewed themselves, that the <hi>old Non-conformists</hi> were more sober and peaceable; And I can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them, that the most of the Non-conformists Ministers of my acquaintance, are not a jot more rigorous or farther from them, than the <hi>old Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi> were. And that those that treated with the Bishops in 1660. did yield to such an Episcopacy, as the <hi>old Non-conformists</hi> would scarcely have generally consented to (viz. Bishop <hi>Ushers</hi> model in his Reduction.)</p>
               <p>If the Accusers of the Non-conformists shall say, [<hi>By the censure of your Book and Person you see what Non-conformists are, that will joyn in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi>

                  <hi>and venting false reports, even of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, before they saw or heard one line of the book,</hi>] I Answer to such: 1. Call not that the act of the Non-conformists, which some of <hi>one party</hi> of them are drawn to by misinformation. 2. There were so <hi>great persons</hi> and so <hi>many</hi> of the <hi>Conformists</hi> concurred in the report, that you may well be silent as to <hi>Parties,</hi> and say that <hi>Iliacos intra muros,</hi> &amp;c. We are all to blame. 3. It cannot be denyed, that among all parties in <hi>England,</hi> there are so many that take up false reports, and think it no sin if they did but hear it from <hi>credible persons,</hi> and hereby are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans instruments to vend false defamations, that it is become the shame and crime of the land; and many strict Professors (excepting the graver and soberer sort) are too commonly guilty of it, though not so much as others. I will not deny but humane converse requireth some credulity: But if men medled not with other mens matters without a call, and withall did Love their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as themselves, and were as tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced as they ought to be, and knew how little before God it will excuse a Lie or Slander to say, [I heard it of such an honest man, or I said but what I heard of many,] it would prevent a great deal of sin.</p>
               <p>And that it may appear I am impartial, and defend not those faults in the Religious sort, which they must repent of, I will intreat you to note from this one instance, these following obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous observations.</p>
               <p>1. Note by this instance what an <hi>inequality</hi>

                     </gap>ness of mens Consciences</hi> towards meer <hi>words</hi> and <hi>formes</hi> of worship, and towards the sins which nature it self condemneth, if they study not well the wiles of Satan; when the City and Country shall have the same men that are tender Conscienced (which I commend) about a Ceremony or the <hi>fashion</hi> of their prayers, without any scruple or remorse thus receive and publish a slander or falshood, (that I <hi>wrote against private meetings,</hi> and <hi>for Conformity,</hi> and that <hi>I Conformed</hi>) and this before they had <hi>ever seen</hi> or <hi>spoken</hi> with one man living that had seen one line of the book, or could report it to them with the least pretense of knowledge. Yea and all this against one that had given an <hi>opener testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> against Conformity, <hi>than any one man</hi> of all them that thus slandered him, as far as ever I was able to know.</p>
               <p>2. Note here what I have told you in the book, the great difference between a <hi>formal</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding zeal for opinions, and a Christian zeal of Love and Heavenliness and good workes. If you would kindle this latter in your own or others hearts, alas, what holy labour doth it require? How many lively Sermons are all too little to kindle the least flame of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, heavenly fruitful zeal! How many meditations and prayers are used before any holy flame appeareth? But a zeal for our <hi>Party</hi> and our <hi>opinions,</hi> and our several <hi>formes</hi> and <hi>fashions</hi> of speaking to God, will kindle and flame like the fire that consumed London. A sparke from one discontented persons mouth will suddenly take,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64624:43"/>
and engage multitudes in City and Country in the affectionate spreading of untruths; and who can quench it till it go out of it self for want of fewel?</p>
               <p>3. Note also the great Partiality of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Religious people, and how easily we can aggravate the faults of <hi>others,</hi> and how hardly we can either <hi>aggravate</hi> or <hi>see our own!</hi> The defects of the Liturgie, and the faults of those by whom we <hi>suffer,</hi> are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily heightned, even beyond desert. But when many of us vend untruths, and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders against our brethren about the land, who aggravateth this or repenteth of it?</p>
               <p>4. But above all I intreate the Dividing Brethren, if they can so long lay by their partiality, to judge by this of the <hi>Reasons</hi> of their <hi>Separation</hi> from those Churches (Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or Parochial) that they differ from, in tolerable things. You <hi>think</hi> it a sin to Communicate in a Church where the <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> is used, and <hi>Discipline</hi> is not so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercised against some offenders, as you and I desire.

I intreat you do but study an answer to one that would <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from you all,</hi> upon such grounds as these.

               <p>Have you more and plainer texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture agninst the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> than all these are? Now suppose one should say that a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of such sin as this should not be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with, especially where there is no discipline exercised that ever so much as cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth one man of them to repentance for it: what answer will you give to this, which will not confute your own objections, against Communion with many Parish Churches in this Land.</p>
               <p>5. Lastly hence note, how still <hi>overdoing</hi> is <hi>undoing.</hi> By the Principles of Love and Peace conteined in the book which some reproach, had they not disowned them, they might

                  <hi>CAP. 2.</hi> The true state as the Controversie, between me, and those whom I call Church-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viders.</head>
               <p>BEcause the Excepter carrieth it all along, as if he understood not what I say, or would not have his Reader understand it, I must state the Case as it standeth between us, for the sake of them that love not to be deceived, nor to be angry at they know not what.</p>
               <p>Know therefore that the <hi>design</hi> of the Writer of that Book was, to <hi>restore Love</hi> and <hi>Unity among Christians,</hi> which he saw decaying and almost dying through the temptation of <hi>our sufferings from some,</hi> and <hi>our differences with others,</hi> and through the sidings of <hi>parties,</hi> and through the <hi>passions</hi> which conquer some mens judgements, and the hy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64624:45"/>
Pride, and Wrath, and Selfishness, against the works of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> And to shew them the great deceitfulness of mans heart, which often fighteth against God as for God, by fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against Love and Unity; and which oft loseth all, by seeming to overcome, and forsaketh Religion by seeming valiant for it;) And I especially intreat the Reader to note, that I said much more about <hi>Principles,</hi> than <hi>Practices;</hi> Because I know that as to Communion with this or that Church, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns practices may vary upon accidental and prudential accounts, of which I pretend not to be a Judge: And therefore I first speak against Love killing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and then against such Practices only, as either proceed from such Principles, or increase them. If I see a man stay from Church, as I know not his reasons, so I judge him not; unless as he doth it upon sinful causes, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he would propagate those Causes to others, and justifie them to be of God, when they are against him.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>Hatred and Enmity</hi> worketh by driving men from each others Societies, as <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> or <hi>intolerable,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> worketh by inclining men to <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Communion;</hi> and again, mens <hi>distance</hi> increaseth the <hi>Enmity</hi> which caused it; and their <hi>nearness</hi> and <hi>familiarity</hi> increaseth <hi>Love,</hi> and reconcileth them; I did therefore think it a matter of great necessity to our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, to counsel men to all <hi>lawful nearness</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> and to disswade them from all <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary alienation</hi> and <hi>separation</hi> from each other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:64624:46"/>Let the Reader also understand, that in this, my purpose was not to condemn mens separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the <hi>Parish Churches only,</hi> nor <hi>more</hi> than <hi>any other sinful separation:</hi> But from <hi>any true Church</hi> of Christians whatsoever; when uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Principles drive them away, Whether it be from Presbyterians, Independents, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, Arminians, Lutherans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Only because that those I deal most with, make most excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against Communion with the <hi>Parish Churches,</hi> I bestowed <hi>most words</hi> in answering such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
               <p>Therefore observe 1. That it is none of our Question, [<hi>Whether you should Communicate with the Parish Churches alone, and no other?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Nor [<hi>Whether you should Communicate with every Parish Church, or any one whose Pastors are through insufficiency, heresie or impiety intolerable?</hi> which I have written against <hi>Dir.</hi> 36. <hi>p.</hi> 202, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Nor [<hi>Whether we may hold local Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Worship with a Church which denyeth us such Communion, unless we will sin:</hi> This I have oft enough denyed, <hi>p.</hi> 203, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Nor [<hi>Whether</hi> caeteris paribus <hi>local Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a purer and better Church, be not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to be preferred before local Communion with a worse?</hi> (which I assert, p. 203, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
               <p>5. Nor [<hi>Whether a man be a Separatist from another Church, meerly because he is not locally present with it?</hi> (For then when I am in one Church, I separate from all other in the world?)</p>
               <p>6. Nor [<hi>Whether it be lawful to remove ones</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:64624:46"/>
                  <hi>dwelling, for Communion with a better Minister and Church, supposing that we are free?</hi> p. 204.</p>
               <p>7. Nor [<hi>Whether it be lawful to remove to a better Church, without removing ones dwelling, in a place where another Church is near, to which we may go without any publick injury, or hurt to our selves or others, which is greater than the benefit,</hi> pag. 204.</p>
               <p>8. Nor [<hi>Whether we may remove both from Church and Countrey, by the occasions of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings or Trades, or other outward weighty reasons?</hi> pag. 298.</p>
               <p>9. Nor [<hi>Whether we may keep in Communion privately with our lawful Pastors, if they be turned out of the publick Temples?</hi>] Which I have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, <hi>pag.</hi> 299. and have said, that <hi>where the Pastor is, there the Church is, in whatever place they do assemble,</hi> p. 250. (which Dr. <hi>Hide</hi> also thought, when he began his Book with an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of the necessity of separating then from the publick places. And so did other Prelatists then, and so think the Papists now, and most other parties.)</p>
               <p>10. Nor is it any of our Question, [<hi>Whether you should have Communion with a Diocesan Church, as such;</hi> (It is a Parochial Church with such others that I spake of, and never a word of a Diocesan Church.)</p>
               <p>11. Therefore it is none of the Question [<hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you must own our Diocesan Bishops?</hi>]</p>
               <p>12. Nor yet [<hi>Whether you must have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with any thing called, A National Church, as a Political Society constituted of an Ecclesiastical</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:64624:47"/>

                     </gap>r Constitutive Head?</hi> Though we must own a <hi>National Church,</hi> as it is <hi>improperly</hi> so denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, from the <hi>King</hi> that is the <hi>Civil Head (accidental,</hi> and not <hi>Constitutive</hi> to the Spiritual Church.) And as it is a <hi>Community of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and a <hi>part of the Universal Church,</hi> united by the <hi>Concord</hi> of her Pastors; who in Synods may <hi>represent the whole Ministry,</hi> and be the means of their <hi>agreement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. Nor is it the Question, [<hi>Whether you must needs hold Communion with those individual Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, whom you account the Persecutors, and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of our silence and confusions.</hi> I have told you in the Story of <hi>Martin,</hi> how he separated from the <hi>Synods</hi> of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AS to that party who think Anabaptists and Independents unfit for their communion, I am not now dealing with them; and therefore am not to answer their Objections. Only on the by I shall here mind them; 1. That it is not such as the old <hi>German</hi> Anabaptists, who denyed Magistracy to Christians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that I speak of; But such as only deny Infant Baptism: And that many of them, are truly Godly sober men; and therefore capable of communion. And that the ancient Churches left it to men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> liberty at what time they would have their Children baptized.</p>
               <p>2. That many Independents are downright against Separation; Mr. <hi>Iacob</hi> hath notably writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against it. Therefore those that are but <hi>meer Independents,</hi> refuse not communion with the Parish Churches: And why should <hi>you</hi> refuse communion with <hi>them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That many that separate, <hi>secundum quid,</hi> or
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64624:49"/>
                  <hi>pro tempore,</hi> from some part of Worship only and for a season, yet separate not <hi>simply</hi> from the Churches as <hi>no Churches,</hi> nor would do all as they do, in othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> circumstances. For instance, when they come not to the publick Assemblies, yet they will not <hi>refuse you,</hi> if you will come to <hi>theirs.</hi> Go to <hi>their meetings,</hi> and see if they so far separate, as to forbid you? Nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to their <hi>Sacraments,</hi> if you will submit to <hi>their way,</hi> as you expect they should do <hi>by yours.</hi> Now seeing we are all agreed, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate doth not make Ministers, Churches (or Sacraments,) but only encourage, protect and rule them, I desire you but to be so impartial as to consider that 1. You count not your selves <hi>Separatists,</hi> because you never go to one of <hi>their Meetings</hi> in <hi>their houses</hi> or other places; Why then should you call <hi>them Separatists,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for not coming to <hi>yours?</hi> 2. But if they are guilty of Separation for holding either that <hi>your Churches and Ministry are Null,</hi> or that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with you is unlawful by Gods Law, enquire how far <hi>you also</hi> are Separatists, if you say the same without proof by any others, (Though their lawfulness by the Law of the Land, I justifie not, no nor the regularity of their Church Assemblies.)</p>
               <p>4. And I would here note how <hi>partial</hi> most men are. They that think an <hi>Independent</hi> or <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> yea, or a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> intolerable at home in their <hi>several Churches,</hi> yet if they would but come to <hi>their communion,</hi> they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them as tolerable members. And they that think it unlawful to hold communion with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64624:50"/>
the <hi>Prelatists,</hi> and give the reason partly from their <hi>unfitness,</hi> yet would receive them (in many Churches) if they did but change their Opinions, and desire communion with them in their way.</p>
               <p>But it is those that judge Parish communion (where there are godly Ministers) unlawful, that I am here to speak to. And their principal doubts are such as many good and sober persons need an answer to.</p>

                  <p>But they that say, that <hi>all false Worship</hi> of the <hi>true God</hi> is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> add to Gods word, and teach doctrines which are but the forgeries of their own brain.

                  <p>2.

Our disorders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, tautologies, unfit expressions, are all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and so false worship: And if God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit any disorder which is in the Liturgie, he prohibits the same in <hi>extemporate prayers</hi> (in which some good Christians are as failing as the Liturgie) And as the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> are not commanded in the Scripture, so neither are the <hi>words</hi> of our <hi>extemporate or studied Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> or <hi>Prayers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:64624:51"/>3. God hateth every sin in every prayer; but he hateth the <hi>avoiding of prayer,</hi> and of <hi>due communion</hi> much more. He hateth every dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in <hi>extemporate</hi> prayer; And yet he more hateth that Censoriousness and Curiosity, which would draw men to forsake the substantials of Worship, or Christian Love and Communion on that pretence.</p>
                  <p>Gods Jealousie in his Worship is most about the heart, and next about the substantials of his own institutions, and of Natural Worship, and least about the phrase of Speech and order, while it is not such, as is grosly dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Nature of God, and to the greater things. And though God under the Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed his jealousie much about Ceremonies, yet that was not for the Ceremonies sake, but to controll gross irreverence and contempt of holy things (as in the Case of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> the <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shemites, Uzziah, Aarons</hi> Sons) and to keep up an esteem of the Holiness of God, and to restrain sacrilegious presumption. And under the Gospel, it is neither <hi>this place</hi> of Worship, nor that, neither this Mountain, nor <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> that God most looks at. It is not whether you pray by a Book, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, by words fore-studied or not, by words of your own contriving, or of anothers, that God is now jealous of. For even when you want words, he accepteth the groans excited by his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>If Christians should plead Gods jealousie about his Worship; as Censoriously against thelr <hi>own prayers,</hi> as they do against <hi>other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64624:51"/>
Churches in this case, they would turn prayer into the fuel of despair and torment. For God is so jealous of his Worship, that he hateth all the sinful dulness, emptiness, wandrings, vain repetitions, confusions, unseemly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, of all your secret prayers, and all your family prayers. And yet I would advise you neither to think that God therefore hateth you, or the prayer it self, nor yet to fly from God and prayer, nor family Worship, where it is no better done, Gods jealousie, especially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, is to be minded for to drive us from our sloth and carelesness, to do the best we can, but not to drive us <hi>from him,</hi> or <hi>from prayer,</hi> or <hi>from one another.</hi> These are <hi>Satans ends</hi> of minding men of <hi>Gods jealousie,</hi> as he doth troubled souls to drive them to despair.</p>
                  <p>And others may scruple joining with <hi>your weaknesses</hi> and <hi>faults</hi> in Worship on pretence of Gods jealousie, as well as <hi>you</hi> with <hi>theirs.</hi> What if twenty Ministers be one abler than another, in their several degrees (and the lowest of them doth weaklier than the Liturgick forms.) Doth it follow, that only the ablest of all these may be joyned with, because that all the rest do worse? It is granted that we must offer God the <hi>best,</hi> that we <hi>have</hi> or <hi>can do.</hi> But not the best which we <hi>cannot do?</hi> And many things must concurr (and especially a respect to the publick good) to know which is the best.</p>

                  <p>3. The judgement of Protestants is, that Vowes must not make us new duties of Religion but bind us faster by a self obligation, to that which God binds us to without them. Therefore (though if we should Vow an indifferent thing, it would bind, yet) this could not be taken for the <hi>Covenanters intention.</hi>

                  <p>6. The Covenant or Vow expresly bindeth us against <hi>schisme.</hi> But the renunciation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which I now dispute against, is plaine schisme; Therefore we are bound against it by that Vow.</p>
                  <p>7. The Covenant bindeth us against all that is contrary to the power of Godliness, and found doctrine. But the separating which I plead against is certainly such.</p>
                  <p>8. The Covenant bindeth us to Unity and the nearest Uniformity we can attain. But as the world goeth now, this Communion is the nearest, and needful to express our Unity.</p>
                  <p>9. The Covenant bindeth us to Reformation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods word, and the example of the best reformed Churches: But to prefer <hi>no publick</hi>

And all the Reformed Churches in Christendom, do commonly profess to hold Communion with the English Churches in the Liturgie, if they come among us where it is used. Therefore it seemeth to me to be perjury and Covenant-breaking, either to prefer <hi>no publick worship</hi> before the Liturgie, or to refuse occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion with the Churches that use the Liturgie, as a thing meerly on that account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>

                     <hi>Quest. 3.</hi> WHether the Case be not much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered since the old Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists wrote against separation, then called Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme? And whether we have not greater Light into these Controversies than they?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Case of <hi>Ministers Conformity</hi> is much altered, by a new Act which requireth subscribing new things, Declaring Assent and Consent to all things prescribed and conteined in and by three books; and by some other things. But that part of the Liturgie which the people are to joyn in is made better, as is shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And if we are returned to the <hi>same state</hi> that they were then in, we are under the <hi>same duties</hi> that they were under. And let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64624:53"/>
that we never Vowed that God should not bring us back to the same case (which had been blasphemy) And therefore it had been bad enough, if we had vowed not to do what was <hi>our duty in that state,</hi> if God should return us to it.</p>
                  <p>2. I earnestly intreat the doubting Reader, that thinketh his duty and the Churches peace, to be worth so much labour, but to read over some of the old Non-conformists books against separation. And if you there find the very same objections answered (or more and greater) than judge your selves whether their case and ours was (as to this cause) the same. The books I would desire you to read are, Mr. <hi>Iacobs</hi> the Independent against <hi>Iohnson;</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradshaws</hi> against <hi>Iohnson,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> defence of it against <hi>Canne:</hi> Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Darrel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hildersham,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> and last of all and fulliest at the beginning of our troubles, Mr. <hi>Iohn Ball</hi> in three books.</p>
                  <p>But of this having spoken already, I shall repeat no more; but only to profess my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that our ordinary boasters that think they know more in this Controversie than the old Non-conformists did, as far as I am able to discern are as far below them almost, as they are below either <hi>Chamier, Sadeel, Whitaker</hi> or such others in dealing with a Papist. which of <hi>them</hi> can <hi>say that,</hi> about Episcopacy, as <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, Bucer, Didoclaue, Blondell, Salmasius</hi> have done? and so of the rest.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest. 4.</hi> IS it not a shameful receding from our Reformation, now to use an unreformed Liturgie, and a pulling down of what we have been building.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is not fit here to enquire who it is that hath pulled down, and destroyed Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: though it be easie to discern it. But this is certain, that God hath set up the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that is over us, and that our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours take down by their Laws, that which we accounted Reformation: This is not <hi>our</hi> worke, but <hi>theirs:</hi> And that they permit us not otherwise publickly to worship God. And that a man in Goal doth ordinarily joyn in no publick worship at all. And where men do venture on other manner of worship in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden assemblies, the fears of some and the passionate discontent of others, and the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances by souldiers and officers, and such like, do take off much of the edification, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from such a frame of mind as is most agreeable to the work and day. And to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God <hi>no where,</hi> is to go farther from Reformation, than to worship him by the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. To do it <hi>of choice</hi> is one thing, and to do it as a duty <hi>put upon us</hi> by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and our Governours, when we can do no better, is another thing. It is God
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64624:54"/>
that hath <hi>pulled down</hi> our liberty and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to serve him otherwise: and we must obey him. It is no faulty mutability, to change our <hi>practice,</hi> when God by changing our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doth change our <hi>duty:</hi> No more than it was in <hi>Paul</hi> who to the Jews became a Jew, and circumcised <hi>Timothy,</hi> and shaved his head for his Vow &amp;c. and became all things to all men: And no more than it was in <hi>Augustine</hi> who professeth that he would worship God, as to formes and ceremonies, according as the Church did with which he joyned where ever he came: Nor no more than it is in a traveller or merchant to joyn, in several Countries, in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fashions and ceremonies or rites of outward worship.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We must not make such carnal policies our guides, as to forbear that which God doth make our duty, for fear of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging other men. If we take this to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable factiousness in others, to desire ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all these distractions in the Church, than that the Non-conformists should be encouraged and strengthned by seeming to have justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired a Reformation, let us not be guilty of what we blame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:64624:55"/>2. If you will believe themselves, it is the <hi>unwilling Conformists</hi> that they are most in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of, who profess that they conform of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and desire a Reformation; As Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Smith</hi> hath shewed in a book written to that end. The Assembly of <hi>Westminster</hi> that set up the Presbytery were such Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.</p>
                  <p>3. It is sinful pride and tenderness of their own honour, which maketh some men avoid their duty, and wrathfully grudge at them that speak for it, because those that are against them thence take occasion to insult over them or reproach them. If men do but say, <hi>you are now turncòats</hi> and <hi>time servers,</hi> and <hi>where is your reformation now, and you are now glad to do as we do,</hi> they think this reason enough why they should forbear that Communion and worship which is their duty. Are these beseeming self denying humble persons? Could they suffer <hi>death</hi> for their duty sake, that cannot bear a little <hi>reproach</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If we knew it were our duty we would suffer for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> But is it not this very suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and reproach, and insulting of others, which maketh you <hi>think</hi> that it is <hi>not your duty?</hi> And so carnal persons use to do. They will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing to be their duty which they must suffer by. Let Gods honour be all to you, and your own be nothing, and you will not much stick at such things as these.</p>

                     <hi>Quest. 6.</hi> BUT will not this course divide us among our selves; while one goeth to the Parish Churches and another doth not?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> did not stick at divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Anabaptists when he wrote for Parish Communion. And Mr. <hi>Philip Nye</hi> did not stick at the fear of dividing the Independents, when he wrote a <hi>M. S.</hi> (as I am credibly informed) for the hearing of the Parish Preachers, (though another wrote against it presently after). And if an ordinary attendance on their publick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be lawful, this will go further than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think, to prove the rest of the Communion lawful.</p>
                  <p>2. We are already so far divided in <hi>our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> as for one to hold it to be lawful, and another to be unlawful: And who can cure this division? And why should it divide us <hi>more,</hi> if mens practice be according to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, rather than for them to sin against their Consciences?</p>
                  <p>3. The great thing in which we differ from the Prelatists yea and Papists too is, that we would have our Union laid only upon <hi>Necessary things,</hi> and liberty and <hi>Charity</hi> maintained in the rest. And shall we now contradict our selves, and say that <hi>things necessary</hi> are not sufficient for our union? Cannot we hold union among our selves, if some go to the publick assemblies, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64624:56"/>
some do not? What is this but to have the imposing domineering Spirit, which we speak so much against? We cannot better confute the uncharitable dividing Spirit of the world, than by shewing them, that we can hold <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> notwithstanding as great differences as this, (yea, and much greater.)</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Without medling now with the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, what guilt it is that lyeth on any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in the points here mentioned, I answer, on your own supposition; 1. That it is the King and his Laws which we obey herein, and not the Diocesans.</p>
                  <p>2. How openly and fully have we declared our utter dissent from the things which you suppose that we shall countenance them in? Our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are yet visible: Our Conferences were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious. And is not the loss of our Ministry, and the loss of all Ecclesiastical Maintenance, and the pinching wants of many poor Ministers, and their numerous families, and our suffering Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of reproach, confinements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our dissent? The case is somewhat hard with abundance of godly faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters? Few that never felt it themselves, can
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64624:56"/>
judge aright, what it is to want a house to dwell in, a bed to lye on, to have Wives that are weak natured, to keep in yearly patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all such necessities, which the Husband can bear himself; to have Children crying in hunger and rags, and to have a Landlord calling for his Rent, and Butchers, and Brewers, and Bakers, and Drapers, and Taylors, and Shoo-makers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for money, when there is none to pay them (there being no <hi>fifth part</hi> of Church-maintenance now allowed them): in the Frost and Snow to have no fire, nor money to but it! And yet all this is little in comparison of their restraint from preaching the Gospel of Salvation; and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of their Governours against them if they preach. And is not all this yet an open signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Dissent from the things which they so far deny complyance with? If some of their Accusers on both sides were but in the same condition, they would think it should go for a sufficient notification of dissent.</p>
                  <p>3. We perswade no man to any one sin, for Communion with others, no not to save their lives. If the thing be proved unlawful to be used (and not only unlawful to be so imposed) we exhort all to avoid it.</p>
                  <p>4. Yea, if an over numerous aggregation of things which singly are lawful, should make them become a snare and injury to the Church; we would have all in their places sufficiently signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their dissent; or if the number shall turn them into a sin in the users, we would have none to use them.

We would have all men to bear a just testimony to the truth, and to their Christian liberty.</p>
                  <p>5. But if the defects of publick Worship be tolerable, and if Providence, necessity and Laws, concurr to call us to use them, (when else we must use none, or do worse) here Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion doth become our duty: And a <hi>Duty</hi> must not be cast off, for fear of seeming to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the faults of others. We have <hi>lawful</hi> means to signifie our <hi>dissent:</hi> It is not in <hi>our power</hi> to express it how <hi>we please,</hi> nor to go as far from the faulty as <hi>we can,</hi> to avoid the countenancing of their faults: But we must do Gods work in his own way: And we must disown mens sins only by prudent lawful means, and not by any that are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Christian Love and Peace, or a breach of any Law of God.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Paul</hi> was not for countenancing any of the falsehoods and faults which he reproveth in any of the Churches, especially partiality, sensuality, drunkenness at the very Sacrament or Love Feasts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bids them forsake the communion of the Church for it, till they shall reform. There were other wayes of testifying dislike.</p>
                  <p>7. I must not countenance an honest weak Minister or Master of a family, in the disorder
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64624:57"/>
or defects, or errors of his prayer or instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; And yet if they be <hi>tolerable</hi> errors or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, I must not forsake either Church or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Worship with him, that I may discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance him.</p>
                  <p>8. There be <hi>Errors</hi> on the <hi>contrary</hi> side, which are not without considerable danger; which we are obliged also to take heed of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing. I will instance but in two; one in Doctrine, and the other in Practice.</p>
                  <p>1. There are men otherwise very honest, and truly godly, and of holy and unblameable lives, who think that the Scripture is intended by God, not only as a <hi>General, but a particular Law or Rule, for all the very Circumstances of Worship,</hi> (yea, some say of the <hi>common business of our lives</hi>)<hi>: and that the second Commandment in particular condemneth all that is the product or invention of man in or about the Worship of God; and that to deny this is to deny the perfection of the Scripture; and that all written Books, and Printed, are Images there forbidden; and that all studied or prepared Sermons, (as to Method or Words, whether in Notes or memory) are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Images of Preaching, and that all provided Words or Forms (written, or in memory, of our own or other mens Contrivance or Composition) are forbidden Images of Prayer; and all prepared Metre and Tunes are forbidden Images of Praise or singing; and that no man that useth any such preparation or form of words in preaching or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, doth preach or pray by the help of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and that if Parents do but teach a Child a</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:64624:58"/>
                     <hi>form of words to pray in, they teach him this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Imagery, yea, Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope the number is but small that are of this Opinion, and that it being commonly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned by the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> no justice or Modesty can charge it on them, but only on the <hi>few persons</hi> that are guilty of it. But yet I must say, that we are obliged to take heed of Countenancing this Error, as well as of Countenancing Church-Usurpations.</p>
                  <p>For 1. When a few men of eminent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity are of this mind, it proveth to us that <hi>many more may</hi> be brought to it, and are in danger of it; Because meer Piety and Honesty is not enough to keep men from it: Yea, when men otherwise <hi>eminent</hi> also for <hi>Learning</hi> and great understanding are of that mind (as they are) poor, ignorant, unlearned persons, though very godly, are not out of the danger of it.</p>
                  <p>2. And if it prevail, what abundance of hurt will it do?</p>
                  <p>1. You may read in the new Ecclesiastical Politician, how it will exasperate the minds of others, and give them matter of bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and for the sake of a very few, how many that are blameless shall be aspersed with it? and the cause of the Non-conformists, yea, with many, the Protestant, yea, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, rendred contemptible and odious by it.</p>
                  <p>2. It draweth men into the dangerous guilt of Adding to the Word of God, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64624:58"/>
of strict expounding it, and defending its perfection and extent.</p>
                  <p>3. By the same Rule as they deal thus by one Text (as the second Command) they may do so by all: And if all or much of the Scripture were but thus expounded, I leave it to the sober Reader to consider, what a body of Divinity it would make us, and what a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion we should have?</p>
                  <p>4. It altereth the very Definition of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, and maketh it another thing: That which God made to be the Record of his holy Covenant, and the Law and Rule of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> and the General Law for outward Modes and Circumstances, which are but Accidents of Worship, is pretended by men to be a particular Law, for that which it never particularly medleth with.</p>
                  <p>5. It sorely prepareth men for <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and to deny the Divine Authority of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and utterly to undo all by overdoing. If Satan could but once make men believe, that the Scripture is a Rule for those things that are not to be found in it at all, and which God never made it to be a Rule for, he will next argue against it, as a delusory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect thing. He will teach every Artificer, to say, That which is an imperfect Rule, is not of God. But the Scripture is an imperfect Rule. For saith, the Watch-maker, I cannot learn to make a Watch by it; saith the Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I cannot make a Legal Bond or Indentures by it; saith the Carpenter, I cannot build a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64624:59"/>
House by it; saith the Physician, I cannot suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently know or cure Diseases by it; saith the Mathematician, Astronomer, Geographer, Musician, Arithmetician, the Grammarian, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, Natural Philosopher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect particular Rule of our Arts or Sciences: The Divine will say, It tells me not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly what Books in it self are Canonical, nor what various Readings are the right, nor whether every Text be brought to us uncorrupted, nor whether it be to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Chapters and Verses, and into how many: Nor what Metre or Tune I must sing a Psalm in, nor what persons shall be Pastors of the Churches, nor what Text I shall choose next, nor what Words I shall use in my next Sermon or Prayer, with abundance such like: Only in <hi>General,</hi> both <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> say, <hi>Let all things be done in Order and to Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi> Spiritually, Purely, Believingly, Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Zealously, Constantly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that believeth it to be given as such a <hi>particular Rule,</hi> and then findeth that it is silent or utterly insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to that use, is like next to cast it away as a delusion, and turn an Infidel, or Anti-scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturist.</p>
                  <p>6. This mistake tendeth to cast all Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worship out of the Church and World; by deterring men from <hi>inventing</hi> or <hi>studying</hi> how to do Gods work aright. For if all that man <hi>inventeth</hi> or <hi>deviseth</hi> be a forbidden Image, than we must not invent or find out by study, the true meaning of a Text, the true method
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64624:59"/>
of Praying or Preaching, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious subjects: Nay, we must not study what to say, till we are speaking, nor what Time, Place, Gesture, Words to use; no nor the very <hi>English</hi> Tongue that we must Pray and Preach in, Whereas the Scripture it self-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth us, <hi>to meditate day and night, to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to shew our selves workmen that need not be ashamed: to search and dig for knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good:</hi> Prov. 14. 22. <hi>I Wisdom dwell, with Prudence (or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty) and find out knowledge of witty inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Prov. 8. 12. <hi>The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words,</hi> Eccles. 12. 10. Banish study, and you banish knowledge and Religion from the world: The <hi>Spirit moveth</hi> us to <hi>search</hi> and <hi>study,</hi> and thereby teacheth us what to judge, and say, and do; and doth not move us, as I play on an Instrument, that knoweth not what it doth.</p>
                  <p>7. This Opinion will bring in all Confusion instead of pure reasonable Worship: While eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is left to find that in the Scripture which never was there, and that as the only Rule of his actions, one will think that he findeth one thing there, and another another thing. For it must be <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Verity,</hi> which must be the term of <hi>Unity:</hi> Men cannot agree in that which is not.</p>
                  <p>8. Yea, it will let in impiety and error; for when men are sent to seek and find that which is not there, every man will think that he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64624:60"/>
that, which his own corrupted mind brings thither.</p>
                  <p>9. And hereby all possibility of Union among Christians and Churches must perish, till this Opinion perish: For if we must unite only in that which is not in being, we must not unite at all. If we must all in singing Psalms, agree in no <hi>Metre</hi> or <hi>Tune</hi> in the Church but <hi>one</hi> that <hi>Scripture</hi> hath prescribed us, we shall sing with lamentable discord.</p>
                  <p>10. And hereby is laid a snare to tempt men into odious censures of each other: Because studied Sermons, printed Books, Catechisms and Forms of Prayer, are <hi>Images and Idolatry,</hi> in these mens conceits, all Gods Churches in the world must be censured as Idolatrous. And almost all his Ministers in the world must be accounted Idolaters; Children must account their Parents Idolaters, and disobey them that would teach them a Catechism, Psalm or Form of Prayer. Our Libraries must be burnt or cast away as Images; And when <hi>Ministers are diminished,</hi> and <hi>accounted Idolaters,</hi> if Satan could next but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade people against all the <hi>holy Books</hi> of the Ministers of Christ (such as <hi>Boltons, Prestons, &amp;c.</hi>) as Images and Idols, had he not plaid a more succesful game, then he did by <hi>Iulian,</hi> and doth by the <hi>Turks,</hi> who keep the Christians but from humane Learning?</p>
                  <p>11. Hereby <hi>Christian Love</hi> will be quenched, when every man must account his Brother an Idolater, that cannot shew a Scripture, for the hour, the place of Worship, the Bells, the Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64624:60"/>
the Pulpit, the Utensils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or that studieth what to say before he Pray or Preach?</p>
                  <p>12. And hereby backbiting, slandering and railing must go currant as no sin, while every <hi>Calvin, Cartwright, Hildersham, Perkins, Sibbs, &amp;c.</hi> that used a Form of Prayer, yea, almost all the Christians in the world, must be accused of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as if it were a true and righteous charge.</p>
                  <p>13. And all our sins will be fathered on God, as if the second Commandment and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture perfection did require all this, and taught Children to disobey their Parents and Masters, and say your Prayers and Catechisms are Images and Idols, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. It will rack and perplex the Consciences of all Christians; when I must take my self for an Idolater, till I can find a particular Law in Scripture, for every Tune, Metre, Translation, Method, Word, Vesture, Gesture, Utensil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that I use in the worshipping of God: When Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science must build only in the air, and rest only on a word which never was.</p>
                  <p>15. It will have a confounding influence into all the affairs and business of our lives.</p>
                  <p>16. Lastly, It will affright poor people from Scripture and Religion, and make us, our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worship, ridiculous in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight of all the world. The Doctrine (which we hear maintained) which hath no better fruits than these, must be avoided, as well as the <hi>contrary extream,</hi> which would indeed charge the Law of God with imperfection, and cause man to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64624:61"/>
usurp the part of Christ. And we must first know, <hi>How far God made the Scripture for our Rule?</hi> and then we must maintain its sufficiency and perfection.</p>
                  <p>II. Also on that extream, we must do nothing to countenance those <hi>Practices</hi> which tend to alienate Christians hearts from one another, and to keep up Church-Wars, or to feed bitter cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, scorns and reproaches. And we that must not scandalize the Religious sort, must avoid all that thus tempteth them, which is the real scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.

If you <hi>pray</hi> to God to encline men against all that Communion which you <hi>write</hi> against, or <hi>lament</hi> such Communion as a <hi>sin,</hi> this is <hi>falser worship</hi> than any is in the Liturgick Prayers.

                  <hi>modes</hi> of worship <hi>false,</hi> which God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath not commanded, what a <hi>false worshipper</hi> are you, that use a translation of Scripture, a Version and tunes of Psalms, a dividing the Scripture into Chapters and Verses, yea the Method and words of every Sermon and Prayer, or most, and abundance such like which God commanded not? God never bid you use the words of Prayer in the <hi>Liturgie;</hi> Nor did he ever bid you use those which you <hi>used last</hi> without it.</p>
               <p>O Brother, if you knew your self, and judged impartially, you would see, that whatever you say against mens communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with other mens tolerable failings, as <hi>false worship,</hi> may be as stronglie urged for avoiding communion in <hi>disordered prayers</hi> that are <hi>without book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and much more in the prayers of honest erroneous Separatists, Anabaptists, Antinomians, &amp;c. which yet for my part I will not so easily avoid. I confess if my judgment were not more than yours against <hi>dividing</hi> from each other in the general, I should be one that should be as forward to disclaim Communion with many zealous Parties (now received by you) and that as <hi>false worshippers,</hi> as you are to disclaim Communion with others. I am sure you worship God <hi>falsly,</hi> that is, <hi>sinfully,</hi> every time that you worship him.</p>
               <p>3. But, seeing my Book disswadeth you <hi>equally</hi> from unjust avoiding Communion with <hi>all sound and sober Christians;</hi> I ask you, whether all these several parties are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64624:64"/>
                  <hi>false worshippers,</hi> save you alone? Did not the Presbyterians and Independants agree in worship, when you gathered Churches out of their Churches, and when thousands separated from all the Parish Churches al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most then existent? Indeed the Anabaptists charged us also with false worship, but it was not truly. But the ordinary Divider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Besides my five Disputations of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, how oft have I written against Persecution? The few Publick Sermons that ever I Preached, had somewhat against it.

the like or less. And I know not how to convince men well, if I must pass by all such experimental Arguments.</p>
               <p>2. Do you not mark your partialitie, Brother! In our Reply to them 1660. pag. 7, 8. <hi>et alibi,</hi> and in my 5 Disput. &amp;c. I tell the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>faults past,</hi> of <hi>Silencings,</hi> and <hi>Suspendings, &amp;c.</hi> of the excellent Ministers afflicted and laid by; and how ordinarily are they told of the things charged on Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Laud, Pierce, Wren, &amp;c.</hi> in their Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to the Parliament: And when did you blame me or others for so doing?

O that we could know what spirit we are of.</p>
               <p>3. Your third untruth in point of fact, is, [<hi>that I was as guilty of stirring up and foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that war as any one whatsoever.</hi>] Could you possibly believe your self in this? 1. I suppose you never saw me till above ten years after I had done with Wars. 2. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you lived far from me. 3. If you know <hi>whom,</hi> and <hi>what</hi> you speak of, you know that I was never of the <hi>Assembly;</hi> I never <hi>Preached to the Parliament,</hi> till the day before the King was Voted home: I was forced from home to <hi>Coventry: There</hi> it was that I did speak my Opinion, but refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their Commission as Chaplain to the Garrison. In <hi>Shropshire</hi> my Father was twice imprisoned, that never did any thing against the King; nor medled with Wars:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64624:66"/>
For two Months I did something there to little purpose, and once got my father out of Prison, by causing another to be seized to redeem him; but I never took Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Office, or pay all that time.

               <p>And did [<hi>no man whatsoever do more than this.</hi>] What not the <hi>Parliament themselves?</hi> Not any of the <hi>chief Speakers there?</hi> Not any of their <hi>acquaintance.</hi> What, not any of the other party neither?

Why do you find none of my Parliament Sermons in Print?</p>
               <p>4. But, if indeed I was as guilty as you
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64624:67"/>
mention, why is it in <hi>me a most unbecoming practice,</hi> to blame that which you think I did occasion? Is this good Divinity, that it is unbecoming a Minister to mention hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous sin with bitterness which we have bin guilty of? How then shall we repent? Or is Repentance an unbecoming thing? I hope the Act of Oblivion was not made to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate Gods Act of Oblivion, which giveth Pardon to the Penitent? Doth it forbid us to Repent of sin, or to perswade our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to repent? Where sin is hated, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will not be hated: And if sin were as <hi>bitter</hi> as it <hi>must be,</hi> Reproof would not be <hi>bitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Do you think that you Preach sound Doctrine, when you say that [<hi>None ought to blame the effects who gave rise and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Cause.</hi>] If this Doctrine be part of Gods worship which you offer him, who should be avoided as a <hi>false worshipper,</hi> that is, a <hi>false teacher,</hi> sooner than your self! What a scandal is it to the world, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonour to your self, that such Doctrine should be found thus under your hand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately delivered? If this be true, then he that first encouraged the War on either side, must not blame any of the Murders, Robberies or other Villanies therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? Then he that hired the <hi>French</hi> man to set <hi>London</hi> on Fire, must not blame the <hi>burning</hi> of it. Then a man ought not to blame any sin which ever he was a cause of! Then when a man hath once sinned he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64624:67"/>
must <hi>despair,</hi> and never must repent nor blame his crime. If you had found such Doctrine as this in the Common Prayer Book, you would have had a fowler charge against it than now you have, as to Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. Which I mention but to shew you, that if we must run away from one another for every thing that is unsound, we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done, and others must avoid you as much as you do them.<note place="margin">And guilty of all which he calleth the Effects?</note>

Do you think all that is done in one land, or one age, or by one Army, is <hi>one War?</hi> Where there are several causes, (especially if also several par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,) sure they are several Wars. The first War was made under the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> when the Commissions run [<hi>for the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>]. The second War begun under <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> when [<hi>for the King</hi>] was left out of the Commissions. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther War was by <hi>Cromwell</hi> against the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> when he garbelled them (though it came not to blows). Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther War was against the <hi>Scots</hi> Army and the <hi>English</hi> that rose for the Kings Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Another was in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Another in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Another between <hi>Cromwel</hi> and the Levellers. And many others there were afterwards under several Usurping Powers; And do you call all these <hi>one?</hi> or which of them do you mean?</p>
               <p>7. I suppose you grosly call the meer

                  <hi>consequents, the effects.</hi> Sure that which was the <hi>Effect</hi> of a <hi>later War,</hi> might be but the <hi>Consequent</hi> of a former. Or else you must say that the Parliament raised War against themselves, to pull down themselves, and set up a Protector? This was the <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> of their first War; but whether the <hi>effect</hi> I leave to Logicians to determine. But by this you may see that you again preach false doctrine. The King may <hi>give rise and encouragement to a War,</hi> and <hi>yet may</hi> lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blame such Consequents as you call ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: What if the Kings own Army should plunder and murder, and blaspheme and depopulate; yea, or depose or hurt, or any way injure the King himself? Shall a man that separateth from the Liturgie as false worship come and tell us, that the King ought not to blame any of this because he gave rise and encouragement to the War: Extremities and Passion do thus unhappily use to blind men.</p>

Are our Rulers by all this exasperated to the severities which we feel? Are Ministers silenced by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it, about eighteen hundred at once, (even many hundreds that never were in any Wars, and such as consented not to this at all.) Are we made by it the by-word and hissing of the Nations, and the shame and pitty of all our friends?

are never like to be healed and restored; and that it is heinous gross impenitence, that keepeth Ministers and people under their distress: And I take it for the sad Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick of our future woe, and (at best) our lengthened affliction, to read such writings against <hi>Repentance,</hi> and to hear so little <hi>open profession of Repentance,</hi> even for <hi>unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heinous crimes;</hi> for the saving of those that are undone by these scandals, and for the reparation of the honour of Religion, which is most notoriously injured.</p>
               <p>To see men still think, that their <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is the <hi>dishonour of their party</hi> and <hi>Cause,</hi> whose honour can no other way be repaired!

That man or party that will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>all these heinous Crimes,</hi> and still plead <hi>Conscience</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> for them, doth grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous injury to <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> I have told you truly in the book which is <hi>bitter</hi> to you, that Gods way of vindicating the honour of Religion, is for us by open free Confession, to take all the shame to our selves, that it be not injuriously cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Religion. And the Devils way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the honour of the Godly, is by justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their sins, and pleading Religion for them, that so <hi>Religiousness it self</hi> may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be hypocrisie and wickedness; as maintaining and befriending wickedness.</p>
               <p>For my own part I thought when I wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted

my strength, and hazarded my life in the Army against these fore-named Crimes, and afterwards preached and wrote against them so openly, and so many years, that I had not been so much guilty of them as you here affirm.

If it be, why is it pride to utter it, as a proof that I plead for Love, and not for my own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest? Is it pride to confess so openly the weakness of my memory? I never learnt a Sermon without book in my life: I think I could not learn an hours speech, sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to utter the very words by memory in a fortnights time.

And I thought my <hi>rebuking</hi> men for it, had been no sign of pride. And, brother, I am confident, if you your self did not believe that my <hi>understanding,</hi> and consequently my Writings are over-valued, you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have written this book, especially in such a stile against me: yea, in the end you profess this to be your design, to undeceive those that had a good opinion of me.

The matter of fact being so publick, invalidateth your exception.</p>
               <p>8. The last expression of my pride is, that I give this testimony even to Christians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to divisions, that if they think a man speaketh not to the depressing of true and serious religion, they can bear that from him, which they cannot bear from one that they think hath a malignant end: and that on this account in my sharpest reproofs my own auditors have still been patient with me. Enquire whether this be true or not? Whether I have not preached twenty times more against Divisions, to a people that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once quarrelled with it, than I have written against it in the book with which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64624:73"/>
you so much quarrel. And is this <hi>probatum</hi> given against malignity a word of pride too?</p>
               <p>You proceed in your Charge that [<hi>I have great thoughts of my self, and have learned little of Christian or moral ingenuity, and am unfit to be a Teacher of it to others.

O how hard is it still to know our selves, and what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of spirit we are of. Is it <hi>pride</hi> in me to think that <hi>I am righter than you</hi> or to <hi>express it?</hi> Why, brother, do not you think as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently</hi> that <hi>you are righter than I?</hi> and do you not as <hi>Confidently utter it?</hi> I differ no further from you, than you do from me: And why is it not as much sign of pride in you, to think you know more than I, as in me to think that I know more (in this) than you?

               <p>You adde [<hi>We wonder that any Protestant should be found, though but by the equalling of Church history to Scripture, as if the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tradition of the one, were to be as much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of and followed as the Divine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Revelation of the other.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Answ. 1. Because this wonder plainly containeth an affirmation that I do so, I must
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64624:78"/>
say that it is your tenth untruth: Prove such<note place="margin">10 Untruth.</note> a word if you are able.</p>
               <p>2. It is not true that this Historie is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain (though not to be equalled with Scripture.) Is the Case of a vast Empire of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> (as big yet after the decay saith <hi>Brierwood,</hi> as <hi>Germany, Italy, France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>) uncertain, when the World knoweth that they have not had so much as Converse with the Pope, and at <hi>Oviedos</hi> attempt did not know who he was? And so of <hi>Persia, India,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If you will needs be so much wiser than your neighbours as to prove all historie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, even that there was a <hi>Caesar,</hi> or a <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror. 1. While you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend the Papists in this one point, you will incommodate them in others, 2.

               <p>When I had given in few words, a full and plain answer to the Papists about our separation from their Church, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred how many Volumes they have troubled the World with, by obscuring our plain and<note place="margin">Whether it be intollerable Pride to say that the Papists understand not Christian sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> ordinarie answer, I told them, that must have Volumes to hide the sense, that if <hi>this answer seem not plain and full to them, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they understand not Christian sense and reason;</hi> and not for want of <hi>plainess</hi> in the matter, or through <hi>defectiveness</hi> as to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

a reasonable impartial man. This, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, chargeth this saying, to be [<hi>insolent,</hi> and from <hi>intolerable Pride</hi>] because <hi>I dare so Charge another with want of Christian sense and reason,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This is his eleventh untruth. I<note place="margin">11 Untruth.</note> only named <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> objectively, not subjectively. It is <hi>not because</hi> the Answer which I give the Papists (and which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants commonly give) is not full and plain, or wanteth <hi>sense</hi> or <hi>reason,</hi> but because the Papists <hi>understand it not.</hi> He that hath <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> may be hindred from using it aright, by interest, partialitie, and wilful negligences which it is no new thing for Protestants to think that Papists are too oft guilty of. But how <hi>proud</hi> am I then, intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably <hi>proud</hi> that in several books have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that all Papists that hold Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, do make it an Article of Faith, and necessarie to Salvation, flatly to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict all the senses of all the sound men in the World, that shall judge whether bread be bread, and wine be wine? How much more <hi>insolent</hi> a Charge is this? But, brother, Popish absurdities have need of a better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, than to call <hi>the</hi> adversarie <hi>insolent and proud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And is the thing I say true or false? I prove it true. <hi>The Answer of the Protestants about</hi> Luther's <hi>Reformation which I give, is Christian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64624:79"/>
understand not Christian sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>That is, In this: For I never said that they understand not Christian Sense and Reason, in <hi>any other thing,</hi> nor is there the least appearance of such a sense. Now if this, brother, will deny either of the premises, he may expect an answer. Till then I adde.</p>
               <p>3. Are not you, brother, by your own censure notoriously <hi>insolent</hi> and <hi>intolerably proud,</hi> if this hold good, as well as I? Do you not take all that you say against me (or some part at least) to be plain and full, and to be <hi>Christian sense and reason?</hi> And do you not suppose me to think otherwise of it? And do you not think that this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I understand it not? Thus some mens hands do beat themselves.</p>
               <p>4. And do you not implicitly charge all or most Protestant Writers with <hi>insolence</hi> and <hi>intolerable pride</hi> as well as me? Do they not all think their reasons against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>full</hi> (at least some of them:) And do they not think that the Papists de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie them because they understand not the Christian Sense and Reason which is in them.</p>
               <p>5. And have not all mankind a deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of understanding? And is it pride and insolence to say so?</p>
               <p>6. But judge of your own spirit by your own rule: Do not you think those that you before charged with persecution, and making our dividing engines, and whose
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64624:80"/>
Communion you think it a duty to avoid, to be such as <hi>understand not Christian sense and reason</hi> in the arguings which I and others have used against them? And is it not as lawful to think so of the Papists?</p>

               <p>But you deny that <hi>Christ had any addition of wisdom, except as to manifestation,</hi> I believe Gods word!

               <p>You adde that Christ <hi>needed not prayer for himself, but as a pattern to us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ had no <hi>Culpable need,</hi> nor <hi>as God</hi> any <hi>natural need.</hi> But, brother, take heed of the

Do you well, brother, to trouble the World at this rate of discourse? For charges on me, I pass them by.

               <p>Lest you deny belief to me, I intreat you and the Reader to get and read a book pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> (as is uncontrolledly affirmed, who lately wrote against Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> against the lawfulness of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Parish Churches) concerning the experiences and strange work of God on a Gentlewoman in <hi>Worcester</hi> (whom I will not name, because yet living, and God may recover her, but is there well known.) This Gentlewoman having been long vain, and a constant neglecter of publick worship, was suddenly moved to go into the Church while I was there preaching (on <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21.) The very Text struck her to the heart; but
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64624:90"/>
before the Sermon was done she could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbear crying out in the Congregation: She went home a changed person; resolved for a holy life. But her affection (or passion) being strong, and her nature <hi>tender,</hi> and her knowledge <hi>small<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> she quickly thought that the Quakers lived strictlier than we, and fell in among them. At last perceiving them vilifie the Ministry and the Scripture, her heart smote her, and she forsook them, as speaking against that which by experience she had found to do her good; And desiring to speak with me (who lived far off,) open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this much to me. But all these deep workings and troubles <hi>between</hi> the several waies, did so affect her, that she fell into a very strong melancholy; Insomuch that she imposed such an abstinence from meat upon her self, that she was much consumed, and so debilitated as to keep her bed, and almost famished. Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> (and others) were her instructers, who were very zealous for the way called <hi>The Fifth Monarchy,</hi> and having instructed her in those opinions, published the whole story in print (which else I would not have mentioned) I shall say nothing of any thing which is otherwise known, but desire the Reader that doth but understand what melancholy is, better than the Writers did, to read that book, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve with sorrow and pitty, what a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of plain effects of Melancholy, as to <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> are there ascribed to <hi>me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And hath set to it the infallible seal of God (which is the Impress of his <hi>Power, Wisdome,</hi> and <hi>Goodness.</hi>) 3. And that he helpeth Ministers to preach this Gospel to us. 4. He next doth help us to <hi>Remember,</hi> and to <hi>Understand</hi> it; And no false exposition is from the spirit of God: And he hath left us sufficient means to discern (as far as is necessary to our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and our Comfort) whether it be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpreted or not. 5. And he helpeth us firmly to believe the Truth of it: And of the unseen Glory which it promiseth. 6. And hereby he kindleth in us <hi>Repentance, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and reneweth both soul and life to the Image of God, and the example of Jesus Christ. 7. And then he helpeth us to <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Exercise</hi> all this Grace. 8. And he helpeth us to <hi>discern</hi> the <hi>sincerity</hi> of it: And And so by the <hi>spirit</hi> we know that we have the <hi>spirit,</hi> and have the witness of Christ, and the seal of God, and the pledge, earnest, and first fruits of eternal life within us, whilest the spirit doth make known him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be in us. And all true signs of <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> or the <hi>Divine nature</hi> in us, are signs of this in-dwelling sealing <hi>spirit:</hi> But so are not the sudden passions, and fancies, and change of parties, sides, or by opinions, or strong conceits unproved, from whence some use to fetch their comforts. 9. And next he helpeth us hereupon to make a true
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64624:92"/>
                  <hi>application</hi> of the promise of Justification and Salvation to our selves: Having before <hi>applied</hi> or received it by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> and being <hi>Iustified,</hi> he helpeth us to apply it to our <hi>Assurance</hi> and setled <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;</hi> and to argue, <hi>There is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit: But I am in Christ Iesus, and I walk not after the flesh but after the spirit; Therefore there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to me.</hi> 10. Next the same spirit exciteth actual <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Ioy</hi> in the soul, by the said application of the promise; that we shall not only <hi>conclude</hi> from it, that we have pardon and right to Heaven in Jesus Christ, but also shall have the <hi>Will and Affections</hi> duly moved with that Conclusion. 11. And the same spirit helpeth us to answer all the false Cavils of Satan, the World, or our misgiving hearts, which rise up against this hope and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. 12. And lastly he helpeth us in the use of all those holy means, by which this <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> is to be maintained, and helpeth us against the sins that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it, and so keepeth it in life, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, and perseverance, till we finally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.

For the publick service of God, in reading, teaching, praying, &amp;c. 3. For stated orders and forms of that publick service, To which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addeth a <hi>4th.</hi> as the narrowest sense of all, <hi>viz</hi> For the sacrificing offices only; which is no usual sense. Now the second and third being the now-Common sense, I thought there had<note place="margin">See Psal 92. and 102, &amp;c.</note> been no question about them.</p>
               <p>That the Jews had a Divine Liturgie in both senses (as a <hi>service,</hi> and as a <hi>prescript</hi>

                  <hi>form</hi>) I proved in my <hi>5th.</hi> Disput. of Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies many years ago. 1. In the Temple they had most punctual prescripts for their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of all sorts, and their offerings; and the manner of performance, and the actions of Priests and people about them. In the Synagogues <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets were read every Sabbath day! And the Psalms were purposely penned (many of them) and<note place="margin">1 Chr. 16. 4. and 25. 2 Chron. 8. 14, 15.</note> recorded to be <hi>Prayers and Praises</hi> for the publick and private worship, and were committed to several Church-officers to be publickly used: And <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> appointed the Instruments, Singers, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; manner in which they should be used. A form of prayer for the Priests is prescribed in three benedictions, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 23. <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> commanded the Levites to sing Praises to the Lord with <hi>the words of</hi> David <hi>and of</hi> Asaph <hi>the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

[<hi>On that day</hi> David <hi>delivered first this Psalm to thank the Lord into the hands of</hi> Asaph <hi>and his brethren,</hi> Exod. 15. The <hi>song of Moses</hi> is a form. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3. the Saints are said to <hi>sing the song of Moses</hi> and of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> Most Expositers think that the <hi>Hymne</hi> that Christ sung at his <hi>last sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> was the usual form: If not, it was a <hi>new form.

their Humiliation: And <hi>Iohn</hi> taught his Disciples to pray; And when Christ was desired to teach his Disciples as <hi>Iohn</hi> had done his, he gave them a form. Now let the sober Reader judge whether the Jews had <hi>no form</hi> or <hi>Liturgie</hi> of God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>If he say, <hi>I thought you had meant a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane form;</hi> I answer, If you will think that which I say not, and choose rather to <hi>revile,</hi> than <hi>observe</hi> what you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>2. When I speak of a <hi>Probability</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I do mean of a <hi>humane Liturgie:</hi> of which I will now only say, 1. That it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth very improbable to me that the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees who so abounded with Traditions, should not so much as have <hi>any humane forms</hi> of prayer or praise.</p>
               <p>2. When Christ speaketh of their <hi>long prayers,</hi> I desire <hi>them on both extreams</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that, If it was a <hi>long Liturgie,</hi> they should not compare the Puritane to the Pharisee in his long prayers as they use to do, but to others. But if they were <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate Prayers,</hi> 1. To one side I say, that if Christ had been against <hi>extemporate praying,</hi> he would have put that into his rebukes: 2. To the other side I say, If the Pharisees had the gift of <hi>long extemporate prayers,</hi> we must take heed of over-valuing such a gift, and ascribing it too much to the spirit, so that the Pharisees <hi>long prayers,</hi> as a two edged sword, cut both extreams in this pievish Controversie.</p>

This Controversie <hi>whether the Iews had a Liturgie,</hi> is handled so largely by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> that I must refer the Reader to him that would see what is said for the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, in <hi>Eutych.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I spake of jesting on both sides at one anothers devotions, and not of one alone. 2. If you are for that way of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64624:96"/>
jeasts and scorns at other mens prayers, with what measure you mete it will be meted to you again. They will requite you to the full with jeasts and scorns at yours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. 3. Brother, do you like this way, or do you not? If you do, what a spirit are you of? If you do not, why do you quarrel with this advice</p>
               <p>And whereas you cite my own words in the Reply to the Bishops, I must tell you; 1. That I know nothing in any of those Papers or Treaty, as to the matter that I have changed my judgement in, or repent of. And I admire that the Prelates that ask so often [<hi>What will satisfie us?</hi>] and others that carry it to the World as if we had said nothing, should to this day leave that Reply and our Liturgie then offered them, and our Petition for Peace, so much unanswered; Which few that knew them will believe is for want of will and fervour or indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against them? 2. That yet the sentence cited by you [<hi>Whether it be that the Common-Prayer-Book hath never a Prayer for it self,</hi>] I confess is sarcastical, and I unfeignedly thank you for calling me to review it; and I do unfeignedly repent of it, and desire pardon of God and men, for speaking words of so much derision? Though I then no more perceived my fault, than you do yours.</p>
               <p>I mentioned some that were scandalized at the scorns of men at the Liturgie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; And, 1. He calls it a <hi>prophane story fitter for Ranters,</hi> 2. <hi>He challengeth me to tell</hi>

                  <hi>the names of them that used those expressions.</hi> 3. <hi>He thinks I did greatly sin in repeating them.</hi> 4. Else he will <hi>think I invented them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on purpose to make my brethren odious, and justifie the persecution against them.</hi>

               <p>

                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>e:</hi> On the Lords-day the Inn-keeper, an old man (Mr. <hi>Hawkshead</hi> as I remember his name was) came in from <hi>Laurence</hi> Church with some guests in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great passion: We ask'd him what the matter was? He answered, that as he went into the Church, a fellow look'd in, and spake those very words I recited, save that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64624:97"/>
he said [<hi>The Deele</hi>] instead of [<hi>The Devil:</hi>] And from very sober honest people I have, I believe, many score times heard them call the Common Prayer [<hi>Porridge</hi>] and say, [<hi>He is not out of his Porridge yet.</hi>]</p>
               <p>3. If I sin in repeating them, I pray you justifie not that spirit that uttered them; Nor be not of the mind of the Councellor of the wicked in this age, whose policy is to perswade men to commit <hi>such heinous sins (Perjury, Lying,</hi> &amp;c.) which sound odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in the naming, and then no man may ever accuse them, lest he be guilty of rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, incivility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Brother, a very low degree of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity would have taught you to have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such a Plea for Love, by one that in this book speaketh more against Persecuting you, than ever you read, I believe, in a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed book since the printing Act, to have come from no malicious persecuting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>Yet, as if you were so eagerly set on the Defence of the dividing scandalous miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of this age, as to take it for <hi>persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> so much as to lament them, or pray against them, you gather the same conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from my very <hi>prayers</hi> to God, <hi>for pitty to his Church</hi> that is distracted and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by such usage.</p>
               <p>And here, seeing <hi>your sufferings</hi> are so<note place="margin">The temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> much talk'd of, and I am numbred by you among your persecutors, endure me to tell you, that <hi>suffering</hi> hath its temptations as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64624:98"/>
well as prosperity; And that the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to <hi>passion,</hi> and to run too far from those we suffer by, and to lose our charity to them and their adherents, are so much stronger to me (I leave others to judge themselves) than the temptations to fear and timerous complyances, that I was much more jealous of my heart in this, when I suffered most than at other times: For I knew that it is one of Satans designs to rob me of my <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> in which he would more triumph than in depriving me of my main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, reputation and liberty. And I must confess to you, brother, that (though I once hoped that we should have been great gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by our sufferings) the fruit of them now appeareth to me to be such in many as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth<note place="margin">Many are overcome by suffering, who think they overcome. It's a reproach to our Nation that <hi>Hornius</hi> Hist. Eccl. saith, [<hi>Ita ut seperatismus sive</hi> Brownis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus <hi>non alios habeat authores quam cum Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannide &amp; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitione Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copos Dominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> pag. 244. So much good suffering doth.</note> me more afraid of imprisonment for the sake of my soul, than of my body, lest it should stir up that <hi>passion</hi> which should bear down my judgement into some errors and extreams, and corrupt and destroy my Love to them by whom I suffer.</p>
               <p>And truly, Brother, I am fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that many that think their sufferings are their glory, and prove them better men than others, are lamentably lost and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by their sufferings. I think your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and you are no gainers by it, who presently by preaching and writing thus, bring water to the extinguishing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Love. I think those two Gentlemen before mentioned, that turned Quakers in prison, and left their Religion (as many
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64624:98"/>
more have done) were losers by it. And I think many thousands in these times, that are driven into various errors and extreams, and have lost their charity to adversaries and dissenters, have lost a thousand times more than their liberties and money comes to. Woe be to the World because of offences; And woe be to them by whom offence cometh. Experience of too many maketh me less in love with sufferings than I have been; And to think that the quiet and peaceable preaching of the Gospel (though under many other disadvantages) if God would grant it us, would be better for our own souls.</p>

I shall propose here these few things to thy consideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Whether an Idolater be not an odious person, and unfit for Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? (That these men think so, their practise sheweth.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:64624:99"/>Q. 2. Whether he that writeth and preacheth to prove others Idolaters, do not write and preach to make them (so far) seem odious, and to perswade men from loving them, and having communion with them as Christians?</p>
               <p>Q. 3. Whether he that preacheth up ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred causelesly, and preacheth down Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian love, do not preach down the sum of true Religion, and preach against God, who is Love?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 4. Whether preaching against God and Religion, be not worse than talking against it in an Ale-house, or in prophane discourse? And fathering all this on God and Religion be not a sad aggravation of it?</p>
               <p>Q. 5. Whether this, brother, that affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this to be <hi>Idolatry</hi> that he speaketh against, should not have given us some word of proof, especially where he calleth me that deny it, a Dictator? And whether both as <hi>Affirmer</hi> among Logicians, and as <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> among men of justice, the proof be not incumbent on him?</p>
               <p>Q. 6. Whether here be a syllable of proof, but his angry affirmation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 7. Whether thou canst receive this saying of his, if thou have Christian sense and reason, so far as to believe that all the Churches of Christ fore-named, the Greek, the Abissine, the Armenian, the Coptics, the Lutherans, and all the Reformed Churches that fall under his Charge, are
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64624:100"/>
Idolaters? And couldst bring thy heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to condemn them, and separate from them? And whether thou canst take all the holy Conformists of <hi>England,</hi> such as <hi>Bolton, Preston, Sibbes, Stocke, Dike, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Crooke, Whateley, Fenner,</hi> &amp;c. for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters? yea, and all the <hi>non-Conformists</hi> that used and joyned in the Liturgie?</p>
               <p>Q. 8. Whether thou canst believe that this same brother himself, that writeth at this rate, <hi>do use nothing in Gods worship which hath no command of God to make it lawful?</hi> Is all this reviling, all this false doctrine, all his untruths commanded of God? Or doth he not make himself an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
               <p>Q. 9. Whether, if he teach true doctrine, there by any Church or person in the World that worshippeth not God with Idolatry; I give my reasons. 1. There is no one but <hi>sinneth,</hi> (or useth sin) in the worship of God. But no sin is commanded or lawful: <hi>Ergo</hi> there is no one, according to his doctrine, but useth Idolatry in the worship of God.</p>
               <p>2. There is no one that useth not some things not commanded to make them law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in the worship of God: Therefore, if he teach true doctrine, there is no one but useth Idolatry. The antecedent I have oft proved by many instances: The method of every Sermon, and Prayer, the words, the time and length, the translation of the Scripture, whether it shall be this or that,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64624:100"/>
the dividing of the Scripture into Chapters and Verses, the Meeter of Psalms, the Tunes, Church utensils, Sermon notes (which some use,) Catechisms in forms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Printing of the Bible, or any other books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> none of these are commanded. And all these are used in the worship of God. And must all Christians in the World be taught to fly from one another as Idolaters? Is this the way of Love and Unity?</p>
               <p>Q. 10. Why should this, brother, be so extream impatient with me for calling <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viders, weak and pievish, and censorious</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians? If in his own judgement all men be Idolaters, that use any thing in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship not commanded? Is not this to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure all men as Idolaters? And yet is a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of previshness on these Censurers a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying of persecution.</p>
               <p>Q. 11. Whether this kind of talk be not sport to the Papists, to hear us call one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Idolaters,</hi> as well as them? and do not make them deride us; and harden them in their bread-worship, and image-worship, as being called <hi>Idolatry</hi> on no better grounds than we so call one another.</p>
               <p>Q. 12. Whether it be not a great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to any man to suffer silencing, because he cannot add to Gods worship, the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Liturgie, and at the same time to add to Gods word new and false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of our own, by saying that [<hi>It is a species of Idolatry, forbidden in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, because it is used in the worship of God</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:64624:101"/>
                  <hi>without any command to make it lawful.</hi>] And if we should suffer such false doctrine, and additions, and Love-killing, dividing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplesas this, to go uncontradicted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do not betray the truth and our flocks, and shew that we were too worthy of our sufferings?</p>
               <p>But that this assertion or definition of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is false, I need to prove no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, than, 1. That it is unproved by him that is to prove it, and, 2. That it denieth Christ to have a Church on earth, or to have any but Churches of Idolaters. 3. That it turneth all sin in Gods worship into one species, even Idolatry. And so every false doctrine used in Gods worship is Idolatry: Every Antimonian, Anabaptist, Separatist, or of any other error be it never so small, must be presently an Idolater, if in prayer or preaching he speak his error: And what man is infallible? When <hi>your Companion</hi> promised in the Pulpit, that there should be <hi>no more Tythes, no more Taxes, nor no more King,</hi> in <hi>Worcestershire</hi> after <hi>Worcester</hi>-Fight, this must be <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For certainly no error is commanded of God. 4. That it maketh the description of a <hi>thing indifferent,</hi> to be the description of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For as [<hi>a thing forbidden</hi>] is the description of sin, so to be [<hi>not commanded</hi>] speaketh no more but <hi>Indifferency</hi> (Though the <hi>prohibition</hi> to do <hi>any thing not commanded,</hi> speaketh more, if it could be proved.) 5. It is contrary to the Scripture which never useth the word</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:64624:101"/>[<hi>IDOLATRY</hi>] in that sense? Peruse the several texts, and try. 6. It equalleth almost all Churches with the Infidel and Pagan World. 7. It heinously injureth God, who is a hater of Idolaters, and will visit their sins (as God-haters) on the third and fourth Generations; to feign him to be thus a hater of his Churches, and of them that <hi>use any thing in his worship not commanded.</hi> 8. It tendeth to drive all Christians <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,</hi> as being Idolaters, and so abhorred of God, because they have all some <hi>uncomman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> yea <hi>forbidden</hi> thing in worship: For by this mans doctrine, a sinful wandring thought, a sinful disorder, or tautologie, or bad expression is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> (as being <hi>not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi>) 9. It tendeth to drive men to <hi>give ever worshipping God;</hi> because while they are certain to sin, they are certain to be <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi> when they have done their best<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. It hardeneth the Mahometans in their enmity to Christianity, who being the great exclaimers against Idolatry do already falsely brand us with that crime.</p>
               <p>But what ever else it do, I am sure it is so pernicious an engine of Satan, to <hi>kill Love</hi> and divide <hi>the Church,</hi> to feign every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist how holy soever, and every one that <hi>useth in worship any thing not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> to be an <hi>Idolater,</hi> that I may well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise all Christians, as they love Christ and his Church, and their own souls, to keep themselves from such mistakes.

               <p>2. The thing is further proved by the common experience of mankind, which it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64624:108"/>
amazeth me to think a man that liveth among men in the world, awake and in his senses, can be ignorant of? Enemies know it: Friends know it; not only that there are <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Injudicious Christians, but that</hi> the far greatest part are such though not in a <hi>damning,</hi> yet in a <hi>sad and troublesome degree!</hi> And that the far greatest part of those that we hope are truly godly, remain so lamentably ignorant of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of things, that should be known, and continue in such an infancy of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as is a great advantage to the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and many waies calamitous to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to the Church: It is the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all experienced Ministers. Alas, how ignorant <hi>even</hi> honest people remain; And how slowly they come on in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</p>
               <p>3. If God have made it one half the work of the Pastors of the Churches, to labour all their daies to heal the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of good people, then, such Ignorant ones there are: But the antecedent is plain in Scripture; and believed by most Ministers, as their daily Sermons tell you.</p>
               <p>4. Do not the multitudes of Sects and Errors, and Contentions that have torn the Church from the Apostles daies till now prove it? Were all those in the Catalogues of <hi>Epiphanius, Augustine, Philastrius,</hi> &amp;c. Certainly graceless? Or were none of them Ignorant and Injudicious?</p>
               <p>And though <hi>Church-tyranny</hi> be a <hi>grand</hi>

                  <hi>Divider,</hi> that this was not the <hi>only Cause,</hi> two instances prove to the great disgrace of this assertion of his. First, the instance of the said sects of Christians, for the first 300 or 400 years, when there were no such <hi>Impositions.</hi> Secondly, our late twenty years (or neer) contentions and divisions, and numerous parties, when there were lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no impositions. Was it <hi>impositions</hi> or <hi>tyranny</hi> that bred sects in the Armies, and in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in the daies of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
               <p>5. And is it not sufficient proof to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that there are <hi>weak, ignorant, injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> Christians, when the <hi>ruines</hi> of <hi>twenty years experience</hi> overwhelmeth us, and when so <hi>many years unreconcilable differences</hi> prove i?

               <p>6. And what say you by all the <hi>Greek, the Abassine, Armenian, Nestorian, Iacobite,</hi> &amp;c. Christians, that are alas, in National general Ignorance: Which will you affirm, Brother; That all these Nations are <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Infidels,</hi> or <hi>no Christians?</hi> Or that there are <hi>no Ignorant Christians</hi> among them?</p>
               <p>7. And what say you by all the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Lutherans and Calvinists, Arminians</hi>

               <p>8. And what say you by all the books now extant (Dr. <hi>Crispes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Saltmarshes, Cop's,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cradocks,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dels,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dens,</hi> Mr. <hi>Randalls, Iacob Behmens,</hi> and all the Germane Prophets, <hi>Andr.

Besides all the writings of Episen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, Presbyterian, Independents, Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, Anabaptists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> against one another.</p>
               <p>9. Do you not think your self, that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of <hi>Conformists,</hi> yea <hi>Ministers</hi> are Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and Injudicious? Sure you do; And can you judge them all to be <hi>no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. Do you not think that <hi>I am Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Injudicious?</hi> If not, you must not only think that I am <hi>no Christian,</hi> but also extreamly maliciously wicked. But if you do so think of me, can you think so of <hi>all the non-Conformable Ministers of my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I am sure if you believe your self, and as you write; <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the easiest charge we can expect from you.</p>
               <p>11. And will <hi>you</hi> put sorth such a book as <hi>your own</hi> to the World, and when <hi>you</hi> have done deny the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Injudiciousness</hi> of all Christians? This is all one as to <hi>swear</hi> that there is never a swearer among Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:64624:109"/>12. I appeal to the common Charges of Ministers in their Sermons and books, who charge weak Christians with <hi>dulness, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and <hi>injudiciousness.</hi>

               <p>13. I appeal to the experience of all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Families, whether they meet with no such Christians there? Yea, how hard it is to meet with better?</p>
               <p>14. I appeal to the experience of every self-knowing Christian, whether he find not abundance of <hi>dulness, ignorance</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciousness</hi> in himself?</p>
               <p>15. I appeal to the <hi>prayers</hi> of almost all Christians, whether they charge not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with this to God?</p>
               <p>16. I appeal to almost all the disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disputers of this and every age, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they <hi>charge not one another with it?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>18 I appeal to Universities, Tutors and Schools, whether they know none such?</p>
               <p>19. I appeal to any judicious man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he find not the judicious even among good Christians; yea, and Ministers to be, alas, too rare?</p>
               <p>20. And I appeal to all men that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, whether there be no Christian chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the World? And whether all such children are cured of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness,</hi> and know all things by the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit? And if all this be no proof, it is time to give over teaching and disputing.</p>

                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:64624:110"/>And now that, if perhaps, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and others be preserved, I shall tell<note place="margin">The greatness of the sin of thus flattering Christians.</note> you what nature this sinful doctrine and practice is of; 1.

               <p>2. Hereby it resisteth a great work of the Gospel and Spirit of Christ, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the humbling of souls, and making them become as little children, conscious of Ignorance, and teachable.</p>

Our question is of more than <hi>true</hi> Saints; even such as may by others (who are no heart-searchers) be called, <hi>Christians;</hi> whether we may call any [<hi>dull, ignorant, or injudicious Christians?</hi>]</p>
               <p>5. You teach Parents and Masters to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and betray the souls of their children and servants, that are Christians: And chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and servants, to reject the teaching of Parents and Masters: For if they are not dull, nor ignorant, what need they to be taught or to learn? And at what age do they come to <hi>know all things,</hi> and to be past the title of <hi>Ignorant?</hi> Is it at 4, or 5, or 7 years old? Doubtless they may have the spirit then: If not, where is it that you will set the bounds? At what age <hi>were you</hi> past your ignorance and injudiciousness, and knew all things?</p>
               <p>6. You thus make the work of <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters</hi> needless; and also of Tutors and Academies.</p>
               <p>7. You encourage and countenance idle Ministers, as to the labours necessary to Christians: If there be no <hi>dull</hi> nor <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Christians,</hi> they are not so blame-worthy as we have made them.</p>
               <p>8. You excuse those that unjustly hinder Christs Ministers to preach to Christians, in any part of the World: If there be no <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> Christians, Preachers are not so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64624:111"/>
nor silencing them so bad a thing as we have made it.</p>
               <p>9. You encourage the contemners of the Preaching of Gods word, who say, what need we go to hear, we know as much as they can tell us.</p>
               <p>10. You contradict the Sermons of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Ministers, as if they abused Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and belyed the people, when they reprove their <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>dulness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. You encourage the bold invaders of the Ministry, who thinking that they <hi>know all things,</hi> and are not <hi>ignorant,</hi> do turn Teachers of others, before they have learned themselves.</p>
               <p>12. You encourage the disputing, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious wrangling, and insolent spirit that is abroad, which maketh men tear and divide the Church, by confidence in their several opinions; while all of them may think that they are not ignorant nor injudicious.</p>
               <p>13. You seek to keep Christs Disciples in continual Ignorance, while you would make them believe that they are <hi>not Ignorant,</hi> and so keep them out of a learning way, which is a Disciples state.</p>
               <p>14. You condemn your own practice, who <hi>preach</hi> to those that you judge your self to be Christians; For what need they your teaching (as to their understandings) if they are not <hi>Ignorant,</hi> but know all things?</p>
               <p>15. You countenance the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ascribe perfection but to a few.</p>
               <p>16. You justifie all the <hi>Errors</hi> of the times, which Christians hold, and teach them to say, we are Christians, therefore we erre not, for we are not ignorant.</p>
               <p>17. You justifie <hi>Contradictions:</hi> For if ten men be of ten several contrary minds, <hi>e. g.</hi> about the exposition of a Text, it is but one of them that can be right; And yet you teach them all to think that they are right.</p>
               <p>18. You do this against the full light and experience of an age of Errors, yea of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all ages of the Church.</p>
               <p>19. You shew your self insensible of the sinful ignorance and divisions, and ruines thereby procured, these twenty years.</p>
               <p>20. You teach all those that are or have been guilty, to be impenitent.</p>
               <p>21. You do this in an age, when dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgements, which have begun at the house of God, do call his houshold most loudly to Repent, and to be an example of penitence to others.</p>
               <p>22. Should you prevail thus to keep Christians in impenitence, you would keep us in our calamities, and turn away the peace and deliverance which we hope and pray for, and be the prognostick of our continued woe, if not of the undoing of the land, and an utter forsaking.</p>
               <p>23. You teach Christians in prayer not to confess their <hi>dulness</hi> or <hi>ignorance,</hi> and make them speak falsly that do consess it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:64624:112"/>24.

               </p>
               <p>25. You cross the use of <hi>all the World,</hi> even the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> so far as they are <hi>Gods means</hi> to teach Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians knowledge, and cure their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>26. You teach men to lose the most of their lives, as to growth in knowledge, when they must believe that they are cured of their ignorance as soon as they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and know all things perhaps at seven years old.</p>
               <p>27. You teach almost all Christians to despair of their sincerity, and to deny themselves to be Christians. For when you have taught them that [<hi>whoever are Christians indeed, have received the anointing by which they know all things, and are cured of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and injudiciousness, &amp; are not to be called dull, or ignorant, or injudicious Christians.</hi>] They will quickly assume [<hi>But it is not thus with me, I am dull and ignorant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am not a Christian indeed.</hi>]</p>
               <p>28. You almost if not wholly deny and un-Church Christs Church on earth, while you deny all to be Christians indeed that are ignorant, injudicious, dull, and know not all things.</p>
               <p>29. By cherishing the <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> of Christians, you cherish all their other

               </p>
               <p>31. You shew by this that your censure of the Conformists is so high, as to make them all to be no Christians indeed.

But he that wrote Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi>'s life, thought otherwise.</p>
               <p>32. You abuse the Scripture, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 20. 27. to countenance all this; As the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers do [<hi>He that is born of God sinneth not.</hi>] <hi>Calvin</hi> truly noteth that by [<hi>knowing all things, he meaneth not universally; sed ad prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentis loci circumstantiam restringi debet;</hi>] It is, <hi>the All things</hi> which the <hi>apostates</hi> there reproved did deny.

say, [I speak not to you as so rude and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant persons that know not these great things which these apostates deny.] Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thinketh that it meaneth, that the Holy Ghost by which you are anointed, or preferred before others, is a certain proof or evidence to you, of the Truth of all the doctrine which Christ taught, and therefore you cannot forsake him by the seducement of these apostates. <hi>Beza</hi>

               <p>39. And this you do in the very day of our scandals and reproach, where thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands are already hardened into a distaste of serious Religion, by our former divisions and injudicious miscarriages; As if you would thrust these miserable souls yet deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into Infidelity and Atheism.

to take us for a people not to be believed, by seeming to deny all this. And when I proved to you, that it is Gods way after our misdoings, to take the shame to our selves, that it may not fall on our Religion; and the Devils way to justifie the misdoings of Christians, that Christianity and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may bear the blame; you give no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of any of this, and yet go on to wrong the truth, by defending that which is not to be defended; If there be none of all this that in your eyes is matter fit for your Repentance, I still pray that you may better know what manner of spirit you are of.</p>

Untruths. 1. Either that there is no such thing as [<hi>an ignorant sort of Preachers, more valued for their affectionate tone and fervour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the loud voice of the Preacher, and a sound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                  <hi>than abler judicious men;</hi>] When as the whole Christian World knoweth that there are <hi>many</hi> such Preachers both among the several sects, (and of our selves, there are or have been some) and in the publick Assemblies; and among all Christian Churches where there is preaching through the World: And the worlds experience puts it past doubt, that the generality of the vulgar, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and injudicious sort of men, do va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue a man by his tone and voice more than for the judgement and excellency of his matter, if not put off by such advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Brother, you and I are both known persons; Though I look not to mention my self without your imputation of pride, I will venture, while I put my self on the side which you say I reproach, to tell you, that I was once commonly taken to have as affectionate a tone of speech as ever you were, at the least: And I ever found that Matter and Affection together took best: But that warm Affection and fervent ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, with common and little matter, took more with the far greater part, than far more excellent matter delivered, with less fervour of affection. I have said as much against cold preaching as ever you have done at least: And I am as much against it as ever: And I am my self much helped in profiting by an affectionate delivery. But,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64624:115"/>
Brother, I take it for no pride to think that I have had more experience of mens cases than you have had; (If you have had no more Pastoral Charge than I suppose, and came but out of the University when I was ready to be turned off from mine.) And I must tell you that I have been oft sorry to see how the people have been moved (in Army and Countreys) to value a Quaker, a Seeker, an Antinomian, an Anabaptist, a Socinian that preach'd down the God-head of Christ; (And among the Orthodox, such ignorant ones as you know I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with;) meerly for the tone and fervency of their delivery. Scarce any thing hath more infected the injudicious with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
               <p>2. Or if you deny not that <hi>such a thing there is,</hi> then it is yet worse in you to feign this <hi>empty loudness,</hi> or <hi>affected fervency,</hi> to be the Preaching which God owneth to the Conversion of souls, Comparatively. This is to reproach the work of Preaching and Conversion, so ill do you avoid what you injuriously impute to others, when you cry out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [<hi>What could</hi> Parker, &amp;c. <hi>have spoken more reproachfully,</hi> &amp;c. Sure you thought I had spoken against <hi>fervent preaching</hi> it self, or else you would not have talk'd as you do? Here also (after some mention of my Pride and Folly) you adde two more gross Untruths. 1. That what I spake of <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual persons</hi> without respect to <hi>any party,</hi> Conformists, non-Conformists, or Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64624:116"/>
and instanced in many of my <hi>own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,</hi> some of which <hi>now Conform,</hi> yea are zealous Conformists, who were the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventest loudest Preachers that ever I knew in all my life: [<hi>If I will not tell you who they are,</hi> (alas man, did you never know such) you <hi>must think it concerns all that are at this day engaged in a Gospel separation.</hi>] <hi>Answ.</hi> Had you said [<hi>We will think so</hi>] it might<note place="margin">18 Untruth.</note> have been true: But, 1. I had made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all of <hi>separation</hi> in the whole <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> nor intended any more than I expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; But only meant to direct people to avoid that error in the choice of Teachers, which prepareth them for any seduction and division. 2. I had largely spoken there for affectionate Preaching. 3. I am not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with very many such as in <hi>England</hi> have been known by the name of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, that go no further; But those few that I do know, I take to be colder, duller Preachers, than those that are called Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians byfar, for the most part of them; so far was I from meaning them; But Quakers, and Fifth-Monarchy men, and some Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists I know, and many revilers of the Ministry I have known, in Armies and Countreys that were just such as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe. 2. It is an untruth that you had<note place="margin">19 Untruth.</note> no pretence of Reason for (that I can think of) that I [<hi>have left off the Lords work, and instead of helping it forwards with you, am weakening your hands, and disgracing the</hi>

                  <hi>builders.</hi>] If you mean that I preach not in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> no more do you: If you mean<note place="margin">Whether I have left off the Lords work.</note> that I have not a <hi>separated Church,</hi> I never had one (on your principles at least:) If you mean that I preach not in <hi>London,</hi> 1. I cannot if I would. 2. I never had any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal<note place="margin">Note how or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Christ himself and his Apostles avoided per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution by removing.</note> Charge, nor place in <hi>London,</hi> but preach'd one year up and down for others, and another year took but a voluntary Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. 3. <hi>London</hi> I was forced eight years ago to forsake for my health and life. 4. Gods work is not only in <hi>London.</hi> 5. I have no call thither, nor any people related to me as a Pastor there. 6. There are very many worthy men there that want both employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and maintenance, whom I will not injure. Are not all these reasons enough? But if you think otherwise, 7. Are not all the Preachers in <hi>England forsakers of Gods work</hi> that preach not in <hi>London?</hi> 8. I think you preached not for many years, when you lay so long in prison: Did you then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake Gods work?</p>
               <p>But I must confess, Brother, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been too slothful and unprofitable a servant, and still am: Yet I can say, that I know no other employment that I have, and that I spend no more time in other things than necessities of life require; I play away none, and I idle away but little; and <hi>preaching,</hi> were it oftner, is a small part of my work, and that will be proved to be the <hi>Lords</hi> work, which you think is against him, (as all have done that ever I wrote
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64624:117"/>
against almost.) And I love you much the better for being zealous for that which you do but think is the Lords work; But I am past doubt that it will prove at last, that such <hi>doctrines, passions,</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> as yours, will be the <hi>weakeners</hi> and <hi>hinderers</hi> of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>

Yea, or all they that did and said those contrary and confounding things in our late troubles, which must not to you be mentioned? Are you sure that none of all these were honest?

Health and Life are not to be avoided because most men have diseases and infirmities. Why did you not answer the proofs I gave you of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, Armenians, Greeks, and other Kingdoms that run together in an error?

Yet, saith this brother, <hi>This is strange counsel to them that have learned from Scripture, that every imagination is evil, &amp;c. So that we do not see if we will allow the spirit of God to be the best Counsellor, how we can speak bad enough of corrupted nature, as the nature of every man now is.</hi>]</p>

Your [<hi>not bad enough</hi>] is sure a <hi>hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole:</hi> For you can speak as bad as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth; And if that speak not <hi>bad enough,</hi> you accuse it of deficiency or error.</p>
               <p>2. But I suppose, you meant [<hi>not too bad.</hi>] What do you think then of such sayings as these following? If you speak truth, then, 1. Mans nature is not capable of grace, or of any amendment or renovation. 2. Nor is it capable mediately of Glory. 3. Mans nature is not Reasonable, nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or nobler than a bruit. 4. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not be good against murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any but a Saint, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Who so sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the Image of God made he man.</hi> 5. No man can grow worse than he is, if he never so much despise God and all his means of grace, and commit every day Adultery, Murder, Treason, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 6. Then there are no degrees of evil among natural men, nor is one any worse than another. 7. Then men on earth are as bad as those in hell, and as the Devils. 8. Yea, ten hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand times worse than Devils, and the damned; for so bad you can call them. 9. Then mans nature hateth good formally as good, and loveth evil formally as evil. 10. Then there are in mans nature no testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies for a deity, or the immortality of<note place="margin">See <hi>Act.</hi> 17. and 14. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, and 2.</note> the soul, nor no conscience of good or evil, nor no principles or dispositions to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64624:126"/>
honesty or civility; or else all these are bad. 11. Then no wicked man is cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, as sinning against any such innate Light, Law, or Principles. 12. Then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men are as much void of power to read, consider, or do any good at all, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear any sin at all, even hourly murder, thest, perjury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a stone is void of power to speak or to ascend. And so that all such that are damned, are damned for not doing that which they had no more power to do, and for not forbearing that which they had no more power to forbear than a stone to speak. Or else that all such power it self is evil. 13. Then it may be said, that there is nothing in all the nature of man which is the work of God; or else that Gods work it self as well as mans is evil. That man is not a man, or else it is evil to be a man. 14. Then there is nothing in mans nature that God can in any kind or measure Love; or else that God loveth that which is evil, even with complacence. 15. Then there is nothing in mans nature which we should love in one another; and no man is bound to love, yea, every man is bound perfectly to hate all that are not Saints; or else we must not perfectly hate, but love that which is perfectly evil. 16. Then no man should love his children or friends, for any thing in them till they have grace. 17. Then no natural man should love himself: Or else goodness is not the proper object of rational love. 18. Then
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64624:127"/>
if every man be armed with utmost malice against others, and persecute and destroy them, imprison, torment, murder all good men, yea Kingdoms, if he were able, it would be but that which we are naturally no more able to forbear, than the fire to burn, or a stone to be heavy. 19. Then see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man ought to look upon every natural man as perfectly evil, and a perfect enemy to all mankind, if they all murder one another, it is but the destroying of such as have no good, either natural or moral, and so are far worse than toads or serpents. 20. Then every natural man hath no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son saving only Gods command, (which it is impossible for him to obey) to forbear the murdering of himself or his children, any more than others. 21.

And he concludeth with an invitation of me, [<hi>to a second and more seasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I heartily thank you for your pity, and for any zeal of God, though it be not according to knowledg; And for my retractation, I suppose you would have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it a <hi>third.</hi> You quarrelled not with my suspension of my Aphorisms of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And for my retractation of my Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Aphorisms, I have no more to say to you and others of your mind, but that you would better consult your own peace and other mens, and your innocency too, if you would meddle with your own matters, or with that only which concerneth you.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, 1. I unfeignedly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you all the revilings and other injuries of this your Book.</p>
               <p>2. I intreat you to review what is against God and his Church, against Faith, Love, and Peace, and to repent of it in time.</p>
               <p>3. I beseech you to give over this perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious flattery of Professors, and daubing over their ignorance, injudiciousness, pride, and divisions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:64624:133"/>4. I intreat you to be more impartial to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dissenters, and let not your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be blinded by your passions.</p>
               <p>5. To help you to impartiality, I beseech you consider how you tempt the Bishops to think it no harm, to silence men that <hi>bold and do such</hi> things as you have vented and done in this book.</p>
               <p>6. I beseech you to that end, better to <hi>study your self,</hi> and to know what manner of spirit you are of. Besides all the <hi>intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Untruths, here are 30 or 31 gross Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths in matter of fact which I have set before you. For my self, it is not the least part of my Non-conformity, That I dare not lie, by publick Declaration to say, I <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and Consent</hi> where I do not. Now shall a man aggravate the crime of such things as these, and yet do what <hi>you do himself?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. I do solemnly profess to you, that I feel no malice against you, much less a desire of your hurt in all this that I say which is against your Judgment, but an unfeigned love to you, and tenderness of your person.</p>
               <p>8. Lastly, I again protest against the injustice of any one that shall charge your <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Miscarriages</hi> on the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists; when I know not two Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians or meer Independants of your mind; though too many so called in <hi>England,</hi> have enclined to unjust separations. And we are no more concerned in the opinions of them that are not Protestants, though they also go under the name of Non-conformists,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64624:133"/>
than in the opinions of the Papists, who are called Recusants.</p>
               <p>And to Conclude, I assure you, that if you write any more at the rates as you have done in this Antidote, I shall give you the last word, as not intending to confute you, if you shall maintain that Light is darkness; nor plead any more a cause against you, which needeth not much argumentation as to sober judgements, but as to interests, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and byassed wills, which are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise moved than by truth and reason, and have but one eare; And I fear not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you before-hand by telling you, that you shall see that I have somewhat else to do. For it is a truth that I tell you with grief, that he that will take out of your book, 1. All the false doctrines. 2. All the gross untruths. 3. And all the impotent revilings, together with the professed end or design, to undeceive them that have a good opinion of me; will leave so little, as may contained in a very narrow room. And he that seeketh in it for any thing that savoureth much of Judgement, Repentance, Love, Unity, or Peace, must have other eyes than mine, or be disappointed. And I wonder not at that, when the sound Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Love, Unity and Peace are the things that have cast you into this displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and which you write against. For where ever the Principles of Christian Love and Peace seem intolerable, there are such contrary principles as will bring forth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64624:134"/>
effects, which will prove indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable in the end.</p>
               <p>As there is nothing in this World which God doth design more gloriously to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and magnifie than his LOVE, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he so much obligeth mankind to, especially Believers, as the LOVE of Him and one another, so there is nothing which the great enemy of God and man doth so much hate, and seek to extinguish; fighting by many sorts of weapons neither against small nor great, in comparison of Divine and Christian LOVE. And his common way is to present the <hi>persons</hi> to us as <hi>UNLOVELY,</hi> or <hi>Odious,</hi> whom he would have us hate. And as their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant <hi>Carnality</hi> and <hi>Impiety</hi> doth give him full advantage with the ungodly, to make first that <hi>Holyness</hi> which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them odious, and consequently <hi>holy persons,</hi> and <hi>God himself;</hi> so with those that really Love God, the Tempter findeth this <hi>double</hi> advantage to make their brethren seem odious to them.</p>
               <p>1. The great <hi>weakness and error</hi> of their <hi>judgements,</hi> sometimes about the <hi>Things</hi> in difference, and sometimes about the <hi>Persons</hi> through <hi>unacquaintedness;</hi> whereby, either through mistake of the <hi>Cause</hi> or of the <hi>Man,</hi> they easily deny or extenuate all the <hi>amiable Goodness</hi> which is in him, and think that the Love of God, and of Truth and Godliness obligeth them to <hi>hate</hi> their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a supposed enemie to both. And yet
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64624:134"/>
while they openly declare to the World, an <hi>Aversation</hi> and a <hi>want of Love,</hi> and a desire to make the person seem <hi>odious</hi> to others, by their obloquy, detraction and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting accusations they make themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all this is indeed no effect of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred or Malice,</hi> but of <hi>Love,</hi> because they can still say, that they desire unfeignedly that the man were of their <hi>mind and way,</hi> which they call a desiring of his Conversion and Conviction, and of his <hi>own</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> good. And thus not only the hereticks of his time, but the very Jews were <hi>Lovers</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of other Apostles: No doubt but they desired that which they thought was their Conversion and their <hi>good;</hi> And what hatred so great that may not have such a cover; not only a feigned pretence, but a real, though erroneous desire. <hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Bonner</hi> exprest the like, and no doubt, did really wish the Martyrs had been of their mind; And no doubt, but many that wish'd this, thought they wish'd but the <hi>persons</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> good. The burning zeal which hath so much depopulated much of the World, was in many <hi>a zeal of God, though not according to knowledge.</hi> He that can transform himself into an Angel of <hi>Light,</hi> and his <hi>Ministers</hi> into <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>free Grace,</hi> no doubt, can teach them to <hi>persecute</hi> men in Love, and to <hi>excommunicate</hi> them in Love: To revile others in Love, to hinder the Preaching of the Gospel in Love, to afflict, or to <hi>Divide</hi> the Church in Love.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64624:135"/>
Alas, how much is the Serpent too subtile, for the understanding that trusteth to it self, and is not illuminated and guided by the spirit of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love:</hi> How easily can he hide from us, that in our brother which we should <hi>Love,</hi> and magnifie and multiply his faults into odious crimes, and transform his very virtues into vices, and his rightest judgement into errors. In this, brother, I thank God that my <hi>principles</hi> give me that advantage of you, that I think you not <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> but <hi>weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The other yet greater <hi>advantage</hi> that Satan findeth, to kill the Love of most, is SELFISHNESS; one <hi>selfish man</hi> thinks that he may well account him <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>odious,</hi> who is against his <hi>worldly wealth</hi> and <hi>honour:</hi> And another thinks him <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>odious,</hi> who is against his <hi>Learned</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious reputation,</hi> and would detect his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or vice. Another thinks him <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>odious,</hi> who is against his <hi>Opinions,</hi> and the <hi>words</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of worshipping God, which he is confident are best; And he that hath once suffered spiritual pride to extoll his own <hi>understanding</hi> and his <hi>piety,</hi> will make that so far the measure of his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, that all shall be thought so far to swerve from Truth and Godliness as they swerve from him. But if we should <hi>suffer much</hi> by others, and that for a cause which we take to be the cause of God, how easie is it for <hi>selfishness</hi> to stir up those <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> which shall blind our understandings,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64624:135"/>
so far as to see <hi>no good</hi> at all scarce in them that we suffer by, or to extenuate all that is Lovely in them; yea, to think hardly of almost <hi>all others</hi> of <hi>their judgement</hi> and <hi>party,</hi> for their sakes: And if we think we may once call them <hi>Persecutors,</hi> yea, or but such as <hi>Conform</hi> to the <hi>Persecutors waies,</hi> we think it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>THat the Excepter may yet further be convinced that it is not any Party of men called <hi>Independents</hi> or <hi>Anabaptists</hi> as such, that I here speak against; As I did in my opposed Book declare that I thought them both, and all others that hold the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and disclaim it not by Heresie, or wicked <hi>lives,</hi> to be such as the Churches should receive into their Communion; and that it is <hi>their</hi> duty to hold Communion in the same Assemblies, notwithstanding their difference; and that it is not the Opinions which <hi>denominate</hi> them, that I <hi>write against;</hi> but only the <hi>Love-killing</hi> and <hi>Dividing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> which are among them, which make them fly with censure and alienation from their brethren that are as meet for Church-Communion as they; and oft break them into pieces among themselves; so do I yet again here declare the same; And not only so, but that if it were in my power, when their Communion with others cannot be procured, they should yet be <hi>tolerated</hi> in their <hi>separation it self,</hi> and enjoy Communion with themselves alone, in their separated Congregations, under the Laws of Peace, being not tolerated to turn their preaching or worship into a reviling and reproaching of the Orthodox, to the destruction of Christian Love: And I should not doubt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64624:137"/>
but the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Orthodox Churches</hi> maintained in <hi>Constant Synods,</hi> together with the <hi>special Countenance</hi> of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magistrate, and the <hi>daily experience</hi> of Believers (which would still make the aged sort forsake them) would suffice better than violent severities to repress the evil, and to give victorious Truth opportunity to do its proper work.</p>
               <p>And to silence this calumny yet more, I do renew the Profession which I have often published, that my own opinion is so much for Independency, as that I think, no Church is made, by God, to be a Ruler to other Churches, under the name of a Mother Church, or a Metropolitane, or Patriarchal, but that all these are humane forms; And that <hi>Councils are not the proper Governours of the particular Pastors; but are for Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Pastors and Churches directly,</hi> by way of Consultation, Consent and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; (As I have heretofore declared, that Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> professed his judgement to me.)</p>
               <p>Though I confess that the <hi>Pastors</hi> in Council are still the Guides of the <hi>people,</hi> as well as singly at home, and by their <hi>Consent</hi> lay a <hi>stronger governing obligation on them;</hi> And that the <hi>General Law</hi> of <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> doth <hi>consequently</hi> bind the <hi>several Pastors,</hi> to concurr in all things Lawful, (<hi>Consideratis considerandis</hi>) with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenting Churches.</p>

               <p>And for further silencing the calumny,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64624:138"/>
let it be noted, that the Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> are commonly called, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or Congregational, and yet they are against <hi>Separation,</hi> and do find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that <hi>Separation</hi> is as perillous a thing to <hi>Independent</hi> free Churches, as it is to <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesane Churches,</hi> and somewhat more, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they use not outward force to preserve their Unity, and because one single Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is sooner dissolved by division than such a thing as a <hi>Diocesane Church</hi> is. And therefore no men should be more willing to suppress Dividing Principles and Passions than the Independents, both because they are most charged with them, and with all our Sects and Confusio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And that the <hi>New England</hi> Churches are against the Separation which hath been commonly known by the name of <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,</hi> I will give you these following evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>
               <p>1.

               <p>But the fullest evidence is the work of the <hi>New-England</hi> Synod, 1662. who determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of two great points of Church-practice, so as greatly tendeth to reconcile them to all the moderate Presbyterians, and other peaceable Christians.

                  <hi>That Members of the visible Church according to Scripture, are confederate visible believers, in particular Churches, and their Infant-seed; that is, Children in minority, whose next Parents, one or both, are in Covenant.</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>The Case of Christians that are of no particular Church is not here medled with). 3. And that [<hi>The Infant-seed of such when grown up, are personally under the Watch, Discipline, and</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:64624:140"/>
                  <hi>Government of the Church</hi>]. 4. <hi>That these adult persons are not to be admitted to full Communion, meerly because they are and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue members, without such further qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations as the Word of God requireth thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> 5. <hi>That Church-Members who were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in minority, understanding the doctrine of Faith, and publickly professing their Assent thereto, not scandalous in life, and solemnly owning the Covenant before the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they give up themselves and their Children to the Lord, and subject themselves to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christ in his Church, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are to be baptised.</hi>]</p>
               <p>As to the points themselves, having written a Treatise on the subject, (under the name of <hi>Confirmation</hi>) and therein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly shewed my Opinion in reconciling terms, (though it may <hi>seem</hi> stricter than these propositions, and more inclining to the dissenters in some things) I shall say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it here. But by this it is visible, that the <hi>New-England</hi> Synod do not only exclude the practice of Gathering Churches out of Churches (which was the great contest in <hi>England</hi> between the Assembly and the Congregational party); but they provide that not so much as any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons that were Baptized in their Churches in Infancy, shall be made Church-members <hi>de novo</hi> (unless by removing from one Church to another), but shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted members till they apostatize noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously or are Excommunicated: And so
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64624:140"/>
shall their children after them succeed by the way of Baptism into the Church, and they will have no other ordinary Church-door but Baptism. And so gathering Churches of Baptized persons will cease, unless it be in a ravelled state, when the old Churches being dissolved, believers are to embody themselves anew. And Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi> and a few more, seeing that by this way their Churches would fall into the way of <hi>England</hi> and other Churches, by a succession of Members growing up from Infancy (and not by making them up of <hi>new Adult enterers,</hi> as the Anabaptists do,) did oppose himself by writing against the Synod, which by some of them is largely Answered: Wherein they tell us that there were <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and de convincingly manifest irregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>] They prudently tell us, p. 45. that [<hi>The Lord hath not set up Churches only that a few old Christians may keep one another warm while they live, and then carry away the Church into the cold Grave with them when they die; but that they might with all care and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages nurse up still successively another genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of subjects to Christ,</hi> &amp;c.] And that [<hi>We may be very injurious to Christ as well as to the souls of men, by too much straitening and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing the bounds of his Kingdom, or visible Church on earth.</hi>] Citing <hi>Paraeus,</hi> (in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.) saying, [<hi>In Church-Reformation it is an observable truth, that those that are for too much strictness, do more hurt than profit the Church.</hi>] Abundance more to the same purpose I might collect.</p>
               <p>And seeing they take children growing up, to be members under Church-discipline according to their Capacities, Let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered soberly, whether this doth not inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to us, that Discipline it self must not be exercised with the hurtful rigor that some expect? For I would intreat the ridgeder sort, if they are Parents, but to tell me, at what age, and for what faults, and for want of Grace, they would have their own children excommunicated? And when they have done, whether they will also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a Family Excommunication of them for the same causes?</p>
               <p>They adde a sixth <hi>Prop.</hi> for the <hi>Baptizing of the Children of those that by death or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And they adde a seventh Propos. that [<hi>The Members of Orthodox Churches being sound in the faith, and not scandalous in life, and presenting due testimony thereof; these oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally coming from one Church to another, may have their children baptized in the Church whither they come, by virtue of Communion of Churches; But if they remove their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they ought orderly to covenant and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themselves to the Government of Christ, in his Church where they settle their abode, and so their children to be baptized: It being the Churches duty to receive such to Communion, so far as they are regularly capable of the same.</hi>]</p>
               <p>So that they provide for the reception of all meet persons. But the chief thing observable is that in <hi>Propos.</hi> 5. Where the Qualifications or Description of a just en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titleing Profession is laid down, as consisting in no more than these four things, 1. <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> the doctrine of <hi>Faith.</hi> 2. <hi>The publick Profession</hi> of <hi>Assent thereto.</hi> 3.

how they were converted; nor what further signs of it they can shew.</p>
               <p>And, for my own part, I never dissented from those called Congregational, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the two great points from which their Churches are denominated, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That regularly they should consist but of so many as are capable of Personal Communion, which they call a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. 2. And that this Congregation is not <hi>jure Divino</hi> under the spiritual Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any superior Church, as <hi>Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litane, Patriarchal,</hi> &amp;c. But my chief dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from them hath been, in their going <hi>beyond Independency,</hi> and too many of them coming too neer to <hi>Separation,</hi> 1. By ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king other tearms of mens title to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member-ship, than these here recited by the <hi>New-England</hi> Synod, and then the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, sober profession of Assent and Consent to the Baptismal Covenant is. 2. And for their gathering new Churches in the several Parishes, as if there had been no Churches there before, and the members not gathered by them, were not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of any Church-Discipline; neither the Children nor Adult.</p>
               <p>And the reasons why I have ever dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them in these points, have been these.</p>
               <p>1. Because I find that the contrary was the way of Scripture-times and all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. And that the Apostles still received members, upon a sudden and bare profession
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64624:142"/>
of belief and consent to the Baptismal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, with the penitent renunciation of the Flesh, the World, and the Devil. And all Ages since have held this course, and made Baptisme the Church-door.</p>
               <p>But I shall heartily joyn with any Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that will endeavour herein to save the Church, from that state of <hi>Imagery</hi> and dead <hi>Formality,</hi> which Papists and all Carnal Hypocrites have mortified Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and unspeakably injured the Churches by, and are still working every ordinance of God that way: All good men should labour to recover Religion and Christian profession to an <hi>understanding seriousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will here insert the words of a most Learned and High Prelatist, to shew you that whoever is against this Course in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, no sober men can deny it in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: <hi>Eldersfield</hi> of <hi>Bapt.</hi> pag. 48. marg. [<hi>Upon score of like reason whereto, and for such after-tryal, may have been taken up in the Christian Church that examination which did sift the Constancy or rather Consistency of those that had been taken in young, to their presumed grounds, that if they wavered, they might be known and discharged; Or if they remained constant, they might by Imposition of hands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what the common name of that Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did import, of their Faith (at least a sign of) Confirmation:</hi> Vasques <hi>hath from</hi> Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus <hi>(in the Preface to his Paraphrase on the Gospels) a word of most wholsome, grave, and</hi>

Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> words I have reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after my Treat. of Confirmation; They
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64624:143"/>
are very worthy of consideration. But to leave this digression,</p>
               <p>2. My second reason why I dissent from them that will have other Tearms of Church-entrance than Baptisme, and a stricter exaction of a Title to member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship than a professed Affent and Consent to the tearms of that Covenant; is because, if in our very Church-title and Constitution we forsake the Scriptural and primitive tearms, we are liable to the exceptions of all dissenters, and cannot justifie our selves against their accusations; nor well answer them that say, It is long of us, and not of them, that they communicate not with us.</p>
               <p>3. Because we shall unavoidably injure many of Christs members, and keep those out whom he will own, and would have us own; to the great injury of him and them.</p>
               <p>4. Because we shall lessen and weaken the Church of Christ, which is already so small, and so be injurious to it.</p>
               <p>5. Because we shall be alwaies at uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, on what tearms to go: For if once we leave Gods prescribed tearms, we shall never know where to fix: But every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor will examine as he please, and form such Covenant-tearms as are agreeable to the measure of his own private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Charity: And even among Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational men, we see already that the tearms of mens Titles do vary, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64624:144"/>
(or Congregations) differ in point of strictness.</p>
               <p>6. And this layeth a certain foundation for perpetual dissentions and divisions; when there are no certain tearms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: And there is no Union when we depart from Christs authority. And it is not in vain that Christ himself prescribed a form of Baptizing; And if all his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches since the Apostles daies, have brought us down that Creed or those Articles of Faith, and form of Baptizing used univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally among them, New waies, and various waies, (even as various as mens degrees of prudence and charity) will never be the tearms of the Churches Unity.</p>
               <p>7. And I am very much the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd against this extream by my long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Having made it much of my work to know the minds and lives of all the people of the great Parish where I lived, and since that, having conversed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the inferior rank, both for estate, and profession of piety, I have found that there is much more good in a great number of those, that are not noted openly for spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Professors of Religiousness, than I did before believe. For no man is usually noted now for Religious, in this stricter sense, 1. Whose knowledge hath not some readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of expression, in conference, and in prayer. 2. And who doth not come to private meetings, and associate himself with the stricter and forwarder sort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64624:144"/>
But there are abundance of things which may hinder some serious weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians from both these. Dulness of natural parts, and want of good education, and use, and teaching, and company, may keep mens parts and utterance very low. And some young Christians for want of former use, at their first true Conversion, cannot speak sense, in the very fundamentals, which yet they have a saving sense and knowledge of, (but are like Infants,) and their prayers have little better expressions, than <hi>Abba</hi> Father, and the unutterable groans of the spirit.</p>
               <p>And some never had the opportunity of profitable company; And some are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from such converse by bashfulness; And some by poverty and business, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; And some by the restraint of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Husbands, Masters, &amp;c. And some by ill company, and scandall, may have a prejudice against those Religious people who are neerest to them; who yet may be real lovers of Christ. Having found in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny called common people more knowledge (though not beter utterance) than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and more trust in Christ, and more desire to be better, and love to those that are better, and more willingness to be taught (crowding in publick or private when they have a full opportunity, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately hearing the closest preaching,) I am grown the more fearful of wronging Christ, his Church and them, by number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64624:145"/>
such with those that are without, when they are Baptized persons, that never were proved to have apostatized, nor to have lived impenitently in any sin so gross, as the back-bitings, proud-censoriousness and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of too many Religiouser people are.</p>
               <p>8. To which may be added the sad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of this age of the dreadful mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of the more noted sort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, turning Infidels, Ranters, Quakers, Socinians, Antinomians, and too many scandalous in life; and such as have destroyed Order, Government, Unity, &amp; Reformation, when there was scarce an enemie able to hurt it much besides themselves: Which is no dishonour to the Profession of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, much less to Christ and Holyness it self; But it seemeth to me a notable rebuke of our common over-valuing the meer <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>utterance,</hi> and <hi>extemporate</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the people, and of Ministers flattering such Professors, and over-looking all of Christ which is in many, that have had no such helps for gifts and utterance as they.</p>
               <p>2. The second Point in which the <hi>New-England</hi> Synod agreed was, the stated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation of Churches, and use of Synods, And herein, saith the Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 99. there appeared no Dissent or dissatisfaction in the Synod. Where they adde also (as to the point of Separation,) [<hi>We never said nor thought, that there should be a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:64624:145"/>
                  <hi>from other Churches upon differences, errors or offences of an inferiour and dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, yea, though continued in: We are far enough from hastyness or harshness in that matter, being professed adversaries to a spirit of sinful and rigid separation.</hi>]</p>
               <p>And that Apostolical man Mr. <hi>Iohn Eliot,</hi> hath printed a draught for stated Synods, (for Counsel and Concord, which is their proper use,) which will go far enough to satisfie moderate men in that point, and saith more for such Synods than ever I said.</p>
               <p>2. Having said thus much of the <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Congregational men in</hi> New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>against Separation,</hi> I shall adde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the second Assertion, <hi>That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the Congregational Party, as much in point of Interest, to be against it, as any sort of men whatsoever.</hi> 1. Because their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have no other bond of Concord (here) but voluntary Consent; And if that break, they are dissolved. 2. Because their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers being usually neither, so <hi>low</hi> as to be <hi>ignorant</hi> of matters of Controversie, nor so <hi>high</hi> as to be able solidly to <hi>Resolve</hi> them, are most like to be quarrelsome, and fall into divisions. And honest people that have a zeal of God, and for Truth and Unity, and not knowledge enough to guide it steadily, are likey to contend and trouble one another, than either they that are more careless, and have less <hi>zeal,</hi> (and therefore like swine will leave such pearls to any that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64624:146"/>
will take them up,) or they that have sound <hi>knowledge</hi> to guide their zeal. 3. And the power which too many of them give the people, over the Pastors and themselves, will do much to increase these divisions, and cause their dissolution.</p>
               <p>And that this is the sense of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> appeareth, 1. In their banishing <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> first, and the two <hi>Brownes</hi> after, lest they should be divided about the Prelacy and Liturgie. 2. By their common judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against dangerous Toleration. 3. By the History of Mrs. <hi>Hutchinsons</hi> business in Sir <hi>Henry Uane</hi>'s daies. 4.

                  <hi>in one years time filled that place with princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of rigid Separation, and tending to Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistry; the prudent Magistrates of the</hi> Massachusets <hi>jurisdiction, sent to the Church of</hi> Salem, <hi>desiring them to forbear calling him to Office; which they not hearkening to, was a cause of much disturbance.—He being in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, proceeded more vigorously to vent many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Opinions, as,</hi> That it is not lawful <hi>for an Unregenerate man to pray; nor to take an Oath; and in special, not the Oath of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the Civil Government; Nor was it lawful for a godly man to have Communion, either in Family-Prayer, or in an Oath, with such as they judged unregenerate. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he himself refused the Oath of Fidelity, and taught others so to do. Also that it was not lawful so much as to hear the godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of</hi> England, <hi>when any occasionally went thither; and therefore he admonished any Church-members that had done so, as of hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous sin. Also he spake dangerous words against the Patent which was the foundation of the Government of the</hi> Massachusets <hi>Colony. Also he affirmed that the Magistrate had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in matters of the First Table, but only the Second: And that there should be a general and unlimited Toleration of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions: And for any man to be punished for any matters of his Conscience, was Persecution.—Staying at home in his own house, he sent a Letter, which was read in the publick Church-Assembly, to give them notice, That if</hi> the Church of Salem <hi>would not separate, not only</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:64624:147"/>
                  <hi>from the Churches of</hi> England, <hi>but the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of</hi> New-England <hi>too, he would separate from them. The more prudent and sober part of the Church being amazed at his way, could not yield to him: Whereupon he never came to the Church-Assembly more, professing separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from them as Antichristian: And not only so, but he withdrew all private Religious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from any that would hold Communion with the Church there. Insomuch as that he would not pray, nor give thanks at meals with his own Wife, nor any of his Family, because they went to the Church-Assemblies. Divers of the weaker sort of the Church-members, that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Had not this man brought the Catholick-Church into a little room.</note> 
                  <hi>had been throughly levened with his Opinions, of which number were divers Women that were zealous in their way, did by degrees fall off to him: Insomuch as that he kept a Meeting in his own house, unto which a numerous company did resort, both on the Sabbath day and at other times, by way of</hi> Separation <hi>from, and opposition to the Church-Assembly there: Which the prudent Magistrates understanding, and seeing things grow more and more towards a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral division and disturbance; after all other means used in vain, they passed a Sentence of Banishment against him, out of the</hi> Massachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets <hi>Colony, as against a disturber of the Peace of the Church and Commonwealth. After which Mr.</hi> Williams <hi>sate down in a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Providence—<hi>and was followed by many of the Members of the Church of</hi> Salem, <hi>who did zealously adhere to him, and cryed out of the Persecution that was against him: Some others</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:64624:147"/>
                  <hi>also resorted to him from other parts. They had not been there long together, but from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Separation they fell to Anabaptistry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Baptism which they had received in their Infancy, and taking up another Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and so began a Church in that way. But Mr.</hi> Williams <hi>stopped not there long; For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some time he told the people that had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that he was out of the way himself, and had misled them; For he did not find that there was any upon earth, that could administer Baptisme, and therefore their last Baptisme was a nullity as well as their first: And therefore they must lay down all, and wait for the coming of new Apostles: And so they dissolved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and turned</hi> Seekers; <hi>keeping that one Principle, That every one should have liberty to worship God, according to the light of their own Consciences; but otherwise not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Churches or Ordinances of God, any where upon earth.</hi>] So far the History.</p>
               <p>To which I adde, that this man was one of the great instruments after all this, of sublimating the English Separation to the same height, and gratifying the Papists by raising up the sect of <hi>Seekers,</hi> who said, that both Scripture, Ministry, Church and Ordinances were lost. And had they not now broken the Church sufficiently, and made it <hi>small enough,</hi> when they had made it <hi>none?</hi>

               <p>From all which I gather, that it is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the Congregational Churches themselves, as much as of any others, to joyn with us for the Principles of Christian Love, forbearance and Unity; and against the Principles of alienation and division: which is all that I am driving at.</p>

Rogers,</hi> &amp;c. would not write so earnestly to men to come to the beginning, and prefer it before all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate duties: And <hi>Perkins</hi> was for kneeling at the Sacrament: And Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor in his Letters writes for Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating kneeling at the Sacrament, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth the objections.</p>
               <p>But though I write this to give them the due honour of their moderation and sober judgement, yet not as making them or any men our Rule, in faith or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Therefore the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> reprove not separation from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer Church, though they would have none separate among themselves, because there is no just Cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The former answer may serve to make it probable, that they would joyn with them as Churches, in case they had not better to joyn with on lawful tearms. 2. And their own expressions signifie that they take the English Parishes that have godly Ministers, for true Churches, though faulty. 3. And those that I now write for cannot forget, that they gathered their Churches by separation out of our Parish-Churches, when there was no Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer nor Ceremonies used, nor any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in worship found among us, that I
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64624:150"/>
know of; And that in <hi>New-England</hi> it self, the Principles which I deny, do too of procure separation from those Churches, that have nothing which moderation and peaceableness will think a sufficient cause of such disjunction.</p>
               <p>4. And it is well known that the name of a <hi>Separatist</hi> and <hi>Brownist</hi> was first taken up here in <hi>England,</hi> with relation to these Parish-Churches where they had the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and Ceremonies as now. Therefore they would speak equivocally in disclaiming <hi>Separatists</hi> and <hi>Brownists,</hi> if they meant not such as the word is first and commonly used to signifie. 5. And if that were not the sense, a Separatist might be said to be against Separation as well as they in <hi>New-England.</hi> For <hi>Canne</hi> or <hi>Iohnson</hi> would be against separating from their own Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or from any which they judged as fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. 6. It was the Parish-Churches that had the Liturgie, and were accused to have 91 <hi>Antichristian</hi> Errors (in them and the Church of <hi>England</hi> which they belonged to) which Mr. <hi>H. Iacob</hi> the Father of the Congregational Party, wrote for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with against <hi>Francis Iohnson,</hi> and in respect to which he called those Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists against whom he wrote; The same I may say of Mr. <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> and other <hi>non-Conformists,</hi> whom the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational brethren think were favourable to their way. And if the old <hi>Independents</hi> (as well as the rest of the <hi>non-Conformists</hi>) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64624:150"/>
them <hi>Culpable Separatists</hi> that then wrote for separation from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-Churches</hi> (for <hi>Diocesane Churches</hi> I I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> meddle not with,) then we have small reason to think that those <hi>New-England</hi> Brethren that disclaim the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists, were of the mind of these Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists themselves, or that they differed from the <hi>old Independents</hi> herein, when they seem rather to be of such healing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and temper towards the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, (as in my opinion) they have in their Synodical Conclusions made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p almost all the breach: And therefore are not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted more for separation than the old Congregational Divines.</p>
               <p>And that you may see that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of <hi>New-England</hi> are of the mind of their Pastors in the Synod, and take <hi>the youth to be under the Ministers Charge,</hi> or at least that I may hereby express my gladness for this work of their great prudence and Christian zeal, and call those my brethren of the Ministry to Repentance, who did neglect this work of personal Instruction, while we had liberty to exercise the Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral office; and also that I may yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them that are silenced, what abundance of good the Law yet alloweth them to do, by this course of going from house to house, and of Catechizing the youth, (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are restrained to no members un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 16 years of age,) I say for these reasons, I shall give you as my Conclusion, the Order

            <p>WHereas we find in the Examples of holy Scripture, that Magistrates have not only excited and commanded all the people under their Government, <hi>to seek the Lord God of their Fathers, and do the Law and Commandment,</hi> 2 Cro. 14. 2, 3, 4. Ezra, 7. 25, 26, 27. but also stirred up and sent forth the Levites, accompanied with other principal men, <hi>to teach the good know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord throughout all the Cities of Iudah,</hi> 2. Chron. 17. 6, 7, 8, 9. which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours have been crowned with Gods blessing.</p>
            <p>Also we find that our Brethren of the Congregational Perswasion in <hi>England</hi> have made a good Profession, in their Book, entituled, <hi>A Declaration of their Faith and Order,</hi> Pag. 59. Sect. 14. where they say, <hi>That although Pastors and Teachers stand especially related unto their particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; yet they ought not to neglect others living</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:64624:152"/>
               <hi>within their Parochial Bounds, but besides their constant publick Preaching to them, they ought to enquire after their profiting by the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing them in, and pressing upon them (whether young or old) the great Doctrines of the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even personally and particularly, so far as their strength and time will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We hope that sundry of you need not a spur in these things, but are consciously careful to do your duty: yet forasmuch as we have cause to fear, that there is too much neglect in many places, notwithstanding the Laws long since provided therein; We therefore think it our duty to emit this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration unto you, earnestly desiring, and in the bowels of our Lord Jesus requiring you to be very diligent and careful to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techize and Instruct all the people (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Youth) under your Charge, in the Sound and Orthodox Principles of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion; and that not only in publick, but privately from house to house, as blessed <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 20. or at least three, four, or more Families meeting together, as strength and time may permit, taking to your assistance such godly and grave persons as to you may seem most expedient. And also that you labour to inform your selves, (as much as may be meet) how your Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do profit by the Word of God, and how their Conversations do agree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and whether the Youth are taught to read the <hi>English</hi> Tongue: taking all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions

to apply suitable <hi>Exhortations</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly unto them, for the rebuke of those that do evil, and for the encouragement of them that do well.</p>
            <p>The effectual and constant prosecution hereof, we hope will have a tendency to promote the Salvation of Souls, To suppress the growth of Sin and Prophaneness, To beget more Love and Unity amongst the people, and more Reverence and Esteem of the Ministry, and will assuredly be to the enlargement of your Crown and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in Eternal Glory.</p>
