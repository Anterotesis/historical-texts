         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>There are fiue ſorts of eares that are not hearing eares. The firſt, is a dull Eare, when a man is either

            <p>The ſecond, is a ſtopped Eare, as <hi>the Serpent ſtoppeth his eare againſt the voyce of the Charmer.</hi> Such are our Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, and ſecure Perſons, that will not heare, leſt they ſhould bee thawed from their dregs, and ſo conuerted and ſaued.</p>
            <p>The third, is a preiudiciall or ſiniſter Eare: this man like <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 10.</note>
               <hi>Malchus</hi> hath loſt his right Eare, and hee comes as the Phariſee to Chriſt, to tempt the Miniſter, to catch him in his talke, turning all his ſpeech to the worſt, becauſe hee hates or deſpiſeth the perſon of the Preacher. This man is like the Spider that ſucketh poyſon out of the ſweeteſt flowers.</p>

            <p>The fift, is an adulterous Eare, that will heare any but the voice of their owne Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds. You ſhall know them as the Harlot is knowne, they are euer gadding to ſeeke their new Louers: but God ſhall one day diſcouer their adultery to the ſhame of their

And for their better direction in this dutie, this preſent Tract is of excellent vſe, being plain and familiar for the manner, and ſound for the matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded vpon many excellent exhortations, and rules in the Holy Scripture: whereby men may know how to heare with glorie vnto God, honour vnto his Ordinance, and profit vnto their owne ſoules.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, Wherein (which may be a fourth reaſon) wee are to bee the more vigilant, becauſe Satan like a rauening Fowle followeth vs ſore at the heeles, &amp;c.

               <hi>An.</hi> A partiall, or rather ſchiſmaticall reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23628:16"/>
ſuch as was in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3, 4</note>ſom extolled one, &amp; ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſome <hi>Paul,</hi> ſome <hi>Apollos?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Whence proceedeth this reſpect of perſons?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> It proceedeth origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from the hearers, either from the ignorance of their mindes; or from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their hearts; and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally from the Teachers, in reſpect of the diuerſitie of their gifts, and manner of handling of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> How are men hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their owne ignorance, and corruption?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> When for want of Iudgement and Sanctimonie, they preferre ſuch as ſpeake pleaſing things, and tickle their eares with Eloquent tearmes, pleaſant ſtories, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23628:17"/>
wittie Ieſts, and cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with thoſe that ſpeake the words of truth and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſſe, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 26. <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 1.</note>and the things as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, that become <hi>wholſome doctrine.</hi> Eſpecially, if they doe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and roundly lay their ſins <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 22 7, 8.</note>before them. Hence it was that <hi>Ahab</hi> could not endure <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25.</note>
               <hi>Michajah.</hi> This made <hi>Felix</hi> cut off <hi>Paul</hi> in the midſt of his ſpeech, and put him off till <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.</note>another time. Hence ſprang the Impriſonment of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> by <hi>Herod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What are the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt this hinderance?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> For a remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this euil we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Firſt, that ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall reſpect of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 4.</note>argueth a carnall, and a fleſhly minde, and ſheweth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23628:17"/>
that wee are Babes and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Chriſtianitie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That by this partialitie wee giue to man more then his due, and take from Chriſt that which of <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 12, 13. &amp; 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</note>right belongeth to him as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and vnequalitie of gifts is not giuen for the renting and deſtroying, but for the building, and the beautifying of the Church of Chriſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the diuerſitie, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of flowres in the ſame Garden differing in colour, ſmell, taſte and vertue, bring no confuſion nor deformitie: but doe decke the ground, and ſerue for the vſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of man: And the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold varietie of ſtrings and Inſtruments doe make the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23628:18"/>
ſweeteſt harmonie.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Remember that no Miniſter excelleth in all gifts: and yet no true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter but hath ſome ſpeciall gifts and graces of edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. One is more profound in knowledge to informe the iudgement: another more powerfull in vtterance, for the inflaming of the affection: one is more fit to humble, and beate downe the proud, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and conceited perſons; another to comfort and raiſe vp penitent ſinners: one hath a ſpeciall grace to worke god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow, another to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <note place="margin">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 16 17, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16</p>
               </note> ſupernaturall comfort and ioy.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Remember that the contempt of any true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is the contempt of God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:23628:18"/>
Sixtly, Let it bee kept in mind that Chriſtian Hearers looke rather to the pith, and ſubſtance of the matter, then to the enticements and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the ſpeech.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What is the fift hinderance to bee remooued before the Sermon?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The fift (which may be referred to the former) is a certayne hatred of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and loathing of the Miniſterie, ſuch as was in the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which made them to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 55, 57.</note>fret at Chriſt, and ſtop their eares againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whence ariſeth this hatred of the Miniſters, and Miniſterie?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Sometime from the perſonall behauiour of the Miniſter himſelfe, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly from the matter

which he deliuereth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Errors of their Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and corruptions of their hearts and liues, are laid open, and reprooued. This <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 22.</note>made <hi>Ahab</hi> to count <hi>Elias</hi> his Enemie, And to hate <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Let ſuch haters and deſpiſers of the Miniſterie conſider that,</p>

            <p>Secondly, They doe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preiudice themſelues, in <note place="margin">

               <hi>Saluation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is a point of godly wiſdome to diſtinguiſh betweene the perſons and the Offices, and not to depriue our ſelues of the fruit of the Word for the fault of the Teacher. In outward things men are wiſe: No man will refuſe a good Workman for ſome perſonall ſinnes. Hee that mindeth to build a houſe will not thinke the worſe of the Worke becauſe the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter is wicked, Hee that is hungry will not refuſe his meate, becauſe the Cooke that dreſſed it is a Drunkard:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23628:20"/>
why then ſhould we diſtaſte the food of our ſoules by reaſon of the ſinnes of him that doth diſtribute it vnto vs? would any man refuſe the Princes gift, becauſe the Meſſenger that bringeth it is a Machiauillian, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What elſe maketh men lothe the Miniſterie?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Beſides that naturall corruption which is common to all, there is in many a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tietie, and fulneſſe, now (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>Hee that is full</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That rebukes and threatnings though they bee tedious to the fleſh, yet they are wholſome Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to the ſoule, and ſtrong defences againſt Satan, &amp;c.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23628:20"/>
And therefore they ſhould pray with <hi>Dauid, Let the</hi>

               <hi>Qu.</hi> What is the ſixt impediment to bee ſtriuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> The length of the way, fouleneſſe of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, weakneſſe in the parties, want of meanes to carrie them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue wee to ouercome theſe impediments?</p>
            <p>

            <p>Thirdly, The practice and examples of the godly in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times both of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:23628:21"/>
Fourthly, By compariſon; if men take ſuch Iournies, and make ſuch ventures, for their bodily prouiſion, How much more ought they to do for the good of their ſoules?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What ſay you to the aged, ſicke, and ſuch as haue young Children?</p>

            <p>Secondly, They muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour though they cannot goe all at once, nor euerie Lords Day, yet that they goe as oft as they can by turnes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one in his courſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they muſt be more carefull to aske queſtions, and to deſire repetition of the Sermon, of them that were there.</p>

For as a coloured glaſſe maketh all things of the ſame colour: ſo a preiudicate opinion maketh all things ſound that way that it ſelfe imagineth.

For there is nothing can bee ſo truly and <note place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, It is the will of God by this meanes to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs, and to abate the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious conceits of our owne will, and to ſtirre vp our dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Prayer, Meditation,

               <hi>An.</hi> Touching Prayer, it is one principall part of the worſhip of God in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Aſſemblies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot bee ſo deſpiſed without ſinne. Beſides, it is the exerciſe wherby al things are bleſſed and ſanctified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. Finally, how can wee receiue ſo great a bleſſing at Gods hands, and depart from his preſence without giuing of thankes?</p>

vndutifull, to ſtand before an earthly King as a dead I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and ſo ſoone as euer his ſpeech were ended, to turne thy backe vpon him without any Requeſt or Thankeſgiuing: How much more to deale thus with him that is, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords?</p>

            <p>
