            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>TO be Impugned from without, and Betrayed from within, is certainly the worst Condition that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Church <hi>or</hi> State <hi>can fall into; and the best of</hi> Churches, <hi>the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>has had experience of Both. It had been to be wished, and (one would think) might very reasonably have been expected, That, when</hi> Providence <hi>had took the Work of destroying the</hi> Church of England <hi>out of the</hi> Papists <hi>Hands, some would have been contented with her</hi> Preserments, <hi>without either attempting to give up her</hi> Rites <hi>and</hi> Liturgy, <hi>or deserting her</hi> Doctrine. <hi>But it has proved much otherwise. And amongst those, who are justly chargeable with the latter, I know none, who has</hi>
               <pb n="II" facs="tcp:101779:3"/>
               <hi>faced the</hi> World, <hi>and defied the</hi> Church <hi>with so bold a Front, as the</hi> Author <hi>of Two very</hi> Heterodox Books; <hi>the first Entituled,</hi> A Discourse concerning the Knowledge of Jesus Christ, <hi>&amp;c. Published in the Year,</hi> 1674. <hi>And the other,</hi> A Vindication of the Doctrine of the Holy and ever-Blessed Trinity, <hi>&amp;c. Published in the Year</hi> 1690. <hi>And (as one would think) Wrote purposely, to let the World see that the Truth cannot be so much shaken by a direct Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, as by a</hi> Treacherous, <hi>and</hi> False Defence. <hi>I shall in this</hi> Preliminary Address <hi>to the</hi> Reader, <hi>pass some brief Remarks upon both these</hi> Books. <hi>But first upon this, which I have here undertook to Animadvert upon. It is now of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Three Years standing in the World, and I have wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even to Astonishment, that a Book so full of</hi> Paradoxes, <hi>and those so positively, as well as absurdly delivered, could pass</hi> Unanswered <hi>for so long a time. For the</hi> Author, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therein advanced a Notion immediately and unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inferring</hi> Three Gods, <hi>has yet had the Confidence not only to Assert it, but to Declare it</hi> Heresie and Nonsence <hi>to think, or hold otherwise; that is, in other Words, to call the whole</hi> Christian Church, <hi>in all Ages and Places,</hi> Fools and Hereticks. <hi>For I do here averr, and will undertake to prove it, (as far as a Negative may be proved)</hi> That no Church <hi>(known to us by History, or otherwise)</hi> ever held this Notion of the Trinity before. <hi>And must we then be all</hi> Fools and Hereticks, <hi>who will not acknowledge the</hi> Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity to be Three distinct Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Minds, or Spirits, <hi>that is, in other Terms, to be</hi> Three Gods? <hi>And can so Learned, and every way Excellent a Clergy bear this? For if they could not, whence is it that some Writers amongst them, while they are declaring their dislike of his</hi> Opinions, <hi>yet do it with so soft an Air, and so gentle a Touch, as if they were afraid either to</hi> Condemn <hi>the</hi> Opinion, <hi>or to</hi> Attack <hi>the</hi> Author? <hi>Nay, and some I find</hi>

               <hi>creeping under his Feet with the Title of</hi> Very Reverend, <hi>while they are charging him with such</hi> Qualities <hi>and</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, <hi>as none can be, justly, chargeable with, and</hi> deserve Reverence <hi>too. For my own part, I franckly own, That I neither</hi> Reverence, <hi>nor</hi> Fear <hi>him; that is, I Reverence none, who gives whole</hi> Communities <hi>and</hi> Churches <hi>such Words, nor Fear any One, who Writes such Things, and in such a manner. For even those</hi> Mean Spirits, <hi>who can both</hi> Court, <hi>and</hi> Censure <hi>him in the same Breath, complain,</hi> That he gives no Quarter, <hi>where he supposes he has his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary upon the least Advantage. And if this be his Way and Temper</hi> never to give Quarter, <hi>I am sure he has no cause to expect any, whatsoever he may find. But still, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, I can hardly believe my Eyes, while I read such a</hi> Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit Novellist <hi>Charging the</hi> Whole Church <hi>as</hi> Fools and Hereticks, <hi>for not Subscribing to a</hi> Silly, Heretical No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>solely of his own</hi> Invention. <hi>For does he, or can he think to Live and Converse in the World upon these Terms? And to throw his</hi> Scurrility <hi>at</hi> High, <hi>and</hi> Low, <hi>at all</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>him,</hi> Above <hi>him, and</hi> Below <hi>him (if there be any such) at this insufferable rate? Does he, (I would fain know) in this speak his</hi> Judgment, <hi>or his</hi> Breeding? <hi>Was it the</hi> School, <hi>the</hi> University, <hi>or</hi> Gravel-Lane, <hi>that taught him this Language? Or does he never reflect upon himself, nor</hi>

One would think by his Words and Carriage that he had ingrossed all Reason and Learning to Himself: But on the contrary, that this his scornful looking down upon all the World besides, is not from his standing upon any higher ground of Learning, and Sufficiency, than the rest of the World; and that he</hi> Huffs <hi>and</hi> Dictates <hi>at a much more commanding rate than</hi>

               <hi>he</hi> Reasons, <hi>the perusal of my Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Chapters will, or (I am sure) may sufficiently inform the</hi> Impartial Reader; <hi>and shew him how many things there are in this Author's</hi> Vindication, <hi>which too much need Another, but admit none. In the mean time, I do, and must declare both to himself, and to all others, That the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Charge of</hi> Heresie <hi>and</hi> Nonsence <hi>(as he has laid it) is so very</hi> Rude, Scandalous, <hi>and</hi> Provoking, <hi>that it is impossible for the</hi> Tongue, <hi>or</hi> Pen <hi>of</hi> Man <hi>to reply any Thing so severely upon him, which the foulness of the said Expression will not abundantly warrant both the Speaking and the Writing of.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Church of England <hi>is certainly very Merciful;</hi>

               </note> Merciful <hi>(as a Great</hi> Judge <hi>once said of K.</hi> Charles II.) even to a Fault. <hi>For who, by her silence upon what this Bold Man has Wrote, and the Encouragement he has since received, would not be shrewdly induced after some consider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of Years (if his stuff should live so long) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that his Notions were the</hi> Current Doctrine <hi>of our</hi> Church, <hi>or, at least, of our</hi> Church-men <hi>at that time? None then opposing them, most over-looking them, and some countenancing and advancing the Author of them; and, perhaps,</hi> for them <hi>too. This is truly the Case; and I hope to do the</hi> Church of England <hi>so much Service at least, as to break the Universality both of the</hi> Silence, <hi>and the presumed</hi> Acceptance, <hi>by one plain, resolute and full</hi> Negative <hi>put in against it. For upon a due Consideration of the Things ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this</hi> Author, <hi>and comparing them with the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Zeal of the</hi> Primitive Church <hi>in its</hi> Councils, <hi>I do from my Heart believe, That had he lived and published this Book in those Days, and Asserted,</hi> That the Three Divine Persons in the Trinity were Three distinct Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Minds, or Spirits. <hi>And that</hi> Their Personal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction consisted only in Self-Consciousness, and their
<pb n="V" facs="tcp:101779:4"/>
Unity only in Mutual-Consciousness. <hi>And withal, That the Terms</hi> Essence, Nature, Substance, Person, <hi>and</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis, <hi>or</hi> Subsistence, <hi>&amp;c. applyed to the</hi> Godhead <hi>and the</hi> Divine Persons, <hi>served only to perplex, obscure, and confound Men's</hi> Apprehensions <hi>of them; and for that cause ought to be laid aside; I say, I do not in the least question, but that all and every one of these</hi> Propositions, <hi>would have been publickly and solemnly</hi> Condemned <hi>in</hi> Council, <hi>and the</hi> Author <hi>of them (as high as he now carries his Head, like another</hi> Abbot Joachim) <hi>severely dealt with for Asserting them; and that upon great Reason.

               <hi>Having given the</hi> Reader <hi>this short</hi> Prelibation, <hi>or</hi> Taste <hi>of the Book, which I shall more particularly and fully examine presently, I think fit to remark something also upon that other Piece mentioned by me, and Entituled,</hi> A Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse concerning the Knowledge of Jesus Christ, <hi>&amp;c. A Book fraught with such Vile and</hi> Scandalous Reflexions <hi>upon</hi> God's Justice, <hi>with reference to</hi> Christ's Satisfaction,
<pb n="IX" facs="tcp:101779:6"/>
               <hi>that it may deservedly pass for a</hi> Blasphemous Libel <hi>upon both. And I do seriously think, that never was any Book</hi> Licensed, Published, <hi>and suffered to pass</hi> Uncontrolled, <hi>more to the</hi> Disgrace <hi>of the</hi> Church of England <hi>than this, which the</hi> Reader <hi>will quickly see upon his Reading some Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of it; which, I am sure, if he be but</hi> Christianly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed, <hi>be cannot do, but with extreme Horrour. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I direct the</hi> Reader <hi>to his</hi> Blasphemies, <hi>I shall lay before him one Grand leading Absurdity, which utterly Evacuates and Overthrows the whole</hi> Doctrine <hi>of</hi> Free Grace, <hi>and the</hi> Redemption of Mankind thereby; <hi>and indeed, by Consequence, the whole</hi> Oeconomy <hi>of the</hi> Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it is that Wonderful Assertion concerning the</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, <hi>in Page</hi> 44. of his Knowledge of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is not possible to understand what Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is, without Pardoning Grace. <hi>Now certain it is, that</hi> Natural Reason, <hi>by its own light, is able from the</hi> Common Works <hi>of</hi> God's Providence, <hi>to collect</hi> the Knowledge of God's Goodness; <hi>as St.</hi> Paul <hi>expresly told those</hi> Heathens <hi>of</hi> Lycaonia, Acts 14. 17. <hi>and therefore, if the</hi> Knowledge <hi>of</hi> God's Goodness, <hi>necessarily implies in it, the</hi> Knowledge <hi>of</hi> Pardoning Grace, <hi>it will follow, That the</hi> Heathens <hi>by understanding</hi> one <hi>from the</hi> Works <hi>of</hi> Providence, <hi>must needs understand and know the</hi> other <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; and consequently, that the</hi> Knowledge <hi>of</hi> Pardoning Grace <hi>is not owing to</hi> Revelation, <hi>nor the</hi> Gospel <hi>necessary to make a Discovery of it to Mankind. A Blessed Principle, and Foundation, no doubt, to establish the New-designed Scheme of a</hi> Natural Religion <hi>upon! For it is not unknown, what Projects were on foot amongst some, when this Book was Wrote, though the</hi> Author <hi>had the ill luck to be left in the Lurch, and not seconded in the Attempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="X" facs="tcp:101779:7"/>
               <hi>But in opposition to this</hi> Paganish Assertion, <hi>I do here affirm,</hi> That if <hi>God</hi> may <hi>be Good,</hi> and that, both as to the <hi>Essential Attribute</hi> of his <hi>Goodness,</hi> and as to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Exercise of the same, without the <hi>Pardon of Sin,</hi> then it is not <hi>impossible to understand the</hi> Goodness of God, <hi>without</hi> Pardoning Grace. <hi>The Consequence is evident. For whatsoever any Thing</hi> is, <hi>it is capable of being</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be. <hi>And as for the Antecedent, that is manifest from these Considerations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>That</hi> God <hi>was</hi> Good, <hi>and exerted Acts of</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>before there was any</hi> Sin <hi>in the</hi> World, <hi>and therefore might be, and undoubtedly was,</hi> understood <hi>both as</hi> Good, <hi>and as exercising his</hi> Goodness, <hi>by the</hi> Angels <hi>before the</hi> Fall <hi>of any of them, and for that reason before</hi> Pardon of Sin <hi>could come into Consideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next Place, God <hi>had been</hi> Good, <hi>and had exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his</hi> Goodness, <hi>had</hi> Men <hi>and</hi> Angels <hi>been Created</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peccable; <hi>and, I am sure, it is no Contradiction to hold, That they might</hi> have been <hi>Originally made such, as all Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Spirits now actually</hi> are.</p>
            <p>And Lastly, God <hi>is, and may be understood to be</hi> Good, <hi>even in respect of those, whose Sins shall never be pardoned. And therefore that Assertion of this Author,</hi> That it is not possible to understand what Goodness is without Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Grace, <hi>is apparently false and absurd; as drawing after it One of these Two Consequences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>That either we cannot understand the Creation and Support of</hi> Angels, <hi>and of this visible World, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of</hi> Mankind, <hi>to have been Acts and Instances of the</hi> Divine Goodness <hi>(which yet, no doubt, were very great ones.) Or,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That we cannot understand them as such, but by understanding them also to imply in them</hi> Pardoning Grace. <hi>And if so, then, supposing the</hi> Creation <hi>of</hi> Man,
<pb n="XI" facs="tcp:101779:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>and his Sin after his</hi> Creation, <hi>and the</hi> Goodness <hi>of</hi> God <hi>remaining still entire, notwithstanding Man's Sin, (as it certainly did) it will follow, that</hi> Pardoning Grace, <hi>having (according to the forementioned Principle) a necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with, or result from the said</hi> Goodness, <hi>must have fallen in of course, and by necessary consequence from thence. And then, Where could be the</hi> Freedom <hi>of this</hi> Grace? <hi>Nay, Where could be this</hi> Grace <hi>it self? For the very Nature of</hi> Grace <hi>consists in this, that it be an Act perfectly</hi> Free; <hi>so free, that</hi> God <hi>might have chosen, after</hi> Man <hi>had sinned, whether he would ever have offered him any Conditions of</hi> Pardon, <hi>or no; And if he had not, Men might, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that, have abundantly known and understood the</hi> Goodness <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>by several other Acts and Instances, in which it had sufficiently declared it self. So that the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Assertion is nothing but a gross Paradox, and a Scurvy Blow at all</hi> Revealed Religion <hi>besides, if the</hi> Knowledge of Pardoning Grace <hi>could, or may be had without it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now after this</hi> Absurdity <hi>presented to the</hi> Reader<hi>'s Examination; I shall point out to him some of the</hi> Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <hi>also that occurr in the same Book. Such as are these that follow.</hi> The Justice of God <hi>(says he)</hi> having glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it self with Revenge on Sin in the Death of Christ, henceforward we may be sure he will be very kind, as a Revengeful Man is, when his Passion is over. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, P.</hi> 46. <hi>Again,</hi> the Sum of the Matter is, That God is all Love and Patience, when he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his fill of Revenge; as others use to say, That the Devil himself is very good when he is pleased, <hi>Pag.</hi> 47. <hi>Again,</hi> The Death of Christ <hi>(says he)</hi> discovers the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalness of Justice to God; that is, That he is so Just, that he has not one Dram of Goodness in him, till his Rage and Vengeance be satisfied; which, I confess, is a glorious kind of Justice. <hi>And presently after.</hi> Now

            <p>
               <hi>But now, if either He himself, or any for him shall plead. That it was not fairly done to charge him with those</hi> Blasphemies, <hi>which he may (and perhaps does) pretend</hi> to have been uttered by Him in the Person of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and as the genuine Consequences of the Doctrine maintained by him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="XIII" facs="tcp:101779:8"/>
               <hi>To this I Answer. First, That he, who pretends to speak in the</hi> Person <hi>of another, ought, according to all</hi> Justice <hi>and</hi> Decorum, <hi>to speak only such Things as that other, whom he</hi> personates, <hi>uses to speak, and consonant to his known,</hi> Avowed Sence. <hi>But did his</hi> Adversary, <hi>Dr.</hi> Owen, <hi>ever speak so? Or use the Expressions here uttered by this Author? Whereas he declares himself concerning the said Expressions thus, viz.</hi> That he cannot mention them without beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Pardon for repeating such horrid and desperate Blasphemies. Owen<hi>'s Vindication against</hi> Sherlock, <hi>p.</hi> 46. That they were fitter for a <hi>Iew,</hi> or a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> for <hi>Servetus,</hi> or <hi>Socinus,</hi> than a Son of this Church, <hi>p.</hi> 47. That he abhorred the Rehearsal of such horrid Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>p.</hi> 49. That they were odious Satanical Exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Truth of Christ's Satisfaction, <hi>ibid. And now can this Man pretend to speak these Things in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of one who thus</hi> Abhors, Abominates, <hi>and</hi> Detests <hi>them? The Truth is, his whole Book is such a lewd Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation both of the</hi> Words <hi>and</hi> Sence <hi>of his</hi> Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>that if he has any</hi> Bloud in his Body, <hi>it must needs</hi> fly in his Face, <hi>and bid him</hi> Blush <hi>for such</hi> Unconscionable Falsifications.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Secondly, If he charges these Assertions as</hi> Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the Doctrine maintained by his Adversary, <hi>I must put him in mind of these two Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That to the just charging of any</hi> Man <hi>with the</hi> Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences <hi>of his</hi> Doctrine, <hi>or</hi> Opinion, <hi>the</hi> Things <hi>so char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ought to be not only the</hi> Real, <hi>but also the</hi> Plain, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, <hi>and</hi> Immediate Consequences <hi>of that</hi> Opinion. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as no Man ought in reason to be charged with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote far-fetched</hi> Consequences <hi>of any</hi> Proposition <hi>held by him; since he may in all Equity (if he disclaims them) be supposed ignorant of them, and that</hi> inculpably <hi>too.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="XIV" facs="tcp:101779:9"/>
2. <hi>This</hi> Author <hi>is to know, That to the just charging of even any</hi> Doctrine, <hi>or</hi> Opinion, <hi>with such and such</hi> Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, <hi>though they follow never so</hi> really <hi>and</hi> truly <hi>from it, yet if they lie any thing remote, and at some distance from the same, they ought first by</hi> clear undeniable Arguments <hi>to be proved to follow from thence, before they can justly and fairly be charged to do so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which two</hi> Observations <hi>thus premised; that I may lay the whole Matter before the</hi> Reader <hi>more particularly; he is to take Notice, That the</hi> Doctrine, <hi>which this</hi> Author <hi>loads with these</hi> Blasphemous Consequences; <hi>is,</hi> That of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a Satisfaction to be paid to God's Justice in order to the Pardon of Sin, and the Justification of Sinners. <hi>And this I affirm to have been the</hi> received Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>and the</hi> General Opinion <hi>of</hi> Divines <hi>in the Case; all asserting</hi> the Necessity of such a Satisfaction; <hi>though not All, I confess, upon the same</hi> ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For</hi> First, <hi>Some found this</hi> Necessity <hi>upon</hi> the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Egress of God's Vindictive Justice, <hi>naturally acting and exerting it self where it meets with a</hi> Proper Object.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> Secondly, <hi>Others state this</hi> Necessity <hi>upon the</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree <hi>or</hi> Purpose <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>resolving to take this course for the</hi> Pardon of Sin, <hi>and no other. Which</hi> Decree <hi>and</hi> Purpose, <hi>though made freely, yet being actually passed and declared, it was not free for God to baulk the execution of it. His Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, Wisdom and Honour, as Supreme Governour of the World; not suffering him to let the Violation of his Laws pass without a due satisfaction made to his Iustice. And this has been the Opinion of most Divines in this matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nevertheless, (whether upon either of these grounds, or some other) it is certain, that the Necessity of a Satisfaction was still</hi>
               <pb n="XV" facs="tcp:101779:9"/>
               <hi>held, and owned by the</hi> Church: <hi>And yet upon supposal of</hi> this Necessity <hi>alone it is, (whatsoever ground it be stated upon) that this Author sets God forth in a most Profane manner,</hi> as an Impotent Man venting his Rage and Passion without any sufficient Ground or Reason for it. <hi>For, I am sure, no other Consideration can Answer, or come up to the</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety <hi>of the forecited Expressions. And I freely appeal to the</hi> Learned, <hi>and</hi> Unbyassed Reader, <hi>Whether the said Passages can be placed to any other Account whatsoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if they cannot, I ask with what Conscience could this Man, of his own Head, invent such Hideous, Abominable Words, and then thrust them into his</hi> Adversary's <hi>Mouth, whether he would, or no? Or charge them as the</hi> necessary Consequences <hi>of his</hi> Doctrine, <hi>without proving, or by any formed</hi> Argument <hi>so much as offering to prove them so? For surely he ought to have done this in the first place, and (since he knew that the</hi> Learned Assertors <hi>of this</hi> Doctrine, <hi>did and would deny these to be the Consequences of it to the very Death) he should by clear and solid</hi> Ratiocination <hi>have proved against them, (in spight of their Denial) that these were indeed the</hi> True <hi>and</hi> Natural Consequences <hi>of the said</hi> Doctrine, <hi>before he reproached them as such. But, it seems he was for doing</hi> execution first, <hi>and for</hi> proceeding to Tryal afterwards; <hi>though, as hasty as he was in the former, he has not yet done the latter, nor, I believe, ever will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon the whole Matter it is manifest, That it was not so much any thing Personal in Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>(how bitter soever he was against him) as the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of</hi> Christ's Satisfaction <hi>asserted by the said</hi> Doctor, <hi>in common with the whole</hi> Christian Church, <hi>which this</hi> Author <hi>so vilely reflected upon; and discharged all those Blasphemous Scoffs at, in that Book of his; and consequently so far as he was the Author both of the Book and the Scoffs in it, he was as fit a Person to have joyned in the Address</hi>
               <pb n="XVI" facs="tcp:101779:10"/>
               <hi>to the</hi> Morocco Ambassadour, <hi>as any Man in</hi> England <hi>besides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I do, I confess, charge this</hi> Author <hi>with Asserting</hi> Three Gods <hi>(though he does not</hi> in Terminis <hi>express it) because of his Asserting</hi> Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits; <hi>But then the case here on my part is quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what it was on his. For in this, the Consequence of</hi> Three Gods <hi>from</hi> Three distinct Infinite Spirits, <hi>is</hi> direct, manifest, <hi>and</hi> immediate; <hi>or rather, in Truth, is not so properly a</hi> Consequence, <hi>or</hi> one Assertion <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing from</hi> another, <hi>as</hi> one <hi>and</hi> the very same <hi>thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in</hi> other words; <hi>which is the True account of this Matter. For the Words</hi> [Infinite Mind or Spirit] <hi>are but a</hi> Periphrasis <hi>of the Thing signified by the Term</hi> [God:] <hi>And their perfect equivalence shall be fully demonstrated in my Fifth Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From all which I conclude, That since there are (beyond all pretence of Denial) several Horrid Blasphemous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in this Author's forementioned Book, which must and ought to be charged somewhere; and since his</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary <hi>utterly disowns them all, both as to</hi> Words <hi>and</hi> Sence; <hi>and since the</hi> Doctrine <hi>it self, maintained by him, infers no such Thing; nor has this</hi> Author <hi>proved that it does so; but that the said Representations of it are peculiarly his own, and occur no where but in his Book (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept possibly in the Writings of some of His Old Friends the</hi> Socinians, <hi>and those such as the</hi> Transylvanian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters) <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> a most Virulent and Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spemous Book Wrote by these Men, and entituled, <hi>Praemonitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Christi &amp; Apostolorum de abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendo vero Christo per Antichristum.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>it follows that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the strictest Laws of fair and just Quotation, all</hi> the black Dirt <hi>of those Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and foul Passages which I have cited from him, and charged upon him, ought to lie</hi>

               <hi>wholly at his Door; and let him (and his</hi> Porter) <hi>shovel it away thence as they are able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to what concerns the Licensing this Book, so severely, and so justly reflected upon by Dr.</hi> Owen, <hi>it did (it must be confessed) meet with a Person, as it were, framed for the very purpose. For none certainly could be so fit to stamp an</hi> Imprimatur <hi>upon a Book Wrote against</hi> Christ<hi>'s Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as One, who while he was</hi> Eating the Bread, <hi>and</hi> Wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Honours <hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>could stab the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of it to the Heart, by Writing for</hi> Transubstantiation. <hi>And then in the next place, for its passing Uncontrolled, it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been to be wished, That the</hi> Clergy <hi>in</hi> Convocation, <hi>in the last especially (in which so many of them acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so exceeding worthily upon other Accounts) would have vouchsafed to wipe off this foul Blot from the</hi> Church <hi>by a due Censure passed upon the forementioned Positions, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful to that, and so Contumelious to our</hi> Common Christianity. <hi>For what vast advantage the</hi> Dissenters <hi>have taken from hence to Scandalize and Bespatter the Government and Governours of our</hi> Church, <hi>is but too well known, and cannot be too much Lamented; and I heartily wish, That it had been a</hi> Scandal <hi>only</hi> Taken, <hi>and not</hi> Given. <hi>And the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">See the Preface to his <hi>Case of Allegiance,</hi> P. 5.</note> 
               <hi>rather do I represent this as a Work fit for the</hi> Convocation; <hi>since this</hi> Author <hi>has given the World such a Notable Proof, That nothing but a</hi> Convocation <hi>can Convince, or work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus I have given the</hi> Reader <hi>a Specimen of the</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines <hi>of this</hi> Author <hi>in these Two Books of his. In the former of which, he affects to be the</hi> Socinian<hi>'s humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, by Ridiculing and Exploding</hi> Christ<hi>'s Satisfaction of</hi> God<hi>'s Iustice; and so in effect, the whole Mystery of the</hi> Gospel: <hi>And in the latter he pretends to oppose them by such a</hi> Vindication of the Trinity, <hi>and of</hi> Christ's Incarnation, <hi>as one would think, were Wrote by Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
               <pb n="XVIII" facs="tcp:101779:11"/>
               <hi>But whatsoever it is, that he either pretends, or intends (as it is hard to know the latter by the former) this Character I shall give of him as a Writer, That there is hardly any one Subject, which he has Wrote upon, (that of</hi> Popery <hi>only excepted) but he has Wrote both</hi> for it <hi>and</hi> against it <hi>too: Not that I say, that he has Printed all which he has so Wrote; but</hi> Printing <hi>is not the only way of</hi> Publication; <hi>and this I will say besides, That where he has not</hi> Printed, <hi>he has</hi> Acted <hi>it with a Witness. And yet even for Printing; could any thing be Wrote and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more sharp and bitter against the</hi> Dissenters, <hi>than what this Man Wrote in his Answer to the</hi> Protestant Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler? <hi>And yet how frankly (or rather fulsomely) does he open both his Arms to embrace them in his Sermon Preached before the</hi> Lord Mayor, <hi>on</hi> Novemb. 4. 1688? <hi>Though I dare say, That the</hi> Dissenters <hi>themselves are of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy as to own, That they were of the same Principles in</hi> 88, <hi>that they were of in</hi> 85. <hi>But the Truth is, Old Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships cannot be so easily forgot. And it has been an Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by some, that hardly can any one be found, who was first tainted with a</hi> Conventicle, <hi>whom a</hi> Cathedral <hi>could ever after cure; but that still upon every cross Turn of Affairs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the</hi> Church, <hi>the irresistible Magnetism of the</hi> Good Old Cause, <hi>(as some still think it) would quickly draw him out of the</hi> Good Old Way. <hi>The Fable tells us of a</hi> Cat <hi>once turned into a</hi> Woman, <hi>but the next sight of a</hi> Mouse <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissolved the Metamorphosis, cashiered the Woman, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored the Brute. And some</hi> Virtuosi <hi>(skilled in the</hi> Useful Philosophy <hi>of</hi> Alterations) <hi>have thought her much a gainer by the latter change; there being so many unlucky turns in the World, in which it is not half so safe and advantagious to</hi> Walk Upright, <hi>as to</hi> be able to fall always upon one's Legs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But not to hold the</hi> Reader <hi>too long in the Entrance of the</hi>
               <pb n="XIX" facs="tcp:101779:11"/>
               <hi>Work, which I am about to present him with, I do here assure him, That, in the following</hi> Animadversions, <hi>I have strictly pursued this</hi> Author <hi>in every part of his new</hi> Hypothesis, <hi>I have answered all his Arguments, not omitting so much as one, or any Thing that looks like one. And if I have thought fit sometimes in a short Remark or two, here and there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh the</hi> Reader <hi>and my self, by exposing his</hi> Bold <hi>and</hi> Blind <hi>side together, yet this has still been my method, throughly to dispatch the Argument, before I offer to divert upon the</hi> Author.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for that part of his Book, which peculiarly concerns the</hi> Socinians, <hi>I leave him and them to fight it out. My bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is to shew, That the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of our</hi> Church <hi>is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely a stranger to his Novel and Beloved Notions: It knows them not; It owns them not; nor ought we to look upon him, so far as he Asserts and Maintains them, to be any True and Genuine Son of it: And consequently, whether he worries the</hi> Socinians, <hi>or (which is much the more likely) the</hi> Socinians <hi>worry him, the</hi> Church of England <hi>is not at all concerned.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>Representing the Sence and Signification of the Word <hi>Mystery;</hi> as also a Vindication of the Use and Application of it to some of the most Difficult and Sublime Truths of the <hi>Gospel;</hi> and lastly, a full Proof, That the Account given by this Author of his Explication of the <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> is wholly inconsistent with the <hi>Mysteriousness</hi> of it; together with some Remarks upon his need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Apology</hi> for Writing against the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN Order to the better Examination of what this Author has wrote about the Holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> I think it requisite to premise something concerning the Signification, Sence, and Nature of a Mystery. For certainly the Unity of One and the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided God-head, in a Trinity of distinct Persons, is one of the greatest Mysteries, if not absolutely the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in our Christian Religion. Now a Mystery, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common signification of the word, is derived either from the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifies to <hi>initiate,</hi> or <hi>enter one into Sacred Rites, or Doctrines,</hi> or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101779:14"/>
from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, another <hi>Greek</hi> word (and that in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Eustathius</hi> and <hi>Stephanus,</hi> more regularly and naturally) signifying to <hi>shut</hi> or <hi>close up,</hi> and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly apply'd to the <hi>shutting of the eyes or mouth,</hi> the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn posture of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Initiati</hi> in the Rites of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Worship. And, <hi>lastly,</hi> one of no small Note <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Casaub. Exer. 16. ad Ann. Baron. 43. <hi>p.</hi> 542, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> for Critical as well as other Learning, will needs run it up even to a <hi>Hebrew</hi> Original, deriving it from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifies <hi>res abscondita aut secretum.</hi> Concerning which, it must be confessed, That there is a more than ordinary agreement between the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> word, both as to Sound and Signification. But whether this be not wholly accidental, is lest to the Criticks in these Languages to determine. In the mean time, most account <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a word purely and perfectly <hi>Greek:</hi> And the Original of it lies so manifestly in one of the two fore-mentioned <hi>Greek</hi> words, that it seems a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Curiosity, or rather a meer Fancy to seek for it else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. But whatsoever the Origination of the word is, it always imports <hi>something hidden</hi> or <hi>concealed,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with reference to <hi>Sacred</hi> or <hi>Religious Matters;</hi> And in this Sence it occurs frequently, if not always, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Writers; from whence the Holy Pen-men of the New Testament seem to have borrow'd and apply'd it to some of the Great and Arduous Truths of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, such as human Reason cannot give a clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Account of.</p>
            <p>This therefore being the undoubted Notation and Signification of the Word, I shall deliver the Nature of the thing it self in this Definition, viz. <hi>That a Mystery is a Truth reveal'd by God, above the Power of natural Reason to find out or comprehend.</hi> This, I take, to be a full and proper Definition of a Mystery. And accordingly I shall consider the several Parts of it distinctly. As,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101779:14"/>
               <hi>First, That it is a Truth.</hi> By which we exclude eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing from being a Mystery that is absurd or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictious; since a Truth can by no means be so. And consequently hereby stand excluded also the Fooleries and Falsities of all other Religions, how Mysterious soever they may be pretended to be, and with how much Solemnity and Confidence soever delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The next Qualification is, <hi>That it be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, viz.</hi> as to its <hi>Existence,</hi> That <hi>there is such a thing.</hi> For otherwise, as to the Nature of the thing it self, and several other respects, in which it may be known, the Revelation of it is not suppos'd to extend so far. In a Word, as a Mystery implies some Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Thing; so it follows, That all Revelation does not overthrow the Mysteriousness of it: But on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such a plenary and entire Revelation of it, as leaves nothing in the Nature of it abstruse or undiscovered. But now, though Revelation be a necessary Ingredient in this Definition, yet it is not sufficient; something more being still required. Since nothing hinders, but that the same thing may be both revealed by God, and known upon other accounts too. As the Moral Law was revealed by God to his People, and may be drawn and demonstrated from Principles of Natural Reason also. And therefore, the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> Property of a Mystery is, <hi>That it surpass all the Power of Natural Reason to discover or find it out.</hi> And that not only as to the <hi>Quid sit,</hi> or particular Nature, but also as to the <hi>Quòd sit</hi> of it too. For that there are or should be such or such things, (to consider only the bare Existence of them) no Principle of humane Reason, by its own natural or improved Light, could ever have found out, as might be easily shewn by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, through the several Mysteries of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101779:15"/>
such as are the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> the <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union of Christ with the Church,</hi> the <hi>Resurrection of the Body,</hi> and the like; of all, and each of which, meer Reason could never have made a discovery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The fourth and last Condition of a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, express'd in the foregoing Definition of it, is, <hi>That it be such a Thing, as bare Natural Reason (even after it is discovered) cannot comprehend.</hi> I say <hi>comprehend,</hi> that is, know it perfectly, and as far as it is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known. I do not say, That it is, or ought to be wholly Unintelligible. For some knowledge (no doubt) may be had of it. As, first, we may know the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification and Meaning of the Words or Terms, in which it is delivered or revealed to us. Likewise as to the thing it self, we may have some imperfect, defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive knowledge of that too. Such as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>a knowing in part, and seeing as through a glass darkly,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12. which words manifestly and naturally import, That something is known, though in a very imperfect manner and degree, and that something also remains still unknown, which shall hereafter be clearly and fully discovered, and made known unto us. So that I think nothing could give us a truer, and more satisfactory account of the Nature of an Evangelical Mystery, than this Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is a Truth, of which we know something, at present, though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfectly; but are ignorant of a great deal more belonging to it. And this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this obscure and abstruse part of it, is that which properly constitutes and denominates a Sacred Truth a Mystery; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently we may reckon the Account given us of a <hi>Mystery</hi> by St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> a true and exact Description of it by its principal Property, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Homily</hi> 7. on the 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101779:15"/>
               <hi>Homily</hi> 19. on the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Where I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the Reader still to observe, that I do not affirm, That this last Acception of the Word is either the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sence of it, or that the Heathen Writers used it in this Signification; all that they intended to signifie by the Word <hi>Mysterium,</hi> seeming to have been only that it was, <hi>Quid sacrum &amp; secretum.</hi> But this I affirm, That the Fathers and Writers of the Christian Church generally used it in the Sence specified; that is, They affix'd a farther Sence to it of their own; but still such an one as carried with it something of Analogy and Cognation to the first, whereby it signify'd only some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>obscure</hi> or <hi>occult in sacred Matters.</hi> So that now, if any one should argue, That in the Writers of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church, <hi>Mysterium</hi> signified only, <hi>Quid sacrum &amp; secretum,</hi> because it signified no more in the Heathen Writers, from whom they borrowed it, this would be very inconsequent and ridiculous; and all one, as if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Sacramentum</hi> in the Heathen Writers signified on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Military Oath: Therefore in the Ancient <hi>Christian</hi> Writers it must signifie so too. For the <hi>Christian</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters apply it, to signifie those two great Rites of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, <hi>Baptism</hi> and the Holy <hi>Eucharist;</hi> though still (in this instance as well as in the former) with some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy, Reference, and Affinity to the first use of the Word, <hi>viz.</hi> That as by this Military Oath, Soldiers did solemnly devote themselves to their Emperor's Service; so in these two Religious Rites Men do much more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly devote and bind themselves over to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Service of Christ, according to all the Rules and Precepts of his Holy Religion.</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore, by a Parity of the Case, That <hi>Mysterium,</hi> according to the Christian Use of the Word, imports not only, <hi>Quid in sacris secretum,</hi> by reason of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101779:16"/>
an actual Concealment of the same, but moreover some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that is so much a <hi>Secretum</hi> in Religion, as to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend and surpass all Human Comprehension. And it is the Authority of the Ancient Writers using the word thus, which I state this Sence of it upon, as abundantly sufficient to enfranchise and render it Authentick in the Church. Though, I confess, as to the Adversary whom I am to deal with, my purpose would be sufficiently serv'd against him, even by the first and narrowest Signification of the Word, as it imports only something in Religion actually secret, hidden, and not open to a common view or perception.</p>
            <p>I have now given the <hi>Notation, Signification,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition</hi> of the word <hi>Mystery.</hi> But after all, there is a new Light sprung lately into the World, which tells us, the use of the Word in Scripture determines the Case quite another way; for that the Scripture knows no such <note place="margin">An Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the word <hi>Mystery,</hi> as it is taken in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> signification of the word, as we have insisted upon; nor that any thing that is Incomprehensible, is, or ought to be accounted, a Mystery. The Asserter of this (as we may well perceive) is a bold Man, but being at present engaged with a much bolder, I shall only say thus much of this <hi>Socinian</hi> Tract here, <hi>viz.</hi> That as to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Author would raise against the <hi>Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> (as he calls them) from the Sence of the Word <hi>Mystery,</hi> as he has there stated it, it has been throughly baffled and overthrown by a Learned Person, in a short <note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. Printed 1691.</note> Discourse <hi>in Vindication of the Mysteries of the Christian Faith,</hi> &amp;c. And when this <hi>Anti-Trinitarian</hi> has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd that Learned Person, if there appears need of any further answer to the foremention'd piece, he may, all in good time, receive one in a distinct Discourse by it self.</p>
            <p>And so I immediately address my self to the Author undertook by me, who by pretending to defend the great

Article of the Trinity, has given the Adversary those great Advantages against it, which the bare Article left to defend it self, (as <hi>the Faith</hi> is generally its own <hi>best Defender)</hi> could never have given him. The <hi>Socinians</hi> charge it with Paradox, and downright Contradiction. For the repelling and staving off which Charge from this Doctrine, our Author has thought fit to give us some Rules to judge of a Contradiction by, and in so doing, has laid down this Remarkable Assertion, viz. <hi>That it is a vain and arrogant presumption, to say, what is, or what is not a Contradiction, when we confess we do not understand, or comprehend the thing we speak of,</hi> p. 4. This, I say, is a very remarkable Assertion, and the first thing remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it, is, That (according to a Custom, very usual with him) he promiscuously joyns together words, as if they were of the same Import and Extent of Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when really they are very different. For to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi> a thing, is to know it in any respect, or degree, in which it is knowable; and to <hi>comprehend</hi> a thing, is to know it in every respect in which it is knowable. And as it is certain, that we cannot know God this latter way; so it is as certain, that we may know him the former: For we do, and may know him by inadequate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and uncommensurate Conceptions; as that he is Just, Wise, Good, and the like; which are several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate ways of representing him to our mind. But now, if this Author's Assertion should take place, <hi>viz.</hi> That we cannot say what is, or what is not a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when we confess we do not comprehend the thing we speak of, then we cannot pronounce these Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Iupiter Olympius</hi> is the Supreme God, the Sun is the Supreme God, or the World is the Supreme God, to be Contradictions: Forasmuch as it is certain, that speaking here of God, we do not comprehend the thing we speak
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101779:17"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:101779:18"/>
of. And yet since <hi>Iupiter Olympius,</hi> the Sun, and the World are all of them finite Material Beings, and God both Infinite and Immaterial: I doubt not but that to affirm one of the other, is a real and manifest Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And to shew that it is so, this Author should do well to consider, That a Contradiction is not properly (or universally at least) oppos'd to the <hi>compleat</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate knowledge of a thing, but to the <hi>true</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it. And we may have a true knowledge even by such inadequate, imperfect, incomplete Conceptions of it, as we have mention'd. For he who knows God to be Just, though he cannot comprehend every way and respect in which he is, or may be so, and much less all his other Perfections, has thereby a true knowledge of God, though an Imperfect one. That is, he knows and understands, though he does not comprehend him. But according to this Author's Assertion, we cannot say, that any thing is a Contradiction, with reference to God, since it is certain and evident, that we neither do nor can comprehend him. And what absurd, and insuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Consequences, this must needs draw after it in our Discourses of God, I leave to any one but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Assertion to judge.</p>
            <p>But the Consequences of it, as bad as they are, do not stop in God. For in the 7th Page, our Author proceeds farther, and affirms, That it is so far from being a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to meet with any thing, <hi>whose nature</hi> (or rather the <hi>Nature of which)</hi> we do not <hi>perfectly understand, that he knows nothing in the World which we do perfectly understand,</hi> or, in his other word, <hi>comprehend,</hi> (for to <hi>understand a thing perfectly,</hi> and to <hi>comprehend</hi> it, I take to be the same.) And now let us apply his former Rule, viz. <hi>That we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say what is, or is not a Contradiction, when we confess we do not comprehend the thing we speak of.</hi> I say, let us apply
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101779:18"/>
this Rule here also; and since he positively avers, That there is nothing in the World which we <hi>do comprehend,</hi> or <hi>perfectly understand:</hi> it must roundly follow, That there can be no such thing as a Contradiction; since whatsoever is so, is, and must be a Contradiction to something or other. Now for the Truth and Reason of his Assertion, I cannot undertake, but certainly the Prudence and Forecast of it is admirable, as being like to do him Knight's Service (as I shall shew hereafter) at many a turn, and, next to a <hi>Convocation-Book,</hi> help him out at a dead Lift.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let us see how our Author makes good this strange and loose Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is nothing in the World, <hi>that we perfectly understand.</hi> And in order to this, Let us bring and lay together what he Asserts in several places. And here first in <hi>Page</hi> 7. <hi>line</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is agreed by all Men, <hi>That the Essences of things cannot be known, but only their Properties and Qualities;</hi> and <hi>that the World is divided into Matter and Spirit;</hi> and <hi>that we know no more what the substance of Matter, than what the s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bstance of Spirit is:</hi> And then he enumerates some of the Essential Properties of each, and owns that we <hi>know them</hi> (in Confirmation, I suppose, of his fore-going Assertion, <hi>that we know nothing.)</hi> After which, in <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. <hi>line</hi> 15. he adds, <hi>As for the Essential Properties, Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Powers of Matter, Sence, Experience, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation will tell us what they are.</hi> And then I hope we may <hi>know also what they are,</hi> when <hi>Sence</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> has told us. So that we see here what our Author asserts; But may we rely upon it, and hold him to his Word? Alas; That, I fear, may prove something hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. For a Man, to whom <hi>a whole Convocation has given a large scope and liberty of thinking,</hi> and who has given himself as large an one for speaking, loves not, of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101779:19"/>
all things in the World, to be held too strictly to what he says. For in <hi>Page</hi> 4. <hi>line</hi> 25. reckoning up some of the Absurdities, and Contradictions attending the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, he tells us, That <hi>we know them to be so;</hi> because <hi>we know the Nature</hi> of a Body (and this also we must suppose said in further Confirmation of his other Assertion, that we know not the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>any thing)</hi> and moreover, <hi>That we know that such things</hi> (as he there mentions) <hi>are a Contradiction to the Essential Properties of a Body, line</hi> 26. All this he says here, and that in very plain terms. But in <hi>Page</hi> 7. (in which it is high time for a Man to forget what he said in the 4th.) He tells us, <hi>That the Essences of things cannot be known;</hi> and consequently one would think, That the Essence of a Body could not be known: And yet for one to <hi>know the nature of a Body,</hi> (which in <hi>Page</hi> 4. he says we do) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>knowing the Essence of it;</hi> (which in <hi>Page</hi> 7. he says, we cannot know) is, I conceive, a way of knowledge peculiar to this Author. In the next place, as for the property of things, he tells us very positively in <hi>Page</hi> 8. <hi>line</hi> 33, 34. <hi>That the Properties and Operations both of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Spirits, are great Secrets, and Mysteries in Nature, which we understand nothing of,</hi> &amp;c. And yet in <hi>Page</hi> 7. <hi>line</hi> 32. he tells us, That we know the <hi>Essential Properties of a Spirit, that it is a thinking substance with the Faculties of Understanding and Will,</hi> &amp;c. Now <hi>to know the Essential Properties of a Spirit;</hi> And yet for these Properties to be <hi>such Secrets and Mysteries in Nature,</hi> that <hi>we understand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them,</hi> (both which this Author expresly affirms in the compass of two Pages) is another sort of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which ought in all reason to be reckon'd peculiar to himself. And thus having consider'd some of his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions in Contradiction to one another (if there be any such thing as a Contradiction) I will consider some of them severally by themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101779:19"/>
And here, as I have already shewn, That he says po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively <hi>Page</hi> 4. <hi>line</hi> 28. <hi>That we have no clear and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive Notion of a Spirit:</hi> So he adds in the next words, That it is impossible <hi>to know what is contrary to the Nature of a Spirit, if we know not what the Nature of a Spirit is,</hi> i. e. Comprehensively, as he must still mean. But this, by his favour, I very much question, and desire him to tell me, Whether we may not know, <hi>That it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Nature of a Spirit to be Material,</hi> to be extended, and <hi>to be compounded of the Elements,</hi> &amp;c. These things I take to be such as are contrary to the Nature of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and such as may be certainly known to be so, and consequently such as may safely, rationally, and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly to all Principles of Philosophy, be pronounced to be so: And therefore this Author's Assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is impossible to <hi>know what is contrary to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Spirit, if we have not a clear, comprehensive No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nature of a Spirit,</hi> is apparently False, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, and Ridiculous.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, This Author having said, <hi>That he knows nothing in the World that we do perfectly understand:</hi> And for the proof of it alledged, <hi>That the Essences of Things cannot be known;</hi> and for the farther proof of that, affirm'd, <hi>That the whole World is adequately divided into Matter and Spirit; the Natures of which</hi> (as he says) <hi>are wholly unknown to us:</hi> Suppose now, I should (as I do) deny this whole Argument, and affirm, That there is a third sort of <hi>Beings,</hi> which are neither <hi>Matter,</hi> nor <hi>Spirit;</hi> which yet (as to some of them, at least) may be perfectly understood and known by us; and these are <hi>Accidents,</hi> which, according to the ablest Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers hitherto, do together with <hi>substance,</hi> make a much better, and more comprehensive Division of the whole World, than <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> For certain it is,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101779:20"/>
That <hi>Accidents,</hi> as contradistinct to <hi>Substance,</hi> are real Beings, and have their respective Essences and Properties belonging to them, and such as may be matter of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration; which kind of Argument is known to be the proving of any Property, or proper Attribute of its Subject, by a third thing, or Principle, bearing an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Connexion with both. And amongst <hi>Accidents,</hi> I do particularly affirm this of Numbers, Figures, and Proportions, that they are such things as may be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood by us in the strength of Natural Reason. For I think it may be perfectly, and comprehensively known, That two and two make four; and that a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is a Figure, every part of the Circumference whereof is equidistant from the Centre; and a thousand more such things, all which are capable of being Scientifically made out to us by Demonstration: And this indeed to such an height, that as some will admit of no Demonstrations, but in the Mathematicks, <hi>viz.</hi> in Numbers, Figures, and Proportions: So there are few, or none, but readily grant, That the Demonstrations about these Matters, are the Clearest, the most Scientifick, and Convincing of all other Demonstrations whatsoever. From all which I conclude, That what this Author has affirm'd, <hi>viz. That there is nothing in the World but Matter and Spirit, and withal, That there is nothing which we do perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi> is not only a crude, loose, unwary, but really, and, in strictness of truth, a very false Assertion.</p>
            <p>And therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though this Author pleaseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with a fanciful Harangue about our Ignorance of the Philosophy; <hi>How the Fire burns, and the Waters are condens'd</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>into Ice? How Stones fall to the Ground, and Vapours ascend and thicken in Clouds, and fall down again to the Earth in gentle Showres,</hi> &amp;c. (for it must be granted, That it is much easier
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101779:20"/>
to <hi>change</hi> like <hi>the Weather,</hi> than to understand it) and moreover, though he is pleased to say, <q>That he who thinks he understands these matters, would make a Man question, Whether he has any sense at all?</q> (which is his usual Complement to most whom he deals with) yet all this confident Talk will neither clear him from the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity and Paradox of the forementioned General Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid down by him; nor convince such as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in the experimental part of Natural Philosophy, but that a very true, rational, and satisfactory Account may be given of all the fore-mentioned Phaenomena in Nature, which this Man, with so much Confidence, or rather Insolence, says, <hi>No Man</hi> of <hi>unquestion'd Sence</hi> will <hi>pretend to give the Reason, or Philosophy of.</hi> Accordingly I will direct him to some who took the boldness to give a Philosophical Account of his <hi>Unresolvable</hi> Problems. As for instance, That of the congealing of Water by Cold, into such a solid Body as Ice, he will find excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and rationally accounted for, by the Learned Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> in his Treatise of <hi>Cold,</hi> containing new Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, and Observations touching it, and an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental History of <hi>it begun.</hi> Likewise a reason of the same given by those Learned <hi>French-men,</hi> the Authors of the <hi>Philosophia Vetus &amp; Nova,</hi> commonly called, the <hi>Colbertine</hi> Philosophy, in the 2 Vol. <hi>p.</hi> 213, 214, 215, 216. And then, <hi>for the Descent of heavy Bodies, or Stones falling to the Ground;</hi> he will find the cause of it assigned by <hi>Galileo,</hi> in his <hi>Systema Cosmicum, Collat. 1. &amp; 2.</hi> And since by <hi>Gassendus,</hi> in his Accurate Tract <hi>de motu impresso à motore translato.</hi> As also, an Account of the Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Descent of such Bodies, judiciously given by <hi>Claudius Berigardus,</hi> Professor of Philosophy first in <hi>Pisa,</hi> and then in <hi>Padua,</hi> in his <hi>Circulus Pisanus</hi> 3d part, and the 6 Dial. <hi>p.</hi> 291, 292. in the Person of <hi>Aristaeus.</hi> And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101779:21"/>
last of all, in the Causes of Gravitation briefly, but inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously given by <hi>Isaac Vossius,</hi> in his <hi>Observationes variae, p.</hi> 201, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In like manner he will find a Philosophical, and Historical Account of Winds, by that great Man, the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> in his Treatise upon that Subject; which, I am sure, is as difficult an one, as any mentioned by this Author. And as for what he here says <hi>of the Ascent of Vapours</hi> (which is easily accounted for, from the Sun and other Celestial Bodies) <hi>and their Descent again in Showres;</hi> which might easily be stated upon their own Gravity, being combined into bigger Bodies, as is lively exemplified in an Alembick) this Author in this, seems to give us some Philosophical Account of Rain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently for presuming so to do, ought to bear his share in the same Reproach, which upon the like account he hath so insolently fastned upon others. But as touching Rain and Vapours, Snow and Frost, and innumerable more such Subjects; there is not a Natural Philosopher, whether <hi>Peripatetick, Gassendian,</hi> or <hi>Cartesian</hi> of any note, but professeth to give a Philosophical Reason of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them, both as to what they are, and how, and by what means they are caused. Concerning all which, Learned Men, who have avowedly travelled, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed themselves in such Studies, and that with great Applause of all the Learned World; I desire <hi>his Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness</hi> to speak out, and declare freely, whether he taketh them to have been such Persons, <hi>as a Man would question, Whether they had any Sense, or no?</hi> For as these famous Men were far from <hi>denying their Senses, in Complement to their Understanding;</hi> so they were as far from passing such a Complement upon their Senses, as to own, That their Understanding could look no farther, and that where <hi>Sense</hi> had started the Game, <hi>Reason</hi> might not follow it, and by a diligent, and sagacious pursuit, at length over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101779:21"/>
it. The Things treated of by these mighty Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into Nature, I acknowledge to be very difficult; but every thing that is difficult, is not therefore impossible, even to him that thinks it so. And therefore, as to the ignorance of such like matters, let our Author (in God's Name) and others like him, pronounce each Man for himself, and not undertake for others. For there may be several things, which one Man may not know, and yet others may: As for instance, It may sometimes so fall out, That a Man <hi>may not know himself,</hi> and yet others may <hi>know him very well:</hi> Which is an Observation, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, not unworthy of this Author's Remark.</p>
            <p>But to go on: Whereas he is very positive, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory, <hi>That the Essences of things cannot be known:</hi> I very much question, (and allow him, if he pleases, to question my <hi>Sense</hi> also, for so doing) whether this be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely true? For a thing may be known more ways than one; and if it be perfectly known, any <hi>one</hi> way, according to the utmost extent of that way, it cannot be truly said, <hi>not to be known.</hi> Now, if by <hi>knowing,</hi> he means the knowledge of a thing, by a direct <hi>Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>Intuition</hi> of it, so as to have an exact Idea, or resemblance of it thereby imprinted upon the mind: I pretend not that the <hi>Essences of things</hi> are by any Human Intellect so known. But then, this is still but one way of knowledge; and what is not known one way, may (for all that) be very well known another. But if on the other side, by <hi>knowing a thing</hi> be meant, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be of such, or such a Nature, by such peculiar Properties, such peculiar Effects, and Operations, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriminate it from other things, and that, to know it thus, be truly to know it: Then I affirm, <hi>That the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or Essences of things may be truly, and</hi> (one way at least) <hi>perfectly known.</hi> And accordingly, I think it a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101779:22"/>
very good Account of the Essence of any thing, to say, That it is such a thing as always, and necessarily has such Properties, such Operations, and produces such Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. For this is an Answer, not only to that Question, that enquires, <hi>Whether there be such a thing, or Essence, or no?</hi> But also, and much more properly to the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that enquires, <hi>What kind of Nature, or Essence such a thing is of?</hi> For when that is askt, to say, in reply to it, That the Essence, or Nature of that thing is a certain Principle, always attended with such Properties, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, or generally operating in such a manner, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing such effects, is a full, and satisfactory Answer to that Question.</p>
            <p>If now this Author replys here, that he grants, That the <hi>Properties of things may be known;</hi> I Answer, That sometimes indeed he grants it, and sometimes again he positively denies it, as I have shewn. But if in the issue he will stand by the Concession of it, then he must stand by the Consequence of that Concession too, and grant, That Properties are declaratory of the Quality of the Essence they flow from, and belong to. For, I hope, he will grant, that the effect declares the Nature of the Cause: And consequently that the Nature of the Cause may be known by it; not by way of simple and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>apprehension</hi> of the Cause it self, I confess, but by way of Inference and Discourse, collecting one thing from another; which is one sure way of knowing. And therefore I do here affirm, and own to this Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Assuming Man, That to assert absolutely (as he does) <hi>That the Essences of things cannot be known,</hi> is, by no means, a justifiable Proposition; or, in the Latitude it is laid down in, to be admitted: But is really that fallacy, that concludes <hi>à dicto secundùm quid ad dictum simpliciter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:101779:22"/>
Well, but since this Author has concluded the whole World in Ignorance (himself, I suppose, still excepted from so general a Doom) What must we do in so sad a Condition? Must we all take up in Scepticism, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that nothing is to be known? What then will that old Principle of Nature, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, serve for, but to tantalize and torment us? For must we thus think, and thirst, and desire to know, and, after all, find nothing to be known with any thing of plainness, evidence, and demonstration? Why, Yes; to comfort us under this Cimmerian darkness, and to shew, that God has not given us our Intellectual Faculties whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in vain: There is one certain thing in the World, <hi>viz. The Doctrine of the Trinity;</hi> That is, to say, <hi>of three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Persons, all united in one and the same numerical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> which is <hi>wonderfully plain, easie, and obvious to be known:</hi> Though still, thanks to our Author for it, who by a New-found Exposition, and Explication of it, has bestowed this piece of Charity upon the World as to render it so. For thus, in <hi>Page</hi> 58. <hi>line</hi> 2. of his Book, Explaining the Union of the three Persons in the God-head, by <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> (which words shall be throughly considered in their due place) he says, <hi>That this is very plain, and intelligible, and makes the three Persons to be as much one, as every Man is one with himself.</hi> And certainly it is hardly possible for any thing to be more plain and clear, more evident and intelligible, than <hi>that every Man is one with himself.</hi> (Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be only when he <hi>contradicts</hi> himself.) Again in <hi>Page</hi> 65. <hi>line</hi> 31. he tells us, That his Notion of <hi>Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness, and Mutual-Consciousness, seems to him to make a Trinity in Unity as intelligible, as the Notion of one God is.</hi> And in <hi>Page</hi> 66. <hi>line</hi> 2, 3. <hi>That it gives a plain, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Solution to all the Difficulties, and seeming Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in the Doctrine of the Trinity.</hi> And surely that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101779:23"/>
thing, about which <hi>all difficulties are solved,</hi> and <hi>all seeming Contradictions are cleared,</hi> cannot be imagined to have any difficulty remaining in it at all. And again, in <hi>Page</hi> 68. <hi>line</hi> 26. he roundly tells us, That the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation given by him <hi>of a Trinity in Unity, is a very plain and intelligible Account of this great and venerable Mystery; as plain and intelligible as the Notion of one God, or of one Person in the Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in good earnest, the Notion of one first Cause of all things, and of one Supreme Being, and consequently of one God, is so easily demonstrated, or rather, with such a broad light, stares all Mankind in the Face, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any demonstration, that if the <hi>Trinity in Unity</hi> be as plain as this is, it is hardly possible for any thing to the Reason of Man to be plainer: And the <hi>Arians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> are ten times more inexcusable, than ever I thought them before. Again, in <hi>Page</hi> 73. <hi>line</hi> 11. having affirmed, <hi>The Trinity to be a most Sacred and Venerable My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery;</hi> within 6 or 7 Lines after, he says, <hi>If Men would but consider it according to his Hypothesis</hi> (which he there sets down) <hi>then a Trinity in Unity is a very plain, intelligible Notion.</hi> Again, in <hi>Page</hi> 74. <hi>line</hi> 9. <hi>There will appear</hi> (says he) <hi>no</hi> difficulty, <hi>or absurdity in the essential Union of Three Minds by a Mutual-Consciousness to each other.</hi> But will this Man conclude, That where there is no <hi>Absurdity,</hi> there is therefore no <hi>Difficulty</hi> neither? So that, that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves one, must needs remove the other too? It is strange to me, That any one who pretends to argue close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, should place two words so vastly different upon the same level. But again, in <hi>Page</hi> 82. <hi>line</hi> 30. he tells us, <hi>That this gives an intelligible account of one of the most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Problems in all School-Divinity,</hi> viz. <hi>That the whole Trinity is not greater than any one Person in the Trinity.</hi> And again, in <hi>Page</hi> 85. <hi>line</hi> 14. <hi>This Notion</hi> (says he) <hi>gives a plain account too of that Maxime</hi> of the Schools,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101779:23"/>
               <hi>That all the Operations of the Trinity,</hi> ad extra, <hi>are common to all the Three Persons.</hi> So that by this time we see here all things relating to the Trinity, made <hi>plain, easie,</hi> and <hi>intelligible;</hi> and that since this Man has shewed his skill upon it, all knots and difficulties are wholly cleared off; so that now none are to be found, though a Man should beat his Brains as much to find them, as Divines did heretofore to solve them. And therefore well may he magnifie the Exploits of such a Triumphant Hypothesis, as he does, first in his Preface, <hi>Page</hi> 1. <hi>line</hi> 13. (which though it be always placed first in Books, yet is generally written last) Having told us, <hi>That his Original Design was to vindicate the Doctrines of the Trinity, and Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from those pretended Absurdities, and Contradictions which were so confidently charged on them:</hi> He adds these words, <hi>This</hi> (says he) <hi>I am sure I have done; for I have given a very easie and intelligible Notion of a Trinity in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> If he has, 'tis well. But (how great soever the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance is, which he utters this with, as he had always a very great stock of it) I dare aver, That he has here said more of himself, than any Divine of Note, since Christianity came into the World, ever durst say, <hi>He was sure of,</hi> before. But as high as this sounds, in <hi>Page</hi> 85. <hi>line</hi> 27. he raises his Voice something higher, or at least is more particular in the Encomiums he bestows upon this his Performance in these words: <hi>Thus</hi> (says he) <hi>I have endeavoured to explain this great and venerable Mystery of a Trinity in Unity. And this I may say, That I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven not only a very possible, and a very intelligible Notion of it, but such also, as is very agreeable to the Phrase, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Scripture, such as preserves the Majesty of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and solves all the difficulties of it.</hi> By which account, as we see that our Author is not wanting to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his own Hypothesis (as it is pity but <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> and <hi>Self-Commendation</hi> should go together)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101779:24"/>
so we see also, that he does it upon three distinct Heads, or Topicks, which therefore, by his good leave, we will as distinctly consider.</p>
            <p>And First, for it's being so agreeable to the <hi>Phrase and Expressions of Scripture,</hi> I hope amongst these, some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ought to be had of such Texts of Scripture, As that forementioned one in the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. 12. Where (no doubt, with reference to the Mysteries of the Gospel, of which this is one of the chief) <hi>we are said to see but as through a glass darkly, and to know but in part,</hi> &amp;c. neither of which, can I perswade my self to think, is only ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expression for <hi>knowing a thing plainly, easily, and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly, and without any difficulty.</hi> The like may be said of that place in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. where the Apostle speaking to the Saints, he wrote to, of the things reported to them by such as had preached the Gospel (amongst which, this Doctrine, doubtless, had it's place, or an equal diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty at least) he adds, That they <hi>were such things as the Angels desire to look into.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which all Interpreters lay a peculiar weight and Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis upon; as importing both the earnest intention of the Inspector, and the difficulty of the object inspected, from the Posture of such as use to stoop down for the better discerning of such things as cannot otherwise be well perceived, or look'd into. And now, is not this (think we) a most proper and fit posture for such as view and look into things very <hi>plain, obvious,</hi> and <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible?</hi> And yet, I doubt not, but the <hi>Angels,</hi> who are said to use it, could very easily give us the Philosophy of <hi>Rain, Snow,</hi> and <hi>Ice,</hi> of <hi>the Fires burning,</hi> and <hi>the descent of Stones,</hi> and <hi>other heavy Bodies,</hi> which yet this Author will allow <hi>no Man of sense and reason</hi> (without forfeiting the reputation of both) to presume <hi>to give a Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Account of:</hi> Whereas, in the mean time, the <hi>Trinity</hi> is declared to be a very <hi>plain, easie, and intelligible Notion,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:101779:24"/>
even to such Persons as can give no such Account of the other. And thus much for the <hi>Agreement of his Hypothesis with the Phrase and Expressions of Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next head of its commendation is, That it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the <hi>Majesty</hi> of this great Article (as he words it:) But in much the same sense, I suppose, as his <hi>Refusing the Oath,</hi> preserved the <hi>Majesty</hi> of King <hi>William,</hi> and <hi>his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it,</hi> the <hi>Majesty</hi> of K. <hi>Iames:</hi> But, that it <hi>preserves it so, as to have a singular virtue to encrease Men's Veneration of it,</hi> this I very much question, and demur to: Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that old Observation that <hi>Familiarity breeds Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi> holds too frequently, as well as undeservedly, no less in Things than in Persons; which we are more apt to venerate at a distance, than upon a clear, plain, and full knowledge of them. I do not say, That Men ought to do thus; but such is the present state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that thus they use to do. And it is worth our marking; That where a Man is said to know a thing perfectly, he is said <hi>To be Master of it;</hi> and <hi>Mastership</hi> (one would think) is not naturally apt to create in the mind, any great awe for the thing, it is thus Master of. But be it, as it may; this I am sure of, That as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tells us, <hi>That things revealed belong to us,</hi> so the same Scripture tells us also, <hi>That there are secret things, which</hi> (by a kind of sacred enclosure) <hi>belong only to God, Deut.</hi> 29. 29. And till God shall think fit to reveal to us the Nature of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> I, for my part, shall reckon it amongst those <hi>Secret things:</hi> And, accordingly, with all the Pious submission of an humble Reason falling down before it, adore and admire it at a distance; not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but that for this very cause, That Men should do so, God in his Infinite Wisdom thought fit to spread such a Cloud and Veil over it. And therefore I cannot but think, that that Man expressed the due measures of our behaviour to this, and the like Mysteries, extreamly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101779:25"/>
well; who being pressed in the Schools with an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Trinity, in opposition to the Question held by him, gave it no other Answer but this: <hi>Magister, hoc Mysterium Trinitatis ex quo argumentaris, est potiùs flexis genibus adorandum, quàm curiosâ nimis indagine ventilandum.</hi> The Respondent who made this Reply, had the Repute of a Learned and Eloquent Man; and I think this Reply represents him a very Pious, and Discreet one too.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as for the third and last Topick, upon which our Author would recommend his Hypothesis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Trinity, <hi>viz. That it solves all the difficulties of it.</hi> I fear, from what hath been last said, that it will prove as far from being a <hi>Commendation,</hi> as it is from being a <hi>Truth;</hi> especially when the Author himself, after his saying so, in <hi>Page</hi> 85. immediately adds, and that in the very next words, <hi>Page</hi> 86. <hi>line</hi> 1. <hi>That there may be a great deal more in this Mystery than we can fathom,</hi> &amp;c. But now, if our Author will in this manner utter one Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and immediately after it subjoyn another which quite overthrows it, who can help this? <hi>For that a great deal more should remain in this Mystery than we can fathom,</hi> or that there can be any thing unfathomable in that, <hi>in which there is nothing difficult;</hi> or that any thing can <hi>be difficult,</hi> after such an Explication given of it, as <hi>solves all the difficulties of it</hi> (for that is his very word in <hi>Page</hi> 85. the last <hi>Line)</hi> I must freely confess, surpasses my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, to conceive; and God bless his Understanding, if it can.</p>
            <p>It must be confessed indeed (as I hinted before in my Preface) that in a short Treatise lately Published by him, and entituled, <hi>An Apology for Writing against the</hi> Socinians, he seems to deny <hi>the Notion of a Trinity to be comprehensible and easie,</hi> Page 15. telling us, <q>
                  <hi>That there</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology.</note> 
                  <hi>must be infinite degrees of knowledge, where the Object is Infinite; and that every new degree is more perfect than</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:101779:25"/>
                  <hi>that below it: And yet no Creature can attain the highest degree of all, which is a perfect Comprehension; so that the knowledge of God may encrease every day, and Men may write plainer and plainer about these matters every day, without pretending to make all that is in God, even a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Unity, comprehensible and easie,</hi> which he calls, <hi>a Spightful and Scandalous Imputation.</hi>
               </q> By which angry words it is manifest, that he would fain rid himself from those Inconveniences which his former unwary, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd Assertions had involved him in. But by his favour, the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Charge shall take off the <hi>Scandal</hi> from such as make it, wheresoever else it may fix it. For I have fully shewn, That in this his <hi>Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. he has frequently (and as clearly as words can express a thing) affirmed, <hi>a Trinity in Unity to be a plain, easie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Notion:</hi> Where, by <hi>Plain</hi> must be understood either <hi>1st.</hi> Such a <hi>Plainness,</hi> as excludes all Doubts and Difficulties whatsoever: In which sense alone a thing can be said to be simply and absolutely <hi>plain:</hi> And in this sense also it can admit of none, and much less of <hi>Infinite degrees</hi> of <hi>plainer</hi> and <hi>plainer;</hi> since that, which excludes <hi>all</hi> doubts, certainly can exclude no more. Or <hi>2dly,</hi> The word may be taken in a Lax, Popular, and Improper sense; for that which is so <hi>Plain,</hi> as to have no conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable doubt, or difficulty remaining about it. But now, the Notion which Men have of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>of the Trinity,</hi> can never be truly said to be <hi>Plain,</hi> in either of these Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and therefore not at all. For in the first, to be sure, it cannot: No, nor yet in the second. For let Men know never so much of any Object, yet if there remains more of that Object actually unknown, than either is, or can be known of it, such a knowledge can never render, or denominate the Notion of that Object (even in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense of the word) <hi>Plain.</hi> And so, I hope, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will allow it to be in the <hi>knowledge,</hi> Men have of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101779:26"/>
               <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>the Blessed Trinity.</hi> And, whereas he lays no small stress upon this, <hi>That Men may write plainer and plainer of these matters every day,</hi> I must here remind him of two Things. 1. That he would be pleased to tell us, How Men <hi>can write plainer and plainer of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity every Day,</hi> after his new <hi>Notion of it has solved all the Difficulties about it,</hi> as in the forecited <hi>Page</hi> 85. <hi>line</hi> 27. he positively tells us, <hi>it does.</hi> For (as I take it) where <hi>there remains no difficulty,</hi> there must be the utmost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Plainness;</hi> and withal, when Men are once come to the utmost of any Thing, they can then go no further. 2. I must remind him also, That the word <hi>Plainer</hi> in the <hi>Comparative</hi> Degree does not couch under it the <hi>positive</hi> signification of <hi>Plain,</hi> but denotes only a less degree of difficulty, and signifies no more than, That a Thing, or Notion, is not quite so difficult, or obscure, as it was before; which it may very well be, and yet be far from being <hi>Plain,</hi> in either of the two foregoing senses, laid down by us. And therefore, tho' we should admit, <hi>That Men might write plainer and plainer of the Trinity every Day;</hi> yet I affirm notwithstanding, that <hi>the Notion of a Trinity in Unity,</hi> can in no sense be truly said to <hi>be plain and easie,</hi> and much less, <hi>very plain and easie;</hi> nay, so very <hi>plain,</hi> as to have <hi>all the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of it solved,</hi> as this Author has expresly affirmed. So that if this be a <hi>Scandalous Imputation,</hi> it is easie to judge, to whom the Scandal of it must belong.</p>
            <p>But besides all this, I see no cause to grant this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that, which he so freely takes for granted, (for I think it very questionable) <hi>viz. That Men may write plainer and plainer of the Trinity every Day.</hi> For, so far as the Writers of the Church have informed us about this great Mystery, the Catholick Church for above these 1200 Years past, has not only had, and held the same Notion of a Trinity, but has also expressed it in the same
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101779:26"/>
way and words, with the Church at this very day. And for so much of this Mystery, as Divines could give no Account of then, neither have they given any clearer Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it ever since; nor has the Church hitherto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced one step further in this Subject: Which is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident demonstration, that it has already proceeded as far in it, as the Reason of Man could, or can go. And as for any further Discoveries of it, which this Author pretends to from two Phantastick words, found out by himself, it will not be long, before they shall be throughly <hi>weighed in the Balance,</hi> and <hi>found as inconsiderable</hi> as <hi>the Dust of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is one thing more, which I must not pass o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and it is this: That in the Passage, I transcribed from him, he lays down that for a certain Principle, which is indeed an Intolerable Absurdity, <hi>viz. That where the Object is infinite, there must be infinite degrees of knowledge.</hi> Now it is most true, That nothing but <hi>Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite knowledge can adequately comprehend an insinite Object.</hi> For which reason, God alone can comprehend himself, and he does it by one simple, indivisible act, uncapable of Parts, or <hi>Degrees.</hi> But as for <hi>Degrees</hi> of any sort, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>knowledge,</hi> or any thing else, nothing but a Finite Being is capable of them; and therefore for this Man to <hi>assert infinite degrees of knowledge,</hi> when Uncreated know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is uncapable of <hi>Degrees,</hi> and Created knowledge uncapable of <hi>Infinite Degrees,</hi> is a gross thick piece of Ignorance, in the first, and commonest Rudiments of Philosophy.</p>
            <p>But to return to his Absurdities about the <hi>plainness and easiness of the Notion of a Trinity in Unity,</hi> and therein to be as short with him as I can, I shall only demand of him, Whether he does in this <hi>Apology</hi> retract and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all, that in his <hi>Vindication</hi> he has Asserted quite contrary to what he has since delivered in his <hi>Apology.</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:101779:27"/>
If he does, let him declare so much, and I have done; but till then, no regard at all ought to be had to his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;</hi> as serving for nothing else, but to shew, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his accustomed way, and known Character, he has denied some things in one of his Books, which he had positively, and expresly affirmed in another; and consequently proving, <hi>That the Apology, which denies a Trinity in Unity to be comprehensible and easie, and the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, which forty times over affirms it to be plain and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;</hi> nay, <hi>very plain and easie,</hi> ought to pass for the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, undoubted Works of this Author, though they had never born his Name.</p>
            <p>Wherefore upon the Result of all, what shall we, or what can we say to the fore-cited Particulars, which with so much positiveness over and over assert the <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and intelligibility of the Notion of a Trinity!</hi> Which yet has hitherto amazed and nonplus'd the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church. For if it be really so <hi>plain and intelligible,</hi> as this Author tells us, it must to my Apprehension un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably follow, either that a Mystery <hi>is a very plain intelligible Notion,</hi> or that the <hi>Trinity is no Mystery.</hi> I shall not here presume to take this Author's beloved word out of his Mouth, and cry <hi>Nonsence,</hi> and <hi>Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> But certainly if the Trinity <hi>be a Mystery,</hi> and a <hi>Mystery</hi> in the nature of it imports <hi>something hidden, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse,</hi> and by <hi>bare reason not to be understood;</hi> then to say, <hi>we may have a plain, as well as an intelligible Notion</hi> of it; nay, <hi>plain even to a demonstration;</hi> this, to say no more, is as like a Contradiction, as ever it can look.</p>
            <p>But really our Author has shewn himself very kind and communicative to the World: For as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Book he has vouchsafed to instruct us how to judge of <hi>Contradictions;</hi> so in the Progress of his Work he has condescended to teach us (if we will but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101779:27"/>
learn) how to <hi>speak</hi> and <hi>write Contradictions</hi> too. There remains therefore only one favour more, <hi>viz.</hi> That he would vouchsafe to teach us how to <hi>reconcile</hi> them also. For I, for my own part, think it every whit as hard a task to reconcile Contradictions, <hi>as to reconcile</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants; and, I hope, much harder. And yet this latter he has endeavoured to prove in a certain Book, wrote <note place="margin">Answer to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</note> by him in the Year 1685, a thing not to be done. But whether it can, or no, I am sure, he has hardly published any Book since, but what manifestly proves, That there is great need of some <hi>Reconciler</hi> to do the other.</p>
            <p>But why do I speak of reconciling Contradictions? It would be a very troublesome work, if it could be done; and a very uncomfortable one, when it could not: And therefore our Author (to give him his due) has attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a much surer, and more compendious way of clearing himself of this imputation, than such a long and tedious way of reconciling inconsistent Propositions, could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly have been. For having Asserted, <hi>That we cannot justly charge a Contradiction, where we cannot comprehend the Nature of the thing said to be contradicted;</hi> and that, in the next place, <hi>there is nothing in the World (which he knoweth of) the Nature of which we can throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, or comprehend:</hi> I hope it follows, That, where nothing can or ought to be contradicted, (as nothing ought to be, which cannot be comprehended) none can be guilty of a Contradiction. And this, I suppose, none will deny to be an Expedient, every way answerable, and equal to our Author's Occasions: For otherwise I cannot see what can stand between him and the charge of many Scurvy, Contradictory Assertions; but that which shall effectually prove, and make out to us, <hi>That indeed there neither is, nor can be any such thing as a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. II.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Containing an Account of several Terms, commonly made use of in Discoursing of the Divine Nature and Persons; and particularly shewing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of applying the Words, <hi>Essence, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, Nature, Infinity,</hi> and the like, to this great Subject; and lastly proving this Author's Exceptions against the use of them about the same, false, groundless, and impertinent: With some further Remarks upon his forementioned <hi>Apology.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>OUR Author seems so desirous to advance nothing upon this sublime Subject, but what shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly new, that in order to the making way for his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Novelties, he Quarrels with almost all the old words, which Divines, in their Discourses about the Divine Nature, and Persons, were heretofore accustomed to make use of. He can by no means approve of the words <hi>Essence, Substance, Nature, Subsistence,</hi> and such like; as reckoning them the <hi>Causes of all the Difficulties, and seeming Absurdities,</hi> that are apt to perplex Mens minds in their Speculations of the Deity, and the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, 4 <hi>Sect. p.</hi> 68, 69, 70. and therefore they must be laid aside, and made to give way to other Terms, which he judges properer, and more accommodate to those Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. To which purpose, though our Author has fixed upon two purely of his own Invention, (which are to do
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101779:28"/>
such wonderful feats upon this Subject, as in all past A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were never yet seen nor heard of before, and which I therefore reserve in due place to be considered of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by themselves) yet at present the Author seems most concerned to remove, and cashier the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned useless, cumbersome words, and to substitute some better, and more useful, in their room: Such as <hi>Eternal Truth and Wisdom, Goodness and Power, Mind and Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. which being once admitted; and applyed to all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes about the Divine Nature (and an <hi>Act of Exclusion</hi> past upon the other) the way will become presently smooth and open before us, and all things relating to the Mystery of the Trinity (according to our Author's own excellent words) be made <hi>very plain, easie,</hi> and <hi>intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Nevertheless, <hi>as I may so speak</hi> (to borrow another of our Author's Elegancies) <hi>let not him that putteth on his Armour, boast as he that putteth it off.</hi> A great <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missor,</hi> with a great <hi>Hiatus,</hi> being much better at raising an Expectation, than at answering it. And hitherto I can see nothing but words, and vapour: Though after all, it is Performance, and the issue of things alone that must shew the strength and reason of the biggest <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the clearer, and more distinct discussion of the matter in hand, I shall endeavour to do these Four things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I shall shew, That the ground upon which this Author excepts against the use of the Terms, <hi>Nature, Essence, Substance, Subsistence,</hi> &amp;c. in this Subject, is false and mistaken.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I shall shew, That the same Difficulties arise from the Terms, <hi>Truth, Wisdom, Goodness, Power,</hi> &amp;c. used for the Explication of the Divine Being, that are objected against <hi>Essence, Substance, Nature,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:101779:29"/>
III. I shall shew, That these Terms do better, and more naturally explain the Deity, or Divine Being, than those other of <hi>Truth, Wisdom, Goodness,</hi> &amp;c. And,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. And Lastly, I shall shew, That the Difficulty of our Conceiving rightly of the Deity, and the Divine Persons, does really proceed from other Causes.</p>
            <p>These four things, I say, I will give some brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of.</p>
            <p>But because the Subject, I am about to engage in, is of that Nature, that most of the <hi>Metaphysical,</hi> and <hi>School-Terms</hi> hitherto made use of by Divines upon this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will naturally, and necessarily fall in with it, I think it will contribute not a little to our more perspicuous proceeding in this Dispute, to state the Import and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of these Terms, <hi>Essence, Substance, Existence, Subsistence, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Personality,</hi> with such others, as will, of course, come in our way, while we are treating of, and explaining these. And here, first of all, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the old Peripatetick Philosophy, which, for ought I see, (as to the main Body of it at least) has stood it's ground hitherto against all Assaults: I look upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> (a summary word for all things) into <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Accident,</hi> as the Primary, and most Comprehensive (as we hinted before in our first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.) But that I may fix the sense and signification of these Terms, all along as I go, by giving them their respective Definitions, or at least Descriptions, where the former cannot be had, I look upon <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> to be truly and well defined, <hi>That which is;</hi> though, I must confess, it is not so much a perfect Definition, as a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the word from the original Verb <hi>est.</hi> For to define it by the Term <hi>Essence,</hi> by saying, <hi>That Ens, or Being, is that which has an Essence,</hi> though it be a true Proposition, yet I believe it not so exactly proper a Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101779:29"/>
since the Terms of a Definition ought to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more known than the thing defined: Which in the fore-mentioned Case is otherwise. As for <hi>Substance,</hi> I define that to be a <hi>Being not inhering in another;</hi> that is to say, so existing by it self, as not to be subjected in it, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, this way, by it. <hi>Accident,</hi> I define, a <hi>Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent</hi> in another, as in a Subject supporting it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it cannot exist, or support it self. Which Division being made by Terms contradictory, <hi>viz. Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> in <hi>another,</hi> and <hi>not inhering in another,</hi> must needs be adequate, and perfect, and fully comprehensive of the whole that is divided thereby.</p>
            <p>But now, besides these two Terms of <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Accident,</hi> there is another assigned by <hi>Logicians, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicians,</hi> and <hi>School-men,</hi> called, a <hi>Mode of Being,</hi> viz. such a thing, as being added to another, does not make any addition of another Being, or degree of Being to it, but only restrains, and determines it; and may be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an <hi>Affection of a thing, or Being,</hi> by which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, <hi>otherwise indeterminate</hi> and <hi>indifferent,</hi> is <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi> to <hi>some certain respect, state, or condition.</hi> Thus, whereas the Nature of a thing may be considered either as yet in its Causes, or as actually produced, and exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of them, either of these is a <hi>Mode</hi> of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the first rendring it only <hi>Potential,</hi> the other <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual:</hi> Nor is this a meer <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> forasmuch as it affects the Being of a thing antecedently to any Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind passing upon it. And the Reason assigned by some <hi>Logicians</hi> for the allowing and asserting these <hi>Modes,</hi> is this: That some things must necessarily be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to belong to <hi>Being,</hi> which are not <hi>Beings</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to prevent an <hi>Infinite progress in Beings.</hi> For since every thing is capable of being defined, or described, and yet nothing can be defined merely by it self, (an
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101779:30"/>
Identical Proposition being no Definition) it must needs be defined by somewhat or other, distinct from it self; but now if that be also a <hi>Being,</hi> then that likewise must be defined by another <hi>Being,</hi> and that by another, and so on <hi>in insinitum;</hi> which would be most absurd: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if this definition, or description of a thing be made by some <hi>Modus of it,</hi> which is not strictly and properly a <hi>Being</hi> it self, the thing presently stops here, without any necessity of proceeding to any more <hi>Beings.</hi> But perhaps it will be here said, if these <hi>Modes</hi> are not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meer <hi>Nothings,</hi> or <hi>Entia Rationis,</hi> what order, or rank shall they be placed in? Since those ten heads of <hi>Being,</hi> which we call <hi>Predicaments,</hi> cannot seem the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Receptacles of things, which we own not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, or formally, <hi>Beings.</hi> I Answer, That though they are not <hi>Beings,</hi> properly so called, and so not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and upon their own Account, placeable under any of the Ten fore-mentioned Heads of <hi>Being;</hi> yet since they are Appendages of <hi>Being,</hi> as cleaving to it, and depending upon it, they are accounted under, and reduced <hi>to</hi> those respective Heads, or <hi>genera</hi> of <hi>Being,</hi> to which the <hi>Beings</hi> modified by them, do directly belong. Now the Nature of these <hi>Modi</hi> being thus accounted for, we are, in the next place, to take notice of the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> resulting from them, which we call <hi>Modal;</hi> and that is either between two, or more, such <hi>Modes</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one another; as the Personalities belonging to several Persons, differ amongst themselves; or when a thing, or Being, differs from the Mode affecting it; or Lastly, When several things thus modified, or affected, do by vertue of those Modes differ from one another; and thus the Persons in the Blessed Trinity may be said to differ amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:101779:30"/>
I proceed now to those other Terms of <hi>Essence, Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, Nature, Subsistence,</hi> and <hi>Personality.</hi> And first for <hi>Essence:</hi> As I shewed, that <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> might be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defined, <hi>That which is;</hi> so <hi>Essence</hi> may be as truly and properly defined, <hi>That by which a thing is what it is;</hi> that is to say, by which it is Constituted in such a kind, or order of <hi>Being:</hi> And this difference I take to be founded in the different ground, upon which we conceive of the same thing. Accordingly the <hi>Essence</hi> of a thing, no less than the thing it self, may be considered, either as yet in the <hi>Power of its Causes,</hi> and only producible by them, or as <hi>actually existing,</hi> and produced by them. By which we see, that an <hi>Essence,</hi> as such, may be indifferent to exist, or not exist; and that from hence springs the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Existence.</hi> There is indeed a Reality ascribed to it, even without Existence: But that is not properly a reality in the thing it self, but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in respect of the power of its Causes enabling them to produce it; and partly, because it is properly the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Science,</hi> and capable of having true Propositions formed of it, and Demonstrations built upon it: As we may form as true Propositions of a Rose in Winter, and demonstrate all the Properties of it, as of their proper Subject, by their proper respective Principles, as well, as while it is actually flourishing upon the Tree. And this is all the reality which I think can be ascribed to <hi>Essence,</hi> in its separation from <hi>Existence.</hi> As for <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence</hi> it self, it may be defined, that <hi>Mode, or Affection of Being,</hi> by which <hi>a thing stands actually produced out of the power of its Causes;</hi> or, at least, not actually included in any Cause; in which sense God himself <hi>does exist.</hi> From whence it appears, That in Created Beings, <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> bears no such necessary Connexion with <hi>Existence,</hi> since it is not necessarily included in the Nature of any
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101779:31"/>
finite Being, that it must needs be produced, or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Exist. But it must be confessed, That <hi>Existence</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perfection, and, in God especially, a very great one, must of necessity be included in his very <hi>Essence,</hi> as containing in it (formally, or eminently) all sorts, or degrees of perfection. The next Term is <hi>Subsistence,</hi> which is a Mode of Being, by which a thing exists by it self, without existing in another, either as a part in the whole, or an <hi>Adjunct</hi> in the <hi>Subject.</hi> I say an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct,</hi> not an <hi>Accident,</hi> for a Substance may be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct. And, I think, if we would assign a way, by which the humane Nature of Christ exists in the Person of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we shall hardly find out a fitter, than to say, That it exists in it, as an Adjunct in the Subject. For it is certain, That it does not exist in it, as a part in the whole; since by this means, the second Person in the Trinity, must, till his Incarnation, have wanted one part of his Person. But I shall not be positive in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Term here. In the mean time it must be observed, That <hi>Essence and Subsistence really differ,</hi> (so far as a Modal difference is reduced to a <hi>Real)</hi> not only in Created Beings, but also in Uncreate. In Created it is evident; forasmuch as a part divided from the whole, loses the Subsistence which it had from thence, but still continues its Existence, as being still a Substance actually subsisting by it self, and not inhering in any Subject, as Accidents do. Nor is it less evident in the Deity it self, and the Divine Persons belonging to it. For one and the same undivided <hi>Existence,</hi> as well as one and the same <hi>Essence</hi> or Nature belongs to all the three Persons equally; whereas yet every Person has his own proper distinct <hi>Subsistence</hi> by himself; which must make as great a difference between <hi>Existence</hi> and <hi>Subsistence,</hi> as that which unites several Persons into one Nature, and that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101779:31"/>
which personally distinguishes them from one another. And then also for Christ's Person, with reference to his humanity; though this <hi>subsists</hi> by the Subsistence of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, yet it does not properly <hi>subsist</hi> by the <hi>Existence of it,</hi> (since every distinct Nature must have its own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct <hi>Existence)</hi> which shews, That even in the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of this Divine Person, <hi>Existence</hi> and <hi>Subsistence</hi> must be considered as formally different; since something, we see, may relate to, and be affirmed of one, which cannot be affirmed of, or bear the same relation to the other. Now, whatsoever Being, or Nature, this <hi>Mode of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence</hi> does belong to, that is properly called a <hi>Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> as being a thing, which by no means exists in any other, but as a Basis, or foundation, supports such things, or Beings, as exist in it; from which also it receives its Name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And the Consequence of this is, That as <hi>Subsistence</hi> makes a thing, or Being, a <hi>Suppositum;</hi> so suppositality makes it <hi>incommunicable;</hi> since that which makes it uncapable of existing in another, must also hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from being Communicated to another. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Consequence of the same is, That every <hi>Suppositum, or Being, thus Subsisting by it self,</hi> is a compleat Being; that is, such an one as is not made for the <hi>Completion of any other:</hi> For whatsoever is so, must naturally exist in it, as a <hi>part</hi> does in the <hi>whole,</hi> or at least be originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed so to do. This Account being given of <hi>Subsistence,</hi> and of a <hi>Suppositum,</hi> which is Constituted such by it, it will be easie to give an Account also what a <hi>Person</hi> is; which is properly defined <hi>Suppositum Rationale,</hi> or <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligens.</hi> So that as a <hi>Suppositum</hi> is <hi>substantia singularis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleta per se subsistens;</hi> so the <hi>Ratio Intellectiva,</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this, makes it a <hi>Person,</hi> which is a farther perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Suppositality, and the utmost perfection of Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, as Subsistence and Suppositality is the utmost
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101779:32"/>
Bound and Perfection of Existence in all Beings not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent.</p>
            <p>If it be here now asked: Whether <hi>Subsistence,</hi> or <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positality</hi> added to bare <hi>Nature,</hi> does not make a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition? I Answer, That in Created finite Persons it does, but not in Uncreated and Infinite: And the reason is, Because though all Composition implys Union; yet all Union, is not therefore a Composition, but something higher and transcendental; so that in the Divine Persons of the Trinity, The Divine Nature, and the Personal Subsistence coalesce into one, by an Incomprehensible, Ineffable kind of Union and Conjunction. And if this does not satisfie, (as I think it rationally may) I must needs profess, That my Thoughts and Words can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rise higher, nor reach further.</p>
            <p>Having thus stated and fixed the signification of the fore-mentioned Terms, I cannot but remark these two things of the Term, or Word, <hi>Essence.</hi> As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is sometimes taken not only for the <hi>Ratio formalis entis,</hi> but simply and absolutely for an entire En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, or Being it self. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. That those two other Terms, <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> are for the most part used as Terms equipollent, and of the same signification with it: <hi>Nature</hi> being the <hi>Essence</hi> of a thing considered as an Active, Productive Principle; and <hi>Form</hi> being the <hi>Essence,</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> of a thing, as it is the chief Principle, giving Being and Perfection to it, in the way of Composition. Nevertheless it is sometimes also applyed to simple uncompounded Natures promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuously with the other. So that we see here, That <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, Form,</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> generally taken, are only three formally distinct Considerations of one and the same thing; which I thought fit to take notice of, to prevent all cavil, or mistake about the use of these Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:101779:32"/>
I have now gone over, and severally given an Account of the Notions of <hi>Being, Substance, Accident, Modes of Being, Essence, Form, Nature, Subsistence</hi> and <hi>Personality;</hi> and hereby, I hope, laid some foundation for our clearer, and more intelligible discoursing of the great Article we have undertook to rescue from a false <hi>Vindication:</hi> There being hardly any one of all the foregoing Terms, of which a clear and distinct Notion is not highly requisite to a clear, explicite, and distinct consideration of the Subject now before us. Concerning which, I think fit to note this, That (so far as I can judge) the thing now in dispute is not, what fully and exactly expresses, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the Nature of God (for nothing can do that:) But what is our best and most rational way of conceiving and speaking of him, and subject to fewest Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and for this, we shall debate it, whether this Author, or we take the best course.</p>
            <p>These things being thus premised, and laid down, we shall now resume the four Heads first proposed to be spoken of by us, and Discourse of them severally: And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I shall shew, That the Ground upon which this Author excepts against the use of the Terms <hi>Substance, Essence, Subsistence,</hi> &amp;c. in treating of this Subject, is false, and mistaken. His Exceptions against them we find in <hi>Page</hi> 68, 69, and 70. of his Book. <q>
                  <hi>The great difficulty</hi> (says he) <hi>of conceiving a Trinity of Persons in one Infinite and undivided Essence, or Substance, arises from those gross and material Ideas, we have of Essence and Substance, when we speak of the Essence, or Substance of God, or Created Spirits.</hi> We can form no Idea of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but what we have from matter; <hi>that is something extended in a triple dimension of length, breadth, and depth, which is the Subject of those Qualities, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:101779:33"/>
                  <hi>and subsist in it. And therefore, as matter is the Subject of all sensible Qualities, so we conceive some such Substance of a Mind, or Spirit, which is the Subject of Will and Understanding, Thoughts and Passions; and then we find it impossible to conceive how there should be three Divine Persons, which are all Infinite without three distinct Infinite Substances, each distinct Infinite Person having a distinct Infinite Substance of his own: And if we grant this, it seems a plain Contradiction to say, That these three distinct Infinite Substances are but one Numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Infinite Substance,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Thus far our Author: And I freely grant, That this does not only <hi>seem</hi> (as he says) but really is a <hi>Contradiction.</hi> And, before I have done with him, I will prove to him also, That to say, <hi>That three distinct Infinite Minds are but one Numerical Infinite Mind,</hi> (which shall be effectually laid at his Door) or, <hi>That three distinct Infinite Minds, are not three distinct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Substances, or Essences,</hi> are as gross, and palpable Contradictions as the other. But he goes on in the same Page a little lower, <q>We know nothing <hi>(says he)</hi> of the Divine Essence, but that God is an Infinite Mind; and if we seek for any other Essence, or Substance in God, but an Infinite Mind; that is, Infinite Wisdom, Power, and Goodness, the Essence of God, though considered but as one Numerical Person, is as perfectly unintelligible to us, as the one Numerical Essence, or Substance of three Divine Persons in the ever-blessed Trinity.</q> In which words, I think this Author guilty of a double Absurdity. One, That he supposes a <hi>Mind</hi> not to be an <hi>Essence,</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;</hi> and it is manifest, that he does so, since he finds fault with <hi>Substance,</hi> and puts <hi>Mind</hi> in the room of it: Whereas a <hi>Mind</hi> is really a <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Nothing;</hi> not that there is <hi>nothing</hi> in the World besides <hi>Substance,</hi> but nothing else which a <hi>Mind</hi> can be properly said to be.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101779:33"/>
His other Absurdity is, his supposing <hi>Mind, Wisdom, Power,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> to be the same; whereas <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> are not properly a <hi>Mind,</hi> but the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Attributes of a <hi>Mind.</hi> And here let not our Author tell me, That they are all one and the same thing in God: For that is no News; yet nevertheless, <hi>Mind, Wisdom, Power, Goodness,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>formally</hi> distinct from one another, and so not affirmable of one another: And in speaking of things, the <hi>formal</hi> differences of them must still be attended to: God's <hi>Iustice</hi> and his <hi>Mercy</hi> are one pure simple Act in Him; but he that says, His <hi>Iustice</hi> is his <hi>Mercy,</hi> speaks absurdly for all that: And he who says, That a <hi>Mind</hi> is <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or <hi>Goodness,</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> &amp;c. speaks just at the same rate.</p>
            <p>But again in <hi>Page</hi> 70. <q>
                  <hi>It is this gross and material imagination</hi> (says he) <hi>about the Essence and Substance of the Deity, which occasions all the difficulties about the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one God, as well as of a Trinity in Unity. For we cannot imagine how any Substance should be without a beginning, how it should be present in all places without parts and without extension, how Substance, Essence, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence, and</hi> all Divine Attributes and Powers <hi>(which are distinct things in Created Spirits) should be all the same and one simple Act in God,</hi> &amp;c.</q> From all which we are (according to this Author) to conclude, That the Terms <hi>Substance, Essence,</hi> and <hi>Existence,</hi> ought to be laid aside in all Discourses of the Deity; as serving for nothing but to cause in us those false Notions of it. Nor are those only excepted against, but also all <hi>Divine Attributes and Powers;</hi> for in his last words (newly quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) he equally joyns and puts them all together. And what monstrous work this must needs make in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and Discourses of God, shall, I hope, in the process of this Dispute, be made to appear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:101779:34"/>
In order to which, I do here first of all, in opposition to what this Author has Asserted about <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> lay down this Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Substance</hi> in the proper Nature, and Notion of it, includes no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with, or respect to <hi>Matter</hi> at all. And this I prove to him by one plain Argument, before I proceed to any thing that is Metaphysical, viz. <hi>That there was Substance in the World before ever there was Matter;</hi> and therefore the Notion of the former does not essentially include in it the Notion of the latter: For, surely, if the Being of one might be without the Being of the other, the Notion of the one may be no less without the Notion of the other too. Now that there was Substance in the World before Matter, I prove from this, That there was a <hi>Being existing by it self,</hi> in the World, before Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore there was <hi>Substance:</hi> For this is the very definition of <hi>Substance,</hi> That <hi>it is a Being existing by it self,</hi> and consequently they must reciprocally infer one another, as the definition and the thing defined by it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do. And then, that there was a <hi>Being thus exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting by it self,</hi> before Matter, is proved from hence, That there was a Being which produced Matter, which nothing but a Being existing by it self could do. And now I would fain know of our Author, Whether we may not have a clear and distinct Conception of such a Being, without so much as thinking of Matter. And if we may, (as I see nothing to hinder us) then it is false, that the Notion of Substance does necessarily engage our thoughts in, or confound them with the Idea of Matter. Besides, all the World does, and must allow, that we may have a full and perfect Conception of a <hi>Genus,</hi> or Generical Nature of a thing, without considering any of its <hi>Species.</hi> And withal, that it is impossible, that such a Generical Nature should include in it any one of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101779:34"/>
Differences of the things, which it is Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to, and which are contained under it; for if so, then one <hi>Species</hi> would include in it the Specifick diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the other opposite <hi>Species;</hi> forasmuch as includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it the Generical Nature, it must include all that is included in that Nature too: Which would be infinitely absurd. But now Substance is a Generical Nature, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually communicable both to Material and Immaterial Substances, as to two distinct <hi>Species;</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in its Precise Conception, implys nothing of Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in it; and for that cause may be conceived and known, and distinctly represented to our minds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Nay, and to shew further the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Substance,</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> in the proper Notions of each, This Proposition, <hi>Substance is not Matter,</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true; true, I say, <hi>particularly</hi> though not <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally;</hi> that is, with reference to all those Substances, the Nature of which excludes all Matter, as the Nature of Angels, and of the Souls of Men, confessedly does. But now, if the general Nature of Substance essentially im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in it Matter, it could not be truly said of any one particular Substance in the World, <hi>That it is not Matter.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> I know, makes <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate, or rather the same. But methinks, though some have lately wrote after him in his lewd Politicks, no Divine should venture to fall in with him in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philosophy too, for fear of some certain Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, which, it is too well known, must follow from it. In a word, the first thing to be conceived in God, is, <hi>That he is a Being;</hi> the next, <hi>That he is a Being exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by it self;</hi> that is, in other words, <hi>He is a Substance:</hi> And therefore, I hope, we may both form an Idea of Substance, and afterwards apply it to God, without plunging our selves into the gross Imaginations of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101779:35"/>
And so far do all other Divines, and Philosophers differ from this Man, that they affirm the word <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> much more properly, and really applicable to God, than to any of the Creatures; which certainly it could never be, if it implyed any such essential cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Matter, either in the Nature, or Notion of it.</p>
            <p>It is evident therefore, That there is no necessity from the thing it self to justifie this Author's Objection. And as for those gross and Material Imaginations of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, taken up and borrowed from Material Corporeal things, nothing can be inferred from thence to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For is it good arguing to conclude, That because a thing is actually thus or thus, it cannot possibly be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise? Do not some form to themselves gross and absurd Imaginations of God the Father, from that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the <hi>Ancient of Days,</hi> Dan. 7. 9. representing Him to their thoughts, as an Old Man sitting in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? But may not others therefore, who are wiser, conceive more worthily of him, without laying aside that Scripture-expression? If it be a good Argument (as it is all our Author brings) that Terms, which may occasion gross and Material Imaginations in the Minds of Men, ought not to be applyed to God; then I hope it is as much an Argument in one thing as in another. And accordingly I desire to know of him, Whether the Terms <hi>Begetting,</hi> and <hi>being begot, Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> are not very fitly applyed to, and used about the Divine Persons? And if so, Whether they are not altogether as hard to be abstracted from material Imaginations, as the Notions of <hi>Essence,</hi> or <hi>Substance</hi> are, or rather, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, much harder? I believe all thinking Men will conclude they are. Nay, and I shall venture to tell him further, That these two words, partly through their Corporeal signification, and partly through the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101779:35"/>
weakness of Men's Minds, have occasioned more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties about the Notion of a <hi>Deity,</hi> and a <hi>Trinity</hi> too, than ever the words <hi>Essence,</hi> or <hi>Substance</hi> did, or perhaps could do: And yet, for all that, the Spirit of God has thought sit to make use of them to express so sacred a Mystery by. But this Man should have remembred, That how gross and Material soever the Representations of things are, which our senses first make to us, there is a <hi>Iudicium Correctivum</hi> in Reason, as the superiour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, which is to consider and separate what is gross and Material in them, from what is otherwise, till at length by rejecting some Notions, and retaining others, it finds out something even in the most Material things, which may truly, properly, and becomingly be applyed to the purest and most Immaterial. But to give a fuller Account of this matter, we must observe, That the Idea of <hi>Substance</hi> may be said to be taken from <hi>Matter</hi> two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Remotely and <hi>Occasionally;</hi> as the Observation of Material Things may first set Reason to work, which in the strength of its own Discourse may draw from thence the knowledge of Immaterials, as the Apostle tells us in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. That the <hi>Invisible things of God, from the Creation, were clearly seen and understood from the things that are made,</hi> viz. Such visible sensible Objects, as Men daily converse with: And if so, then surely these do not necessarily dispose the Mind of Man to gross and Material Imaginations of the things so apprehended by it. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Idea of Substance may be said to be taken from Matter <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>exemplarily,</hi> as when the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination does, (as it were) transcribe and copy one from the other, and take one for the representation of the other; and this, I confess, must needs imprint a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101779:36"/>
gross Idea of <hi>Substance</hi> upon the Imagination: And to this way may be referred all those gross and Material Ideas of Substance, which this Author so much exclaims against. But then, all this is from the neglect of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in not imploying his Reason to correct and refine the first reports of Sence, as he might and ought to have done; and if from hence we conclude an utter Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in the thing it self to be improved and heightened into Immaterial Representations, and thereupon to be conceived and spoken of agreeably to them, we must even expect a Teacher to be sent down from Heaven to furnish us with a new Language, or we must shut up our Mouths, and put up our Pens, and not speak, or write of Divine Matters at all.</p>
            <p>And therefore whereas this Author further adds, in <hi>Page</hi> 70. <hi>That we cannot imagine how any substance should be without a Beginning, and how it should be Present in all places.</hi> I tell him, This is not the Point in Controversie, Whether we can imagine it, or no? But I tell him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, That it is as easie for the Mind of Man to conceive all this of <hi>Substance,</hi> as of any thing else whatsoever. For, Why not <hi>a Substance without Beginning,</hi> as well as <hi>Truth, or Wisdom, or Goodness,</hi> without a Beginning? I say, Let him shew me some solid Reason why. In the mean time, I can tell him, That of the two, it should seem less difficult to imagine the Eternal Existence of <hi>Substance,</hi> than of <hi>Truth;</hi> since Substance is in order of Nature before it; as the Subject must needs be before that which affects it. Though in very deed, the main difficulty here, is not so much to find out which of those Perfections may be the most easily conceived to have been without a Beginning, as it is to bring the mind to a full and clear Conception, How any thing at all is so? While it finds it self wholly at a loss in running up its
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101779:36"/>
thoughts still higher and higher, without any bound or stint to determine them. And this it is, and not the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nature of Essence, or Substance, that nonplusses and confounds our Reason in these unlimited Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And whereas he goes on in the next words, and tells us, That we cannot imagine, How <hi>Substance, Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, and all the</hi> Divine Attributes <hi>and Powers should be all one and the same simple Act in God?</hi> I Answer, What if we cannot? Must nothing be applyed to God, but what shall let us into the full knowledge of all that is difficult and mysterious in the Divine Nature? Or will this Man say, That the Application of the Terms <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> to God, is the true cause and reason, why we cannot apprehend, <hi>How Substance and Existence, and all the</hi> Divine Attributes and Powers, <hi>are one and the same simple Act in God?</hi> For this is the thing that he has been professedly driving at, and therefore ought to prove. And besides, as what he has here alledged, is nothing to his purpose, without the proof of that, so it is all but a meer fallacy, <hi>a fallacy of the Accident:</hi> For albeit, we cannot apprehend how all these Attributes are one and the same simple Act in God, yet surely it will not follow hence, that we cannot apprehend them singly and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by themselves, and as we so apprehend them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them properly and fitly to God. And here I cannot but take notice of a way of Arguing usual with this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as, <hi>I cannot conceive,</hi> and <hi>I cannot understand,</hi> and <hi>I cannot imagine,</hi> &amp;c. After which, as if he had laid down irrefragable Premises, he concludes, That the thing it self is not to <hi>be conceived, understood,</hi> or <hi>imagined.</hi> But for my part, I must be excused, that I cannot allow this Man's single Judgment (or prejudice rather) for the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Standard, or measure of humane Reason; or that such a way of discoursing proves any thing but the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101779:37"/>
assuming humour of him who uses it; and one strangely full of Himself, instead of better things.</p>
            <p>In conclusion therefore, I do here assert, That the gross and Material Imaginations which Men form to themselves of <hi>Substance,</hi> proceed not from the thing it self, but from the grossness and fault of the Persons who take up these Imaginations. And accordingly I affirm to this Author, That that Assertion of his in <hi>Page</hi> 69. <hi>That we can form no Idea of Substance, but what we have from Matter,</hi> is false, and manifestly proved to be so. And moreover, That it is not only as possible, but as easie to form in the mind, a conception of a <hi>Substance, or Being Existing by it self</hi> (which is all one) as abstracted from, and strip'd of all conception of Matter and Corporeity, as it is to frame to our selves a conception of <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or of a Being eternally True and Wise, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from all those gross Qualifications: And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the word <hi>Substance,</hi> with others of the like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, may be most fitly and significantly applyed to the Divine Nature and the Persons of the Holy Trinity, which was the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>But because our Author avers, in <hi>Page</hi> 70. <hi>That if we consider God as Truth and Wisdom, which is his true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Essence, without confounding our mind with some material conceptions of his Substance</hi> (as he had already af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed all conceptions of Substance must needs be) <hi>then these things (viz.</hi> the Difficulties before-mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Apprehensions of God) <hi>are all plain and easie.</hi> Where, by the way, it is observable, That he <hi>calls Truth and Wisdom the true</hi> Nature and Essence <hi>of God;</hi> whereas in this very <hi>Page,</hi> as well as in 68. he had excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Term <hi>Essence,</hi> no less than that of <hi>Substance,</hi> as (by reason of the gross Material Ideas raised by it in the Mind) very unfit to be applyed to God. So happy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101779:37"/>
is this Author above other Men, that he can rectifie the most improper words and expressions barely by his own using them.</p>
            <p>But because he is so positive in making the Terms <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> an effectual Remedy against all the Inconveniences alledged from the Terms <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Substance,</hi> as applyed to the Deity, this brings us to our second <hi>Proposition, viz.</hi> That the same Objection lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Terms <hi>Truth, Wisdom, Goodness,</hi> &amp;c. as appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the Deity, that are made against <hi>Essence, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, Existence,</hi> and the like. In order to the proving of which, I shall observe, That <hi>Truth</hi> may be taken in a three-fold sense.</p>
            <p>First, For the truth of Propositions, which is called Logical.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For an Affection of Being, which is Truth Metaphysical. And</p>
            <p>Thirdly and Lastly, As it is a Qualification of Men's Words and Actions, and consists properly in an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Mind with both.</p>
            <p>Concerning all which I observe, That the Truth of Propositions is no further eternal, than as it exists in the Mind of God. That the Metaphysical Truth of Things is eternal, or not eternal, as the Being, or Thing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to, is, or is not so. And for the Moral Truth of Men's Words and Actions, it is no more eternal than the said Words and Actions, the proper Subject of them, can be said to be. This premised, I would here ask our Author, Whether the first Notions we actually enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> are not drawn from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations we make of these things in Men; that is, in Beings sensible and Material, and consisting of Body as well as Soul, and accordingly cloathed with sensible Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Circumstances? I cannot imagine that he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101779:38"/>
will deny this, since we do not speak immediately, or converse visibly with God, or Angels; and I suppose also, that he now speaks of <hi>Truth, Wisdom, Goodness,</hi> &amp;c. not as they are exhibited to us in Books, or Propositions, but as they actually exist and occur in persons, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently as they are first apprehended by us in Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Conjunction with Men; that is, with Beings so Compounded, Qualified, and Circumstantiated, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove expressed, and as we find, see and observe them, in Men's Words and Actions, in what they speak, and what they do; and these are certainly very sensible things, and such as incurr into, and affect the sence as much as Matter it self can do. And if so, I desire to hear some satisfactory Reason, Why the Observation of <hi>Substance</hi> in Material Beings, and our first <hi>Occasional</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of it from thence, should so necessarily pervert, and cause such a grossness in our Conceptions of it, as to make it hardly (if at all) possible to conceive of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> without the gross Conception of Matter; and yet that the same consideration and cause should not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually take place in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and equally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and thicken our Apprehensions of them, when they are equally drawn from sensible, gross, and Material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>viz.</hi> the Words and Actions of Men, which they both Exist in, and Converse about? For I can see no ground why the same Reason should not infer the very same thing, and the same Antecedents draw after them the same Consequents, whatsoever they are applyed to. For the Argument <hi>à Quatenus ad omne,</hi> &amp;c. is certain and infallible.</p>
            <p>If it be here said, That <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Notion and Conception of them, imply no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication at all with Matter: I Answer, That as the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them is Abstracted, and gathered up by the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101779:38"/>
Discourses of Reason it does not; but so neither does that of <hi>Substance,</hi> after such an Act of the Mind has passed upon it. So that hitherto the Case is much the same in both.</p>
            <p>But to carry the matter a little further. <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> as observed in and amongst Men, are certainly finite Things. For whatsoever exists in a finite <hi>Subject</hi> (whatsoever the <hi>Object</hi> be which it converses about, or is terminated upon) is certainly it self finite also. And here I would have this Author tell me, Why a Notion drawn off, and borrowed from finite Things, should not be as apt to perplex and confound our Minds, when applyed to an Infinite Being; as a Notion abstracted from a <hi>Material Being,</hi> can be to distract and confound our Thoughts when applyed to an Immaterial? I must confess, I can see nothing alledgeable for one, which may not be as strongly alledged for the other. All that can be said, is what has been mentioned already, <hi>viz.</hi> That Reason may, and does extract some Notions from a finite Being, that may be properly applicable to an Infinite, due allowance made for the disproportion between both; and in like manner I affirm, That it can and does draw Notions from a thing endued with Matter, which may as well agree to Things Spiritual and Immaterial. So that I cannot perceive, that <hi>Truth, Wisdom,</hi> or <hi>Goodness,</hi> have upon this Account any Preheminence, or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over <hi>Essence, Substance, Existence,</hi> and the like Terms at all, but the one may be applyed to the Divine Nature as well and properly as the other.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; for I affirm in the 3d <hi>Place,</hi> That <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, Substance, Nature, Existence,</hi> and other Terms equipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to Being, considered precisely in and by themselves, are naturally fitter to express the Deity by, than those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Terms, <hi>Truth, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> contended for by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101779:39"/>
our Author. This is our Third Proposition; and for the proof of it I first appeal to that high and glorious Account, which <hi>God</hi> himself gave of his own Nature, when <hi>Moses</hi> desired to be informed of it, viz. <hi>I am that I am,</hi> Exod. 3. 14. In which he describes himself only from his <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Substance,</hi> which indeed rendered him more eminently, and even more <hi>substantially,</hi> and truly <hi>a Being or Substance,</hi> than all other Beings or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances whatsoever, which, in comparison of him, can hardly be so much as said to <hi>Exist</hi> or <hi>Be.</hi> And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that God knew his own Name and Nature, and withal, how to give the best and most proper De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Both, as well as the Author of <hi>Self-Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and Mutual-Consciousness</hi> does or can pretend to do. And indeed this seems to have been the very Character by which God would be then known to all the World, <hi>viz.</hi> All the Rational part of the Creation; for it was sent to his People, then living under, and with a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Prince, to answer them and him even in those No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a God, which meer Nature suggested to all Mankind; and consequently were so known and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them, that they could not easily question, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them. For otherwise we know God addressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the same People afterwards in a Character ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly different, and more peculiar, viz. <hi>A God Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and Gracious, Long-suffering, abundant in Goodness and Truth, and pardoning Iniquity, Transgression, and Sin,</hi> Exod. 34. 6, 7. Which, it seems, was the Opening a Particular Attribute to them, which the bare Account of his Being (as known as it was) could not sufficiently inform the World of before.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to other Considerations, vastly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed inferiour to this, but yet of singular use in their degree, to direct our Speculations about these Matters,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101779:39"/>
I have some other Things to offer in behalf of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position laid down by us.</p>
            <p>As First, That all Divines hitherto have looked upon, and professedly treated of <hi>the Divine Nature and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,</hi> as different and distinct from one another; still considering the first as the <hi>Subject,</hi> and the other as the <hi>Adjuncts</hi> of it; or, at least, as Analogous to these Terms as they stand properly applyed to other Things. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which Notion, as the <hi>Subject,</hi> or that which is Analagous to it, naturally both precedes and supports the <hi>Adjuncts;</hi> so all Notions importing the Divine <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Being,</hi> or <hi>Substance,</hi> are to be accounted as <hi>the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> in respect of all God's other Attributes, or Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whether they be <hi>Truth, Wisdom, Goodness, Power, Eternity, Omniscience,</hi> or any other whatsoever. Which being so, I do here affirm, That the Terms <hi>Essence, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, Existence,</hi> and others Synonymous to them, ought to have the Precedence of the other Divine Perfections, commonly called <hi>Attributes,</hi> in their Application to God, and that upon a three-fold Account, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Of Priority.</item>
               <item>2. Of Simplicity.</item>
               <item>3. Of Comprehensiveness. <hi>Of each of which severally.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. For that of <hi>Priority.</hi> As we have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, That the first thing in order of Nature Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable of God, is, <hi>That he is a Being;</hi> and the next to it, <hi>That he is a Being existing by it self,</hi> or (in another word) <hi>a Substance;</hi> so the same is yet further evidenced from this, That the Notion of Being, or Substance, is that, which fully answers and determines the last Question and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, which can be made concerning God. For if we describe his Nature by any particular Attribute, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101779:40"/>
and be thereupon asked, <hi>What that is?</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given an Answer to that Question, be afterwards urged with another, and perhaps another; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, after an Answer given to those also, the Enquiry be still continued, till at length we Answer, <hi>That God is a Being; a Being existing by it self,</hi> that is, a <hi>Substance.</hi> Then we must of necessity stop, and can go no further; which makes it evident even to a Demonstration, That this is the first and Original Notion which we have, or can have of God. Forasmuch as that which answers the last Enquiry, or Question, naturally made concerning any thing, is certainly the first Thing into which the Being, or Reason of that Thing is resolved. And thus much for <hi>Priority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pass we now to the <hi>Second Thing,</hi> which is the <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi> of these Terms, For <hi>Primum in omni genere sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicissimum.</hi> So that when we say, <hi>God is a Being exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by it self,</hi> viz. <hi>A Substance;</hi> this includes in it no respect to, and much less any Conjunction with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thing or Notion whatsoever: But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Truth, Goodness, Power,</hi> &amp;c. are all Affections of Being, or Substance, and so connote a Relation to, and a Conjunction with it, as their <hi>Subject.</hi> So that to give you the same thing in words at length, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> are nothing else but <hi>Being, or Substance, with these Qualifications,</hi> or Being and Substance under such cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain respects formally determining them to such a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> either of <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Understanding,</hi> as <hi>Truth</hi> determines them, or of <hi>Conformity to the Will,</hi> as <hi>Goodness</hi> does. So that in these, and all other the like Attributes, <hi>Being or Substance</hi> do, as it were, pass from their absolute and Original Simplicity by the Accession of the fore-mentioned Perfections superadded to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:101779:40"/>
And then in the <hi>Third and last place.</hi> For the <hi>Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness</hi> of Being, or Substance, above any one, or more of the Divine Attributes. This also is evident; foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it runs through and contains them all, which no other particular Attribute does, or can be said to do. And certainly that which signifies <hi>Being</hi> in the whole compass and perfection of it, should be much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applicable to God; than that, which signifies <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> only under some certain and particular determination of it, as every one of his Attributes does, and no more. For we cannot say, That <hi>God's Justice, Mercy, Wisdom, Holiness and Power,</hi> are properly contained under, and formally attributable to his <hi>Truth,</hi> but they are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under, deducible from, and referible to his <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>Substance.</hi> So that it may properly be said, That God is an <hi>Infinitely True, Wise, Good, Holy, Omnipotent, Omnipresent Being</hi> or <hi>Substance.</hi> But we cannot with any propriety of Speech pitch upon any one of the other <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi> and in like manner affirm all the rest of that one. As to say that God is an Infinitely Wise, Good, Eternal, Omnipotent, Omnipresent <hi>Truth.</hi> This (I say) cannot be equally said: For though the Thing be fundamentally true, yet the Expression is neither Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nor Natural: Forasmuch as <hi>Goodness, Justice, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, Omnipresence,</hi> and the like, are not the proper Affections of Truth, but they are properly so of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> or <hi>Being.</hi> And moreover, Whereas this Author will needs have the Terms <hi>Substance, Essence,</hi> and <hi>Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> discarded, and the Terms <hi>Truth, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> put in their room, when we speak of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; I desire him to give me some good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why he pitches upon <hi>Truth, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> rather than upon <hi>Eternity, Omnipotence</hi> and <hi>Omnipresence.</hi> For these, in their proportion, express the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:101779:41"/>
as much as the other; but neither the one nor the other can grasp in the whole Compass of the <hi>Divine Perfections,</hi> so as to be properly denominable from all and every one of them, as <hi>Substance,</hi> and <hi>Essence,</hi> and such other Terms as barely import <hi>Being,</hi> are found to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I conclude therefore, that in our Discourses of <hi>God, Essence, Substance, Nature,</hi> and the like, are so far from being necessary to be laid aside, as disposing our Minds to gross and unfit Apprehensions of the Deity; that they are much fitter to express and guide our thoughts about this great Subject, than <hi>Truth, Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> or all of them together, as importing in them both a <hi>Priority,</hi> and a greater <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and larger <hi>Comprehensiveness of Notion,</hi> than belong to any of them; and these surely are Considerations most peculiarly suted to, and worthy of the Perfections of the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now done with my <hi>Third Proposition,</hi> and so proceed to the <hi>Fourth and last,</hi> viz, <hi>That the Difficulty of our Conceiving rightly of the Deity and the Divine Persons, does really proceed from other Causes, than those alledged by this Author.</hi> I shall assign Three: As,</p>
            <p>First, <hi>The Spirituality of the Divine Nature. For God is a Spirit,</hi> Joh. 4. 14. And it is certain that we have no clear, explicit, and distinct Idea of a Spirit. And if so, must we not needs find a great difficulty in knowing it? For we know Things directly by the Idea's, the <hi>Species Intelligibiles,</hi> or Resemblances of them, imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Intellect, and these are refined and drawn off from the <hi>Species Sensibiles,</hi> and sensible Resemblances of the same imprinted upon the Imagination. And how can a Spirit incur directly into that? Indeed not at all. For we can have no knowledge of a Spirit by any direct Apprehension, or Intuition of it; but all that we know of such Beings, is, what we gather by Inference,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101779:41"/>
Discourse, and Ratiocination: And that is sufficient. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second Reason of our Short and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Notions of the Deity, is, <hi>The Infinity of it.</hi> For this we must observe, That we can perfectly know and comprehend nothing, but as it is represented to us under some certain Bounds and Limitations. And therefore one of the chief Instruments of our Knowledge of a Thing, is the Definition of it. And what does that signifie, but the bringing, or representing a Thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der certain Bounds and Limitations, as the <hi>Geeek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> manifestly imports? Upon which Account what a loss must we needs be at, in understanding, or knowing the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> when the very way of our knowing seems to carry in it something opposite to the thing known? For the way of knowing, is by <hi>Desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Limiting,</hi> and <hi>Determining:</hi> and the Thing known is that, of which there neither are nor can be any Bounds, Limits, Definitions, or Determinations. And this, I think, is not only a sufficient, but something more than a sufficient Reason, why we stumble and fail, when we would either have, or give a distinct Account of the Deity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Third Reason of the same, especially with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Trinity of Persons belonging to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> is, <hi>The utter want of all Instances and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this kind.</hi> For when a long and constant course of Observation has still took notice that every numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally distinct Person, and every <hi>Suppositum</hi> has a numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally distinct Nature appropriate to it, and Religion comes afterwards, and calls upon us to apprehend the same Numerical Nature, as subsisting in three Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically distinct Persons; we are extreamly at a loss how to conform our Notions to it, and to conceive how that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101779:42"/>
can be in three Persons, which we never saw before, or in any thing else, to be but onely in One. For humane Nature, which originally proceeds by the Observations of Sense, does very hardly frame to it self any Notions, or Conceptions of Things, but what it has drawn from thence. Nay, I am of Opinion, That the Mind is so far governed by what it sees and observes, that I verily believe, that had we never actually seen the beginning or end of any Thing, the generality of Men would hardly so much as have imagined, That the World had ever had any beginning at all: Since with the greatest part of Mankind what <hi>appears,</hi> and what does <hi>not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</hi> determines <hi>what can,</hi> and <hi>what cannot be,</hi> in their Opinion.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shewn Three Causes (which I take to be the True Causes) why we are so much to seek in our Apprehensions of, and Discourses about the Divine Nature, and the Three Glorious Persons belonging to it. And the Reason of them all is founded upon the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Disparity which the Mind of Man bears to so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate, and so transcendent an Object. So that it is a vain thing to quarrel at Words and Terms, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially such as the best Reason of Mankind has pitched upon as the fittest, and properest, and most significant to express these great Things by. And I question not, but in the Issue of all, wise Men will find, That it is not the defect of the Terms we use, but the vast Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility of the Thing we apply them to, which is the True Cause of all our Failures, as to a clear and distinct Apprehension and Declaration of what relates to the Godhead.</p>
            <p>From all which I conclude, That the Terms, <hi>Essence, Substance, Nature, &amp;c.</hi> have had nothing yet objected against them, but that they may still claim the place, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101779:42"/>
continue in the use, which the Learned'st Men the <hi>Christian Church</hi> hath hitherto had, have allotted them in all their Discourses and Disputes about the Divine Nature, and the Divine Persons; which are confessedly the greatest and most Sacred Mysteries in the Christian Religion. But as in my time, I have observed it a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice at Court, That when any one is turned out of a considerable Place there, it is always first resolved (and that out of <hi>merit foreseen,</hi> no doubt) who shall succeed him in it: So all this ado in dismounting the Terms <hi>Essence, Substance, Nature, &amp;c.</hi> from their ancient Post, I perceive, is only to make way for these two so highly useful and wonder-working Terms, <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness.</hi> And therefore let us, with all due and awful Reverence (as becomes us) expect their August appearance, and for a while suffer the <hi>Mountain</hi> to swell, and <hi>heave up its Belly,</hi> and look big upon us, and all in good time, no doubt, we shall have the happiness to see and admire, and take our measures of the <hi>Mouse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I close this Chapter, to shew how like a Judge upon life and Death, this Man sits over all the formerly received Terms, by which Men were wont to discourse of <hi>God,</hi> Sentencing and Condemning them as he pleases; not content to have cashiered the words <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, Substance</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> from being used about this Subject, he has as great, or greater a Quarrel at the word <hi>Infinite,</hi> as applyed to <hi>God;</hi> and I shall here give his Exceptions against it in his own words, being such, as I believe few would dare to utter but himself, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching so near, or rather quite coming up to Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, that it may be truly said, That he has not spoke more blasphemously of <hi>God's Vindictive Iustice</hi> in his <note place="margin">See my Preface.</note> 
               <hi>Book of the Knowledge of Christ,</hi> than he has spoken
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101779:43"/>
of <hi>God's Infinity</hi> in this: For in the 77, 78, 79 <hi>Pages,</hi> he expresses his Thoughts of it thus. <hi>The truth is</hi> (says he) <hi>this very word</hi> Infinite <hi>confounds our Notions of God, and makes the most perfect and excellent Being the most perfectly unknown to us. For</hi> Infinite <hi>is only a Negative Term, and signifies that which has no end, no bounds, no measure, and therefore no positive and determined Nature, and therefore is Nothing,</hi> (mark that) and withal, <hi>That an Infinite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had not Use and Custom reconciled us to that expression, would be thought Nonsence and Contradiction.</hi> Which I am so far from granting him, that I affirm, if there had never been any thing in the World besides <hi>God</hi> alone, it had yet been most True and Rational. But he goes on. <hi>For</hi> (says he) <hi>every Real Being has a certain and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Nature, and therefore is not Infinite in this sense, which is so far from being a Perfection, that it signifies Nothing Real.</hi> Thus he discourses: And yet this word <hi>Infinite</hi> has been universally received and applyed to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> by Learned Men in all Places and Ages; and I desire this Man to tell me, How, if this word <hi>Infinite</hi> were so liable to be thought <hi>Nonsence</hi> and <hi>Contradiction,</hi> this could possibly come to pass. For what he speaks of <hi>Use and Custom reconciling us to this Expression,</hi> is Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and begs the Thing in dispute. For still I would know of him, how a word so utterly unfit to express the Thing it was applyed to, could ever pass into <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Custom,</hi> so as to be took up, approved, and made use of by all Mankind. Let him prevail with the whole World to speak <hi>Nonsence,</hi> and to use words that <hi>signifie nothing,</hi> if he can. But this Man, before he played the <hi>Aristarchus</hi> at this rate, should have done well to have considered, That every Term is not <hi>Negative,</hi> which has a <hi>Negative Particle</hi> in the Composition of it. Of which, innumerable Instances may be given. And if
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101779:43"/>
he does not know this, for all his flirting at his <hi>Socinian Adversary,</hi> as if he <hi>knew neither</hi> Greek <hi>nor</hi> Latin, <hi>P.</hi> 95. it is a scurvy sign that he is not so over-stocked with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them as to have any to spare.</p>
            <p>And therefore, whereas he goes on in <hi>Page</hi> 78. and pretends there to explain this word <hi>Infinite,</hi> he might have kept his Explication to himself. For no body ever used it otherwise, but so as to signifie a <hi>Positive Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> by it, but yet withal connoting an <hi>Illimitation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it. It signifies, I say, a Thing <hi>Real, Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> and <hi>Positive,</hi> but still with a Connotation of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which is to be removed from it, and denied of it; such as are all <hi>bounds and limits</hi> in respect of that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial, All-comprehending Perfection of the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> In a word, the Thing principally signified by this Term, is <hi>Positive,</hi> the Thing Consignified, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted, (which is but Secondary and Consequential) is a <hi>Negation.</hi> And this sufficiently overturns all his odd Descants upon it. But if, after all, our Minds cannot fully master this Notion, <hi>Persons,</hi> as thinking as he can be, know, and acknowledge, that it is not the <hi>word In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,</hi> but the <hi>Thing Infinite,</hi> that renders them so short and defective in this matter.</p>
            <p>But it is pleasant to see him take his Turns backwards and forwards in speaking of this Thing. <hi>There is</hi> (says he) Page 78. <hi>a measure of the most Absolute and (in this sense) Infinite Perfections;</hi> and if such a <hi>measure</hi> there be, then I hope there is as much <hi>Nonsence</hi> and <hi>Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> in the word <hi>Immense,</hi> as in the word <hi>Infinite;</hi> and withal, if there is even in the most <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Infinite Perfections,</hi> a <hi>no plus ultrà,</hi> and an <hi>ultimum quod sic</hi> (as the <hi>School-men,</hi> who were never bred at St. <hi>Mary Ove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> are apt to speak) then I confess, That an <hi>Infinite,</hi> with all these <hi>Qualifications</hi> about it, must needs (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101779:44"/>
to his beloved Dialect) be <hi>Nonsence</hi> and <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi> and that of the highest Rank. And again, <hi>P.</hi> 79. <hi>We know not</hi> (says he) <hi>how far Infinite Wisdom, and Power, and Goodness reaches,</hi> (and thus much is very true) but then (says he again) <hi>we certainly know that they have their</hi> Bounds, <hi>and that the Divine Nature is the utmost</hi> Bounds <hi>of them.</hi> By which words if he means, That they have their fixed determinate Notions, whereby they are formally distinguished among themselves, as well as from other Things, it is right. For the Notion of <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wisdom</hi> is so bounded, that it cannot be said to be <hi>Infinite Power,</hi> or <hi>Infinite Power</hi> to be <hi>Infinite Goodness,</hi> or the like; but still the Thing couched under all these is <hi>Infinite,</hi> and neither has nor can have any <hi>Bounds</hi> set to its Being. And if he should here reply, That then the Notion of <hi>Infinite Wisdom, Power,</hi> and the like, are false Notions, as not answering the Things they are applyed to. I answer, That they are indeed imperfect and <hi>inadequate,</hi> as not fully answering the Thing it self, but they cannot be said to be <hi>false</hi> for all that. But on the contrary, if he will needs have the Thing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by signified to have any Real Bounds or Limits of its Being; then it will and must follow, That in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited words he has with Accurate and Profound Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation presented to us <hi>An Infinite with</hi> Bounds, <hi>and the Divine Nature</hi> (which has no Bounds) <hi>made the</hi> Bounds <hi>of it.</hi> These are the very words he uses; and withal delivered by him with such a Magisterial Air and Contempt of the whole World besides, who have hitherto approved and made use of these Expressions, (and that in a Sense and signification not to be born down by every self Opiniator, after so long and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal a Prescription) that so much Confidence cannot be sufficiently wondred at, nor too severely rebuked.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:101779:44"/>
And therefore to review a little the foregoing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and thereby to take some estimate of the Man; Where shall we find such another Instance of a <hi>private Presbyter,</hi> who in the Communion, or rather in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bosom of so pure and Orthodox a Church, as this our <hi>Church of England,</hi> ever before durst, in so great an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> draw his Pen against all the Writers of the Church Ancient and Modern, Fathers and School-men, and with one dash of it explode and strike off all those received Terms by which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly explained this Mystery, as not only useless, but mischievous in all Discourses about it? Whereas (not to anticipate what I intend more particularly and fully upon this Head in my Eighth Chapter,) I shall only affirm thus much at present; That the <hi>Greek</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in expressing the <hi>Godhead,</hi> or <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they do not use the Words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, constantly express it by <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> were commonly used in the same sense. And likewise the <hi>Latins,</hi> where they express not the same by <hi>Deitas,</hi> or <hi>Divinitas,</hi> do as constantly express it by <hi>Natura</hi> and <hi>Substantia;</hi> which words stand now particularly condemned by this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming Man; and that, not only in Defiance of all the Ancients, but also of the <hi>Church of England</hi> Her Self, which has set her Authorizing Stamp upon those Two Words, <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> by applying them to this Subject both in her <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Liturgy.</hi> In the first of them teaching us, <hi>That in the Unity of the Godhead there are three</hi> Persons, <hi>of one</hi> Substance, <hi>Power and Eternity.</hi> Artic. 1. And in her <hi>Liturgy</hi> rendring the <hi>Athanasian Creed</hi> by the same words, <hi>Neither confounding the</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <hi>nor dividing the</hi> Substance. As likewise that Passage in the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> by the <hi>Son's being of one</hi> Substance
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101779:45"/>
               <hi>with the Father.</hi> And again in the <hi>Doxology</hi> at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion on <hi>Trinity Sunday,</hi> it gives us these full and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words, <hi>One God, one Lord, not one onely</hi> Person, <hi>but three</hi> Persons <hi>in one</hi> Substance. After all which, with what face can this strange, Anomalar Son of the Church (while he is sucking her Breasts, and at the same time poysoning the <hi>Milk,</hi> with which she should feed her Children.) I say, with what Face can he aver to the World, That this word <hi>Substance</hi> thus embraced, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and used by her, ought to be thrown away, as the Direct Cause of all the Errours Men are apt to fall into, about this great Mystery? And that we can have no <hi>Notion of Substance,</hi> but what <hi>implies in it something gross and material?</hi> Which, were it so, can any one imagine, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> would ever have made use of such a <hi>word,</hi> as could serve for nothing, but a Snare and a Trap to betray the Understandings and Consciences of Men, into such Errours as may cost them their Souls? This is so fouly Reflexive upon her, that I would have any Man living give me a good Reason, Why this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor should not be call'd upon by Publick Authority to give the Church satisfaction for the Scandal given to all the Orthodox Members of it, by the Contumely and Reproach which he has passed upon those <hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Words</hi> which She has thought fit so solemnly to express her <hi>Faith</hi> and her <hi>Devotions</hi> by. But some Men, (such is the Regard had to her Laws and Discipline) will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to utter and write any Thing, that the Bookseller will pay them for, though they throw their Conscience and Religion into the Bargain.</p>
            <p>But <hi>God</hi> himself, <hi>who resisteth the Proud,</hi> seems to have took the Matter into his own Hands, and (to shew his <note place="margin">Some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology.</note> Controlling Providence over the Minds and Hearts of Men) has at length brought this Scornful Man <hi>to eat his</hi>

That instead of wounding</hi> Christianity <hi>in its Vitals, they only prick the Fingers of</hi> Hereticks, <hi>and secure</hi> Christianity <hi>from being wounded.</hi> All these great and good Things he tells us have been done in behalf of Christianity by the <hi>School-men,</hi> and their fore-mentioned <hi>Terms,</hi> here in this <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;</hi> and now if the <hi>Reader</hi> will but look back into the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101779:47"/>
               <hi>Vindication</hi> too, our Author will there tell him also, <hi>How,</hi> and by <hi>what Way</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> the said <hi>School-men</hi> and their <hi>Terms</hi> have Atchieved all these worthy Feats, viz. <hi>By their</hi> Obscuring <hi>instead of</hi> Explaining <hi>the Doctrine of the Trinity. By their</hi> mistaking <hi>the Meaning of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or clogging it with peculiar Niceties of their own.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>by confounding the Mystery of the Trinity, through a vain endeavour to reduce it to such Terms of Art, as</hi> Essence, Substance, Subsistence, Nature, Person, <hi>and the like.</hi> As likewise <hi>by the said terms being found very</hi> unapplicable <hi>to this Mystery.</hi> And lastly, <hi>Because though some tolerable Account might possibly be given of their meaning, yet that it would be of little or</hi> no use <hi>to give any such Account, or Explication of them: So useful</hi> (it seems) does he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them, to <hi>secure</hi> Christianity <hi>against</hi> Hereticks, that it is <hi>of no use</hi> at all to <hi>explain</hi> them. And now, I hope, when the <hi>Reader</hi> has considered, what this <hi>Author</hi> has said on both sides, he will acknowledge, that <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Glove</hi> cannot more exactly agree, than the <hi>Vindication</hi> and the <hi>Apology.</hi> And as for that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Stander-by,</hi> upon whose Account this <hi>Apology</hi> is pretended to have been written, if he will but read and compare the <hi>Apology</hi> and <hi>Vindication</hi> together, I dare undertake, that he will not be half so <hi>Melancholy</hi> as he was before.</p>
            <p>But does this <hi>Author,</hi> in sober sadness, think that this is the way to <hi>Confute Hereticks,</hi> thus to play backwards and forwards, to say, and unsay, and only to set two Books together by the Ears? Let me tell him, <hi>That</hi> God <hi>is not mocked,</hi> nor the World neither; and that he owes an Account, of what he has wrote, to both. For my own part, so far as my Converse reaches, I meet with no serious and judicious Person, who does not reckon, that this <hi>Author,</hi> by his <hi>Desultorious Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent,</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:101779:47"/>
but withal <hi>Imposing</hi> way of writing, will in all likelihood make Twenty <hi>Hereticks,</hi> before he Confutes One.</p>
            <p>It is indeed an amazing Thing to consider, That any one Man should presume to Brow-beat all the World at such a rate; and we may well wonder at the force of Confidence and Self-Conceit, that it should be able to raise any one to such a pitch. But <hi>Naturalists</hi> have observed, That Blindness in some <hi>Animals,</hi> is a very great Help and Instigation to Boldness. And amongst Men, as <hi>Ignorance</hi> is commonly said to be the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> so in accounting for the Birth and Descent of <hi>Confidence</hi> too, (whatsoever other Cause some may derive it from) yet, certainly, He who makes <hi>Ignorance the Mother of this</hi> also, reckons its Pedigree by the <hi>surer side.</hi>

                  <hi>In which the Author's New Notion of</hi> Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness <hi>and</hi> Mutual-Consciousness, <hi>is briefly declared.</hi> Self-Consciousness <hi>made by him the formal Constituent Reason of</hi> Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality <hi>in all Persons, both Create and Uncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; and on the contrary, proved against him in the first place, That it is not so in Persons Create.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>OUR <hi>Author</hi> not being satisfied with the Account given of the Mystery of the Blessed Trinity by the Schools, nor with those Notions about it, which have hitherto obtained in the World, till he came into it (no doubt as a Person peculiarly sent and qualified to rectifie all those Imperfect, and Improper Notions, which had been formerly received by <hi>Divines.)</hi> He, I say, with a Lofty Undertaking Mind, and a Reach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all <hi>before,</hi> and indeed <hi>beside</hi> him, and (as the Issue is like to prove) as much <hi>above</hi> him too, undertakes to give the World a much better, and more satisfactory Explication of this great Mystery, and that by two new Terms, or Notions, (purely and solely of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention) called, <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness;</hi> which, though still joyned together by our <hi>Author</hi> in his Explication of the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101779:48"/>
yet very different Effects, as we shall presently see.</p>
            <p>For by <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> he means, a Mind's, or Spirit's being Conscious to its own Thoughts, Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Affections, (and I suppose all other Internal Motions too) which no other finite Spirit is, or can be naturally Conscious to, but it self. And this (he says) makes a finite Spirit Numerically one, or <hi>one with it self,</hi> (for he uses both Expressions) and withal sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and distinguishes it from all other Spirits; so that hereby every Spirit feels only its own Thoughts, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or Motions, but is not Conscious to the Thoughts, Passions, or Motions of any other. And this (so far as his own Words import) he means by <hi>Self-Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Mutual-Consciousness.</hi> That takes place, when two or more Spirits, or Minds know all that of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which each Mind, or Spirit knows of its self, by a particular <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> of its own. And this, I conceive to be a just Account of what this Man means by <hi>Mutual-Consciousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Effects of these two (as I noted before) are very different.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> (according to him) is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituent Principle, or formal Reason of Personality. So that <hi>Self-Consciousnss</hi> properly Constitutes, or makes a Person, and so many <hi>Self-Consciousnesses</hi> make so many distinct Persons.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> so far as it extends, makes an Unity, not of Persons, (for Personality as such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports distinction, and something personally Incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable;) but an Unity of Nature in Persons. So that after <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> has made several distinct Persons, in comes <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> and sets them all at <hi>one</hi> again;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101779:49"/>
and gives them all but one and the same Nature, which they are to take amongst themselves, as well as they can. And this is a True and strict Account of this <hi>Author's</hi> New <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> and such, as I suppose, he will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept against, because justly, I am sure, he cannot; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I may have expressed the Novel Whimsey some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the <hi>Reader's</hi> Diversion.</p>
            <p>Now, by what has been said, it is evident, that the <hi>Author</hi> assigns <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> as the formal Reason of Personality, in all Persons Universally, whether Finite, or Infinite, Create, or Uncreate, For having first sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it so in Finite and Created Spirits, <hi>Pag.</hi> 48. <hi>lin.</hi> 26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He afterwards applies it to Infinite and Uncreate, <hi>viz.</hi> the Three Persons of the <hi>Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, that we may proceed fairly, and without any ground of Exception in the Case, we will examine:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Whether or no <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> be the Reason of Personality in <hi>Finite Persons?</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Whether it be so in <hi>Infinite?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And First, For <hi>Finite,</hi> or Created Spirits. I deny <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> to be the formal Reason of Personality in these. And before I give my Reasons against it, I shall premise this one Consideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the formal Reason of Personality is, there is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality. And again, That wheresoever Personality is, there is the formal Reason of Personality, <hi>viz.</hi> That they exist Convertibly, and that one Mutually and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially infers the other.</p>
            <p>Now this premised and laid down, my Reasons, why I deny <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> to be the formal Reason of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality in Finite, or Created Beings, are these.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:101779:49"/>
1. <hi>Argument.</hi> According to the Natural Order of Things, <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> in Persons, pre-supposes their Personality, and therefore is not, cannot be the Reason of it. The <hi>Argument,</hi> I conceive, is very plain. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever pre-supposes a Thing, is in Order of Nature Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterior and Subsequent to the Thing so pre-supposed by it; and again on the other hand, the formal Reason of any Thing is in Order of Nature precedent to that Thing, of which it is the Reason. We will therefore prove the Major Proposition. And we do it thus. Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality is the Ground and Principle of all Action, whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is. For where there is a <hi>Suppositum,</hi> whether it be <hi>Rational,</hi> (which is another word for Person) or not, still it is the whole <hi>Suppositum,</hi> which Acts. So that there must be a Person before there can be an Act, or Action proceeding from, or attributable to a Person. In a word, there must be a Person in Being, before any Action is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues from him; and therefore the Act must essentially and necessarily pre-suppose the Person for the Agent. But now <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> does not only do this; but (which is more) it also pre-supposes another Act Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to it self. For it is properly and formally a <hi>Reflex Act</hi> upon the Acts, Passions, or Motions of the Person whom it belongs to. So that according to the Nature of the Thing, there is not only a Person, but also an Action (which is, and must be Subsequent to a Person) that is Antecedent to <hi>Self-Consciousness;</hi> which being a <hi>Reflex Act,</hi> must needs in Order of Nature be Posterior to the Act reflected upon by it. And therefore <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> which is by two degrees Posterior to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality, cannot possibly be the <hi>formal Reason</hi> of it. This I look upon as a Demonstration of the Point. And I leave it to our <hi>Author</hi> (who is better a great deal at
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101779:50"/>
scorning the Schools, than at confuting them) to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer and overthrow it <hi>at his leisure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Second <hi>Argument</hi> is this. The Humanity, or Humane Nature of Christ, is perfectly Conscious to it self of all the Internal Acts, whether of Knowledge, Volition, Passion, or Desire, that pass in it, or belong to it; and yet the Humanity, or Humane Nature of Christ is not a Person, and consequently <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is not the proper formal Reason of Personality; foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it may be in that, which is no Person. That the Humane Nature of Christ is thus <hi>Self-Conscious,</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, since it has all the Principles and Powers of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reflection upon its own Acts, whereby it intimately knows it self to do what it does, and to be what it is, which are in any particular Man whatsoever; so that if any Man be Conscious to himself of these things, the Humane Nature of Christ, which has the same Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Powers in perfection (and those essentially proper to, and inseparable from it self) which the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are endued with, must needs be so too. And then, as for the Assumption, <hi>That the Humane Nature of Christ is not a Person,</hi> is no less evident. Since it is taken into, and subsists in and by the Personality of the second Person of the Trinity, and therefore can have no distinct Personality of its own; unless we will with <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius</hi> assert two Persons in Christ, an Humane, and a Divine. And the Truth is, If <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> were the formal Reason of Personality, since there are two destinct <hi>Self-Consciousnesses</hi> in Christ, no less than two distinct Wills, an Humane, and a Divine, <hi>viz.</hi> One in each Nature, I cannot see how, upon this <hi>Author's Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi> to keep off the Assertion of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> That there are <hi>Two distinct Persons</hi> in him also.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:101779:50"/>
3. My Third <hi>Argument</hi> against the same shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from <hi>the Soul of Man in a state of separation from the Body.</hi> And it is this: The Soul in its separate Estate is Conscious to it self of all its own Internal Acts, or Motions, whether of Knowledge, Passion, or Desire, and yet the Soul in such an Estate is not a Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is not the formal Reason of Personality; for if it were, it would and must Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Person, wheresoever it was. Now, that the Soul, in its separate Estate, is thus <hi>Self-Conscious,</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose no body will pretend to deny, but such as hold a Psychopannychisme, <hi>viz.</hi> such a dormant Estate, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it void of all Vital Motion or Action, during its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Body. But this being an Errour which few now a-days think worth owning, neither shall I think worth the disproving.</p>
            <p>But for the <hi>Minor Proposition, That the Soul in its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Estate is not a Person.</hi> In this I expect to find some Adversaries, and particularly our <hi>Author</hi> himself, who expresly affirms, <hi>That the Soul in such a separate Estate is a Person,</hi> Pag. 262. <hi>A Soul</hi> (says he) <hi>without a Vital Union to an Humane Body, is a Person.</hi> Nor does he bestow the Name and Nature of a Person upon the Soul only as separate from, but also (as shall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made appear) as it is joyned with the Body; which Assertion of his, together with some others of near Affinity with it, shall in due place be examined by themselves.</p>
            <p>At present in Confirmation of my <hi>Argument,</hi> I shall produce my <hi>Reasons</hi> against the Personality of the Soul, held by this <hi>Author,</hi> and in order to it, shall lay down this Conclusion in direct Opposition to his, <hi>viz. That</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:101779:51"/>
               <hi>the Soul of Man is not a Person.</hi> And since (as we have noted) he holds, that it is so, both in its Conjunction with the Body, and its separation from it; I shall bring my <hi>Arguments</hi> against the Personality of it in both.</p>
            <p>And First, I shall prove, That the Soul while joyned to, and continuing in the Body, is not a Person; and as a Ground-work of the proof thereof, I shall only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise this one Thing, as a Truth acknowledged on all Hands, viz. <hi>That the Soul and Body together constitute the Person of a Man.</hi> The same being plainly Asserted in the <hi>Athanasian Creed,</hi> where it tells us, <hi>That the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Soul and Flesh, is one Man,</hi> [or one Human Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son] for both signifie but the same Thing; which being thus laid down, as a Thing certain and confessed, I Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus: If the Soul and Body in Conjunction consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the Person of a Man, then the Soul in such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction is not a Person. But the former is true, and therefore the latter must be so too. The <hi>Proposition</hi> is proved thus: Nothing which, together with the Body, Constitutes a Person, is, or can be it self a Person. For if it be, then the Body must be joyned to it, either by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assumed into the Personal Subsistence of the Soul, as the Human Nature of Christ is assumed into the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Subsistence of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Whereupon the <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of a Man, will be an Hypostatick Union between Soul and Body: which I suppose, no body will be either so bold or absurd, as to affirm; all Divines accounting an Hypostatical Union so peculiar to Christ's Person, as not to be admitted in any other <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> whatsoever. (For an <hi>Hypostatick Union,</hi> and an <hi>Hypostatick Composition, viz.</hi> Such an one as makes a Compound Hypostasis, are quite different things: and this <hi>Author</hi> shall in due time be taught so much, if he has any thing to object against it.) Or,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:101779:51"/>
Secondly, The Body must be joyned with the Soul, as one part, joyntly concurring with another, to the Composition of the whole Person. And if so, then the Soul being a <hi>Part,</hi> cannot possibly be a <hi>Person.</hi> Forasmuch as a <hi>Part</hi> is an <hi>Incomplete Being,</hi> and therefore, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nature of it, being designed for the Completion of something else, must subsist in and by the Subsistence of the whole. But a Person imports the most complete Degree and Mode of Being, as Subsisting wholly by it self, and not in or by any other, either as a Subject of Inherence or Dependence. So that it is a direct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the very Definition and Nature of the Thing, for the same <hi>Being</hi> to be a <hi>Part</hi> and a <hi>Person</hi> too. And consequently that which makes the Soul the former, does irrefragably prove it not to be the other.</p>
            <p>Besides, if the Soul in the Composition of a Man's person, were an entire person it self, and, as such, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with the Body towards the Constitution of the Man; then a Man would be an Imperfect, Accidental, and not a Perfect, Natural Compound. He would be that which Philosophy calls <hi>Unum per Accidens,</hi> that is, a thing made up of two such <hi>Beings,</hi> as cannot perfectly coalesce and unite into <hi>one.</hi> For a <hi>Complete Being</hi> (as every <hi>Person</hi> essentially is) having received the utmost degree of Subsistence, which its Nature can give it, if it comes afterward to be compounded with another Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether Complete, or Incomplete, it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily make such a loose, unnatural Union and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. But to assert, That the person of a Man is such a Compound, would be exploded by all who understood any thing of Natural Philosophy. So that it would be a very idle thing to attempt any further Confutation of it. Let this <hi>Author</hi> overthrow these Reasonings, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Assertion against them if he can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:101779:52"/>
But having thus disproved the <hi>Personality of the Soul while in Conjunction with the Body,</hi> I go on to disprove it also while in a state of Separation from it: Which I do thus. If the <hi>Soul</hi> in such a state be a <hi>Person,</hi> then it is either the same <hi>Person,</hi> which the <hi>Man</hi> himself was, while he was living and in the <hi>Body;</hi> or it is another <hi>Person:</hi> But to Assert either of them, is extreamly Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, and therefore equally Absurd, That the <hi>Soul</hi> in such a state should be a <hi>Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And First, It is Absurd to affirm it to be the same <hi>Person.</hi> For a <hi>Person</hi> compounded of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> as a <hi>Man</hi> is and a <hi>simple uncompounded Person,</hi> as the <hi>Soul</hi> (if a <hi>Person</hi> at all) must needs be, can never be numerical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one and the same. For that, differing from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Compound,</hi> they differ as two things, whereof one implies a Contradiction and Negation of the other. A Compound, as such, including in it seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts compounding it. And a <hi>simple Being</hi> utterly excluding all <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Composition.</hi> So that if a <hi>Man,</hi> while alive, be one <hi>Person,</hi> and his <hi>Soul</hi> after his Death be a <hi>Person</hi> too, it is impossible for the <hi>Soul</hi> to be one and the same <hi>Person</hi> with the <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then for the other part of the <hi>Disjunction.</hi> To Assert, That they are two distinct <hi>Persons,</hi> is as Absurd as the other, as drawing after it this Consequence, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is one <hi>Person</hi> who lives <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> in this World, to wit, the <hi>Man Himself</hi> while he was personally in the <hi>Body;</hi> and another <hi>Person,</hi> who passes out of the <hi>Body</hi> into Heaven or Hell, there to be rewarded, or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (at least till the Resurrection) for what that other <hi>Person</hi> had done well or ill here upon Earth. And does not this look mightily agreeable to all the Principles of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Divinity?</hi> Nevertheless so much is certain,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101779:52"/>
That wheresoever there are two distinct <hi>Persons,</hi> we do, and must by all the <hi>Rules of Grammar and Logick,</hi> say, That one of them is not the other; and, where one is not the other, we cannot in Truth or Justice say, That one ought to account for what was done, or not done by the other. But then, if it be intolerably Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, (as no doubt it is,) That the <hi>Soul</hi> in the other World should not be responsible for what the <hi>Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> in <hi>Person</hi> had done in this, then it is altogether as Absurd and Intolerable, for any one to represent and speak of these Things under such Terms and Notions, as must necessarily throw all Discourse and Reasoning about them, into <hi>Paradox</hi> and <hi>Confusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis needless to insist any longer upon a thing so clear, or to add any other <hi>Arguments</hi> in so plain a Case. And indeed to me, the <hi>Soul</hi>'s thus changing its state for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and backwards, from one <hi>manner of Subsistence</hi> to another, looks very odd and unnatural. As, that from an <hi>Incomplete state in the Body,</hi> it should pass to a <hi>Personal and Complete state</hi> out of the <hi>Body,</hi> (which state is yet preternatural to it) and then fall back into an <hi>Incomplete state</hi> again by its re-union to the <hi>Body</hi> at the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which yet, one would think, should rather improve our principal parts, in all respects, not merely relating to the <hi>Animal Life;</hi> as the bare <hi>Subsistence</hi> of them, I am sure, does not.) These things, I say, seem very uncouth and improbable, and such as ought not, without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Necessity, to be allowed of; which here does not appear; since all this Inconvenience may be avoided, by holding, That the Soul continues but <hi>a Part of the whole Person,</hi> and no more, in all its Conditions.</p>
            <p>And thus having proved our Assertion against the <hi>Personality of the Soul,</hi> Whether <hi>in the Body,</hi> or <hi>out of it;</hi> let us now see what may be opposed to it.</p>

And here, I suppose, some will object, That the <hi>Soul</hi> in a state of <hi>Separation,</hi> is not properly a <hi>Part,</hi> foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it exists not in any <hi>Compound,</hi> nor goes to the <hi>Composition</hi> of it. To which I answer, That an Actual Inexistence in a <hi>Compound,</hi> is not the onely Condition which makes a Thing a <hi>Part,</hi> but its Essential Relation to a <hi>Compound;</hi> which Relation is founded partly upon its <hi>Original Designation,</hi> and partly upon its <hi>Natural Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> to be an Ingredient in the Constitution of a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</hi> And this Relation to the <hi>Compound,</hi> I affirm the <hi>Soul</hi> to retain, even while it is separated from it; as is evident from what both Philosophers and Divines hold concerning the <hi>Soul, viz.</hi> That even in its Separation and Disjunction from the Body, it yet retains a strong Appetite and Inclination (as well as an Essential Apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) to return and be re-united to it: Which Re-union also we know will be effected at the great and last Day.</p>
            <p>But you will say, Does not the Scripture, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. speaking of <hi>Blessed Souls</hi> in a state of Separation from the <hi>Body,</hi> call them, <hi>The Spirits of Just Men made perfect,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; And if those Just Men were made <hi>Perfect,</hi> must it not have been in respect of <hi>the Perfection of their Souls,</hi> since their <hi>Bodies</hi> were then rotting, or (rather) rotten under Ground? And if they derived this <hi>Perfection</hi> from their <hi>Souls,</hi> must not their <hi>Souls</hi> have been eminently perfect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which rendred them so? And if perfect, can we deny them the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Personality,</hi> (which as we have shewn) in <hi>Rational Beings,</hi> carries in it the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Natural Perfection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which I Answer, That the <hi>Perfection</hi> here spoken of, is not <hi>Natural,</hi> but <hi>Supernatural;</hi> and relates only to the Consummation of their <hi>Graces,</hi> and not to the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101779:53"/>
manner of their <hi>Subsistence.</hi> Which being the only Thing now in dispute, this Scripture, which speaks only of the former, can make nothing at all to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Purpose.</p>
            <p>Having thus evinced, that the Soul, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is neither during its Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Body, nor its Separation from it, properly a Person; and having withal shewn the grounds and Reasons upon which I conclude it impossible to be so, I shall however think it worth while something more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to examine (as I promised) this Author's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and peculiar Notions of <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> as he applies them to the Soul, even while it is joined with the Body also. And first in the 268th Page, he discourses of it in this manner. <hi>All the Sufferings</hi> (says he) <hi>and Actions of the Body, are attributed to the Man, though the Soul is the</hi> Person, <hi>because it is the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Governing Power, and</hi> Constitutes <hi>the Person.</hi> These are his words, and they contain a very pleasant way of arguing, though wholly contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, known Rules of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> For according to these, one would, and must have concluded, That for this very Reason, <hi>That all the Actions and Sufferings of the Body</hi> (and he ought to have added of the Soul too) <hi>are ascribed to the Man,</hi> therefore the Man himself, to whom these Personal Acts are ascribed, must indeed be the Person, and that for the same reason also, the Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so. But our Author has a way of Reasoning by himself. For (says he) <hi>The Soul is the Person, because it Constitutes the Person.</hi> But for that very Cause, say I, The Soul is not the <hi>Person.</hi> For whatsoever Constitutes a Person, must do it either efficiently or formally. That is, either as a Principle producing it, or a Principle compounding it. As for the first way, whatsoever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101779:54"/>
a person efficiently, must do it either by Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Generation; but this the Soul (as much a <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Power as it is)</hi> is not able to do. For will any one say, That the Soul can either Create or Generate the Person, or (to speak more plainly) the Man who is the Person? And then, for the other way, by which it may be said to Constitute a Person, to wit, <hi>formally.</hi> This it can do no otherwise than as it is a <hi>Constituent Part,</hi> and therefore only as a <hi>Partial,</hi> and not a <hi>Total</hi> Adequate Cause of the Constitution. That is, in other words, the Soul, as the <hi>Form,</hi> must concur with the Body as the <hi>Matter,</hi> to the Constitution of the whole Person of the Man. But then for that very Reason again, the Soul cannot possibly be a Person, since it contributes to the Constitution of the Person only as a <hi>Part;</hi> which, by reason of its <hi>Incomplete Being,</hi> can upon no Principle of Philosophy be a <hi>Person.</hi> And I would fain have this profound <hi>Philosopher</hi> give me but one allowed Instance, where one Person is the constituent Principle of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But to examine the forementioned Assertion yet more particularly, since this Man so peremptorily says, <hi>That the Soul is the Person, because it is the Superiour Power, and Constitutes the Person.</hi> I must tell him, That the <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Power</hi> is not therefore the sole Power, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot solely Constitute the Person, which yet this Author pretends it does. If indeed he had said, That the Soul as the <hi>Superiour Power</hi> bears the chief and principal part in the Constitution of a Person, this had been sence, but by no means sufficient for his purpose; for still this would not prove the Soul to be a Person, (which he contends for) but on the contrary, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to concur thereto only as a <hi>Part,</hi> demonstrate it, upon the same Account, not to be a <hi>Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:101779:54"/>
But this is not all, for in <hi>Page</hi> 169. he calls the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man a <hi>Person,</hi> and thus Discourses about it. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> (says he) <hi>Vertues and Powers have Personal Acts and Offices ascribed to them only upon the Account of their Unity and Sameness with the mind in which they are, which is a Person, and Acts by them.</hi> Now this also is very odd and strange (could any thing in this Author, which is <hi>odd,</hi> be <hi>strange</hi> too;) For the thing Asserted by him amounts to neither more nor less than this, That <hi>Powers, Faculties,</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> have <hi>personal</hi> Acts ascribed to them upon the account of their Unity and Sameness with that, which it self neither is, nor can be a <hi>Person;</hi> as we have abundantly proved, That the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man, (taking it in his sense for the <hi>Soul)</hi> cannot be. And for his further Conviction, I could tell him of something which has <hi>personal</hi> Acts very remarkably ascribed to it; and yet neither for being it self a <hi>Person,</hi> nor for its <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Sameness</hi> with the <hi>Mind,</hi> in which it is, and which sometimes acts by it. And that, if he pleases to turn to 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. he will find to be that notable Grace and Virtue, called <hi>Charity;</hi> which, being but an <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> I believe, that even this Author himself will not affirm to be a <hi>Person;</hi> and, I am sure, as little can be said for any <hi>Unity</hi> or <hi>Sameness</hi> that it has with the Mind, which it is lodged in: Since, though it should be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost, the Mind would nevertheless retain all the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials of a Mind, and continue as truly a Mind, as it was before: Which, I think, is but an ill <hi>Argument</hi> of any <hi>Unity or Sameness</hi> between the Mind and that; and this being indubitably true, all that this Author here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses about <hi>personal</hi> Acts being ascribed to the Mind, and about their <hi>Identity</hi> with the Mind, as the Reason of it, is with equal mistake and impertinence alledged by him in this case. For he might and should have
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101779:55"/>
known, That <hi>personal</hi> Acts are often ascribed to <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Vertues, and Graces,</hi> not in strict propriety of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical speaking, but <hi>Tropically</hi> and Figuratively, by a Figure (which he shall hear further of hereafter) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Prosopopoeia;</hi> which represents Things, that are not <hi>Persons,</hi> speaking and doing as if they were so.</p>
            <p>But besides this, there are here two Things which this Author takes for granted, which yet such dull Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals as my self will be apt a little to demurr to.</p>
            <p>As First, That he takes the <hi>Mind</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man for one and the same thing; whereas very Learned Men, both <hi>Grammarians</hi> and <hi>Philosophers</hi> hold, That in Men there is a great difference between <hi>Animus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima;</hi> and that as <hi>Anima</hi> imports the Spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which we call the Soul, so <hi>Animus</hi> signifies only a Power or Faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> The Supreme Intellectual, Reasoning, Governing Faculty of the Soul, or at least, the Soul it self considered, as exerting the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Acts. But whether it be one or the other, we have sufficiently proved against this Author, That neither of them can be a Person.</p>
            <p>The other Thing here supposed by him, is the <hi>Unity</hi> or <hi>Sameness</hi> of the Powers or Faculties of the Soul, with the Soul it self; which yet the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> generally, and most of the <hi>School-men</hi> with <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> in the Head of them do positively deny, and think they give very good Reason for such their Denial. For if Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and Accidents are Beings really distinct, and if Qualities be Accidents, and the Powers and Faculties of the Soul come under the second <hi>Species</hi> of Quality, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> reckons them, then it is manifest, that they are really distinguished, and that there is no Identity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Nor does there want a further Reason for the same. For, since the bare <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101779:55"/>
the Soul, considered nakedly in it self, may rationally be supposed undetermined, and therefore Indifferent to all those Acts or Actions that naturally proceed from it; and since withal, bare Objects can of themselves neither enable nor dispose the Agent to exert any Action, there seems a Necessity of asserting the Intervention of some Third Thing distinct from both, which may thus ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, dispose, and determine the Soul to exert it self in such a particular way of acting rather than another, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to the several Objects which shall come before it; which thing is properly that Quality residing in the Soul, which we call a <hi>Faculty</hi> or <hi>Power.</hi> And this to me seems the true Philosophy of the matter. But I need not here press the Decision of the Case one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as not directly affecting the Point in debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. Only I thought fit to suggest these Remarks, to check this Author's bold unwary way of dictating and affirming in things disputable and dubious, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind him how much it becomes and concerns one that writes Controversies, to be more liberal in his Proofs, and less lavish in his Assertions.</p>
            <p>But before I quit this Point about the <hi>Personality of the Soul;</hi> since this Author has so absolutely and expresly affirmed, <hi>That the Soul, or Mind of Man is a Person,</hi> and given this for the Reason of it, <hi>That being the Superiour Governing Power</hi> in Man, it does, as such, <hi>Constitute the Person;</hi> over and above the Arguments which have been already brought for the Confutation of it, I desire to leave with him two or three Questions, which seem na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to rise from this Wonderful Position. As,</p>
            <p>First, Whether the <hi>Soul,</hi> or <hi>Mind</hi> of Man be <hi>one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and the Man himself <hi>Another?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:101779:56"/>
Secondly, Whether the asserting of the <hi>Soul to be a Person,</hi> because it <hi>Constitutes the Person,</hi> does not infer so much, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>the Person that Constitutes,</hi> and the <hi>Man the Person that is Constituted;</hi> unless we will say, That the <hi>Soul Constitutes it self a Person?</hi> And then,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whether to say, or assert this, does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Two distinct Personalities</hi> in the same <hi>Soul,</hi> one in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature before the other, <hi>viz.</hi> That, by which it is it self <hi>formally a Person,</hi> and that other, which by its Constituting it self a Person, is <hi>Constituted</hi> and <hi>caused by it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But since it is too hard a Task to drain any one Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity (especially a very great one) so, as to draw forth and represent all its naturally descending Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, I desire the Author with the utmost (if Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial) strictness to compare the foregoing Questions with his own Assertion and to see, First, Whether they do not directly spring from it: And next, Whether the Matter couched under the said Questions, if drawn out into so many Positive Propositions, would not afford as many Intolerable Defiances to Common Sense, Reason and Philosophy. But thus it is, when Men will be Writing at Thirty, and scarce Thinking till Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score.</p>
            <p>But to proceed and shew, That it is not only the <hi>Soul, or Mind of Man</hi> which our Author dignifies with the Name and Nature of a <hi>Person;</hi> but that he has almost as free an hand in making every thing he meets with a <hi>Person,</hi> as K. <hi>Charles the Second</hi> had in making almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Person</hi> he met with, a <hi>Knight;</hi> (So that it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous for any one who had an Aversion to Knighthood, to come in his way,) our Author, out of the like Over-flowing Communicative Goodness and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101779:56"/>
is graciously pleased, to take even the <hi>Beasts</hi> themselves into the Rank and Order of Persons; in some imitation, I suppose, of the Discreet and Humble <hi>Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> so famous in History for making his Horse <hi>Consul.</hi> And for this, Let us cast our Eyes upon <hi>Page</hi> 262. where he has these words, worthy <hi>(in sempiternam rei memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam)</hi> to be wrote in Letters of Gold. <hi>A Beast</hi> (says he) <hi>which has no Rational Soul, but only an Animal Life (as a Man has together with an Humane Soul) is a Person, or</hi> Suppositum, <hi>or what you will please to call it.</hi> But, by your favour, Good Sir, the Matter is not so indifferent; for <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Suppositum,</hi> are by no means the same Thing; and I pity you with all my heart, that you should think so. For any single Complete Nature actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally subsisting by it self, is properly a <hi>Suppositum,</hi> but not therefore a <hi>Person.</hi> For as <hi>Subsistence</hi> superadded to Nature, Constitutes a <hi>Suppositum,</hi> so <hi>Rationality</hi> added to <hi>Suppositality,</hi> Constitutes a <hi>Person;</hi> which is therefore properly defined <hi>Suppositum Rationale,</hi> or <hi>Intelligens,</hi> as we have sufficiently shewn already in our Second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that to call a <hi>Beast</hi> a <hi>Person,</hi> is all one as to call it a <hi>Rational Brute:</hi> Which this Author, who can so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily reconcile Contradictions, or (which may serve him as well) <hi>swallow them,</hi> may do, if he pleases; <hi>and so stand alone by himself</hi> in this, as well as (he says) he had done in some other Things. But others, who think themselves obliged to use Philosophical Terms only as Philosophers intended them, dare not venture to speak thus, for fear <hi>Aristotle</hi> should bring an <hi>Action of Battery</hi> against them; who certainly has <hi>a Pate</hi> to break as well as <hi>Priscian,</hi> and is as sensible of hard usage, how pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently soever he has took it hitherto at this Author's hands. But to give the said Author his due, he is not so much <hi>a Slave to his word,</hi> as to speak the same Thing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101779:57"/>
in all places of his Book. For, to quote his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (though of little value, but when brought against himself) in <hi>page</hi> 62. of this very Tract, he has these words. <hi>A Person</hi> (says he) <hi>and an Intelligent Substance are Reciprocal Terms.</hi> And, are they so? Why, how then comes a <hi>Beast,</hi> in <hi>page</hi> 269. to be <hi>a Person?</hi> Is a <hi>Beast</hi> an <hi>Intelligent Substance?</hi> Or, can a <hi>Beast</hi> be a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and yet not an <hi>Intelligent Substance,</hi> when he affirms, That they are Terms Reciprocal? If I have not quoted this Author fairly and justly, let the Advantage be his, and the shame mine. But if I have, then let all the Learned and Impartial World (which I appeal to) judge, whether one who talks thus Ignorantly and Self-Contradictiously about the Nature of a <hi>Person,</hi> be fit to prescribe to the whole Church New Terms and Models never heard of before, to explicate the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Sacred Trinity</hi> by. But the Truth is, the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 69. and the 262. <hi>pages,</hi> was so great, and the Contradictions which passed within that compass so Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, that how gross and bulky soever this one might be, yet with the help of a little good luck, it might well escape the Author's Eye in such a Crowd. And perhaps, it had been never the worse luck for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Himself, if it could as easily have escaped the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Eye too.</p>
            <p>And now, to sum up in short, the Chief Heads of what has been treated of in this Chapter, I have proved against this Author, That <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is not the formal Reason of Personality in Created Beings. And that first by an Argument drawn from the very Nature of the Thing; For that, <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> presupposes Personality, and therefore cannot be the formal Reason of it. As also from two Notable Instances, One of the Humanity, or Humane Nature of Christ. The other
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101779:57"/>
of the Soul of Man in its state of Separation from the Body: Both of which I have shewn to be perfectly <hi>Self-Conscious</hi> of all the Internal Acts, Motions and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions respectively belonging to each of them; and yet that they were, neither of them, <hi>Persons.</hi> And pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to this Subject, I have, by clear, and solid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons overthrown the pretended Personality of the Soul, both in a state of Conjunction with the Body, and of Disjunction from it; which in both is asserted by this Author. And Lastly, I have examined his Absurd Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philosophical Assertions about these Matters; in one whereof he ascribes a Personality even to Beasts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. By all which, it is but too manifest against this Assuming big-talking Man, that as loftily as he carries it, yet in very Deed and Truth he does not understand what those Terms <hi>Suppositum and Subsistence, Person and Personality</hi> mean. So fit is he (as I have said) to treat of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> of the <hi>God-head;</hi> whom yet he has made so bold with.</p>
            <p>And here I should judge it high time to conclude this Chapter; but that, methinks, it is pity to leave this fine Trim Notion of <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> so; without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a little further View of the Curious Artifice and admirable Contrivance of so rare a production. For if it were not such, could this Author vaunt of it at such a rate as he does, pleasing himself, and proclaming his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as upon an Invention (forsooth) which all Antiquity before him could never yet reach to?</p>
            <p>Nevertheless to deal clearly and plainly amongst Friends, such a Cheating, Lurching thing does this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation usually prove, that after all these Pompous Shews, and Glorious Boasts of <hi>Self-Consciousness, Self-Consciousness,</hi> ushered in with twenty <hi>Encomium's</hi> (at
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101779:58"/>
least) like so many Heralds, or Tip-staves, or (rather) <hi>Yeomen of the Guard,</hi> marching before it; yet, in Truth, after all this noise, it is, (like an Owl stripp'd of its Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) but a very Mean, Meagre, Ordinary Thing; being, in down-right Terms, neither more nor less than only <hi>one Property of a Rational, or Intelligent Being;</hi> by vertue whereof, the Soul is (as the Schools express it) <hi>Supra se Reflexiva,</hi> that is to say, Able by a Reflex Act of Knowledge, intimately to know and consider it self, and its own Being, together with its own Acts, Motions, and Operations. This is the Sum Total of the Matter, and all that <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is, or can truly pretend to be.</p>
            <p>And, (which is yet a further Diminution to it) as poor and mean a Notion as it is, it is Borrowed too. But you will say, From whom? Why? Even from Honest <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> and his <hi>Cogito ergo sum.</hi> Only with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy difference in the Application of it, That this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which <hi>Des Cartes</hi> lays as the Basis and Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of his Philosophy, our Author places with its Heels upwards in his Divinity. For whereas <hi>Des Cartes</hi> insists upon <hi>Cogitation,</hi> only to prove and infer Being, as one would prove a Cause from its Effects, or rather an Antecedent from its Consequent: Our Author, on the contrary, makes <hi>Cogitation</hi> the very Cause and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Being and Subsistence, by making it the formal Constituent Reason of Personality in the Person who Thinks, or Reflects; than which nothing can be more false, and ridiculous.</p>
            <p>And this, according to the Truest, and most Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Account of the Thing, is the very utmost which this New, and so much bragg'd of Notion amounts to. And I do hereupon Challenge this Author to prove these two Things if he can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:101779:58"/>
First, That the <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> hitherto spoken of by him is any Thing more than a bare <hi>Property</hi> of an Intelligent Being, whereby it reflects upon it self, and its own Thoughts and Actions.</p>
            <p>And in the next place, That such a <hi>Property</hi> does, or can Constitute the Being or Nature which it flows from, and belongs to, properly <hi>a Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These two things, I say, I call upon him to prove; and if he does not by dint of <hi>Argument</hi> make them good, he exposes a poor, senceless, infant Hypothesis to the wide World, and then very unmercifully leaves it to shift for it self. In fine, I cannot but again and again own my Amazement at the Confidence of some bold presuming Men, who set up for Enlightners of the Church, and new Modellers of Divinity in the strength of some odd upstart Notions, which yet are not able to acquit, or support themselves <hi>upon,</hi> and much less <hi>against</hi> the very first Elements and Principles of a long tryed and never yet baffled Philosophy,</p>

               <p>In which is proved against this Author, That neither is <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> the formal Reason of <hi>Personality</hi> in the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity; nor <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their Unity in one and the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

            <p>HAving thus examined, and (as I think) over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown our Author's Notion of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> with reference to Created and Finite Persons, I shall now proceed to the Consideration of what he says of it with reference to the three Persons in the Glorious God-head. And this I shall do under these following Heads, which shall be the Subjects of five distinct Chapters. As</p>
            <p>First, I shall treat of his two new Notions, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> and shew, That <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is not the <hi>formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality</hi> in the three <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> nor <hi>Mutual-Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> the Reason of their Unity in one and the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

            <p>Secondly, I shall prove, That the Three <hi>Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> of the Godhead, are not Three <hi>Distinct, Infinite Minds, or Spirits</hi> in the 5th Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:101779:59"/>
Thirdly, I shall Consider, what this Author pretends to from the Authority of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>School-men,</hi> in behalf of his New invented Hypothesis, and shew, That they speak nothing <hi>at all for it,</hi> or <hi>towards it:</hi> And this shall make the 6th and 7th Chapters.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I shall set down the Ancient and generally received Doctrine of the Church and Schools concerning the Article of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and Vindicate it from this Author's Exceptions, in the 8th Chapter.</p>
            <p>And when I shall have discussed and gone over these Particulars, I cannot imagine what can be found Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in this his Book (so far as I have undertook it) but what will have received hereby a full and sufficient Answer.</p>
            <p>Though, when all is done, I confess I have some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Complements to make to this Author upon some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accounts (though still occasioned by this Work of his) which, I should be extremely wanting both to him and the Cause now before me, should I not, with all due Address, pass upon him. And this will add three or four Chapters more to the former, and so conclude this Work.</p>
            <p>And First, To begin with the first of these, I shall endeavour to prove, That <hi>Self-Consciousness is not the formal Reason of Personality in the Three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to which, I shall premise and lay down these following <hi>Considerations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consideration</hi> 1. That although the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> be one Pure, Simple, Indivisible Act, yet in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101779:60"/>
of it (which are always inadequate to it) there is a Natural Order of <hi>Prius</hi> and <hi>Posterius</hi> founded in the Universal Reason of Things (according to which, the Conception of one Thing presupposes, and depends upon the Conception of another) which, though it can make no <hi>Prius</hi> or <hi>Posterius</hi> in the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> yet is by no means to be contradicted, or confounded in our discoursing of <hi>God;</hi> forasmuch as without our admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Rule it is impossible for any Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing either to Conceive, or Discourse consistently; or intelligibly of Him at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consideration</hi> 2. (Which, I think, affords us a Rule safely and universally to be relied upon) is this, That in Things having a dependence between them, where we may form to our selves a clear and distinct Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of one Thing, without implying, or involving in it the Conception of any other Thing, there that Thing is in Order of Nature precedent to all those Things which are not essentially included in the Conception of it. Thus, for instance, we may have a clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Conception of <hi>Entity and Being,</hi> and of <hi>Unity</hi> too, without entertaining in our Mind, at the same time, any Notion, or Conception of <hi>knowledge</hi> at all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Ratio Entitativa,</hi> of any Thing must needs in Nature precede the <hi>Ratio Cognitiva,</hi> as well as <hi>Cognosci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis</hi> of the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consideration</hi> 3. We must distinguish between the Affections; or <hi>Modes</hi> of Being (as they are strictly so called) and between the <hi>Attributes</hi> of it. The first sort are reckoned of the same Order with <hi>Being</hi> it self, and so precede whatsoever is consequent upon it, as the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of it are accounted to be; which relate to the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101779:60"/>
Being or Subject they belong to, as things in Order of Nature <hi>Posterior</hi> to it. Accordingly in the first rank are <hi>Existence, Subsistence, Personality,</hi> &amp;c. and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond are all Acts issuing from a <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Subject</hi> so Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting; whether they be of <hi>Knowledge, Volition, Power, Duration,</hi> or the like: The <hi>Denominations</hi> derived from which, are properly called <hi>Attributes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consideration</hi> 4. Though there can be no Accidents inhering in God, yet there may be <hi>Accidental</hi> Predicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to him. And I call those <hi>Accidental,</hi> which are not <hi>Necessary,</hi> or <hi>Essential.</hi> Such as are all <hi>Extrinsecal Denominations</hi> of him founded on such Acts of God, as were perfectly free for him to do, or not to do; nothing in the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> obliging him thereto. Of which number are the <hi>Denominations,</hi> or <hi>Predicates</hi> of <hi>Creatour, Redeemer,</hi> and the like: Since there was nothing in God that made it necessary for him to be so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consideration</hi> 5. When the Terms <hi>[Cause, Formal Reason, Constituent; or productive Principle,</hi> and the like] are used about the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> they are not to be understood as applicable to them in the strict and proper signification of the said Terms, but only by way of Analogy; as really meaning no more than a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, or Necessary Dependence of one Notion, or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptus objectivus</hi> upon another; so that it is impossible for the <hi>Mind</hi> to Conceive distinctly of the one, but as depending upon, or <hi>proceeding from</hi> the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consideration</hi> 6. That the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> may with all fair Accord to the Rules of Divinity and Philosophy be Considered as <hi>Prescinding,</hi> or <hi>Abstracting (though</hi> not as <hi>divided)</hi> from the <hi>Divine Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:101779:61"/>
               <hi>Consideration</hi> 7. That whatsoever is Essentially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> thus Considered, is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Common and Communicable to all the <hi>Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consideration</hi> 8. That whatsoever is the proper <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality,</hi> is utterly Incommunicable to any Thing, or <hi>Person</hi> beyond, or <hi>beside the Person</hi> to whom it belongs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consideration</hi> 9. That for any Absolute Perfection es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially included, or implyed in the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> to be <hi>multiplyed</hi> in the Three <hi>Persons</hi> belonging to it, is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Multiplication of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> it self in the said <hi>Persons.</hi> By which we are given to understand the difference between the <hi>Multiplication,</hi> and the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> to those <hi>Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Rules, I thought fit to draw up and lay down before-hand, in order to the use which we shall have of them in the ensuing Disputation.</p>
            <p>And so I proceed to my <hi>Arguments</hi> against this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's New Notion of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> with reference to the Persons of the <hi>Blessed Trinity.</hi> And the First is This:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> I. No <hi>Personal</hi> Act can be the formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Personality</hi> in the <hi>Person,</hi> whose Act it is. But <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is a <hi>Personal</hi> Act, and therefore <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> cannot be the formal Reason of <hi>Personality</hi> in the <hi>Person,</hi> whose Act it is, and to whom <hi>personally</hi> it belongs. The Minor, I suppose, neither our Author Himself, nor any one else, can deny. For if <hi>Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:101779:61"/>
be not a <hi>Personal</hi> Act, let any one assign what else it is, or what it ought to pass for. It is certainly an Act of Knowledge, by which each <hi>Person</hi> knows and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends himself, and whatsoever belongs to him. The Major Proposition therefore is to be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That no <hi>Personal</hi> Act can be the formal Reason of <hi>Personality</hi> in the <hi>Person</hi> whose Act it is. And I prove it thus: The formal Reason of every Thing, is in order of Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Thing of which it is the formal Reason; but no <hi>Personal</hi> Act is, in order of Nature, before the <hi>Persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the <hi>Person</hi> whose Act it is, and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the formal Reason of his <hi>Personality.</hi> The Major is Self-evident. And as for the Minor, That no <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Act is before the <hi>Personality</hi> of the <hi>Person</hi> whose Act it is; This also is manifest; Because such an Act cannot be before the <hi>Person</hi> himself, and therefore not before his <hi>Personality:</hi> For as much as his <hi>Personality</hi> is that by which he is formally a <hi>Person;</hi> so that it is impossible to be before the one without being before the other too. And now, that it cannot be before the <hi>Person</hi> himself, is manifest from hence, that as every <hi>Personal</hi> Act in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral bears a Relation of <hi>Posteriority</hi> to the <hi>Person</hi> to whom it belongs, as to the Cause or Productive Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all the Acts proceeding from Him; so this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Act of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> bears a Treble Relation of <hi>Posteriority</hi> to the <hi>Person</hi> whose Act it is, <hi>viz.</hi> as to the Agent or <hi>Principle</hi> producing it. 2. As to the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> Recipient of it, and sustaining it. And Thirdly and Lastly, As to the <hi>Object</hi> which it is terminated to. All which Respects it sustains, not barely as it is an Act, but partly as it is an <hi>Immanent Act,</hi> and partly also a <hi>Reflex Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first place therefore, every <hi>Person</hi> being the Agent, or Productive Cause of all the <hi>personal</hi> Acts issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101779:62"/>
from Him, he must upon that Account, in Order of Nature, precede the said Acts; and consequently every <hi>Divine Person</hi> must in Nature be before that Act of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> which <hi>personally</hi> belongs to him. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over since it is likewise an <hi>Immanent</hi> Act, it relates to him, as <hi>the Subject in which it is,</hi> as well as <hi>the Cause from which it is,</hi> and upon that Account also, must bear a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Posteriority</hi> to Him. And then lastly, as it is also <hi>a Reflex Act,</hi> by which the <hi>Person</hi> knows himself to be a <hi>Person,</hi> and is Conscious to Himself, what he is, and what he does, it terminates upon him as its Object also. So that the <hi>Cause,</hi> the <hi>Subject,</hi> and the <hi>Object</hi> of this Act being the same <hi>Person,</hi> in this last respect, no less than in the two former, it bears another and third Relation of <hi>Posteriority</hi> to Him; since every Act, not productive of something besides, and without the Agent, is in Order of Nature <hi>Posterior</hi> to the <hi>Object</hi> it terminates upon.</p>
            <p>From all which I conclude, That that Act of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> by which each <hi>Divine Person</hi> knows, or is <hi>Conscious</hi> to Himself of his own <hi>Personality,</hi> cannot be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of the said <hi>Personality,</hi> without being, in Order of Nature, <hi>both before it,</hi> and <hi>after it</hi> too, <hi>viz.</hi> Before it, as it is the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of it, and yet <hi>Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> to it, as it is an Act <hi>proceeding from, lodged</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in,</hi> and lastly, <hi>Terminated upon the same Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which is so very plain, that hardly can any Thing be plainer: And indeed, the very word <hi>Self-Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> contradicts and overthrows its being the <hi>ground,</hi> or <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality.</hi> For still <hi>Self</hi> must be before <hi>Consciousness;</hi> and <hi>Self</hi> imports <hi>Personality;</hi> as being that, by which a <hi>Person</hi> is said <hi>to be, what he is;</hi> and they both stand united in this one Word, as the <hi>Act and the Object,</hi> and therefore <hi>Consciousness</hi> cannot be the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101779:62"/>
               <hi>Reason of it.</hi> Or to express the same Thing by other Terms, <hi>Self-Subsistence</hi> must precede <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> and <hi>Self-Subsistence</hi> here implys <hi>Personality;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Personality,</hi> upon the same Account, must in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture precede <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> and consequently cannot be the <hi>formal Effect,</hi> or <hi>Result</hi> of it. For, surely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the most Essential Order of Things, <hi>a Person must be what he is,</hi> before he can <hi>know what he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>Argument,</hi> I confess, being founded upon the <hi>Priority</hi> of <hi>Subsistence</hi> to all <hi>Acts,</hi> and particularly to those of <hi>knowledge</hi> in every <hi>Person Self-Conscious,</hi> does, and must Universally run through all Instances, in which <hi>Personality</hi> and <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> with reference to one another, come to be treated of. And as it affects <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> so it will equally take place in <hi>Mutual-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness</hi> too.</p>
            <p>What Allowances are to be here made for the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Simplicity, Eternity,</hi> and <hi>Pure Actuality</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> (when these Notions are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to them) we have already observed, in the first of those Preliminary Considerations mentioned in this Chapter. The proper use and design of all which No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is to lead, guide, and direct our Apprehensions about that <hi>Great Object,</hi> so much too big for our Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <hi>Faculties;</hi> so that whatsoever contradicts the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Order of these Apprehensions ought upon no ground of Reason to be admitted in our Discourses of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> how much soever it may and does tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend the said Apprehensions. And this must be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, or we must sink under the vast Disproportion of the thing before us, and not discourse of it at all. For I cannot think, that the Word <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> has brought the <hi>Deity</hi> one jot lower to us, or raised our Understandings one degree higher and nearer to that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:101779:63"/>
               <hi>Argument</hi> II. My Second <hi>Argument</hi> against <hi>Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness</hi> being the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality</hi> in the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> is this: <hi>Nothing</hi> in the <hi>Nature</hi> of it <hi>Absolute and Irrelative</hi> can be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality</hi> in the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity;</hi> but <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is in the Nature of it <hi>Absolute and Irrelative;</hi> and therefore it cannot be the Reason of <hi>personality</hi> in any of the said <hi>Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Major Proposition is proved thus. Nothing in the <hi>Nature</hi> of it <hi>Absolute</hi> can be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of any Thing in the Nature of it purely and perfectly Relative. But the <hi>Personality</hi> of every one of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons</hi> is purely and perfectly Relative; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Nothing <hi>Absolute</hi> can be the <hi>Formal Constituent Reason</hi> of their <hi>Personality.</hi> The Major of which Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism is also manifest. For Things Essentially different, and thereby uncapable of being affirmed of one another, cannot possibly be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of one another. And, that the Persons in the <hi>Blessed Trinity</hi> are purely Relative to one another, and consequently, that their Personali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are so many Relations, is no less evident from this, That Two of them relate to one another, as <hi>Father and Son,</hi> and the Third to Both, as proceeding from Both; and it is impossible for one Thing to proceed from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, especially by a Continual Act of Procession, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Importing a Relation to that from which it so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds; so that the very <hi>personal Subsistence</hi> of these <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> implys and carries in it a Formal Relation. For the Father Subsists personally as a Father, by that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communication of his Nature to his Son; which Act, as proceeding from him, is called <hi>Generation,</hi> and renders him Formally a Father, and as Terminated in the Son, is called <hi>Filiation,</hi> and Constitutes him For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101779:63"/>
a Son; and in like manner the Holy Ghost Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists personally by that Act of <hi>Procession,</hi> by which he proceeds from, and relates to both the Father and the Son. So that, that <hi>proper Mode of Subsistence</hi> (by which in Conjunction with the <hi>Divine Essence</hi> always included in it, each of them is rendred a <hi>Person)</hi> is wholly Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and so belongs to one of them, that it also bears a Necessary reference to another. From all which, it undeniably follows, That the Three <hi>Persons</hi> in the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity,</hi> are in the Formal Constitution of them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to one another; and consequently, That the Three <hi>Personalities,</hi> by which they become Formally Three <hi>Persons,</hi> and are so denominated, are Three <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Relations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, for the Minor Proposition in the first Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism, viz. <hi>That Self-Consciousness is a Thing in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it Absolute and Irrelative,</hi> that, I think, can need but little Proof; it being that Act by which each <hi>Person</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately knows, and is Conscious to himself of his own <hi>Being, Acts, Motions,</hi> and every Thing <hi>personally</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him; so that, as such, it terminates within, and looks no further than that one <hi>Person,</hi> whom it is an Entire Survey and Comprehension of. And as it is an <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Irrelative</hi> Term, so it may be Conceived di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly and fully without Conceiving, or implying the Conception of any Thing, or <hi>Person</hi> besides. And now, what <hi>Relation</hi> does or can such an Act of <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> imply in it? It is indeed on the contrary, a direct Contradiction to all that is <hi>Relative.</hi> For it incloses the <hi>Person</hi> wholly within himself; neither pointing nor looking further, nor referring to any one else.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:101779:64"/>
If it be here said, That each <hi>Person,</hi> by an Act of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> intimately knows the <hi>Relation</hi> which he stands in to the other Two Persons.</p>
            <p>To this, I Answer Two Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That to know a <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Person</hi> to be Relative, or to be Conscious of the Relation belonging to it or him, does not make that Act of Knowledge to be either a Relation, or of a Relative Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I Answer, That this very Thing proves <hi>Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness</hi> not to be the Constituent Reason of <hi>Personality.</hi> For, if the Father knows himself to be a Father by an Act of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> it is evident, That <hi>Self-Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> did not make him so: but that he was a Father, and had the Relation of a Father, and thereby a <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality</hi> belonging to him as such, in Order of Nature An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to this Act of <hi>Self-Consciousness;</hi> and therefore that this <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> cannot be the Reason of the Relation, nor of the <hi>Personality</hi> implyed in it. Forasmuch as it is in several respects Posterior to the Person whom it belongs to, as in the foregoing <hi>Argument</hi> we have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly shewn.</p>
            <p>But to take a particular and distinct Account of this Notion, in the several <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> Does the <hi>Father</hi> become a <hi>Father</hi> by being <hi>Conscious to himself,</hi> that he is so, or rather by that Act by which he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates his <hi>Nature</hi> to, and thereby generates a Son? Or does the <hi>Son's Relation to the Father</hi> consist in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Conscious to himself</hi> of this <hi>Relation?</hi> Or Lastly, does the Holy Ghost <hi>proceed from the Father and the Son,</hi> and so <hi>personally</hi> relate to both by that Act of <hi>Self-Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> by which he is Conscious to himself of this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession?</hi> All this is <hi>Absurd, Unnatural,</hi> and <hi>Impossible.</hi> For
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101779:64"/>
no <hi>Person</hi> is related to another by that Act of <hi>Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness,</hi> by which he knows and reflects Personally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself. And yet it is certain, That <hi>to be a Father,</hi> is a <hi>Relative Subsistence,</hi> and to be a Son depending upon the Father by an Eternal Act of Generation perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally begetting him, is also to have a <hi>Relative Subsistence;</hi> and lastly, to be <hi>Eternally proceeding from Both,</hi> as the Holy Ghost is, must likewise import <hi>a Way or Mode of Subsisting altogether as Relative</hi> as the Two former. In which three ways of <hi>Subsistence</hi> consist the Personalities of the Three Persons respectively; and upon these <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> can have no Constituting Influence at all; as being an Act quite of another Nature; to wit, <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and Irrelative,</hi> and resting wholly within the Person, whom it belongs to.</p>
            <p>From all which, I conclude, That <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> neither is, nor can be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality</hi> in the Three <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity.</hi> And this <hi>Argument</hi> I take to have the force and clearness of a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> III. The Third <hi>Argument</hi> is this. If <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality</hi> in the Three <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> then there is no Repugnancy in the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of the Thing it self, but that there might be Three Thousand Persons in the <hi>Deity</hi> as well as Three. But this is Absurd, and therefore so must that be likewise from which it follows. The Consequence appears from this, That there is no Repugnancy but that there might be so many <hi>Self-Consciousnesses,</hi> or <hi>Self-Conscious Minds</hi> or <hi>Spirits,</hi> for the <hi>Deity</hi> to Communicate it self to: And therefore, if <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality,</hi> there is no Repugnancy, but that there might be Three Thousand Persons in the God-head, as well as Three.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:101779:65"/>
The Proposition is proved thus. Because this Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy (if there be any) must be either from the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> in the several <hi>Self-Conscious Minds</hi> or <hi>Spirits</hi> it belongs to, or from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>God-head,</hi> which is to be Communicated to them. But it is from neither of them, For</p>
            <p>First, there is nothing in the Nature of <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> to hinder its Multiplication into never so great a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Particulars; but that there may be Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, or Three Millions of <hi>Self-Conscious Minds</hi> or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> as well as Three. Nor, in the next place, is there any Repugnancy on the Part of the <hi>God-head, That Three Thousand Self-Conscious Spirits</hi> should subsist in it any more than that Three should: For the <hi>Godhead</hi> considered precisely and abstractedly in it self (and not as actually included in any Person) is as able to Communicate it self to the greatest Number as to the smallest.</p>
            <p>If it be here said, That the Three <hi>Persons</hi> are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Three <hi>Self-Conscious Spirits,</hi> but also Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Infinite <hi>Self-Conscious Spirits,</hi> (as our Author says they are, and of which, more in the next Chapter.) I Answer, That there may be as well Three Thousand distinct <hi>infinite Spirits</hi> as Three. For Infinity is as much inconsistent with the least Plurality of Infinites, as with the greatest; and therefore if it be no Repugnancy, that there should be Three distinct <hi>Infinite Minds,</hi> neither is there that there should be Three Thousand. So that if <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality,</hi> there appears no Repugnancy either from the Nature of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> or the Number of the <hi>Spirits</hi> endued with it, nor from the [supposed] <hi>Infinity</hi> of the said <hi>Spirits,</hi> no nor yet from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>God-head</hi> it self, but that there might be Three Thousand <hi>Persons</hi> in it as well as Three.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:101779:65"/>
But how then comes there to be only Three? Why, upon these grounds no other Reason can be assigned for it, but only that it was God's free Determination that there should be Three and no more. And then the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi> must be an Effect of God's Will, and not a Necessary Condition of the Divine Nature; and the further Consequence of this must be, that the three <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> are Three <hi>Created Beings,</hi> as proceeding from the free Results of God's Will, by vertue whereof they equally might, or might not have been.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary our Author himself holds <hi>Page</hi> 129. <hi>line</hi> 13. That the Three <hi>Persons</hi> are Essential to the Divine Nature, and so Essential to it, that they neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily belong to it in this number, <hi>and can be neither more nor fewer than Three.</hi> And if this be so, I am sure it is a Contradiction that it should be otherwise: for it is a Contradiction, that it should not be, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily is, and cannot but be. But now I have proved, that there is no Repugnancy or Contradiction to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things considered barely according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that three thousand <hi>Self-Conscious Minds</hi> or <hi>Spirits</hi> should subsist in the <hi>Godhead</hi> any more than that three such <hi>Spirits</hi> should so subsist. And therefore if it be Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, and Impossible, (as undoubtedly it is) that so many <hi>Persons</hi> should belong to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> then must the Reason of this Absurdity be fetched from some other Thing, than either from <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> with reference to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or from the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> (considered in it self abstractedly from all Actual <hi>Personality:)</hi> for these, as we have shewn, afford no sufficient Proof of this Absurdity. And therefore, I say, some other <hi>Reason</hi> must be found out, and assigned against it. And accordingly, let this Author produce such an one (whatsoever it be) as shall
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101779:66"/>
solidly and conclusively prove, That there cannot be Three Thousand <hi>Self-Conscious Persons</hi> belonging to the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and that from the Nature of the Thing it self (as several such <hi>Reasons</hi> may be brought) and I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to him to prove, by the very same <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi> as Conclusively, That <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is not, cannot be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality</hi> in the Three <hi>Divine Persons</hi> of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> In the mean time, by that kind of Arguing, which is called <hi>Deductio ad Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdum,</hi> I have sufficiently disproved it, by shewing what an Intolerable Absurdity must follow the Assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> IV. The Fourth and Last <hi>Argument</hi> shall proceed thus. If Three distinct <hi>Self-Conciousnesses</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Constitute Three distinct <hi>Personalities,</hi> then Three distinct <hi>Self-Complacencies</hi> will Constitute Three distinct <hi>Personalities</hi> too. But our Author, Isuppose, will not allow of the latter, and therefore neither ought he to assert the former.</p>
            <p>The Consequence is plain. Because there is no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son alleagable (according to our Author's Hypothesis) why <hi>Self-Complacency</hi> may not found a <hi>Personality</hi> as well as <hi>Sels-Consciousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For they are both of them equally distinct <hi>Internal</hi> Acts in the Person whom they belong to; and as to the Formal Effect of each, an Act of <hi>Self-Complacency</hi> seems to have the Preheminence; since it is a greater Perfection to be <hi>United</hi> to an <hi>Infinite Good,</hi> that is, to the <hi>Deity,</hi> by way of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Adhesion,</hi> than barely by way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Intellection. And <hi>Self-Complacency</hi> is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, whereas <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> rises no higher than the latter. And consequently since <hi>Self-Complacency</hi> is the more Perfective Act of the two (knowledge of good
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101779:66"/>
being still in order to the Love of it) and since withall <hi>Personality</hi> is the most perfect way of <hi>Subsisting,</hi> which any <hi>Nature</hi> is capable of, it seems most rational to derive the perfectest way of <hi>Subsistence,</hi> belonging to an <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Being,</hi> from the most <hi>Perfective</hi> Act of that <hi>Being;</hi> if from any <hi>Act</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>And now if this Author should Object, That <hi>Self-Complacency,</hi> is in Order of Nature Subsequent to <hi>Self-Consciousness;</hi> and so, that there cannot be the same ground to make it the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality,</hi> that there is, to make <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> so.</p>
            <p>I Answer, That, according to my Principle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I deny <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> to be the <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> because it is postnate to <hi>Self-Subsistence,</hi> it is, indeed, a good Reason; but according to our Author's Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, it is none at all. For if the Priority of <hi>Self-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence</hi> to <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> (according to him) hinders not but that <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> may nevertheless be the <hi>Principle</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality,</hi> why should the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> to <hi>Self-Complacency,</hi> hinder <hi>Self-Complacency</hi> from being as proper a Reason or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to found <hi>Personality</hi> upon, as the other.</p>
            <p>All this I alledge only as <hi>an Argument ad Hominem;</hi> and desire this Author to consider, if any one should borrow some of that Boldness of him, by which he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents from all Antiquity, and confidently averr, That <hi>Self-Complacency is the Proper formal Reason of Personali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in each and every one of the Divine Persons,</hi> I would have him, I say, consider by what Reason or Argument, consistent with his New Opinion he could Confute this other New Assertion.</p>
            <p>For my own part, since I think as much may be said for the one as for the other, I am ready to set up for <hi>Self-Complacency</hi> against his <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> when he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101779:67"/>
pleases; and will undertake to give as good Reasons for my Notion, as he can sor his, and perhaps better; let him begin and enter into the Dispute, as soon as he will. And as I shall oppose my <hi>Self-Complacency</hi> to his <hi>Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness,</hi> so I shall find out a <hi>Mutual-Complacency</hi> to Vye against his <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> too. And if any one should here object, That this and the like Disputes are of that Nature, that the World is not like to be much Edified by them; I, perhaps, think so as much as he: But that is no great matter; since our Author is of so very Benign a Temper, That he does not always Write only for the <hi>Reader's Edification,</hi> but sometimes <hi>for his Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> too.</p>
            <p>Having thus given my Reasons against this Author's New Notion of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> both with reference to Persons Create and Uncreate, and proved, That it neither is, nor can be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality</hi> in either of them: I shall now pass to his other New Notion of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> whereby those <hi>Persons,</hi> who were distinguished from one another by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective <hi>Self-Consciousnesses,</hi> are United and made one in Nature by vertue of this <hi>Mutual-Consciousness.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which Notion also, I must profess my self in the number of those who are by no means satisfied with it, as of any such peculiar Efficacy to the use and purpose it is here brought for.</p>
            <p>And there are sufficient Reasons against it. In giving of which, as I must acknowledge, That that one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the <hi>Priority</hi> of <hi>Being</hi> (whether <hi>Essentially,</hi> or <hi>Personally</hi> considered) together with the first Modes and Affections of it, to any <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> Attributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the said <hi>Being,</hi> is the Fundamental Principle upon which I impugn this Author's New Hypothesis; so it does and must (as I have noted) run through all, or
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101779:67"/>
most of the parts of this Disputation, both about <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> too. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, in the first place I Argue against it thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> I. No <hi>Act of Knowledge</hi> can be the <hi>Formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of an Unity of Nature in the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi> But an Act of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> is an Act of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> And therefore no Act of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> can be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of an Unity of Nature in the Three <hi>Divine Persons.</hi> The Major I prove thus. Every <hi>Act of Knowledge</hi> supposes the <hi>Unity</hi> of a Thing, or <hi>Being</hi> from which that Act flows, as Antecedent to it, and therefore cannot be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of the said <hi>Being.</hi> For still I affirm, that <hi>Being,</hi> and consequently <hi>Unity of Being</hi> (which is the first Affection of it) must in Order of Nature precede <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and all other the like At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of <hi>Being.</hi> And if so, no <hi>Attribute</hi> Subsequent to a Thing, can be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of that Thing, which it is thus, in Order of Nature, Subsequent to. For neither can <hi>Omniscience</hi> it self (one of the greatest and most acknowledged Attributes of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)</hi> be said to be the Reason either of the <hi>Being,</hi> or of the <hi>Unity</hi> of the said <hi>Nature:</hi> And therefore neither can any <hi>Act of Knowledge</hi> whatsoever be so. This is my first <hi>Argument,</hi> which I think sufficient fairly to propose, without any farther Amplification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> II. If Unity of Nature in the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> be the Cause, Reason, or Principle of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> in the said <hi>Persons,</hi> then their <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> is not the Cause or Reason of the Unity of their <hi>Nature:</hi> But the former is true, and therefore the latter is so too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:101779:68"/>
As for the Consequence of the Major Proposition, it is as evident, as, that Nothing can be the Cause and Effect of the same Thing.</p>
            <p>And for the Minor, <hi>That Unity of Nature, or Essence in the Divine Persons is the Cause, Reason, or Principle of Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> is proved from this, That we can no otherwise conceive of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> than as of an Essential Property equally belonging to all the Three <hi>Persons:</hi> And all Properties, or Internal Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, are accounted to issue and result from the <hi>Essence</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> of the Things which they belong to; and therefore can have no Antecedent Causal Influx upon the said <hi>Nature,</hi> so as to Constitute either the <hi>Being,</hi> or the <hi>Unity</hi> thereof. But the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> being one and the same in all the Three <hi>Persons,</hi> there is, upon this Account, one and the same <hi>Knowledge</hi> in them also. And they are not <hi>one in Nature,</hi> by vertue of their <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-Consciousness;</hi> but they are therefore <hi>Mutually Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> because the <hi>perfect Unity and Identity of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> makes them so. And to Assert the contrary, is of the like import (still allowing for the Disproportion of an <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Finite Nature)</hi> as if we should make <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility</hi> in a Man, the Principle of <hi>his Individuation,</hi> and affirm, That <hi>Peter</hi>'s having this Property, is that which Constitutes him this particular Individual Man; which is egregiously absurd in all the Philosophy I ever yet met with, whatsoever it may be in this Author's.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> III. To affirm <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> to be the Cause of the <hi>Union</hi> of the Three <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> in the same <hi>Nature,</hi> is to confound the <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of the said <hi>Persons</hi> together: But such a confusion ought by no means to be allowed of: and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought that to be Asserted, from whence it follows.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101779:68"/>
Now certain it is, That all Acts of several Persons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another (as all that are <hi>Mutual</hi> must needs be) are properly Acts of <hi>Communion,</hi> by which the said Persons have an Intercourse amongst themselves, as acting inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably one upon the other. But then, no doubt, both their <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Personality,</hi> must still go before this <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> since the Three <hi>Persons</hi> must needs be really one in Nature before they can know themselves to be so. And therefore <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> (as I think <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> may properly be called) cannot give an <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> It may indeed suppose it, it may result from it, and upon the same Account may infer and prove it, but it can never give or cause it, nor be that Thing or Act, wherein an <hi>Unity of Nature</hi> does properly consist, whatsoever this Author Asserts to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But the Truth is, all that he has said both of <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> (and he has no more than said it, as never offering at the Proof of any Thing) is founded in a manifest Perversion of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Order, in which Humane Reason Conceives and Discourses of Things: Which Order (to give an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it in our discoursing of any particular Person, or Complete Being) proceeds by these steps. First we conceive of this Person as possessed of a certain <hi>Essence</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> Constituting or rendring him what he is. Then we conceive of this Nature <hi>as one,</hi> which is the first Affection resulting from <hi>Being.</hi> After this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this <hi>Being,</hi> as stepping forth, or exerting it self in <hi>some Acts,</hi> whether of <hi>Intellection, Volition, Power,</hi> or the like. In which whole process the Order of these Conceptions is such, That it cannot, with any Accord to <hi>Reason,</hi> be transposed, so as to have the second or third put into the place of the first.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:101779:69"/>
But now let us see how contrary to this Order our Author's Hypothesis proceeds. For whereas <hi>Nature or Being</hi> should be <hi>first, Unity next,</hi> and the <hi>Acts issuing</hi> from thence obtain the <hi>Third place,</hi> and then those Acts stand in their due Order amongst themselves. This Author, on the contrary, makes <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> which is by two Degrees, or Removes posterior to Unity of Nature (in the Persons whom it belongs to) to be the Cause or <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of the <hi>said Unity.</hi> For first <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is posterior to this <hi>Unity,</hi> and then <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-Consciousness</hi> is posterior to <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Act supervening upon it. For <hi>Mutual-Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is that Act by which each <hi>Person</hi> comprehends, or is Conscious of the <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> of the other two; and therefore must needs presuppose them, as the Act must needs do its <hi>Object.</hi> And therefore to make (as this Author does) <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> the Constituent Reason of the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Three <hi>Persons,</hi> when this <hi>Unity</hi> is by two degrees, in Order of Nature, before it, runs so plainly counter to all the Methods of true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, that it would be but time lost to pursue it with any further Confutation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> IV. Our 4th and last <hi>Argument</hi> proceeds equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> too; and is taken from that known Maxime in Philosophy, That <hi>Entities, or Beings, are not to be multiplied without manifest Necessity:</hi> That is, we are not to admit of New Things, nor to coin new Notions, where such as are known and long received are sufficient to give us a true and full Account of the Nature of the Things we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse of, and to answer all the Ends and Purposes of Argumentation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:101779:69"/>
Accordingly I affirm, That the Notions of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> in the Subject now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us ought to be rejected not only as New and Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, but as wholly Needless. For what can be signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by those, which is not fully, clearly, and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signified by that one plain Word, and known Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, the <hi>Divine Omniscience?</hi> And what are <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> else (if they are any thing) but one and the same <hi>Omniscience</hi> exerting it self several ways, and upon several <hi>Objects?</hi> As to apply it to the Matter before us; does not every one of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons,</hi> by vertue of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and of this <hi>Omniscience</hi> therewith belonging to him, Perfectly, Intimately, and Intirely know himself as a <hi>Person,</hi> and all the <hi>Actions, Motions,</hi> and every thing else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him? No doubt he does; for that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he could not be <hi>Omniscient.</hi> And does not the same <hi>Person</hi> again, by the very same <hi>Omniscience,</hi> know all that is known by the other Two <hi>Persons,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Two <hi>Persons</hi> by the same Mutually know all that is known by him? No doubt they may and do: Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>Omniscience</hi> knows all things that are knowable, and consequently all that is or can be known of, or in any one or all of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> joyntly or severally considered.</p>
            <p>But to argue the Matter yet more particularly. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> are one and the same with the <hi>Divine Omniscience,</hi> or they are distinct sorts of knowledge from it. If they are the same, then they are useless and superfluous Notions, as we affirm they are; but if they import distinct sorts of knowledge, then these two Things will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:101779:70"/>
1. That in every one of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> there are three distinct sorts of <hi>Knowledge, viz.</hi> A Knowledge of <hi>Omniscience,</hi> a Knowledge of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> and a Knowledge of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> too; which, I think, is very absurd and ridiculous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And in the next place: If we affirm them to be distinct sorts of Knowledge from that of <hi>Omniscience,</hi> then they must also have <hi>Objects</hi> distinct from, and not included in the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Omniscience;</hi> since all such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, either of sorts or Acts of Knowledge is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the difference of their <hi>Objects.</hi> But this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible; since the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Omniscience</hi> comprehends in it all that is knowable; and consequently if <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> have <hi>Objects</hi> distinct from, and not included in the <hi>Object of Omniscience,</hi> those <hi>Objects</hi> must be something that is not knowable; for that <hi>Omniscience</hi> (as we have shewn) claims all that is knowable, or possible to be known, for its own <hi>Object.</hi> From all which it follows, That <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> considered as distinct from <hi>Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> are two empty Chimerical Words, without any distinct Sense, or Signification.</p>
            <p>In a word, Every Person in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> by one and the same Act of <hi>Omniscience,</hi> knows all the Internal Acts, Motions, and Relations proper both to himself, and to the other Two Persons besides. And if so, what imployment or use can there be for <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> or <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> which <hi>Omniscience</hi> (that takes in the Objects of both) has not fully answered and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged already?</p>
            <p>If it be here said, That <hi>Omniscience</hi> cannot give <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality;</hi> forasmuch as the Personality of each <hi>Person</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes him from the other two; which <hi>Omniscience</hi> (being common to them all) cannot do. This I grant,

and own it impossible for any Thing Essentially involved in the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> to give a Personal Distinction to any of the Three <hi>Persons;</hi> but then I add also, That we have equally proved, that neither was <hi>Self-Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of this <hi>Personal</hi> Distinction, by several <hi>Arguments;</hi> and more especially, because that <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> being a Thing Absolute and Irrelative, could not be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of any thing in the Nature of it perfectly Relative, as the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> certainly are. For this is a received Maxime in the Schools, with reference to the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and <hi>Persons, Repugnat in Divinis dari Absolutum Incommunicabile,</hi> Greg. de Valen. 1 Tom. p. 874. And it is a sure Rule, whereby we may distinguish in every one of the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> what is <hi>Essential,</hi> from what is <hi>Personal.</hi> For every At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute that is Absolute, is Communicable, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Essential, and every one that is purely Relative, is Incommunicable, and therefore purely Personal, and so <hi>è converso:</hi> Upon which Account <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> which is a Thing Absolute and Irrelative, cannot be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable, nor consequently the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality</hi> in any of the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity;</hi> as we have already at large demonstrated.</p>
            <p>So that still our Assertion stands good, That all that can be truly ascribed to <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> with reference to the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> may be fully and fairly accounted for from that one known Attribute, the <hi>Divine Omniscience.</hi> And therefore, that there Is no use at all either of the Term <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> or <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> to contribute to the plainer or fuller Explication of the <hi>Blessed Trinity;</hi> as this Author, with great fluster of Ostentation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, but has not yet by so much as one solid <hi>Argument</hi> proved.</p>

But when I consider how wonderfully pleased the Man is with these two new-started Terms so high in sound, and so empty of sence, instead of one substantial word, which gives us all that can be pretended useful in them, with vast overplus and advantage, and even swallows them up, as <hi>Moses</hi>'s Rod did those pitiful Tools of the <hi>Magicians;</hi> This (I say) brings to my Mind (whether I will or no) a certain Story of a Grave Person, who Riding in the Road with his Servant, and finding himself some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing uneasy in his Saddle, bespoke his Servant thus. John (says he) <hi>a-light; and first take off the Saddle that is upon my Horse, and then take off the Saddle that is upon your Horse; and when you have done this, put the Saddle that was upon my Horse, upon your Horse, and put the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle that was upon your Horse upon my Horse:</hi> Whereupon the Man, who had not studied the Philosophy of Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles (whether <hi>Ambling</hi> or <hi>Trotting)</hi> so exactly, as his Master, replys something short upon him; <hi>Lord! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, What needs all these Words? Could you not as well have said, Let us change Saddles?</hi> Now I must confess, I think the Servant was much in the right; though the Master having <hi>a Rational Head of his own,</hi> and being withal willing to make the Notion of <hi>changing</hi> Saddles more <hi>plain, easie and intelligible,</hi> and to give a clearer Explication of that word, (which his Fore-Fathers, how good <hi>Horse-men</hi> soever they might have been, yet were <hi>not equally happy in the explaining of)</hi> was pleased to set it forth by that more full and accurate Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution.</p>
            <p>And here it is not unlikely but that this Author, who, with a spight equally Malicious and Ridiculous, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon one of his Antagonists, and that for no <note place="margin">See Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter II.</note> Cause, or Provocation that appears (unless for having Baffled him) may tax me also, as one Drolling upon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101779:71"/>
               <hi>Things sacred,</hi> for representing the vanity of his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis by the forementioned Example and Comparison. But I hope the World will give me leave to distinguish between Things <hi>Sacred,</hi> and his Absurd Phantastick way of treating of them; which, I can, by no means look upon as <hi>Sacred,</hi> nor indeed any Thing else in his whole Book, but the bare <hi>Subject</hi> it treats of, and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> there quoted by him. For to speak my thoughts plainly, I believe this Sacred Mystery of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> was never so ridiculed and exposed to the Contempt of the Profane Scoffers at it, as it has been by this New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fashioned Defence of it.</p>
            <p>And so I dismiss his two so much <hi>Admired</hi> Terms (by himself I mean) as in no degree answering the Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation he raised of them. For I cannot find, That they have either heightned or strength'ned Men's Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Faculties, or cast a greater light and clearness upon that Object which has so long exercised them; but that <hi>a Trinity in Unity</hi> is as Mysterious as ever; and the Mind of Man as unable to grasp and comprehend it, as it has been from the beginning of Christianity to this day. In a word, <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> have rendred nothing about the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and <hi>Persons, plainer, easier,</hi> and more <hi>Intelligible;</hi> nor indeed, after such a mighty stress so irrationally laid upon two slight empty words, have they made any thing (but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himself) <hi>better understood than it was before.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>In which is proved against this Author, That the Three <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> are not Three Distinct <hi>Infinite Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT being certain both from <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> that there is but one only <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>God-head,</hi> in which <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion</hi> has taught us, That there are Three <hi>Persons;</hi> Many Eminent Professors of it have attempted to shew, how one and the same Nature might Subsist in Three <hi>Persons,</hi> and how the said Three <hi>Persons</hi> might meet in one, and make no more than one simple, undivided <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> It had been to be wished, I confess, that Divines had rested in the bare Expressions delivered in Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Mystery, and ventured no further by any particular, and bold Explications of it. But since the Nature, or rather Humour of Man has been still too strong for his Duty, and his Curiosity (especially in things Sacred) been apt to carry him too far; those, however, have been all along the most pardonable, who have ventured least, and proceeded upon the surest grounds both of Scripture it self, and of Reason discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon it. And such I affirm the Ancient Writers and Fathers of the Church, and after them the School-men to have been; who with all their Faults (or rather Infelicities, caused by the Times and Circumstances
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101779:72"/>
they lived in) are better Divines, and Soberer Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers than any of those Pert, Confident, Raw Men, who are much better at Despising and Carping at them, than at Reading and Understanding them: Though Wise Men Despise nothing, but they will know it first; and for that Cause very rationally despise them.</p>
            <p>But among those, who leaving the Common Road of the Church have took a By-way to themselves, none (of late Years especially) have ventured so boldly and so far as this Author; who pretending to be <hi>more happy</hi> (forsooth) <hi>in his Explication of this Mystery than all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him</hi> (as who would not believe a Man in his own Commendation?) and to give a more satisfactory Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this long received, and Revered Article by Terms perfectly New, and peculiarly his own, has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced quite different Notions about this Mystery, from any that our Church was ever yet acquainted with; Affirming, (as he does) <hi>That the Three Persons in the God-head, are Three Distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits,</hi> as will appear from the several places of his Book, where he declares his Thoughts upon this great Subject. As, First in <hi>Page</hi> 50. he says, The Three <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, <hi>are Three Infinite Minds really distinct from each other.</hi> Again, in <hi>Page</hi> 66. The <hi>Persons</hi> (says he) are perfectly distinct; <hi>for they are Three distinct and Infinite Minds, and therefore Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Persons:</hi> For a <hi>Person is an Intelligent Being; and to say, they are Three Divine Persons, and not Three distinct Infinite Minds, is both Heresie and Nonsense.</hi> For which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Complement passed upon the whole Body of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and perhaps all the Churches of <hi>Christendom</hi> besides, as I have paid him part of my thanks already, so I will not fail yet further to account with him before I put an end to this Chapter. In the mean
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101779:73"/>
time, he goes on, in <hi>Page</hi> 102. <hi>I plainly assert</hi> (says he) <hi>That as the Father is an Eternal and Infinite Mind, so the Son is an Eternal and Infinite Mind distinct from the Father,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is an <hi>Eternal and Infinite Mind distinct both from Father and Son:</hi> Adding withall these words; <hi>Which</hi> (says he) <hi>every Body can understand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any skill in Logick, or Metaphysicks.</hi> And this, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, is most truly and seasonably remarked by him: For the want of this Qualification is so far from being any hindrance in the Case mentioned, that I dare undertake, that nothing but want <hi>of skill</hi> in <hi>Logick and Metaphysicks,</hi> can bring any Man living, who acknowledges the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> to own this Assertion. I need repeat no more of his Expressions to this purpose; these being sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Opinion; save only that in <hi>Page</hi> 119. where (he says) <hi>That Three Minds, or Spirits, which have no other difference, are yet distinguish'd by Self-Consciousness, and are Three distinct Spirits.</hi> And that other in <hi>Page</hi> 258. where speaking of the Three <hi>Persons, I grant</hi> (says he) <hi>that they are Three Holy Spirits.</hi> By the same Token, that he there very Learnedly distinguishes between <hi>Ghost</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> allowing <hi>the said Three Persons</hi> (as we have shewn) to be <hi>Three Holy Spirits,</hi> but at the same time denying them to be <hi>Three Holy Ghosts,</hi> and this with great scorn of those who should hold, or speak otherwise. To which at present I shall say no more but this, That he would do well to turn these two Propositions into <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Latin;</hi> and that will presently shew him what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and distinction there is between a <hi>Ghost</hi> and a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and why the very same things which are affirmed of the one (notwithstanding the difference of those words in <hi>English)</hi> may not, with the same Truth, be affirmed of the other also. But the Examination of this odd Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will fall in more naturally towards the latter end of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101779:73"/>
this Chapter, where it shall be particularly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>I have now shewn this Author's Judgment in the Point, and in opposition to what he has so boldly Assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and laid down, I do here deny, <hi>That the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Blessed Trinity, are Three distinct Infinite Minds or Three distinct Infinite Spirits.</hi> And to overthrow his Assertion, and evince the Truth of mine, I shall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neither my Reader nor my self, with many <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> But of those, which I shall make use of, the first is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> I. <hi>Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits, are Three distinct Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity, are not Three distinct Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity, are not three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Minor, I suppose, this Author will readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with me in; howbeit his Hypothesis (as shall be shewn) in the certain Consequences of it Contradicts it, and, if it should stand, would effectually overturn it. For by that he asserts a perfect <hi>Tritheisme,</hi> though I have so much Charity for him, as to believe, that he does not know it.</p>
            <p>The Major Proposition therefore is that which must be debated between us. This Author holds it in the Negative, and I in the Affirmative: and my Reason for what I affirm, <hi>viz.</hi> That Three <hi>distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits, are Three distinct Gods,</hi> is this, That <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Infinite Mind,</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> are Terms Equipollent, and Convertible. <hi>God being</hi> truly and properly an <hi>Infinite Mind, or Spirit,</hi> and <hi>an Infinite Mind or Spirit</hi> being as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101779:74"/>
truly and properly <hi>God.</hi> And to shew this Convertibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Commensuration between them yet further: Whatsoever may be affirmed or denied of the one, may with equal Truth and Propriety be affirmed or denied of the other. And to give an Instance of this with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Three <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity;</hi> As it is true, that one and the same <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>God-head</hi> is Common to, and Subsists in all and every one of the Three <hi>Persons;</hi> so is it true, <hi>That one and the same Infinite Mind, or Spirit,</hi> is Common to, and Subsists in the said Three <hi>Persons:</hi> And consequently, as it is false, That one and the same <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>God-head,</hi> by being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to, and Subsisting in the Three <hi>Persons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Three <hi>Gods,</hi> or Three <hi>God-heads;</hi> so is it equally false, That one and the same <hi>Infinite Mind,</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> by being Common to, and Subsisting in the said Three <hi>Persons,</hi> becomes Three <hi>Infinite Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spirits.</hi> This is clear Argumentation, and craves no Mercy at our Author's Hands.</p>
            <p>If it be here objected, That we allow of Three <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Persons</hi> in the <hi>God-head,</hi> of which every one is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,</hi> without admitting them to be Three distinct <hi>Gods;</hi> and therefore, why may we not as well allow of Three <hi>distinct Infinite Minds</hi> or <hi>Spirits</hi> in the same <hi>God-head</hi> without any necessity of inferring from thence, That they are Three distinct <hi>Gods?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, That the Case is very different, and the Reason of the difference is this, Because Three <hi>Infinite Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spirits</hi> are Three Absolute, Simple <hi>Beings,</hi> or <hi>Essences,</hi> and so stand distinguished from one another, by their whole <hi>Beings</hi> or <hi>Natures.</hi> But the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> are Three Relatives, (or one simple <hi>Being,</hi> or <hi>Essence,</hi> under three distinct Relations) and consequently differ from one another, not wholly, and by all that is in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101779:74"/>
them, but only by some certain <hi>Mode,</hi> or <hi>respect</hi> peculiar to each, and upon that Account causing their Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And therefore to Argue from a <hi>Person</hi> to a <hi>Spirit</hi> here is manifestly Sophistical, and that which is called, <hi>Fallacia Accidentis,</hi> or (since several Fallacies may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the same Proposition) it may be also <hi>à dicto secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dùm quid ad dictum simpliciter.</hi> For so it is to conclude, That Three <hi>Persons</hi> are Three <hi>distinct Gods;</hi> since the difference of Persons is only from a <hi>diverse respect</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; but Three <hi>Gods</hi> import Three absolutely <hi>distinct Natures or Substances.</hi> And whereas we say, That the Three <hi>Persons</hi> are all and every one of them <hi>Infinite,</hi> yet it is but from one and the same Numerical Nature Common to them all that they are so, the Ternary Number all the while not belonging to their <hi>Infinity,</hi> but only to their <hi>Personalities.</hi> The Case there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore between <hi>a Mind, or Spirit,</hi> and <hi>a Person,</hi> is by no means the same. Forasmuch as <hi>[Person]</hi> here imports only a Relation, or Mode of <hi>Subsistence</hi> in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Nature it belongs to: And therefore a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of <hi>Persons</hi> (of it self) imports only a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of such <hi>Modes,</hi> or <hi>Relations,</hi> without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Multiplication of the Nature it self to which they adhere. Forasmuch as one and the same Nature may sustain several distinct Relations, or Modes of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence. But now on the other side, a <hi>Mind,</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> is not a Relation, or Mode of <hi>Subsistence,</hi> but it is an Absolute <hi>Being, Nature,</hi> or <hi>Substance;</hi> and consequently cannot be multiplyed without a Multiplication of it into so many Numerical Absolute <hi>Beings, Natures,</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;</hi> there being nothing in it to be <hi>multiplyed</hi> but it self. So that Three <hi>Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spirits,</hi> are Three Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute <hi>Beings, Natures,</hi> or <hi>Substances,</hi> and <hi>Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits,</hi> are accordingly <hi>Three distinct</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:101779:75"/>
               <hi>Infinite Absolute Beings, Natures, or Substances.</hi> That is, in other words, <hi>They are Three Gods;</hi> which was the Thing to be proved; and let this Author ward off the Proof of it as he is able.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> II. My Second <hi>Argument</hi> against the Three <hi>Persons</hi> in the <hi>Blessed Trinity</hi> being <hi>Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits, is this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Three distinct Minds, or Spirits are Three distinct Substances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Three Persons in the Blessed Trinity are not Three distinct Substances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore they are not Three distinct Minds, or Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Major Proposition is proved from the Definition of a <hi>Mind,</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> That it is <hi>Substantia Incorporea In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligens,</hi> an Intelligent, Incorporeal, [or Immaterial] Substance; and therefore Three <hi>distinct Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> must be Three such <hi>distinct Substances.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if a <hi>Mind,</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> were not a <hi>Substance,</hi> what could it be else? If it be any Thing, it must be either <hi>an Accident, or Mode of Being.</hi> But not an Accident, since no Accident can be in <hi>God;</hi> nor yet <hi>a Mode of Being,</hi> since a <hi>Spirit</hi> (not designed to concur as a part towards any Compound) is an Absolute, Entire, Complete Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of itself, and has its proper Mode of Subsistence belonging to it; and therefore cannot be <hi>a Mode</hi> it self. From whence it follows, That a <hi>Spirit</hi> is, and must be a <hi>Substance,</hi> and can be nothing else.</p>
            <p>As for the Minor, viz. <hi>That the Three Persons in the Blessed Trinity are not Three distinct Substances;</hi> this is evident both from Authority, and from Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:101779:75"/>
And first for Authority, <hi>Tertullian</hi> against <hi>Praxeas</hi> affirms, <hi>Semper in Deo una Substantia.</hi> And St. <hi>Ierom</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Damasus, Quis ore sacrilego Tres substantias praedicabit?</hi> And St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his 5th Book <hi>de Trinitate,</hi> Chap. 9. and in Book 7. Chap. 4. And <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in the 1st Book of his History, Chap. 29. All affirm One Substance in <hi>God,</hi> and deny Three, and yet the same Writers unanimously hold Three <hi>Persons,</hi> which shews, That they did not account these Three <hi>Persons,</hi> Three <hi>Substances.</hi> And <hi>Anselmus</hi> in his Book <hi>de Incarnatione,</hi> Chap. 3. says, That the Father and the Son may be said to be Two <hi>Beings,</hi> provided that by Beings we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Relations, not Substances. And <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> a Writer Orthodox enough in these points, and of unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable Learning otherwise, in his 2d <hi>Tome, page</hi> 348. about the end, says, That to assert, that the Father and the Son differ in Substance, is <hi>Arianism:</hi> And yet if they were Two <hi>distinct Substances,</hi> for them not to differ in Substance, would be impossible. And as for the <hi>Greek</hi> Writers, they never admit of Three <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>Deity,</hi> but where <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is used to signifie the same with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as sometimes it was used: And by reason of this Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity it was, that the <hi>Latin</hi> Church was so long fearful of using the word Hypostasis, and used only that of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sona,</hi> answering to the <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, lest they should hereby be thought to admit of <hi>Three Substances,</hi> as well as Three <hi>Persons</hi> in the <hi>God-head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor, in the next place, is the same less evident from Reason, than we have shewn it to be from Authority. For if the Three <hi>Persons</hi> be Three <hi>distinct Substances,</hi> then Two <hi>distinct Substances</hi> will concur in, and belong to each Person; to wit, <hi>That Substance</hi> which is the <hi>Divine Essence,</hi> and so is Communicable or Common to all the <hi>Persons,</hi> and <hi>that Substance</hi> which Constitutes each
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101779:76"/>
Person, and thereby is so peculiar to him as to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish him from the other, and consequently to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable to any besides him to whom it belongs: Since for one and the same Substance to be Common to all Three <hi>Persons,</hi> and withal to belong incommunicably to each of the Three, and thereby to distinguish them from one another, is Contradictious and Impossible. And yet on the other side to assert Two <hi>distinct Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in each <hi>Person,</hi> is altogether as Absurd; and that, as upon many other Accounts, so particularly upon this, That it must infer such a Composition in the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> as is utterly Incompatible with the Absolute Simplicity, and Infinite Perfection of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> And therefore the Three <hi>Persons</hi> in the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> can by no means be said to be Three <hi>distinct Substances,</hi> but only one <hi>Infinite Substance,</hi> equally Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to, and Subsisting in them all, and diversified by their respective Relations. And moreover, since Three <hi>distinct Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spirits</hi> are Essentially Three <hi>distinct Substances,</hi> neither can the Three <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> be said to be Three <hi>distinct Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spirits;</hi> which was the Point to be made out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> III. My Third <hi>Argument</hi> against the same shall proceed thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be truly said, That one and the same Infinite Mind, or Spirit is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, (I mean all Three taken together) and it cannot be truly said, That one and the same Infinite Mind, or Spirit is Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits; then it follows, That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits.</hi>

               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:101779:76"/>
               <hi>But it may be truly said, That one and the same Infinite Mind, or Spirit is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and it cannot be truly said, That one and the same Infinite Mind, or Spirit is Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the Three Persons in the Trinity,</hi> viz. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost are not Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Consequence of the Major appears from this, That the same Thing, or Things, at the same time, and in the same respect, cannot be truly affirmed and denied of the same Subject: And therefore since <hi>[Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> taken joyntly together] are truly predicated of one and the same <hi>Infinite Mind;</hi> and [Three <hi>distinct Infinite Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spirits]</hi> cannot be truly affirmed or predicated, and consequently may be truly denied of the same; it follows, That <hi>[Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost]</hi> and [Three <hi>distinct Infinite Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spirits]</hi> neither are, nor can be accounted the same, nor be truly affirmable of one another.</p>
            <p>As for the Minor, it consists of two parts, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly must be proved severally in each of them.</p>
            <p>And First, That it is, and may be truly said, <hi>That one and the same Infinite Mind is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost (viz.</hi> joyntly taken) as I noted before. This, I say, may be proved from hence, That <hi>God</hi> is truly said <hi>to be Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> (still so taken.) And it having been already evinced, That <hi>[one Infinite Mind, or Spirit]</hi> and <hi>[one God]</hi> are terms convertible and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent, it follows, That whatsoever is truly affirmed or denied of the one, may be as truly affirmed or denied of the other. And this is too evident to need any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:101779:77"/>
And therefore in the next place, for the proof of the other part of the Minor, viz. <hi>That one and the same Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mind, or Spirit, cannot be truly said to be Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits;</hi> This is no less evident than the former, because in such a Proposition both Subject and Predicate imply a Mutual Negation of, and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to one and another; and where it is so, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for one to be truly affirmed, or predicated of the other.</p>
            <p>And now, after this plain proof given both of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor and the Minor Proposition, and this also drawn into so little a compass, I hope this Author will not bear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so much above all the Rules which other Mortals proceed by, as, after the Premises proved, to deny the Conclusion, viz. <hi>That the Three Persons in the Blessed Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are not Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits.</hi> The Affirmation of which, is that which I undertook to confute.</p>
            <p>But before I dismiss this <hi>Argument,</hi> I cannot but take notice, That the same Terms, with a bare Transpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, <hi>viz.</hi> by shifting place between the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and the Subject (which in Adequate and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surate Predications, may very well be done) will as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually conclude to the same Purpose, as they did in the way in which we have already proposed them. And so the <hi>Argument</hi> will proceed thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be truly and properly said, That the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Blessed Trinity, are one Numerical Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mind, or Spirit; then they cannot be truly said to be Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But they are truly and properly said to be one Numerical Infinite Mind, or Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:101779:77"/>
               <hi>And therefore they neither are, nor can be truly said to be Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Consequence of the first Proposition is manifest, because (as we have shewn before) <hi>one and the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mind</hi> cannot be Three <hi>distinct Infinite Minds</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Contradiction in the Terms.</p>
            <p>And for the Minor, viz. <hi>That the Three Persons are truly said to be one Infinite Mind, or Spirit;</hi> That also is proved by this, That all and every one of them, are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly <hi>said to be God; and God is truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly one Numerical Infinite Mind, or Spirit:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Three <hi>Persons</hi> are said to be the First, they must be said to be this Latter also; and that (as I shew before) because of the Reciprocal Predication of those Terms. But as to the Matter before us, <hi>That God is truly and properly one Numerical Infinite Mind, or Spirit,</hi> even this Author himself allows, who in <hi>Page</hi> 69. posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively says, <hi>That we know nothing of the Divine Essence, but that God is an Infinite Mind.</hi> Very well; and if he grant him to be an <hi>Infinite Mind,</hi> let him prove <hi>this Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mind</hi> to be <hi>three distinct Infinite Minds,</hi> if he can. The Truth is <hi>[Infinite Mind or Spirit]</hi> is an Essential Attribute of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and Convertible with it, and whatsoever is so, belongs equally to all the Three <hi>Persons,</hi> and consequently cannot be ascribed to them <hi>plurally</hi> any more than the <hi>Deity</hi> it self; it being as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable, as that, of being multiplied. Upon which Account, if the Three <hi>Persons</hi> are with equal Truth said to be <hi>[one Infinite Mind, or Spirit]</hi> and to be <hi>[one God]</hi> they can no more be said to be Three <hi>distinct Infinite Minds,</hi> than they can be said to be Three <hi>distinct Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:101779:78"/>
So that which way soever the <hi>Argument</hi> be proposed, either, <hi>That one Infinite Mind is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;</hi> or, <hi>That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mind,</hi> it still overthrows this Author's Hypothesis, That the said Three <hi>Persons</hi> are Three <hi>distinct Infinite Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> IV. My Fourth and Last <hi>Argument</hi> against the same, shall be this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatsoever Attribute may be truly predicated of all and each of the Divine Persons in the</hi> Athanasian <hi>Form, so belongs to them all in Common, that it can belong to none of them under any Term of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction from the rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Attribute</hi> [Infinite Mind, or Spirit] <hi>may be truly predicated of all and each of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in and according to the</hi> Athanasian <hi>Form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore it can belong to none of them under any Term of distinction from the rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Major is as evident; as that no Attribute can be Common to several Subjects, and yet peculiar and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to each of them.</p>
            <p>And the Minor is proved by Instance thus; The <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is an <hi>Infinite Mind,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> is an <hi>Infinite Mind,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is an <hi>Infinite Mind;</hi> and yet they are not Three <hi>Infinite Minds,</hi> but one <hi>Infinite Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this I affirm to be as good Divinity as any part in the <hi>Athanasian Creed,</hi> and such as I shall abide by, both against this Author, and any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
            <p>But now let us see how his Assertion cast into the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Model, shews it self, as thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:101779:78"/>
               <hi>The Father is a distinct Infinite Mind, the Son is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Infinite Mind, and the Holy Ghost is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Infinite Mind; and yet they are not Three distinct Infinite Minds, but one distinct Infinite Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is so far from being true, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed neither <hi>Truth</hi> nor <hi>Sence.</hi> For what Truth can there be in denying, That Three <hi>Persons,</hi> of which every one is said to be a <hi>distinct Infinite Mind, are Three distinct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Minds?</hi> And what sence can there be in affirming, or saying, <hi>That they are but one distinct Infinite Mind?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Term <hi>[distinct]</hi> is never properly used or apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but with respect had to several Particulars each di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriminated from the other; but by no means where there is mention made only of <hi>one</hi> Thing and no more, as it is here in this Proposition.</p>
            <p>But to make what allowances the Case will bear, and for that purpose to remit something of the strictness of the <hi>Athanasian Form,</hi> by leaving out the word <hi>[distinct]</hi> in the last and illative Clause, we shall then see that our Author's Hypothesis will proceed thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Father is a distinct Infinite Mind, the Son is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Infinite Mind, and the Holy Ghost is a distinct Infinite Mind; and yet they are not Three Infinite Minds, but one Infinite Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, I say, it must proceed in the <hi>Athanasian</hi> way with the word <hi>[distinct]</hi> left out of the Conclusion. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless even so, the Inference is still manifestly and grosly false in both the branches of it. For it is absolutely false [That <hi>Three distinct Infinite Minds, are not Three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Minds]</hi> and altogether as false <hi>[That Three Infinite Minds, are but One Infinite Mind.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author's Hypothesis put into the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Model, must needs fall in with that Fallacy sometimes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101779:79"/>
urged against us by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> viz. The <hi>Father is a Person, the Son a Person, and the Holy Ghost a Person, and yet they are not Three Persons, but one Person;</hi> which is manifestly Sophistical, by arguing <hi>ab imparibus tanquam paribus,</hi> viz. Concluding that of an Attribute <hi>Relative,</hi> and <hi>Multiplicable,</hi> which can be concluded only of such as are not So.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Inference holds only in Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes <hi>Essential</hi> and <hi>Common</hi> to all the Three <hi>Persons</hi> joyntly, or severally taken, and not in such as are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Personal,</hi> and Peculiar to each. As also in such as are <hi>Absolute,</hi> (as the Attribute of <hi>Mind,</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> without the word <hi>[distinct]</hi> is) and not in such as are <hi>Relative.</hi> For those Attributes, which agree to the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> Personally, Peculiarly, and Relatively can never Unite, or Coincide into <hi>one</hi> in the Inference, or Conclusion. In a word <hi>[Infinite Mind, or Spirit]</hi> is a Predicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Essential, and so in its Numerical Unity Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Three <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> and for that cause not to be affirmed of, or ascribed to, either all or any of them with the Term <hi>[distinct]</hi> added to it, or joyned with it. For that would <hi>multiply</hi> an Attribute that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>multiplyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, what I have here discoursed upon, and drawn from the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed with respect to this particular Subject, I leave to our Author's strictest Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. For my own part, I rely upon this <hi>Creed,</hi> as a sure Test, or Rule to discover the falshood of his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis by. So that as long as it is true, that <hi>God is one</hi> numerical <hi>Infinite Mind or Spirit,</hi> and as long as the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasian</hi> Form duely applied is a firm and good way of Reasoning, this Author's Assertion, <hi>That the Three Divine Persons, are Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits,</hi> is thereby irrefragably overthrown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:101779:79"/>
And therefore I shall not concern my self to produce any more Arguments against it. Only by way of <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus</hi> to, and <hi>Illustration</hi> of those, which have already been alledged, I cannot but observe the Concurrent Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Philosophers, and most Learned Men amongst the Heathens about <hi>God's being one Infinite Mind, or Spirit,</hi> as a necessary deduction (no doubt) made by Natural Reason from the Principles thereof concerning the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</hi> For most of the Philosophers looked upon <hi>God</hi> as <hi>the Soul of the World,</hi> as <hi>One Infinite Mind, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that animated and presided over the Universe. For so held <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> in his first Book, <hi>de Naturâ Deorum,</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> in his Book <hi>de irâ Dei,</hi> tells us, <hi>Pythagoras quoque unum Deum confitetur dicens Incorpoream esse</hi> mentem <hi>quae per omnem Naturam diffusa &amp; intenta vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talem sensum tribuit.</hi> In like manner the Great <hi>Hermes</hi> being asked, <hi>What God was,</hi> answered, <gap reason="foreign">

And the same was the Opinion of <hi>Cato</hi> before him, a great Man, though but a small Author, who tells us from the Ancient Poets (who were accounted the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers of the first Ages.) That <hi>Deus est Animus,</hi> God is a Mind, or Spirit.</p>
            <p>And the Truth is, I reckon that these Learned Men, all along, <hi>by an Infinite</hi> Mind, or Spirit, understood as truly and certainly <hi>One</hi> Infinite Mind, or Spirit, as if the Term of Unity had been added by them. For besides that the Particles <hi>a,</hi> or <hi>the,</hi> (which we use in translating any single word into our own Language) import so much, the very condition also of the Subject spoken of, as being <hi>Infinite,</hi> must needs infer the same. So that we see here how the Judgment of Natural Reason in these Eminent Philosophers amongst the Heathens falls in with what God himself revealed by the Mouth of our Saviour concerning his own Nature, in <hi>John</hi> 4. 24. viz. <hi>That God is a Spirit.</hi> For we have them expressing him by these words, <hi>Aninius, Mens, &amp; Spiritus.</hi> So that had they all lived after St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> (as one of them did,) their Sentences might have passed for so many Paraphrases
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101779:80"/>
upon the Text, all declaring God to be <hi>One Infinite Soul, Mind, or Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps our Author will here say, What is all this to the purpose, since we found our knowledge of the Three <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> wholly upon <hi>Revelation?</hi> And I grant, we do so; Yet nevertheless I shall, by his good favour, shew, That what I have alledged is very much to the purpose. And to this end, premising here what we have already proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>to be One Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mind, and to be Three distinct Infinite Minds,</hi> involve in them a Mutual Negation of, and Contradiction to one another: (Forasmuch as to be <hi>Unum,</hi> is to be <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum in se;</hi> that is to say, Indivisible into more things, <hi>such</hi> as it self.) This, I say, premised,</p>
            <p>First, I desire this Author to produce that Revelation, which declares the Three <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> to be Three <hi>distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits.</hi> For I deny that there is any such.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I affirm, That whatsoever is a Truth in Natural Reason, cannot be contradicted by any other Truth declared by Revelation; since it is impossible for any one Truth to contradict another.</p>
            <p>Upon which grounds, I here ask our Author, Is it a Contradiction <hi>for One God to be One Infinite Mind,</hi> or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and to be also Three Infinite Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spirits?</hi> If he grant this (as I have proved it, whether he does or no) then I ask him in the next place, Whether it be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position true in Natural Reason, <hi>[That God is one Infinite Mind,</hi> or <hi>Spirit?]</hi> If he grants this also, then I infer, That it cannot be proved true from Revelation, <hi>[That God is Three Infinite Minds, or Spirits,]</hi> since the certain Truth of the first Proposition supposed and admitted must needs disprove the Truth of that <hi>Revelation,</hi> which pretends to establish the second.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:101779:81"/>
But some again may perhaps ask, Suppose it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in <hi>express Terms, [That God is Three distinct Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Minds, or Spirits,]</hi> would you in this case throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side this Revelation in submission to the former Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion declared by Natural Reason? I Answer, No: But if the Revelation were <hi>express</hi> and undeniable, I would adhere to it; but at the same time, while I did so, I would quit the former Proposition, and conclude, That Natural Reason had not discoursed right when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>That God was one Infinite Mind, or Spirit:</hi> But to hold both Propositions to be True, and to assent to them both as such, This the Mind of Man can never do.</p>
            <p>So that, in a word, I conclude, That if it be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true from Reason, <hi>That God is one Infinite Mind, or Spirit.</hi> No Revelation can, or ought to be pleaded, <hi>That he is Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits:</hi> And if Revelation cannot, or ought not to be pleaded for it, I am sure, we have no ground to believe it. And yet at the same time I own and assert a Revelation of the truth of this Proposition, <hi>[That God is Three Persons]</hi> or, which is all one, <hi>[That God is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,]</hi> since it does not at all contradict the forementioned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions founded upon Natural Reason, [viz. <hi>That God is One Infinite Mind, or Spirit,]</hi> nor could it yet ever be proved to do so, either by <hi>Arians,</hi> or <hi>Socinians.</hi> But on the contrary, these two Propositions, viz. <hi>[God is One Infinite Mind, or Spirit]</hi> and that other, <hi>[God is Three distinct Infinite Minds or Spirits]</hi> (which he must be, if the Three <hi>Divine Persons</hi> are Three <hi>distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits)</hi> are Gross, Palpable, and Irreconcileable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions. And because they are so, it is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively certain, <hi>That the said Three Persons are not Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits:</hi> As this Author against
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101779:81"/>
all Principles of Philosophy and Divinity has most er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneously affirmed them to be.</p>
            <p>I have said enough, I hope, upon this Subject. But before I quit it, it will not be amiss to observe what work this Man makes with the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> (as indeed he seldom almost turns his Pen, but he gives some scurvy stroke at it or other,) particularly in <hi>Page</hi> 89. he affirms, That the Expression of <hi>[the One true God,</hi> and <hi>the only true God] cannot properly be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Son, nor to the Holy Ghost.</hi> From whence I infer, That then neither can the Expression of <hi>[God, or the True God]</hi> be properly attributed to the <hi>Son,</hi> or to the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Forasmuch as the Terms <hi>[one God]</hi> and <hi>[One True God, or one only True God]</hi> are equivalent. The Term <hi>[One God]</hi> including in it every whit as much as the Term <hi>[One True God, or One only True God]</hi> and the Term <hi>[One True God, or One only True God]</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding in it no more than the Term <hi>[One God;]</hi> and consequently if he asserts, That these Terms cannot with equal Propriety be attributed to, and predicated of the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> we have him both <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Macedonian</hi> together in this Assertion.</p>
            <p>And I believe his Adversary the <hi>Author of the Notes</hi> could hardly have desired a greater Advantage against him, than his calling it (as he does) <hi>a Corruption of the</hi> Athanasian <hi>Creed,</hi> to joyn the Term <hi>[One True God]</hi> to every <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> adding withal, That upon the doing so, <hi>it would sound pretty like a Contradiction to say in the close [That there was but One True God.]</hi> These are our Author's words, but much fitter to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a <hi>Socinian,</hi> than from one professing a belief, and (which is more) <hi>a defence</hi> of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> But in answer to them, I tell him, That the repeated Attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>[The One True God, or Only True God]</hi> to each of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101779:82"/>
the Three <hi>Persons</hi> is no Corruption of that Creed at all. Forasmuch as these Terms <hi>[The One True God, and the only True God]</hi> import, an Attribute purely Essential, and so equally, and in Common belonging to all the Three <hi>Persons,</hi> and not an <hi>Attribute properly Personal,</hi> and so appropriate to some one or other of the said <hi>Persons.</hi> And if this Author would have duly distinguished between <hi>Essential</hi> and <hi>Personal</hi> Attributes, he could not have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of these Matters at so odd a rate, as here he does. And therefore I deny it to be any <hi>Contradiction</hi> (let it sound in his Ears how it will) to conclude, That the said Three <hi>Persons</hi> (notwithstanding this Repetition) <hi>are not Three True Gods, but only One True God.</hi> But he says, <hi>That such a Repeated Application implies as if each Person considered as distinguished and separated from the other were the One True God,</hi> To which I Answer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That to imply as if a thing were so,</hi> and to imply <hi>that really it is so,</hi> makes a very great difference in the case; indeed so great, that this Author must not think from words implying only the former to conclude the latter; which yet must be done, or what he here alledges is nothing to his purpose. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. I Answer yet farther, That the forementioned words do indeed <hi>imply,</hi> and (which is more) plainly declare, That the Three <hi>Persons</hi> who are said to be <hi>[the One, or only True God]</hi> are, while they sustain that Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, really distinct from one another, but it does not imply, That this is said of them under that peculiar <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, as they are distinct,</hi> and much less, <hi>as separated;</hi> which latter they neither are, nor can be. The truth is, what he has said against the repeated Application of this Term to every one of the Three <hi>Persons,</hi> may be equally
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101779:82"/>
objected against all the repeated Predications in the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasian</hi> Creed; but to as little purpose, one as the other; since, albeit all these Predications do agree to <hi>Persons really distinct,</hi> yet they agree not to them under that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and precise consideration <hi>as distinct:</hi> For nothing but their respective Personal Relations agree to them under that Capacity; and this effectually clears off this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>But here I cannot but wonder, that this Man should jumble together these two Terms <hi>[distinguished</hi> and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated]</hi> as he does twice here in the compass of eight Lines; when the signification of them, as applyed to the Three <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> is so vastly different, that one of these Terms [viz. <hi>distinguished]</hi> necessarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them, and the other which is <hi>[separated]</hi> neither does nor can take place amongst them: Nay, and when this Author himself has so earnestly and frequently contended for the difference of them; as all along assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>distinction of Persons,</hi> and as often denying their <hi>separation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he proceeds, and says, That this Expression of <hi>[The One [or only] True God] is never (that he knows of) attributed to Son, or Holy Ghost, either in Scripture, or any Catholick Writer.</hi> Which words, methinks, (as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but observe again) do not look, as if a Man were Writing against the <hi>Socinians.</hi> Nevertheless admitting the Truth of his Allegation, <hi>That this Term [the One True God] is not to be found expresly attributed to the Son, or the Holy Ghost,</hi> will he infer from hence, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it neither can, nor ought to be so? For if that be attributed to them Both in Scripture and Catholick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which necessarily and essentially implys <hi>[The One True God]</hi> and does, and must signifie the very same Thing, is it not all one, as if <hi>in Terminis</hi> it had been
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101779:83"/>
ascribed to them? Doubtless there are several other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed, as hardly (as this) to be found elsewhere: However, the Thing being certain from other words equivalent, this exception is of no force at all; nor by any one, who understands these Matters, is, or ought to be accounted so; and much less can I see to what end it should be insisted upon by any one, while he is encountring the <hi>Socinians:</hi> And therefore, whereas he says, This Attribute, or Title, <hi>viz. [The One True God] cannot</hi> so properly <hi>be ascribed to any one Person, but only to the Father;</hi> (whom, he tells us, the Fathers call <hi>the Fountain of the Deity)</hi> what he here designs by the words <hi>so properly</hi> (which seem to import degrees of Propriety) I cannot well tell: But this I ask, in short, May it be <hi>properly</hi> attributed <hi>to the Son,</hi> and <hi>to the Holy Ghost,</hi> or may it not? If not; then they are not properly <hi>[The One True God]</hi> nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently are they properly <hi>[The True God:]</hi> For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever any <hi>one properly is,</hi> that he may be <hi>properly said to</hi> be.</p>
            <p>And as for [the Father's being <hi>the Fountain of the Deity,]</hi> I hope he looks upon this Expression only as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical, and such as ought not to be stretched to the utmost of its Native Sence, for fear the Consequences of it may engage him too far, to be able to make an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Retreat; which I assure him, if he does not take heed, they certainly will. But, in a word, I demand of him, Whether <hi>[the Father's being the Fountain of Deity]</hi> does appropriate and restrain the Thing expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the <hi>[One True God]</hi> to the <hi>Father</hi> in contra-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction to the other Two <hi>Persons,</hi> or not? If it does, then the same Absurdity recurs, <hi>viz.</hi> [That neither <hi>is the Son, nor the Holy Ghost, the One True God]</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, neither simply, really and essentially <hi>[God.]</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:101779:83"/>
But on the other side, if <hi>[the Father's being the Fountain of the Deity]</hi> does not appropriate the Thing signified by <hi>[the One True God]</hi> to the Father, then it leaves it common to the other Two Persons with Himself, and to each of them. And whatsoever is so, may with the same Propriety and Truth of Speech be ascribed to, and affirmed of them, as it is often ascribed to, and affirmed of the <hi>Father</hi> Himself. The Truth is, this Man's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous and unwary way of expressing himself in this sacred and arduous Subject (to give it no worse word, whatsoever it may deserve) affords the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> no small Advantages against this Doctrine; should it stand upon the strength of His Defence, as (thanks be to <hi>God)</hi> it does not.</p>
            <p>But I must not here omit that Passage, which, in the former part of this Chapter, I promised more particularly to consider; a Passage, which indeed looks something strangely. It is that in <hi>P.</hi> 258. <hi>line</hi> 27. where he tells us, that he allows, <hi>That in the Blessed Trinity there are Three Holy Spirits,</hi> but denys, <hi>That there are Three Holy Ghosts;</hi> so natural is it for false Opinions to force Men to absurd Expressions. But my Answer to him is short and positive, That neither are there <hi>Three Holy Spirits nor Three Holy Ghosts</hi> in the <hi>Blessed Trinity</hi> in any sense properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to these words. However, the Thing meant by him (so far as it is reducible to Truth and Reason) is, and must be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That when the Third <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is called the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> there the word <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> (which otherwise signifies the same with <hi>Holy Spirit)</hi> must be taken <hi>Personally,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Incommunicably;</hi> but when the <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Son,</hi> is said to be a <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> there <hi>Spirit</hi> must be understood <hi>Essentially,</hi> for that <hi>Immaterial, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> and <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> which is common to, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101779:84"/>
Predicable of all the <hi>Divine Persons.</hi> All which is most true. But then, for this very Reason, I must tell our Author withal, That as <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> taken <hi>Personally</hi> is but <hi>Numerically one;</hi> so <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> as it is understood <hi>Essentially,</hi> is but <hi>Numerically one</hi> too. And therefore, though the <hi>Father</hi> may be called a <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and the two other <hi>Persons</hi> may each of them be called so likewise, yet they are not therefore <hi>Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Holy Spirits,</hi> nor can be truly so called (as this Author pretends they ought to be, and we have sufficiently disproved) but they are all one and the same <hi>Holy Spirit Essentially</hi> taken; and which so taken, is as much as <hi>one and the same God.</hi> And moreover, though <hi>Spirit</hi> understood <hi>Personally</hi> distinguishes the <hi>Third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> from the other two, yet taken <hi>Essentially,</hi> it speaks him <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same Spirit,</hi> as well as <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same God</hi> with them, and can by no means distinguish him from them, any more than the <hi>Divine Essence,</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> (which <hi>Spirit</hi> in this sence, is only another word for) can discriminate the Three <hi>Persons</hi> from one another. So that upon the whole Matter, it is equally false and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, That in the <hi>Blessed Trinity</hi> there should be <hi>Three Holy Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghosts,</hi> (Terms perfectly Synonymous) either upon a <hi>Personal,</hi> or an <hi>Essential</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and consequently that there should be so at all. For, as the word <hi>Spirit</hi> imports a peculiar Mode of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,</hi> by way of <hi>Spiration</hi> from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> so it is <hi>Personal</hi> and <hi>Incommunicable;</hi> but as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the <hi>Immaterial Substance</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> so indeed (as being the same with the <hi>Deity</hi> it self) it is equally Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Three <hi>Persons;</hi> but still, for all that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains <hi>Numerically one</hi> and no more; as all must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Deity</hi> to be. And this is the true state of the Case. But to state the difference between the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:101779:84"/>
and the other Two <hi>Persons,</hi> upon something signified by <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which is not signified by <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> (as the words of this Author manifestly do; while <hi>he affirms Three Holy Spirits,</hi> but <hi>denies Three Holy Ghosts)</hi> this is not only <hi>a playing with words</hi> (which he pretends to scorn) but <hi>a taking of words for things;</hi> which, I am sure, is very ridiculous.</p>
            <p>And now, before I conclude this Chapter, (having a Debt upon me declared at the beginning of it) I leave it to the Impartial and Discreet Reader to judge, what is to be thought or said of that Man, who in such an Insolent, Decretorious manner, shall in such a point as this before us, charge <hi>Nonsense</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi> (two very vile words) upon all that Subscribe not to this his New (and before unheard of) Opinion. I must profess, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver met with the like in any Sober Author, and hardly in the most Licentious Libeller: The Nature of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I have, according to my poor Abilities, discussed, and finding my self thereupon extremely to dissent from this Author, am yet by no means willing to pass for a Nonsensical Heretick for my pains. For must it be Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence not to own Contradictions? viz. <hi>That One infinite Spirit is Three distinct Infinite Spirits?</hi> Or must it be <hi>Heresie</hi> not to Subscribe to <hi>Tritheisme,</hi> as the best and most Orthodox Explication of the Article of the <hi>Trinity?</hi> As for <hi>Non-sence,</hi> it must certainly imply the asserting of something for true concerning the Subject discoursed of, which yet in truth is contradictory to it (since there can be no Non-sence but what contradicts some Truth.) And whereas this Author has elsewhere, <hi>viz. P.</hi> 4. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it <hi>unreasonable to charge a contradiction in any Thing, where the Nature of the Thing discoursed of is not throughly</hi> comprehended <hi>and understood,</hi> I desire to know of him, whether he throughly understands and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101779:85"/>
the Article and Mystery of the <hi>Trinity?</hi> If he says, he does, I need no other Demonstration of his unfitness to write about it. But if he owns that he does not, let him only stick to his own Rule, and then he may keep the Charge of <hi>Non-sense</hi> to himself.</p>
            <p>But what shall we say to the Charge of Heresie, (in which St. <hi>Austin</hi> would have no Person, who is so charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be silent?) Why, in the first place we must search and enquire, whether it be so, or no? And here, if my Life lay upon it, I cannot find either in <hi>Irenaeus adversùs Haereses,</hi> or in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s <hi>Prescriptions contra Haereticos,</hi> Cap. 49. Nor in <hi>Philastrius</hi>'s Catalogue, nor in <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> nor in St. <hi>Austin,</hi> nor in <hi>Theodoret,</hi> nor in <hi>Iohannes Damascenus</hi>'s Book <hi>de Haeresibus;</hi> nor in the latter <hi>Haeresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologists,</hi> such as <hi>Alphonsus à Castro &amp; Prateolus,</hi> with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others: I cannot, I say, find in all, or in any one of these the Heresie <hi>of not asserting the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity to be Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi> no, nor yet the Heresie <hi>of denying them to be so.</hi> But where then may we find it? Why, in this Author's Book. And therefore look no further; it is enough, that so great a <hi>Master</hi> has said it; whose Authority in saying a Thing, is as good as another Man's in prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, at any time: And he says it (as we see) posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and perhaps (if need be) will be ready to take his <hi>Corporal Oath</hi> upon it, That such as deny his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis are <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this case our Condition is, in good earnest, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sad; and I know nothing to comfort us, but that the Statute <hi>de Haeretico comburendo</hi> is Repealed. And well is it for the Poor Clergy and Church of <hi>England,</hi> that it is so; for otherwise this Man would have kindled such a Fire for them, as would have torrified them with a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. But as he has stocked the Church with such
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101779:85"/>
plenty of New <hi>Hereticks</hi> (and all of his own making) so could he, by a sway of Power, as <hi>Arbitrary</hi> as his <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> provide for them also such a <hi>Furnace</hi> as that of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> (whom in his Imperious Meen and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour he so much resembles) yet he must not think That the <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Iingle</hi> of <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-Consciousness</hi> (how melodiously soever they may tinkle in his own Ears) will ever be able to Charm Me<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> over to the Worship of his <hi>Idol;</hi> or make them Sacrifice their Reason and Religion either to <hi>Him,</hi> or to the <hi>New Notions</hi> which he <hi>has set up.</hi> And indeed I cannot but here further declare, that to me it seems one of the most preposterous and unreasonable things in Nature, for any one first to assert Three <hi>Gods,</hi> and when he has so wel furnished the World with <hi>Deities,</hi> to expect that all Mankind should fall down and Worship <hi>Him.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>In which is Considered, What this Author pretends to from the Authority of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>School men,</hi> in behalf of his Hypothesis; and shewn, in the first place, That neither do the <hi>Fathers</hi> own the Three <hi>Divine Persons</hi> to be Three Distinct <hi>Infinite Minds,</hi> nor <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> to be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of their Distinction.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Have in the foregoing Chapters debated the Point with this Author, upon the Reason and Nature of the Thing it self. But that is not all, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to defend his Cause by; endeavouring to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance it also with great Authorities; and that in these positive and remarkable words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is no New Notion</hi> (says he) <hi>but the constant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine both of the Fathers and the Schools,</hi> Page 101.</p>
            <p>These are his very words; and I desire the Reader carefully to consider, and carry them along with him in his Memory. For as they are as positive, as Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can make them: so if they are not made good to the utmost, they ought severely to recoil upon any one, who shall presume to express himself at such a Rate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:101779:86"/>
And now, that we may do him all the right that may be, The way to know, whether this Author's Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis be the Constant Doctrine of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Schools,</hi> is in the first place truly and fairly to set down, what this Author's Doctrine is, and wherein it does consist; as we shall declare, what the received Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Schools</hi> is, in our Eighth Chapter.</p>
            <p>Now we shall find, That the whole Doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by him concerning the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under, and reducible to these four Heads.</p>
            <p>First, That the Three <hi>Persons</hi> in the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> are <hi>Three distinct Infinite Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is the <hi>Formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of <hi>Personality;</hi> and consequently that each of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> is such by a <hi>distinct Self-Consciousness</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and peculiarly belonging to him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Three <hi>Divine Persons</hi> being thus distinguished from one another by a <hi>distinct Self-Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> proper to each of them, are all United in one and the same Nature by one <hi>Mutual Consciousness</hi> Common to them all. And</p>
            <p>Fourthly and Lastly, That a <hi>Trinity in Unity,</hi> and <hi>an Unity in Trinity,</hi> by this Explication and Account given of it, is a very <hi>Plain, Easie and Intelligible Notion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These four Heads, or Particulars, I say, contain in them a full and fair representation of this Author's whole Hypothesis concerning the Oeconomy of the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity:</hi> And I am well assured, That the knowing and Impartial Reader, neither will, nor can deny, that they do so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:101779:87"/>
In the next place therefore, that we may see how far our Author makes good all the said Particulars by the Authority of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as he has peremptorily promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and undertook to do, I think it requisite to consider, how the <hi>Fathers</hi> expressed themselves upon this Subject, and how this Author brings the said Expressions to his purpose. For surely the natural way of knowing any Writer's Mind is by the Words and Expressions, which he pretends to deliver his Mind by. But concerning these we have our Author declaring,</p>
            <p>First, That he has not troubled his Reader with the signification of <hi>Essence, Hypostasis, Substance, Subsistence, Person, Existence, Nature,</hi> &amp;c. Pag. 101. and some of his Readers could give him a very good Reason why, though I fear too true for him to be pleased with. But the Reasons which he himself alledges for his not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his Readers either with these Terms, or the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them, are,</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That they were very differently used by the Fathers themselves,</hi> Page 101. And be it so; yet still for all that, <hi>used by them</hi> they were; and that not so very differently neither; the chief difference having been about the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which yet was fairly accorded, and well high setled between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Latines,</hi> before the end of the 6th Century, as shall be further made to appear in our Eighth Chapter. And his next Reason for <hi>his not troubling his Reader</hi> (forsooth) with these Terms, is, Because they have (as he tells us) <hi>very much obscured the Doctrine of the Trinity, instead of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it,</hi> Page 101. which being one of the chief Things, which he might conclude, would assuredly be disputed with Him; for Him thus to presume it, before he had proved it, is manifestly to beg the Question. In the mean time, certain it is, That these, and these only
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101779:87"/>
were the Terms which the <hi>Fathers</hi> used in their Disputes about the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and by which they managed them; and consequently, were they never so <hi>Ambiguous, Faulty, or Improper,</hi> (as they are much the contrary) yet, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will pretend to give the Sence of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> must have recourse to them, and do it by them; and to do otherwise, would be to dispute at Rovers, or (as the word is) <hi>to speak without Book;</hi> which may much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter become our Author in the Pulpit, than in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of such a Controversie.</p>
            <p>And now let the Reader (whom he is so <hi>fearful of troubling</hi> with any Thing that is to the Purpose) judge, Whether this Man has not took a most extraordinary <hi>way of proving his Doctrine the very same with the Fathers.</hi> For neither in the first place does he set down, what the Doctrine of the <hi>Fathers</hi> concerning the <hi>Trinity</hi> was; which yet, one would have thought was absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the shewing how his own Doctrine agreed with it, which he professed to be his design: Nor, in the next place, does he either <hi>use, or regard,</hi> or offer to explain those Terms, which the <hi>Fathers</hi> all along deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that their Doctrine in; but is so far from it, <hi>That he reproaches, explodes, and utterly rejects them, as serving only to obscure this Doctrine, instead of explaining it:</hi> Which, in my poor Judgment, is such a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Fathers</hi> on his side, as perhaps the World never heard of before, and will be amazed at now. But it is <hi>his way,</hi> and it will not be long before we find him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing a like cast of his Kindness upon the <hi>School-men</hi> too.</p>
            <p>But since, notwithstanding all this, He allows the <hi>Fathers</hi> (good Men) to have <hi>meant well,</hi> and taught right; albeit, by reason of a certain Infelicity and Awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness they had in representing <hi>what they meant, by</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:101779:88"/>
               <hi>what they wrote,</hi> their <hi>meaning</hi> ought, by no means, to be gathered from their <hi>own words</hi> (as, possibly also for the introducing a new and laudable Custom amongst the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> and <hi>Sons</hi> of the Church, that the <hi>Sons</hi> must teach the <hi>Fathers</hi> to speak) our Author has, for these and the like Reasons, in great Charity and Compassion to their Infirmities, provided two other and better words of his own Invention, <hi>viz. Self-Consciousness,</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> by which alone the True Sense and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Fathers, in all their Writings about this Article of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> may, or can be understood.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless how kind soever this design of his may be, yet to me it seems very unreasonable. For, in the first place, it is, (upon the most allowed grounds of Reason) a just, and a sufficient Presumption, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> were wholly Strangers to what our Author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by these two words, for that they never so much as mention, or make use of the words themselves: Whereas, <hi>to be Self-Conscious, and Mutually-Conscious,</hi> were things (no doubt) easie enough, not only for the <hi>Fathers,</hi> but for any Man else of Common Sense to find out and understand; and they might also, without much difficulty, have been applyed to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> as well as other Acts of <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and therefore since the <hi>Fathers</hi> never used them in this case, it is but too plain, that they never thought them fit, or proper for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For the <hi>Arian</hi> Controversie was then, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 4th and 5th Centuries (in which also the most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of the <hi>Fathers</hi> wrote against it) at the Highest. Among which Writers, <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> (whom this Author so often quotes) has a Passage, which in this case, is to me very remarkable, and a Rational ground to conclude, that he knew nothing of <hi>Mutual-Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> as it is here applyed by this Author. For that,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101779:88"/>
speaking of the Unity of the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> in respect of one <hi>Common</hi> (though <hi>Single)</hi> Nature, he expresses it by <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, instead of which, certainly he could not have chosen a more apposite and proper place to have expressed the same by a <gap reason="foreign">

But it seems, he was either <hi>less Happy,</hi> or more judicious in this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. And besides all this, it is most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be Noted, That the very Terms in which the Orthodox Writers expressed themselves about the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and whatsoever related to it, were severely canvased and examined, and some of them settled by Councils; which is a fair proof, that the said Terms were fixed and authentick, and exclusive of all others, and consequently of those of this Author, as well as of the Notion signified by, and couched under them, which he would here with such Confidence obtrude upon the World, by and from the Credit of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> though their Writings demonstrate, that they were wholly uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, both as to his Doctrines and his Expressions.</p>
            <p>Nor can any Want, or Penury of words be here pleaded for their silence in this Matter, since the <hi>Greek</hi> being so happy, above all other Languages, in joyning and compounding words together; in all probability had <hi>the Fortunes of Greece</hi> (as the word is) been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the case, we might have heard of some such words, as, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Or since most such words, as in <hi>English</hi> terminate in <hi>ness,</hi> usually in the <hi>Greek</hi> terminate in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, possibly we might have met with some such made-words, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, since these do more properly import <hi>Consciousness</hi> than the former; which rather signifie <hi>Self-Conscience</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:101779:89"/>
and <hi>Mutual-Conscience,</hi> and so in strictness of Speech, differ something from the other. But he who seeks in the <hi>Greek Fathers</hi> for these words, or any thing like them (as applyed to the <hi>Trinity)</hi> may seek longer than his Eyes can see.</p>
            <p>Nor will his Inquest succeed at all better amongst the <hi>Latines.</hi> For although that Language be extremely less copious than the other, and so affords no one <hi>Latine</hi> word either for <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> or <hi>Mutual Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> but what we must first <hi>make,</hi> and being <hi>made</hi> would sound very barbarously; yet, no doubt, there were ways and words enough to have otherwise expressed the same thing, had they found it the fittest and best Notion to have expressed this great Article by. But no such thing or word occurs in any of their Writings.</p>
            <p>But why do I speak of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine Fathers?</hi> When the very <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> the boldest Framers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of Words and Terms, of all others, where they think them necessary to express their Conceptions by, notwithstanding all their <hi>Quiddities, Hoecceities,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seities,</hi> and the like, have yet no word for <hi>Self-Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Mutual Consciousness:</hi> which is a sufficient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, that either the thing it self never came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Heads; or (which is most likely) that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought it of any use for the explication of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, which yet they venture further at, than any other Writers whatsoever.</p>
            <p>But after all; though this Author is very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to ward off the charge of Novelty and Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from his Notions, (for which I cannot blame him; this being a charge sufficient to confound and crush any such Notion applyed to so Sacred and received an Article as the <hi>Trinity)</hi> and for this cause is not a little desirous to shelter it with the Authority of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> yet I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101779:89"/>
the Reader, That he is no less careful and concerned to keep the Glory of the Invention wholly to himself, and would take it very ill either of <hi>Fathers, School-men,</hi> or any one else, should they offer to claim the least share in it. For he roundly tells us, That the <hi>Fathers were not so happy as to hit upon his way of explaining this Mystery,</hi> Page 126. Line 5. nay, and that, how right a Judgement soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they might have of it, yet in down-right Terms, <hi>That they knew not how to explain it,</hi> Page 126. Line 18. which, I confess, is no small Complement passed upon himself (a thing which he is seldom or never failing in) but, in good earnest, a very course one upon the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> In short, he would appropriate the <hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>New Invention</hi> entirely to himself, but with admirable, and more than Metaphysical Abstraction, at the same time clear himself of the <hi>Novelty of it;</hi> and so, in a word, prove it of at least 12 or 13 hundred years standing in the World; when yet the Author of it was Born since <hi>Conventicles</hi> began in <hi>England,</hi> as is well known. But I frankly yield him the Invention, as perfectly his own; and such an one too, as he is more like to be known by, than ever admired for; and so, much happiness attend him with it.</p>
            <p>But as little success as we have had in seeking for his Darling and peculiar Notion of <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> in the Ancient Writers of the Church, we are like to find no more in seeking for his other equally espoused Notion and Opinion there, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Three <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity are Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits:</hi> We find indeed the Terms <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. but not one Tittle of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> except where <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as I hinted before) is sometimes used in the same sense and signification with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And in this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101779:90"/>
case (I am sure) no difficulty of framing Words, or Terms (as might possibly in some measure be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Case of <hi>Self-Consciousness)</hi> can with any colour of Reason be alledged for our not finding this Notion in the <hi>Fathers,</hi> had the thing it self been at all there. For can there be any words more Obvious, and Familiar than <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the <hi>Greek,</hi> or than <hi>Tres Spiritus,</hi> or <hi>Tres Mentes,</hi> in the <hi>Latine?</hi> But neither one nor the other are to be met with any where amongst them, as applied to the Subject now before us.</p>
            <p>But in Answer to this, I expect that our Author will reply, That they are not the words <hi>[Three distinct Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Minds, or Spirits]</hi> or those other [of <hi>Self-Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness]</hi> but the things meant and signified by them, which he affirms to be found in the <hi>Fathers.</hi> But this is the very thing which I insist upon against him, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Non-usage of these words, (nor any other equivalent to them) in the Works of those Ancient Writers, (while they were so particularly, and nicely disputing this Matter) is a solid Argument, That neither are the things themselves there. For that all those Great and Acute Men should mean the very same thing with this Author, and not one of them ever light upon the same words, is not rationally to be imagined. For What Reason can be given of this? Was either the Thing it self (as I noted before) of such deep, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Speculation, as not to be reached by them? Or the Language, they wrote in, too scanty to express their Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations by? Or can we think that the <hi>Fathers</hi> wrote <hi>Things</hi> without <hi>Words,</hi> as some do but too often write <hi>Words</hi> without <hi>Things?</hi> So that to me it is evident to a Demonstration, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> never judged, nor held in this Matter, as this Author pretends they did: And besides all this, there is yet one Consideration more, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:101779:90"/>
that of greater weight with me, than all that has been, or can be objected against this Man's pretensions, <hi>viz.</hi> That it seems to me, and I question not but to all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Persons else, (and that upon good reason) wholly unsuteable to the wise and good Method of <hi>God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> That a clear Discovery of such a Principal Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Christian Religion, as the Trinity</hi> is, should now at length be owing to the Invention, or lucky Hit of any one Man's single Mind, or Fancy; which so many Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Humble, as well as Excellently Learned Persons, with long and tedious search, and the hardest study, (and these, no doubt, joyned with frequent and servent Prayers to <hi>God,</hi> to enlighten and direct them in that search) have been continually breathing after, but could never attain to for above Sixteen Hundred Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This, I freely own and declare, That I judge it morally impossible for any serious, thinking Person, ever to bring himself to the belief of; and much less for any one, not intoxicated with intolerable Pride, to arrogate to Himself. To which sort of Persons <hi>God</hi> never reveals any thing extraordinary for the good of the World, or of themselves either.</p>
            <p>But, since I am now upon <hi>Disputation,</hi> which has its proper Laws, and that this Author may have no ground of Exception, I will proceed to examine his Quotations out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and try whether his <hi>Hypothesis</hi> may be found there, where it is certain, that we can find none of his Terms.</p>
            <p>And here, he first begins with the Distinction of the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> where I must remind him, That it is not the bare proving a <hi>Distinction of Persons,</hi> (which none, who acknowledges a <hi>Trinity,</hi> either doubts of, or much less denies) which will here serve his turn; but He must prove also, That they stand distinguished as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101779:91"/>
               <hi>Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits,</hi> and that this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is owing to Three <hi>distinct Self-Consciousnesses</hi> belonging to them; otherwise all his Proofs will fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side his <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This premised, I will consider what he alledges. And in the first place he positively tells us, <hi>Page</hi> 101. <hi>That no Man who acknowledges a Trinity of Persons, ever denied, That the Son and Holy Spirit were Intelligent Minds, or Beings.</hi> To which I Answer,</p>
            <p>First, That it is not sufficient for him, who advances a Controverted Proposition, that none can be produced, who before denied it; but it lies upon him the Advancer of it, to produce some who have affirmed it. Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as a bare non-denial of a Thing, never before af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, can of it self neither prove nor disprove any Thing. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, I Answer further, That if none of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writers did ever, in express Terms, deny this, it was because none had before in express Terms asserted it. But then I add also, That the <hi>Ancients</hi> have expresly asserted that, which irrefragably inferrs a Negation of the said Proposition: For they have affirmed, <hi>That the Son and Holy Spirit are one single Intelligent Mind,</hi> and consequently that being so, they cannot possibly <hi>be more.</hi> And this is a full Answer to this sorry shift; for an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I am sure, it deserves not to be called.</p>
            <p>But he proceeds from Negatives to Positives, and tells us, Page 101. <hi>That it is the Constant Language of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> (for it seems he has read them all) <hi>That the Son is the Substantial Word and Wisdom of the Father, and that this can be nothing else, but to say, That he is an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Being, or Infinite Mind.</hi> And he is so, I confess. But does this inferr, That He is therefore <hi>a distinct Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Mind, or Being from the Father?</hi> This we deny,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101779:91"/>
and it is the very Thing, which he ought to prove. And it is not come to that pass yet, that we should take his bare affirmation for a Proof of what he affirms.</p>
            <p>He comes now to Particulars, and tells us, That <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nyssen</hi> (though, since he neither mentions Book nor Page, this ought not to pass for a Quotation) calls the Son <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which this Author renders <hi>Mind, or Intellect:</hi> And I will not deny, but that it may, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, import so much; but I am sure it does not by direct Signification. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, signifies proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Res quaedam Intellectualls,</hi> or <hi>Intellectu praedita:</hi> And since nothing is so, but a <hi>Mind,</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> it may (as I have said) imply a <hi>Mind,</hi> but it does not directly signifie it. But admitting that it does both; does this expression prove, That the Son is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>distinct</hi> from the <hi>Father?</hi> By no means: For not only the <hi>Son,</hi> but the <hi>Father</hi> may be called, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and yet they are not Three <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And the Reason of this is, because <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is an <hi>Essential Attribute</hi> following the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and therefore common to all the Three <hi>Persons,</hi> and not a <hi>Personal Attribute</hi> pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to any one of them. So that granting the <hi>Son</hi> to be as truly and properly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as this Author would have him, yet we absolutely deny, That he is a <hi>distinct</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from the <hi>Father.</hi> And this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, I am sure, is far enough from proving him to be so.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Nyssen,</hi> he passes to St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who (he tells us) observes out of these words of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 10. 30. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and that, by so speaking, he gave us a perfect <hi>Duality of Persons</hi> in the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and an <hi>Unity of Nature</hi> in the word <gap reason="foreign">

All which is very true, and that this distinction of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> overthrows the <hi>Heresie</hi> of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> and the Unity of their Nature, the <hi>Heresie</hi> of <hi>Arius;</hi> But then this is also as true, that all this is nothing at all to our Author's Purpose, For how does this prove, either that the Three <hi>Divine Persons</hi> are <hi>Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits?</hi> Or, that <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is the proper ground, or Reason of their distinction? Why, yes, (says He) <hi>If the Father be an Eternal Mind and Wisdom, then the Son is also an Eternal, but begotten Mind and Wisdom:</hi> Very true; but still I deny, that it follows hence, <hi>That the Eternal Mind, or Wisdom Begetting, and the Eternal Mind, or Wisdom Begotten, are Two distinct Minds, or Wisdoms,</hi> but <hi>only one and the same Mind, or Wisdom,</hi> under these <hi>Two distinct Modifications of Begetting</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Begot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he pretends to explain and confirm his Notion of a <hi>distinct Mind, or Wisdom,</hi> out of those words of the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> in which the <hi>Son is said to be God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God.</hi>

            <p>By which words, I cannot imagine, how this Author thinks to serve his turn; unless that by <hi>Light</hi> must be meant <hi>Infinite Wisdom,</hi> or <hi>Infinitely Wise Mind,</hi> and that this must also infer the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> to be <hi>Two distinct Infinitely Wise Minds, or Wisdoms,</hi> one issuing from the other.</p>
            <p>But if so, then the same words will, and must infer them also to <hi>be two distinct Gods, and very Gods:</hi> For all these words stand upon the same level in the same Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and then, if we do but joyn the Term <hi>[Distinct]</hi> equally with every one of them, we shall see what Monstrous Blasphemous Stuff will be drawn out of this Creed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:101779:92"/>
In the mean time let this Author know once for all, <hi>That Light of Light</hi> imports not here <hi>Two distinct Lights,</hi> but <hi>one Infinite Light under Two different ways of Subsisting,</hi> viz. either <hi>by</hi> and <hi>from it self,</hi> as it does in the <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>of</hi> and <hi>from</hi> another, as it does <hi>in the Son.</hi> All which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully imported in and by the Particle <hi>[of]</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying properly (as here applyed) <hi>Derivation,</hi> or <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> in the thing which it is applyed to. And this is the clear undoubted sense of the Word, as it is used here. In the mean time, I hope the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> will joyn in a Letter of Thanks to this Author, for making such an Inference from the <hi>Nicene Creed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, he comes to St. <hi>Austin;</hi> where, though I am equally at a loss to find how he proves his Point by him, any more than by those whom he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready produced; yet I will transcribe the whole Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Quae ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinatio ad id co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, ut di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camus De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem non esse sapientem nisi habendo sapientiam quam genuit, non existendo per se pater sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia.

Quod si tenemus, cur non &amp; magnitudinis suae, &amp; bonitatis, &amp; aeternitatis, &amp; omnipotentiae suae Generator sit? ut non ipse sit sua magnitudo, &amp; sua bonitas, &amp; sua aeternitas, &amp; sua Omnipotentia, sed eâ magnitudine magnus sit, quam genuit, &amp; eâ bonitate bonus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Aug. Tom. 3. Lib. 6. de Trinitate.</note> into the Margin, that so both the Reader may have it under his Eye, and the Author have no cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that he is not fairly dealt with.</p>
            <p>Now that which he would infer from thence, seems to be this, That <hi>God the Father</hi> is <hi>Infinitely Wise,</hi> by a Wisdom of his own, distinct from that Wisdom by which the <hi>Son</hi> is called <hi>The Wisdom of the Father;</hi> and consequently, that they are <hi>Two distinct Infinite Wisdoms,</hi> or <hi>Infinitely Wise Minds.</hi> This, I say, is that which he would inferr, and argue from St. <hi>Austin,</hi> or I know not what else it can be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:101779:93"/>
But this is by no means deducible from his words: for the <hi>Father</hi> is wise by one and the same <hi>Infinite Wisdom</hi> equally belonging both to the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> but not by it under that peculiar Formality, <hi>as it belongs to the Son.</hi> For it belongs to the <hi>Son,</hi> as <hi>Communicated to Him;</hi> whereas it belongs to the <hi>Father,</hi> as <hi>Originally in and from Himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas it is objected, <hi>That if the Father should be Wise by the Wisdom which he Begot, then he could not be said to be Wise by a Wisdom of his own, but only by a Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Wisdom proper to the Son.</hi> I Answer, That neither does this follow; since it is but one and the same <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Wisdom</hi> in both, <hi>viz.</hi> in him who Begets, and in him who is Begotten: Though <hi>[as] it is in him</hi> who is Begotten, it is not <hi>after the same way</hi> in Him who Begets: So that it is this determining Particle <hi>[as,</hi> or <hi>Quatenus]</hi> which by importing a distinction of the <hi>manner,</hi> causes a quite different application of the Term, while the Thing is still the same. For the <hi>Father</hi> himself is not denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Wise,</hi> even by that very <hi>Wisdom</hi> that is <hi>Essential</hi> to <hi>Him,</hi> considered as <hi>Personally determined</hi> to the <hi>Son;</hi> for so it must be considered as <hi>Derived</hi> and <hi>Communicated,</hi> and no <hi>Divine Perfection</hi> can agree to the <hi>Father</hi> under the Formal Consideration of <hi>[Derived</hi> and <hi>Communicated]</hi> albeit the Thing it self, <hi>which is Derived</hi> and <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi> absolutely considered, may and does. In a word, the <hi>Father</hi> is Wise by one and the same Wisdom, which is both in himself and in his Son, but not by it, <hi>as it is in the Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, by the way, it is worth observing, That this Man who here in the 102 and 103 Pages denies <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Wise by this Begotten Wisdom,</hi> which the Son is here called (and which, in the Sense we have now given of it, is very true) and alledges St. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Lombard</hi> to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101779:93"/>
abett him in it. This very Man, I say, <hi>Page</hi> 131. <hi>Line</hi> 24. affirms, That the Son is that <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge, wherewith his Father knows himself:</hi> Where, <hi>If for the Father to be Wise and to know himself</hi> be formally the same Act, and as much the same as his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> can be, as it is manifest, they are; then I leave it to this Author to tell us, which of these two Assertions is false, for both of them, I am sure, cannot be true: But he who makes nothing to contradict himself within the compass of two or three Pages (and sometimes as many Lines) may do it <hi>cum Privilegio</hi> at the distance of near Thirty.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is urged again from the same place in St. <hi>Austin, That if we say the Father begets his own Wisdom, we may as well say, That he Begets his own Goodness, Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Eternity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Answer, No doubt but we may say one as well as the other, but that in Truth and Propriety of Speech, we can say neither: For God cannot properly be said <hi>to beget Wisdom,</hi> and much less <hi>his own Wisdom,</hi> nor indeed any of his other Attributes, or Perfections <hi>Essentially</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and considered; he may indeed be said to <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them,</hi> and by such <hi>Commmnication</hi> to <hi>Beget a Son.</hi> But still, though these are thus said to be <hi>Communicated,</hi> it is the <hi>Person only,</hi> who is, or can be properly said to be <hi>Begotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Author tells us, <hi>Page</hi> 103. out of the next Chapter of St. <hi>Austin</hi> (the words of which he should have done well to have quoted) that he there calls <hi>God the Father, Sapientia Ingenita,</hi> and the <hi>Son, Sapientia Genita,</hi> and are not these <hi>Two distinct Infinite Wisdoms?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, No: For that the Wisdom here spoken of, is not taken <hi>Absolutely and Essentially,</hi> but <hi>only Personally:</hi> That is, for <hi>Wisdom</hi> under two several Modifications;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101779:94"/>
which Modifications, though they <hi>diversifie</hi> and <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish</hi> the Thing they belong to, yet do not <hi>multiply</hi> it. For still it is one and the same <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which is both <hi>Genita</hi> and <hi>Ingenita,</hi> though <hi>as it is one,</hi> it is not the <hi>other. Sapientia,</hi> or <hi>Wisdom,</hi> considered <hi>Absolutely</hi> and <hi>Essentially</hi> in it self, belongs in Common to all the <hi>Three Persons;</hi> but with the Term <hi>Genita,</hi> or <hi>Ingenita</hi> joyned with it, it imports a peculiar <hi>Mode</hi> of <hi>Subsistence,</hi> which determines it to a particular <hi>Personality:</hi> So that <hi>Sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia quatenus Genita</hi> properly and only denotes the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of the <hi>Son.</hi> In like manner when the <hi>Third Person</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Term <hi>Spirit</hi> is not there taken <hi>Essentially</hi> for that <hi>Infinite Immaterial, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal Nature, Absolutely</hi> considered (for so it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Three <hi>Persons)</hi> but for that <hi>Infinite Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Nature, Quatenus procedens aut spirata,</hi> and under that peculiar <hi>Mode</hi> of <hi>Subsistence,</hi> it belongs not to the other Two <hi>Persons,</hi> but stands appropriate only <hi>to the Third.</hi> Nevertheless this makes them not <hi>Three distinct Infinite Spirits</hi> (as we have already shewn) but only one <hi>Infinite Spirit</hi> under <hi>Three distinct Modalities.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, when the <hi>Son</hi> is here called <hi>the Wisdom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that very Term <hi>[of the Father]</hi> imports a Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it peculiar to the <hi>Son,</hi> but yet this Modificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does not make it <hi>another Wisdom,</hi> from that which is in the <hi>Father;</hi> since one and the same <hi>Wisdom</hi> may su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain several determining <hi>Modes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author's next Quotation is out of <hi>Peter Lombard, Page</hi> 103. whom (for the Credit of what he Quotes from him) he styles <hi>the Oracle of the Schools</hi> (though he, who shall read <hi>Lambertus Denoeus</hi> upon the first Book of his Sentences, will quickly find what a Doughty Oracle he is.) The Passage quoted, proceeds upon the same Notion which we find in the foregoing Citation out of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:101779:94"/>
St. <hi>Austin,</hi> whom he also alledges for it. Nevertheless, I shall Transcribe this also, as I did the other, both for the Choice Stuff contained in it, as also that the Reader may have it before him, and thereby see, what <note place="margin">—Sed absit ut ità sit; [viz. <hi>That the Father should be wise only by the Wisdom he begets]</hi> quia si hoc est ibi <hi>esse</hi> quod <hi>sapere,</hi> non per illam sapientiam quam genuit sapiens dicitur Pater, alioquin non ipsa ab illo sed ille ab ipsâ est. Si enim sapientia quam genuit causa est illi ut sapiens sit, etiam ut <hi>sit</hi> ipsa illi causa est; quod fieri non potest nisi gignendo eum aut faciendo: Sed nec genetricem nec conditricem Patris ullo modo quisquam dixerit Sapientiam. Quid enim insanius? &amp;c. Lib. 1. Dist. 32. Cap. 3.</note> use our Author is able to make of it for his purpose.</p>
            <p>First of all then, he tells us, <hi>That in God</hi> to be, <hi>and</hi> to be <hi>Wise, is the same thing.</hi> And I grant it, with respect to the Absolute Simplicity of the <hi>Divine Nature:</hi> but, for all that, I must tell him, That <hi>to Be, and to be Wise,</hi> fall under two formally distinct Conceptions, of which the former does not include the latter; and that for this Reason, such as treat Scholastically of these Matters, do always allow <hi>a formal difference</hi> between them, and never treat of them, but as so considered. And let me tell him also, that this consideration looks yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further; as inferring, That Things <hi>formally</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, must have <hi>formally</hi> distinct Effects; so that the <hi>formal</hi> Effect of one cannot be ascribed to the other. And moreover, that it is a very gross Absurdity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the <hi>Formal Cause with the Efficient,</hi> and so, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from one, as you would do from the other.</p>
            <p>Which Observations being thus laid down, let us see how this Man and his Oracle argue in the Case. And it is thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the Wisdom which He [viz.</hi> God the Father] <hi>Begets, be the cause of his being wise, then it is the cause also of his very Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:101779:95"/>
In Answer to which, I deny the Consequence. For that Wisdom is the cause of one's being Wise only <hi>by a formal Causality,</hi> viz. by existing in Him, and affecting him in such a particular way: and this it does without being the Cause also of his <hi>Existence,</hi> that being a Thing formally distinct from his <hi>Being Wise:</hi> And therefore, though Wisdom, I grant, must presuppose the Existence of the Subject, where it has this Effect: Yet it does not <hi>formally</hi> cause it; or rather indeed, for this very reason, cannot possibly do so.</p>
            <p>But he proceeds and argues further, <hi>viz. That supposing the Wisdom Begotten by the Father were the Cause both of his</hi> Being, <hi>and of his</hi> being Wise, <hi>then it must be so either by Begetting, or Creating him,</hi> (for so I Interpret <hi>Conditri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem)</hi> but for <hi>one to say, That Wisdom is any way the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getter, or Maker of the Father, would be the height of Madness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be so indeed. And so on the other side to attempt to prove the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> to be Two <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Infinite Minds</hi> by such strange, odd, uncouth No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as these, which St. <hi>Austin</hi> himself (particularly treating of them in his 7 and 15 Books <hi>de Trinitate)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to be <hi>Quoestiones inextricabiles,</hi> this, I say, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may <hi>be the height of Madness)</hi> is certainly not <hi>the height of Discretion.</hi> Nevertheless, as to the Argument it self, I deny the Consequence. And that because the <hi>Begetting,</hi> or any otherwise <hi>Producing</hi> a Thing imports a Cause operating by a proper Efficiency, or Causality; whereas Wisdom, being only the <hi>formal Cause</hi> of one's being Wise, (as it would be no other, could it be the Cause of one's very Being also) operates only by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, Improper Causality, <hi>viz.</hi> in a word, <hi>Wisdom</hi> makes one <hi>Wise,</hi> as Whiteness makes a Thing White, not by producing any Thing in him, but by Existing in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101779:95"/>
him, and affecting him by it self, after such a certain manner, and thereby giving him such a certain Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>Now from hence let any one judge how foreibly and Philosophically this Man Disputes; the Truth is, were the whole Argument Conclusive, it were nothing to his purpose. But I was willing to shew, That his way of arguing is as defective, as the Thing he Argues for is Absurd.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless let us see, what the main Conclusion is, which he would draw from the Premises. Why, it is this, <hi>That the Father is Eternal Wisdom, or Mind, and the Son Eternal Wisdom and Mind.</hi> I give you his very Terms. And who denies this? Or what does it conclude for him? For still I ask, Does he who says, That the <hi>Father is Eternal Wisdom, or Mind,</hi> and the <hi>Son Eternal Wisdom and Mind,</hi> by saying so, affirm, That the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> are <hi>Two distinct Eternal Wisdoms,</hi> or <hi>Minds?</hi> Any more than he who says, That the <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Son God,</hi> affirms them to be <hi>Two distinct Gods?</hi> Let him say it if he can; and he shall not fail of a through Consutation as soon as it can be Printed off.</p>
            <p>But to give the <hi>Reader</hi> an Account of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in short. This Author has espoused a very Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and dangerous Notion, <hi>viz. That the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity are Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits;</hi> and in order to the proof of this, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us, That there are <hi>Two distinct Wisdoms,</hi> one in the <hi>Father,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Son;</hi> and that for this <hi>Reason:</hi> Because the <hi>Father,</hi> who is <hi>Essentially Wise,</hi> cannot be said to be <hi>Wise</hi> by <hi>that begotten Wisdom, which is in the Son</hi> (albeit the <hi>Son</hi> be yet said to be <hi>the Wisdom of the Father)</hi> but that the <hi>Father</hi> must have one <hi>distinct</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:101779:96"/>
               <hi>Wisdom</hi> of his own, and the <hi>Son</hi> another <hi>distinct Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of his own. This, I am sure, is the full Account of his Argument from top to bottom. In Answer to which, I have plainly and undeniably shewn, That the <hi>Father</hi> is Wise by one and the same <hi>Essential Wisdom,</hi> common to <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> though not under that particular Modification, as it Subsists in the other Two <hi>Persons,</hi> but by that peculiar Modification, by which it is appropriated to, and Subsists in his own. And that those different Modifications do not, for all that, make it any more than one single Numerical Wisdom, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one and the same under so many <hi>distinct Modes</hi> of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,</hi> determining it to so many <hi>distinct Personali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Sum both of his Opinion and of mine, and I referr it to the Judicious Reader to arbitrate the Case between us, with this profession and promise, that if in all, or any one of the Quotations alledged by him he can shew, That it is either expresly affirmed, or neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily implyed, <hi>That the Father and the Son are two distinct Infinite Minds,</hi> I will, without further proof of any sort, forthwith yield him the Cause, and withal renounce all my poor share in Common Sense and Reason; nay, and all belief of my own Eyes for the future.</p>
            <p>But there is one Clause more, which he brings in as one part of his main Conclusion, <hi>Page</hi> 103. <hi>Line</hi> 33. viz. <hi>That if we confess this of the Father and the Son,</hi> to wit, That they are each of them <hi>Eternal Mind,</hi> or <hi>Wisdom, there can be no dispute about the Holy Ghost who is Eternal Mind, and Wisdom, distinct both from Father and Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is perfectly <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> without either proof, or pretence of proof; and that whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the Orthodox, or the Heterodox and Heretical. And,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:101779:96"/>
First, For the Orthodox, they utterly deny the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to be an <hi>Eternal Mind,</hi> or <hi>Wisdom</hi> distinct both from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son;</hi> and I challenge this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to produce me but one reputed <hi>Orthodox Writer,</hi> who affirms it. In the mean time, it argues no small Confidence (to give it the mildest Term) in this Man to Assert that <hi>as certain, and without Dispute,</hi> which is neither granted on one side, nor so much as pretended to be proved on the other. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we respect the Heterodox and Heretical, who (no doubt) <hi>can dispute</hi> as much as others, will this Man say, That these also grant this his Assertion about the <hi>Holy Ghost without any dispute?</hi> No, it is certain, that they neither do, nor will. For this Author may be pleased to observe, That as some in the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> allowed the Son to be only <hi>like the Father;</hi> so they made the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> a downright <hi>Creature,</hi> and an inferiour Agent to both. Such were the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> under their Head and Leader <hi>Macedonius;</hi> as we see in St. <hi>Austin de Haeresibus,</hi> Cap. 52. hereby placing him as much below the <hi>Son,</hi> as they had placed the <hi>Son</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Father, or rather more. Whereupon I appeal even to this Author himself, whether those who did so, would <hi>without all dispute</hi> have allowed the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to be an <hi>Eternal Infinite Mind, or Wisdom,</hi> distinct both from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son;</hi> and upon that Account, Essentially and Necessarily equal to them both? Let this Author rub his Fore-head, and affirm this if he can; and for the future take notice, That it becomes a True and Solid Reasoner, where a Thing is disputed, fairly to prove it, and not boldly and barely to presume it.</p>
            <p>In the last place he alledges the Judgment of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Fathers</hi> indefinitely in the Case. And truly where he cannot cite so much as one of them to the purpose, I
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101779:97"/>
think he does extremely well to make short work of it, and with one bold Impertinent stroke to alledge them <hi>all</hi> together.</p>
            <p>His Allegation is this, <hi>That it is usual with the Fathers to represent the Three Persons in the Blessed Trinity as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct as</hi> Peter, James <hi>and</hi> John. Well; and what then? Why; <hi>That then the said Three Persons are Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits.</hi> I deny the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and to give a particular Answer to this general Allegation, I tell him, That it is a Fallacy of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monymy of the Word,</hi> and that the Term <hi>[as distinct]</hi> is Ambiguous: For it may either signifie,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. As Real. <hi>Or,</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. As Great <hi>a Distinction.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>As for the first, I grant, That the <hi>Three Persons</hi> in the <hi>Blessed Trinity differ as really</hi> as <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> Forasmuch as they differ by something in the Thing <hi>it self,</hi> or <hi>ex parte rei,</hi> antecedent to, and independent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Apprehension, or Operation of the Mind about it; which is a <hi>Real difference,</hi> and whatsoever is so, is altogether <hi>as Real</hi> as the Difference between one Man and another can be. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, If by <hi>Real</hi> distinction be meant as <hi>great a distinction,</hi> so we utterly deny that the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> differ as much as <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> do, or that the <hi>Fathers</hi> ever thought they did so. For this would inferr a greater difference, or distinction between them, than even our Author himself will allow of; even such a difference, as reaches to a <hi>Division,</hi> or <hi>Separation</hi> of the <hi>Persons</hi> so differing. And since it is impossible for the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> to differ so, it is hard to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine upon what bottom of Reason our Author should measure the Distinction, or Difference of the <hi>Three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons,</hi> by the Distinction, or Difference, that is

between, <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> For though the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> differ <hi>as really,</hi> yet it is certain, that they do not <hi>differ as much.</hi> But what the <hi>Fathers</hi> alledged only as an Illustration of the Case, this Man is pleased to make a direct proof of his Point, which by his Favour, is to stretch it a little too far: For, if he would make the foregoing Example a Parallel Instance to the Thing which he applies it to, it would prove a great deal too much, (as has been shewn) and therefore as to the Thing, which it is brought for, does indeed prove nothing at all. Now the Thing it is brought to prove, is, <hi>That the Three Divine Persons are Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits;</hi> but since we have shewn, That a <hi>Real Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> or <hi>Distinction,</hi> may be much short of such an one as is between <hi>two or more Minds, or Spirits,</hi> (which we own to be as great, as between two or more Men) it follows, That the <hi>Real Difference,</hi> which is between the <hi>Three Divine Persons,</hi> cannot prove them to <hi>be so many distinct Minds, or Spirits.</hi> In short, our Author's whole Argument amounts to no more but this (which, though it may sound something jocularly, is really and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true) <hi>viz.</hi> That because <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn are so many Men,</hi> therefore <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are so many Minds.</hi> A pleasant way of Arguing certainly.</p>
            <p>I have now examined all that this Author has alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the <hi>distinction of the Three Divine Persons,</hi> and I have done it particularly and exactly, not omitting any one of his Quotations. But how comes it to pass all this while, that we have not so much as one Syllable out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>School-men,</hi> in behalf of <hi>Self-Consciousness?</hi> Which being, according to this Author, the <hi>Constituent Reason</hi> of the <hi>Personality</hi> and <hi>Personal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> of the <hi>Three Divine Persons,</hi> will he pretend to prove the Distinction it self from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and at the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101779:98"/>
same time not speak one Tittle of the Principle, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this Distinction? Or will he profess to prove his whole Hypothesis by the Authority of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and yet be silent of <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> which he himself makes one grand and principal part of the said Hypothesis? Certainly, one would think, that the very shame of the World, and that Common Awe and regard of Truth, which Nature has imprinted upon the Minds of Men, should keep any one from offering to impose upon Men in so gross and shameless a manner, as to venture to call a Notion or Opinion, the <hi>Constant Doctrine both of the Fathers and the Schools;</hi> nay, and to profess to make it out, and shew it to be so, and while he is so doing, not to to produce <hi>one Father,</hi> or <hi>Schoolman,</hi> I say again, not so much <hi>as one of either</hi> in behalf of that, which he so confidently and expresly avows to be the joynt Sentiment of Both. This surely is a way of <hi>proving,</hi> or rather of <hi>imposing</hi> peculiar to Himself. But we have seen how extremely fond he is of this new Invented Term and Notion: And therefore since he will needs have the Reputation of being the sole <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Begetter</hi> of the <hi>Hopefull Issue,</hi> there is no Reason in the World that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity should find other <hi>Fathers</hi> to maintain it.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>In which is shewn, That the Passages alledged by this Author out of the <hi>Fathers</hi> do not prove <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> to be that, wherein the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in the <hi>Three Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity</hi> does Consist: But that the <hi>Fathers</hi> place it in something else.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>OUR Author having undertook to make good his Doctrine about the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> and that both as to the Distinction of the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> and also as to their Unity in the same Nature; And having said what he could from those Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for that new sort of Distinction which he ascribes to the said <hi>Persons,</hi> in the former part of his 4th Section, which I have confuted in the preceding Chapter; he proceeds now, in the following, and much longer part of the same Section, to prove the Unity of the <hi>Three Persons</hi> in one and the same Nature, according to his own Hypothesis.</p>
            <p>And the Proofs of this we shall reduce under these Two following Heads, as containing all that is alledged by him upon this point of his Discourse, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:101779:99"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> That it is one and the same <hi>Numerical Divine Nature,</hi> which belongs to all the <hi>Three Divine Persons.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Thing, wherein this <hi>Numerical Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> does consist, is that <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> by which all the <hi>Three Persons</hi> are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately <hi>Conscious</hi> to one another of all that is known by, or belongs to each of them in particular.</p>
            <p>And here the Authority of the <hi>Fathers</hi> is pleaded by him for both of these, and I readily grant it for the <hi>first,</hi> but however shall examine what this Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces for the one, as well as for the other.</p>
            <p>But before I do this, I must observe to him, That if that Distinction Asserted by him between the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> whereby they stand distinguished as Three <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Minds,</hi> or <hi>Spirits,</hi> holds good, all his proofs of the Unity of their Nature will come much too late. For he has thereby already destroyed the very Subject of his Discourse; and it is in vain to seek, wherein the <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> (as it belongs to the <hi>Three Persons)</hi> does Consist, after he has affirmed that, which makes such an <hi>Unity</hi> utterly impossible. And it has been sufficiently proved against him in our 5th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That <hi>Three Infinite Minds or Spirits,</hi> can never be one <hi>Numerical Infinite Mind, or Spirit,</hi> nor consequently one <hi>God.</hi> Three <hi>distinct Spirits</hi> can never be otherwise <hi>One,</hi> than by being United into one Compound, or <hi>Collective Being,</hi> which, (could such a Thing be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted here) might be called indeed <hi>an Union,</hi> but <hi>an Unity</hi> properly it could not. And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I cannot but observe also, That this Author ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often uses these Terms promiscuously, as if <hi>Union</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:101779:99"/>
and <hi>Unity, being United into One, and being One,</hi> signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the very same Thing; whereas, in strictness and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Speech, whatsoever Things are <hi>United into One,</hi> cannot be Originally <hi>One;</hi> and <hi>è Converso,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is Originally <hi>One,</hi> cannot be so, by being <hi>United</hi> into <hi>One:</hi> for as <hi>Suidas</hi> explains the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is to say, <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is so called from the pressing [or thrusting] together several Things into one. But our Author, who with great profoundness, tells us <hi>of the same Nature in Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Persons being United into One Numerical Essence, or God-head,</hi> Page 118. Lines 9, 10. has certainly a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Notion of <hi>Union</hi> from all the World besides. For how one and the same Nature (though in never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>distinct Persons:</hi> since it is still supposed the same in all) can be said to be <hi>United</hi> into any <hi>one</hi> Thing, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve surpasses all Humane Apprehension to conceive; <hi>Union</hi> in the very Nature of it, being of <hi>several Things, not of one and the same.</hi> I desire the Reader to consult the place, and to extract the best sense out of it that he can.</p>
            <p>And thus having presented our Author with this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary Observation, I shall now proceed to consider how he acquits himself in the <hi>first Thing</hi> undertook by him, <hi>viz.</hi> The proving a <hi>Numerical Unity</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> in the <hi>Three Divine Persons, out of the Fathers;</hi> which tho' I do as readily grant, and as firmly believe, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor does, or can; yet I think it worth while to shew, with what Skill, Decency, and Respect he Treats the <hi>Fathers</hi> upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>And here in the first place he tells his Reader, <hi>That this being a Mystery so great, and above all Example in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is no wonder if the Fathers found it necessary to use several Examples, and to allude to several kinds of Union</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:101779:100"/>
               <hi>to form an adequate Notion of the Unity of the God-head.</hi> And withall, <hi>That they take several steps towards the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this great Mystery,</hi> viz. of an <hi>Unity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in a <hi>Trinity of Persons,</hi> page 106. In our Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of which Passages (reserving his former words to be considered elsewhere) we will first consider the <hi>steps</hi> which (he says) the <hi>Fathers</hi> made towards the Explication of this Mistery.</p>
            <p>And these, he tells us, are Two.</p>
            <p>First, The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the <hi>Coessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi> of the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> whereby all the <hi>Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> of the <hi>God-head</hi> have the same <hi>Nature,</hi> Page 106.</p>
            <p>Secondly the other is a <hi>Numerical Unity</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence,</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> Page 121. Line 6. which (to answer one <hi>Greek</hi> word with another) we may call the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, St. <hi>Cyril</hi> authorizing the Expression, whom we find speaking of an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> Cites him in his <hi>Catena</hi> upon <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 11, 21.</p>
            <p>Now as this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Sameness of Nature,</hi> and this <hi>Numerical Unity of Nature,</hi> lying fifteen whole Pages, in this Author's Book, distant from one another, must be confessed to make a very <hi>large stride;</hi> so, for all that, they will be found to make but an insignificant <hi>step;</hi> as setting a Man not one jot further than he was before. For as touching those Words and Terms, which the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> used to express the Unity of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> by, I do here, without any demurr, affirm to this Author, That <hi>Coessentiality, Sameness of Nature, and Sameness of Essence,</hi> all signified by the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as also <hi>Unity of Nature, and Unity of Essence,</hi> expressed by the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, do all of them, in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101779:100"/>
the sense of the <hi>Fathers</hi> denote but one and the same Thing, viz. <hi>A Numerical Unity of the Divine Nature,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I confess, with some Circumstantial Difference, as to the way, or manner of their signification. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, signifies <hi>Unity of Nature,</hi> with a Connotation of some Things, or Persons to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. Upon which Account it is, that St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> (whom this Author cites) speaking of this word in his 3d Book, Chap. 7. tells us, That <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>aliud alii, non ipsum est sibi:</hi> Nor indeed is any Thing said to be the <hi>same,</hi> but with respect to some Thing, or Circumstance besides it self. And therefore no wonder if the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was anciently rejected, since the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, relating to the <hi>Person,</hi> whom the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> belongs to, must import a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi> of <hi>Person</hi> as well as an <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Essence,</hi> which would be contrary to the <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, signifies <hi>Unity of Nature,</hi> or <hi>Essence,</hi> without Connotation of any to whom it belongs: Not but that it does really and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed belong to the <hi>Three Divine Persons,</hi> but that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the strict and proper signification and force of the word, it does not connote, or imply them, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts, or prescinds from them.</p>
            <p>And this is a true Account of these words, by which the <hi>Fathers</hi> (without making more steps than one) intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and meant the same Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Numerical Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> belonging to all the <hi>Three Persons,</hi> only with this difference, That the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> with a Connotation of the <hi>Persons</hi> in whom it is; which also gives it the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Sameness;</hi> and that the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, signifies the <hi>Unity</hi> of the same <hi>Nature</hi> absolutely and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractedly, without imploying, or co-signifying any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to those in whom it is, and to whom it belongs.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101779:101"/>
So that these words (as much <hi>Two</hi> as they are) yet in the sense and meaning of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> import but one and the same <hi>Unity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Author tells us, That though indeed the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> own <hi>an Unity of Nature</hi> in the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> yet, since there is a <hi>Specifick,</hi> as well as a <hi>Numerical Unity,</hi> the Dispute is here, which of these two <hi>Unities</hi> we shall assign to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> with reference to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this; He tells us, That <hi>Petavius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> have abundantly proved, That the <hi>Nicene Fathers did not understand the word</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>of a</hi> Numerical, <hi>but of a</hi> Specifical Sameness <hi>of Nature, or the agreement of Things Numerically different from one another in the same Common Nature,</hi> Page 106. about the end.</p>
            <p>In Answer to which, I must confess my self very unfit to take such Great and Truly Learned Persons to task, and that upon comparing this Author and <hi>Petavius</hi> together (if there can be any comparison between them) I find much more Reason to believe that he mistook the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Petavius,</hi> than that <hi>Petavius</hi> could mistake the meaning of the <hi>Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however, I shall lay down this as a Conclusion, which I take to be undoubtedly true, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers,</hi> as well the <hi>Nicene,</hi> as those after them, held only a <hi>Numerical Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity:</hi> That is, in other words, They held and acknowledged one <hi>Numerical God,</hi> and no more. This Conclusion I hold, and have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe, That neither <hi>Petavius</hi> nor Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> shall be able to wrest it from me. For the chief Reason of some Men's charging the <hi>Fathers</hi> with holding a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Unity of Nature</hi> amongst the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> is drawn from this, That some of them, and particularly
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:101779:101"/>
               <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Nyssen</hi> (cited by this Author) seem to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from that <hi>Specifick Unity of Nature</hi> which is found in several Individual Men, to an <hi>Unity of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Answer, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> never used the Example of Three or more Individual Men, agreeing in the same <hi>Nature</hi> as a Parallel Instance of the same sort, or degree of <hi>Unity</hi> with that which is in the <hi>Three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons;</hi> but always alledged it, <hi>one,</hi> or (perhaps sometimes) <hi>both</hi> of these two ways.</p>
            <p>First, By way of Allusion, or Illustration (as I have already noted in the foregoing Chapter) and as it is the nearest Resemblance of, and Approach to this <hi>Divine Unity</hi> of any that could be found in <hi>Created Beings.</hi> For still their Argument proceeds only by the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> on the one side, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> on the other, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from that place quoted out of <hi>Maximus,</hi> P. 107.) which Terms surely do not of necessity import an <hi>Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> of the Case, but only some <hi>Similitude</hi> in the parts of the Comparison.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Fathers</hi> used the forementioned Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as an Argument <hi>à minore ad majus,</hi> viz. That if se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Individual Men could not properly be said to have more than one <hi>Nature</hi> (upon which <hi>Nyssen</hi>'s whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument turns) much less could this be said of the <hi>Three Divine Persons.</hi> Forasmuch as it is not only certain, but evident, That Persons merely distinguished from one another and no more, must have a greater <hi>Unity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> than such as are not only <hi>distinguished,</hi> but also <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> from one another by a separate Existence. And let any one stretch this Argument of the <hi>Fathers</hi> further if he can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:101779:102"/>
I do not in the least deny, but several Expressions may have dropped from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which, if we look'd no further, might be drawn to a very inconvenient sense. But then also it is as little to be denied, That the same <hi>Fathers</hi> professedly and designedly treating of the same Points, have declared themselves in such Terms, as are very hardly, if at all reconcileable to those Occasional and Accidental Expressions. And therefore since their meaning cannot be taken from both, it ought much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be taken from what was Asserted by them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly, than what was Asserted only occasionally.</p>
            <p>To which I shall add this further Remark, That a due consideration of the Circumstances, under which those <hi>Fathers</hi> wrote, may very well Apologize for the Dese<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s of some of their Arguments. For the Grand Controversie which exercised the <hi>Orthodox Writers</hi> of the fourth and part of the fifth Century, was that with the <hi>Arians.</hi> So that we have the less cause to wonder if some of their Reasonings about the <hi>Trinity</hi> seem to look no further than the proof of a <hi>Specifick Unity of Nature in the Divine Persons,</hi> while they had to deal with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries who would not allow so much as this between the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> but instead of an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Sameness,</hi> held only an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Likeness of Nature</hi> between them; which, together with the foregoing Considerations, may serve as a Key to let us into the true Explication of several Passages of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> about the meaning of which we might otherwise possibly be something at a loss. And the same likewise may serve to give a fair Account of what has been alledged by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius,</hi> and mistook by this Author upon the present Subject. For to traverse and examine all <hi>Petavius</hi>'s Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations particularly would require a full and distinct Work by it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:101779:102"/>
But still our Author seems extremely set upon making good his first step of a <hi>Specifick Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> from the <hi>Fathers;</hi> and to that purpose he tells us, <hi>Page</hi> 107. <hi>Line</hi> 23. <hi>That one thing wherein the Fathers place the Unity of the Godhead is, that all the Three Persons have the same Nature,</hi> by which he means (as shall be shewn presently) Specifically the same <hi>Nature;</hi> and a few Lines after, he tells us again, <hi>That some of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers went further than this, and plac'd the Essential Unity of the Divine Nature in the Sameness of Essence,</hi> Lines 30, 31, 32, of the same Page.</p>
            <p>Now here I would desire this Author to inform me of Two Things.</p>
            <p>First, By what Rule of speaking, or upon what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Divinity, Logick, or Philosophy, <hi>Sameness of Nature</hi> ought to signifie one Thing, and <hi>Sameness of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> to signifie another; and withal to be so contra-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished to each other, that in the degrees of <hi>Unity,</hi> this latter must be a step beyond the former? For the <hi>Fathers,</hi> I am sure, make no such distinction, but use the words <hi>Sameness of Nature,</hi> and <hi>Sameness of Essence,</hi> as well as the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> themselves promiscuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; so that neither by their Native signification, nor yet by their use, do they import any more than one sort of <hi>Unity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas in <hi>Page</hi> 106. <hi>Lines</hi> 23, 24. he makes the <hi>first step</hi> towards this <hi>Unity</hi> to consist in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Coessentiality,</hi> (which also in the next Page, <hi>Line</hi> 23. &amp;c. he explains by <hi>Sameness of Nature;)</hi> And whereas in <hi>Page</hi> 121. he makes <hi>a Numerical Unity of the Divine Essence,</hi> the <hi>next step</hi> (introducing it with the word <hi>Secondly)</hi> and telling us, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which he had before made the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:101779:103"/>
               <hi>first step;</hi> And whereas, notwithstanding this, having in <hi>Page</hi> 107. told us, <hi>That Sameness of Nature was one Thing wherein the Fathers placed the Unity of the Divine Nature,</hi> within seven Lines after, he tells us, <hi>That some of the Fathers went further, and placed it in the Sameness of Essence,</hi> (which, yet it is manifest all along, that he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons not the same Thing with <hi>Numerical Unity of Essence)</hi> I desire to know of him, whether there be <hi>Two second steps</hi> in this <hi>Unity?</hi> or, whether there be <hi>one between the first and the second?</hi> For he makes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Nature one step,</hi> Page 106, 107. <hi>And Sameness of Essence a further step,</hi> Page 107. Line 30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then <hi>Numerical Unity of Nature another step,</hi> calling it also <hi>the Second,</hi> Page 121. Line 5. These Things, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I am utterly unable to give any Consistent Account of, and I shrewdly suspect, that our Author himself is not able to give a much better. But it is still his way to forget in one place what he has said in another; and how kind soever he may be to himself, I should think it very hard for another Man to <hi>forget</hi> himself so often, and to <hi>forgive</hi> himself too.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless our Author, without mincing the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, roundly Asserts a <hi>Specifick Unity of Nature in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons,</hi> telling us, <hi>Line</hi> 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the fore-cited <hi>Page</hi> 107. <hi>That this is absolutely necessary to make the Three Persons one God, and that it is impossible that they should be so without it;</hi> where it is evident, that he means a <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Unity,</hi> both from this, that it was the <hi>Subject,</hi> which he had been there treating of, as also from this, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after he mentions another sort, or degree of <hi>Unity,</hi> as a <hi>step further</hi> than this; which, since nothing can be but <hi>a Numerical Unity,</hi> it follows, That that which was <hi>one step</hi> short of a <hi>Numerical,</hi> must needs be a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical.</hi> And now is it not strange, that in <hi>Page</hi> 109.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:101779:103"/>
which is but the next save one after this, this Man should positively say, (as he does) <hi>That the Fathers never so much as Dream'd of a specifick Unity of Nature in the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> having here in <hi>Page</hi> 107. affirmed it <hi>to be no less than absolutely necessary to make the Three Persons one God?</hi> And that certainly is a necessity with a witness. But he, who exacts of this Author a consistency with himself for five Pages together, deals very severely with him.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, the more I consider of this Matter, I cannot but think, that what he says of the <hi>Nicene Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers holding a Specifick Unity of Nature in the Divine Persons,</hi> Page 106. and his affirming that <hi>Gregory Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi> St. <hi>Cyril, Maximus</hi> and <hi>Damascen never so much as Dream'd of any such Unity,</hi> Page 109. Line 22. will by no means consist together.</p>
            <p>For first, If by the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> be meant not only those who were present at that Council, but those <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> also who about those Times held the same Faith which was Established in that Council, then his two fore-cited Passages contain a gross, manifest, fulsome Contradiction; even as gross as the <hi>positive asserting of a thing,</hi> and the <hi>never so much as dreaming of it,</hi> can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. But if by the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> he means only those who sat and acted in that Council, he will hardly how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perswade any understanding Man, That <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> who Wrote and flourished between Fifty and Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years after the Council, and <hi>Maximus</hi> about Sixty, and St. <hi>Cyril</hi> about Ninety, could be so grosly ignorant of, and Strangers to the Sentiments of those <hi>Fathers,</hi> as not so much <hi>as to Dream of that wherein they had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Unity of the God-head.</hi> This to me seems Incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and morally Impossible: since it is not to be imagined, that <hi>Nyssen, Cyril,</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> could so soon forget, or knowingly dare to relinquish the Doctrine of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:101779:104"/>
fore-mentioned <hi>Fathers,</hi> whose Authority was so great and Sacred all the <hi>Christian World</hi> over. And therefore since this Author allows these <hi>Fathers</hi> not to have <hi>Dreamt</hi> of a <hi>Specifick Unity of the Divine Nature;</hi> I conclude, That neither did the <hi>Nicene Fathers Dream</hi> of it any more than they, howsoever they might express them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon some occasions.</p>
            <p>And thus having (as well as he could) made <hi>his first step,</hi> by Asserting a <hi>Specifick Unity,</hi> or <hi>Sameness of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that is to say, partly from what <hi>Petavius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> had told him of the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> holding such a <hi>Specifick U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> between them, and partly from the other <hi>Fathers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much as dreaming of it,</hi> he proceeds now to his other <hi>step,</hi> or rather <hi>Counter-step;</hi> which is to shew, That the <hi>Unity</hi> between the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> held by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> was no other than a <hi>Numerical Unity of Nature,</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> belonging to them: For since <hi>to be one only Specifically,</hi> and to be one only <hi>Numerically,</hi> are by no means consistent with one another, in respect of the same <hi>Persons,</hi> what can this be so truly and properly called as <hi>a Counter-step to</hi> that which he had made before? His Method being plainly this. First he tells us, that the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> by the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> understood only a <hi>Specifick Unity,</hi> or <hi>Sameness of Nature</hi> in the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> Page 106. And then, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> [mentioning them indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely] <hi>held this Sameness of Nature</hi> absolutely necessary to make the said <hi>Three Persons one God,</hi> Page 107. And now at length he tells us, Page 121. Lines 27, 28, 29. <hi>That though several of the Fathers attempted several ways of explaining that Unity of Nature that is in the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, yet they all agree in the Thing, That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three distinct Divine Persons are united in one Numerical Nature and Essence.</hi> So that the Sum of all
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101779:104"/>
must be this (as appears also from his own words in the latter end of <hi>Page</hi> 120. and the four first Lines of the 121.) that according to him, the <hi>Fathers</hi> held a <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Unity of Nature necessary</hi> to make the <hi>Three Divine Persons one God,</hi> but not <hi>sufficient</hi> without the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by a <hi>Numerical Unity</hi> superadded to it.</p>
            <p>This, I say, is the Sum of what he delivers; and in direct opposition to which, I do here deny, That there is any such Thing as a <hi>Specifick Unity of Nature</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> or that the <hi>Fathers</hi> ever held, that there was.</p>
            <p>And to prove this, I shall premise this Assertion both as certain in itself, and withall affirmed by this Author in those forecited words, <hi>viz. That all the Fathers held, That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three distinct Persons are United in</hi> (or rather <hi>are One, by)</hi> One Numerical <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Essence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which being so premised, I have these <hi>Considerations</hi> to oppose to the Admission of any <hi>Specifick Unity</hi> in the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> as it belongs to the <hi>Divine Persons.</hi> As,</p>
            <p>First, If a <hi>Numerical Unity</hi> in the same <hi>Divine Nature</hi> be sufficient to make the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> to whom it belongs, <hi>One God,</hi> then a <hi>Specifick Unity</hi> of the same is not necessary; but a <hi>Numerical Unity</hi> in the same <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is sufficient to make the said <hi>Three Persons One God,</hi> and therefore a <hi>Specifick Unity</hi> is not necessary. The Consequence is evident, because nothing can be <hi>necessary</hi> to any Thing, or Effect, beyond, or beside what is <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> for the same; since this would imply a manifest Contradiction, by making the same Thing, in the same respect, both <hi>sufficient</hi> and <hi>not sufficient.</hi> And as for the Minor, That an Agreement in one and the same <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:101779:105"/>
               <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is sufficient to make the <hi>Persons</hi> so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing <hi>One God.</hi> I suppose this carries with it so much Self-Evidence, that no Man of Reason will pretend to doubt of, and much less to deny it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A greater degree of <hi>Unity,</hi> and a less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Unity</hi> are not to be admitted in the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> But a <hi>Numerical Unity</hi> and a <hi>Specifical Unity,</hi> are a greater and a less degree of <hi>Unity,</hi> and therefore they are not both to be admitted in the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> The Major is proved thus, because two such <hi>Unities</hi> would overthrow the simplicity of the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they must be either two <hi>degrees</hi> of the same kind of <hi>Unity,</hi> or they must be two different <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Unity:</hi> Either of which would inferr a Composition by no means to be endured in the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> As for the Minor, it is evident in it self, and needs no Proof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Such a degree, or sort of <hi>Unity of Nature,</hi> as may agree to Ten Thousand Individuals, neither can nor ought to be admitted in the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Divine Persons.</hi> But a <hi>Specifick Unity of Nature</hi> may agree to Ten Thousand Individuals, as well as to Two or Three; since (upon a <hi>Specifick</hi> Account) it has no Stint, or Limitation, but may be every whit as well and properly in the former Number, as in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and therefore it neither can nor ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Such an <hi>Unity</hi> as is principally, if not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>Notional,</hi> and depends upon the Operation of the Intellect drawing one common Notion from the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which it observes in several Individuals, is by no means necessary to make the <hi>Three Divine Persons One God,</hi> nor can any way properly belong to them. But a <hi>Specifick Unity</hi> is such an one. And therefore it neither is,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101779:105"/>
nor can be necessary to the making the <hi>Three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons One God,</hi> as this Author most absurdly Asserts, <hi>p.</hi> 107. <hi>Line</hi> 23, 24. The Major is evident. For that, if such an <hi>Unity</hi> could be necessary upon that Account, then there would be some sort or degree of <hi>Unity</hi> in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature</hi> so depending upon the Operation of some Intellect, or other (forming one common Notion out of several Particulars,) that, had not such an Operation pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon the said Particulars, such an <hi>Unity</hi> could not have been, nor consequently could the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> have been one <hi>God</hi> without it; which to affirm, would certainly be both a Monstrous and Blasphemous Assertion.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and lastly, If a <hi>Specifick Unity of Nature</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists with, and indeed implies a <hi>Multiplication</hi> of the said <hi>Nature,</hi> in every one of the Particulars, to which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; then such a <hi>Specifick Unity</hi> can by no means be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> But a <hi>Specifick Unity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> imports a <hi>Multiplication</hi> of the said <hi>Nature</hi> in every one of the Particulars to which it belongs; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such an <hi>Unity</hi> cannot be admitted in the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> The Reason of the Consequence is evident; because the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is uncapable of any <hi>Multiplication:</hi> And herein consists the difference of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi>'s belonging to the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> and of any other <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>'s belonging to its proper Individuals; That this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is by a <hi>Multiplication of it self in them,</hi> and the other by a bare <hi>Communication of it self to them,</hi> so as that the same <hi>Numerical Nature exists in,</hi> and becomes thereby common to all the <hi>Three Persons.</hi> As for the Minor Proposition, That a <hi>Specifick Unity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> consists with and implies a <hi>Multiplication</hi> of the said <hi>Nature</hi> in the several Individuals which it belongs to;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101779:106"/>
I referr him to all the <hi>Logicians</hi> and <hi>Metaphysicians</hi> who have wrote of <hi>Species,</hi> and <hi>Specifick Unity,</hi> of <hi>Idem, &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versum,</hi> whether they do not give this Account of it.</p>
            <p>But I fancy this Author has a reach of Cunning (tho' but a short one) in the case. For that having made the <hi>Three Divine Persons Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> which can never be <hi>One</hi> by a <hi>Numerical Unity;</hi> he is willing to provide them a <hi>Specifical Unity,</hi> and to see whether that will serve the turn; but as the <hi>Nature of the Thing</hi> unhappily falls out to be, that will not do it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>These are the <hi>Considerations</hi> which I thought fit to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance against the Admission of a <hi>Specifick Unity</hi> in the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> with reference to the <hi>Divine Persons.</hi> And the Conclusion, which I draw from them all, is this, That since the <hi>Fathers</hi> (and that even by this Authors own Confession) held a <hi>Numerical Unity of Nature in the Three Divine Persons,</hi> we can by no means grant that the said <hi>Fathers</hi> admitted also a <hi>Specifick Unity</hi> in the same, without making them guilty of a gross Absurdity and Contradiction. Forasmuch as these Two sorts, or degrees of <hi>Unity</hi> are utterly incompatible in the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope by this time the Judicious Reader sees how fit this Man is to be trusted with the <hi>Fathers,</hi> whose Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about so weighty an Article he dares misrepresent in such a manner. For to sum up briefly what he has said upon this Point.</p>
            <p>First, he tells us, <hi>That the Fathers agree very well in the Account they give of a Trinity in Unity,</hi> Page 106. and the four first Lines. Next he tells us, <hi>That the Nicene Fathers asserted a Specifick Unity of the Divine Nature in</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:101779:106"/>
               <hi>the Persons of the Blessed Trinity, and understood the word</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>only of such an Unity, and not of a Numerical,</hi> Page 106. and the five last Lines. And Thirdly, <hi>That this Specifick Unity, or Sameness of Nature, was absolutely Necessary to make the Three Divine Persons One God, and that it was impossible they should be so without it,</hi> Page 107. Lines 23, 24. And Fourthly, That the other <hi>Fathers</hi> (of which he there names four) <hi>never so much as Dream'd of a Specifick Unity of the Divine Nature,</hi> Page 109. lines 22, 23. And Lastly, <hi>That the Fathers do not stop in this Specifick Unity and Identity of Nature, but proceed to shew how the</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>proves a true Numerical and Essential Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Godhead in the Three Divine Persons,</hi> Page 114. Lines 30, 31, 32, 33.</p>
            <p>From all which Assertions, which lie plain and open in the forecited Pages, I desire this Author to resolve me these following Queries.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether those <hi>Fathers</hi> who Assert a <hi>Specifick Unity of the Divine Nature,</hi> and <hi>those who never Dreamt of such an Unity;</hi> And those again, who by the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> proceed to prove a <hi>Numerical Unity of Nature</hi> in the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> can be said to agree so very well in the Account they give of a <hi>Trinity in Unity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether those could give a true and right Account of a <hi>Trinity in Unity,</hi> who never so much as <hi>Dreamt</hi> of that, which was so absolutely necessary to make the <hi>Three Divine Persons One God,</hi> that they could not possibly be so without it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether a <hi>Specifick Unity,</hi> or <hi>Sameness of Nature</hi> in several <hi>Persons,</hi> is or can be a direct and proper proof of a <hi>Numerical Unity</hi> and <hi>Identity of Nature</hi> in the said <hi>Persons?</hi>

These Questions, I say, being the Natural and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Results of this Author's Positions, I hope he will graciously vouchsafe, sometime or other, to give the World a satisfactory Resolution of.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I will tell him what it was, that imposed upon him so, as to make him talk thus Absurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Unphilosophically of a <hi>Specifick Unity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> and traduce the <hi>Fathers</hi> also, as if they held the same. And that in one word is, That in the Subject before us, he takes <hi>Specifick Nature</hi> and <hi>Common Nature</hi> to signifie one and the same Thing; whereas, though every <hi>Specifick Nature</hi> be a <hi>Common Nature,</hi> yet every <hi>Common Nature</hi> is not a <hi>Specifick Nature</hi> (no nor a <hi>Generical</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.)

               <hi>of a Numerical, but of a Specifical Sameness of Nature, or the agreement of Things Numerically differing from one another in the same</hi> Common <hi>Nature.]</hi> In which words it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That he makes <hi>Specifick Sameness of Nature, and the Agreement of Things numerically different, in one and the same</hi> Common <hi>Nature,</hi> to signifie Convertibly the same Thing; and when he has done so, he opposes them Both to a <hi>Numerical Sameness of Nature,</hi> as appears from the Adversative Particle <hi>[But]</hi> placed between them. In which, let me tell him he is guilty of a very great mistake, both by making those Things the same, which are not the same, and by making an Opposition where there is a real Coincidence. For, by his favour, <hi>one and the same Numerical Divine Nature is a</hi> Common <hi>Nature too;</hi> forasmuch as without any Division, or Multiplication of it self, it <hi>belongs in Common</hi> to the <hi>Three Divine Persons.</hi> The Term <hi>[Deus]</hi> indeed is neither a <hi>Genus,</hi> nor a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:101779:107"/>
Nevertheless all <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>School-men</hi> allow it to be a <hi>Terminus Communis,</hi> as properly predicable of, and Common to <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and in this very Thing consists the Mystery of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> That one and the same <hi>Numerical Nature</hi> should be <hi>Common</hi> to, and Exist in <hi>Three Numerically distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi> And therefore for one (who pretends to teach the whole World Divinity) while he is Discoursing of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> to oppose <hi>Common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to <hi>Nature Numerically One,</hi> and from the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it,</hi> to make the <hi>Fathers</hi> Argue against <hi>its Numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calness</hi> (whereas the same <hi>Divine Nature</hi> may be, and really is both) it is a shrewd sign of the want of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other in that Man, that must needs render him extremely unfit to prescribe, and dictate in these Matters.</p>
            <p>In fine, the sole Point driven at all along by the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> as to the Question about the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> (for their Arguments to prove the Coequality of the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> against the <hi>Arians</hi> are not now before us) is an Assertion of a Real Numerical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting <hi>Unity</hi> of the said <hi>Nature</hi> in the said <hi>Persons.</hi> I say, a <hi>Numerical Unity,</hi> without making any more <hi>steps, or degrees</hi> in it than <hi>One,</hi> or owning any distinction between <hi>Sameness of Nature,</hi> and <hi>Sameness of Essence.</hi> And much less by making (as this Author does) a <hi>Specifick Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Nature,</hi> one thing wherein they place the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and then making <hi>Sameness of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence another and further degree</hi> in the <hi>Unity</hi> of the said <hi>Nature;</hi> and when they have done so, by a return back explaining this <hi>Sameness of Essence,</hi> by the <hi>Sameness of Nature</hi> newly mentioned; as he says, they do, in these words, immediately following (by way of Exegesis of the former) viz. <hi>That there is but one God, because all the Three Divine Persons have the same Nature,</hi> Page 107. and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101779:108"/>
the two last Lines. All which is a Ridiculous Circle, and a Contradiction to boot, making <hi>Sameness of Nature</hi> one <hi>step,</hi> and <hi>Sameness of Essence</hi> another, and then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this <hi>Sameness of Essence</hi> no more than a <hi>Sameness of Nature,</hi> again; so that according to him the <hi>Fathers</hi> must be said to go <hi>further,</hi> by resting in the very same <hi>step</hi> which they first made: Which way of Reasoning, I confess, may serve well enough for one, who can forget in one Page, what he had said in the other just before. But (by his favour) the <hi>Fathers</hi> were a little more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent, and understood themselves better than to run Divisions in such a senseless manner upon a Thing that admitted none.</p>
            <p>And thus having shewn how he has dealt with the <hi>Fathers</hi> in the Account given by him of their Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>the Unity of the Divine Nature in the Persons of the Blessed Trinity,</hi> (which was the <hi>first Head,</hi> under which I reduced his Allegations from them,) I come now in the</p>
            <p>2d Place, to the other and Principal Head; under which he undertakes to prove the chief and more peculiar part of his Hypothesis from the said <hi>Fathérs,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Unity and Identity of Nature belonging to the Three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, consists in the</hi> Mutual-Consciousness <hi>which is between them,</hi> That is in Truth, That they are therefore <hi>One God,</hi> because they are <hi>Conscious</hi> to themselves, that they are so.</p>
            <p>And here I shall begin with shewing how this Author overthrows the Point undertook by him before he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces any Arguments from the <hi>Fathers</hi> for it. And to this Purpose I shall resume those words of his before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by me out of Page 106. In which he reminds his Reader, <hi>That Trinity in Unity being so great a Mystery, and of which we have no Example in Nature, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:101779:108"/>
               <hi>if it cannot be explained by any one kind of Natural Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that therefore it was necessary to use several Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and to allude to several kinds of Union, to form an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Notion of the Unity of the God-head.</hi> Now here, since our Author's Notion, and the <hi>Fathers</hi> too (as he says) of this <hi>Unity</hi> is nothing else but <hi>Mutual-Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> I desire to Learn of him, what necessity there was or is of <hi>using several Examples, and alluding to several kinds of Union to explain, or form an adequate Notion of that?</hi> And I wonder what kind of <hi>Thing he would make of his Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> should he come to explain and describe it by several Examples, and several Kinds of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? But this is not all, for he tells us likewise (as we also observed before that there are several <hi>steps</hi> to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken towards the Explication of this Mystery. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I would again learn of him how many <hi>steps</hi> are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to explain <hi>Mutual-Conciousness?</hi> for one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine one single <hi>step</hi> sufficient to represent and declare a Thing which every Body understands. This Author indeed confidently enough Asserts, That <hi>the Fathers give no other Account of a Trinity in Unity, than the same which he gives of it,</hi> Pag. 101. Line 2. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if the <hi>Fathers</hi> thought <hi>several Examples,</hi> Steps <hi>and Kinds of Union absolutely necessary to explain the Notion they had of this Unity,</hi> and if these cannot be necessary to explain the Notion of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> then it must follow, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> neither did, nor possibly could by that <hi>Unity</hi> mean <hi>Mutual-Consciousness.</hi> And if this Author doubts of the force of this Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let him try his skill, and see what Learned stuff he is like to make of it when he comes to explain his Notion of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness by several Examples, Steps, and Sorts of Union, and out of them all to form one ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Notion of this so much admired Thing.</hi> Wherefore
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:101779:109"/>
I conclude, and, I think, unanswerably, That the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> by this <hi>Unity</hi> between the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> mean one Thing, and this Man quite another; and consequently that they have given a very different Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, from what he gives, contrary to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually bold and false Asseveration, affirming it to be <hi>the very same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I am ready to see what he has to offer us from the <hi>Fathers</hi> in behalf of his <hi>Mutual-Consciousness;</hi> but because I am extremely desirous, that the Reader should keep him close to the Point, and not suffer him to wander from it (which, in dispute, he is as apt to do as any Man living) I shall presume to hint this to him, That the Point to be proved by this Author, is not that the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> have one and the same <hi>Numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Nature,</hi> or <hi>Essence,</hi> nor that they are <hi>Mutually Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to one another of whatsoever each of them <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>knows;</hi> no, nor yet that this <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> inferrs an <hi>Unity of Nature</hi> in them, as a Thing inseparable from it. But he is to prove, That this <hi>Unity of Nature,</hi> and this <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> are Convertibly one and the some Thing, or that this latter is to the former what the <hi>Essence</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> of any Thing is to that Thing: That is to say, That the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> formally <hi>Consists in,</hi> and is, what it <hi>is, by</hi> that <hi>Mutual-Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which belongs to the <hi>Three Divine Persons.</hi> This, I say, is the Thing to be proved by Him.</p>
            <p>And so I proceed to his Arguments (which I assure the Reader, he shall find very strange ones) nevertheless to give him as easie and distinct a view of them, as I can, I will set down the several Heads of them before I particularly discuss them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The First of them is from the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">3. The Third from the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or Circuminces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion attributed likewise by the <hi>Fathers</hi> to them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Fourth from the Representation, which St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> makes of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> by the <hi>Mind,</hi> and its <hi>Three distinct Faculties of Understanding, Memory, and Will.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Fifth and Last from the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Original Principle,</hi> or <hi>Fountain of the Deity,</hi> or rather (say I) of the second and third <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which I shall examine distinctly, and in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But before I do so, I think fit to give the Reader an Account in one word of this Author's whole design in all the Particulars above specified. And that is, to prove, that the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> consists in <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Operation,</hi> and then to suppose (for he does not so much as to go about to prove it) that this <hi>Unity of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration is Mutual-Consciousness.</hi> This is the Sum Total of the Business; but I now come to Particulars. And,</p>
            <p>First, for the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, quoted by him out of <hi>Greg. Nyssen.</hi> Where, before we see how far it may be formed into an Argument, I think it requisite to give some Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how this Author Discourses of it. I must confess, I have sometimes wondred, what design he could have in so zealously exploding those commonly received Terms of <hi>Substance, Essence and Nature</hi> from any application of them to God: which here he does again afresh, telling us in <hi>Page</hi> 115. <hi>lines</hi> 24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>That it confounds our minds when we talk of the Numerical Unity of the God-head to have the least Conception or Thought about the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction and Union of Natures and Essences.</hi> And that therefore we are to speak of God only in words import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Energy or Operation:</hi> And accordingly for this reason
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101779:110"/>
               <hi>Gr. Nyssen</hi> expresses God by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, words not signifying <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Essence,</hi> but only <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection;</hi> Nay and this Author has gone <hi>a step</hi> much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this, plainly telling us, <hi>That the Father and the Son are Energy or Operation,</hi> Page 132. Line 13. And <hi>that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Energy are the same in God,</hi> P. 133. L. 20. and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, That we are to entertain no other Conception of God, but as <hi>of a pure simple Operation.</hi> And thus, when we have degraded the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> from <hi>Substance</hi> to <hi>Operation,</hi> it is but <hi>one step</hi> more to degrade it to bare <hi>Notion.</hi> This conceit of this Author, I say, at first I could not but wonder at, but am since pretty well aware of what he drives at by it. And that is in short, That he thinks it a much easier Matter to make <hi>Action,</hi> or <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,</hi> than <hi>Substance, Essence,</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> pass for <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Consciousness:</hi> And this upon good Reason, I am sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, is the Thing he designs: But I believe he will fall short of fetching <hi>his Mutual-Consciousness</hi> out of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. And therefore first to Correct that Crude Notion of his, <hi>That we must not speak of God in Terms im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Nature, but Operation;</hi> I desire this Bold Man (as I urged before in Chap. 2) to tell me whether the Names of <hi>Iah</hi> and <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and <hi>I am that I am,</hi> by which, <hi>God</hi> revealed himself to his People, were not Names of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Essence?</hi> and whether <hi>God</hi> revealed them for any other purpose than that he might be <hi>known</hi> and <hi>understood</hi> by them? But for all this he will have us to know from <hi>Gr. Nyssen,</hi> That the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is <hi>quid</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Thing above Name or Expression. And it is so, I confess, as to an adequate complete Conception or Description of it. But then, I ask him, are not the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Operations so too?</hi> Are we able to comprehend them perfectly, and to the utmost of <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> they are? When the Psalmist tells us, that <hi>God has put darkness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:101779:110"/>
               <hi>his feet,</hi> Psal. 18. 9. <hi>and that his footsteps are not known,</hi> Psal. 77. 19. And the Apostle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. <hi>That his judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out.</hi> And are not these passages an Account of his <hi>Dealings</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> in the Government of the World? And yet surely, notwithstanding all this, we may have some true, though imperfect Conceptions both of his <hi>Nature</hi> and of his <hi>Operations</hi> also: And I desire this Assuming Man to inform me, What should hinder, but that so much as we <hi>Conceive of God,</hi> we may likewise express, and (what is more) prove too? For though <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> has told us, That the <hi>Divine Nature is unexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> yet, I hope, a Thing may be proved, though the <hi>Nature</hi> of it cannot always be throughly expressed. But the Truth is, he makes this <hi>Father</hi> Argue at a very odd rate. For he tells us, <hi>Page</hi> 115. That one way, by which <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> undertakes to prove, That the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Specifick Sameness of Nature,</hi> (as this Man understands it) proves a <hi>Numerical Unity of Nature</hi> in the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> is, <hi>because the Name [God]</hi> does not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly signifie the <hi>Divine Nature as something relating to it:</hi> Which is a rare Proof indeed; it being as much as to say, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Sameness of Nature,</hi> proves one <hi>God,</hi> because <hi>[God] does not signifie Nature.</hi> But St. <hi>Gregory</hi> is far from arguing so (which, besides the Absurdity of it, is only <hi>denying</hi> instead of <hi>proving)</hi> but he proves <hi>Sameness and Unity of Nature, by Sameness, or Unity of Operation;</hi> and that surely he might very well do, without making <hi>Unity of Nature</hi> only an <hi>Unity of Operation.</hi> And no less absurd is it, to represent St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> making <hi>Unity of Operation</hi> one way whereby the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Specifick Sameness of Nature,</hi> proves a <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Unity of Nature:</hi> For though <hi>Unity of Operation</hi> it
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:101779:111"/>
self proves this, yet surely it is not a Medium, whereby a <hi>Specifick Unity</hi> of the said <hi>Nature,</hi> does, or can prove it.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, That Assertion of this Author, <hi>[That God is properly Energy, or Operation]</hi> contains in it more Absurdities than one. For first he takes <hi>Energy and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> for the same Thing; whereas <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is properly <hi>vis activa,</hi> and <hi>Operation</hi> is only the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or actual Exercise of that <hi>vis,</hi> or <hi>Power.</hi> But whether it signifies one or both, it is certain, that <hi>God</hi> is properly neither of them. For (as I have shewn before) we must speak of <hi>God</hi> as we are able to conceive of him; and we conceive of <hi>God</hi> not as of an <hi>Action,</hi> but as of an <hi>Agent;</hi> that is, as of a <hi>Substance acting,</hi> or <hi>exerting</hi> it self; and upon this Account I do here tell this Author, that it is impossible for Humane Reason to conceive of <hi>Action, or Operation, but as founded in Substance;</hi> and that nothing would more confound and overturn all the Methods, Ways, and Notions of Men's Minds, than to endeavour to conceive of it otherwise. And therefore if <hi>God</hi> is sometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Action,</hi> it is by a Metonymy of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct for the Subject, or the Effect for the Cause; for truly and properly he is not so. And now, if this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor shall think to take Sanctuary in that known Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>God, That he is a pure simple Act,</hi> he may please to take notice, that the Term <hi>Act</hi> is Ambiguous; and sometimes signifies an <hi>Actus Entitativus,</hi> which is no more than the <hi>Entity,</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> of a Thing, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an <hi>Actus Physicus,</hi> which is the <hi>Operation,</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion</hi> of some <hi>Active Power.</hi> And it is in the former sense only in which <hi>God</hi> is said to be <hi>a pure simple Act,</hi> and not in the latter. And, by this Author's Favour, every <hi>Substance, Essence,</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> is such an <hi>Act;</hi> which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101779:111"/>
quite spoils all his fine Notion about expressing <hi>God</hi> only by <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Energy</hi> and <hi>Operation,</hi> in exclusion of those of <hi>Nature, Essence</hi> and <hi>Substance.</hi> This I thought fit to premise, as throwing up the very foundation of all his Arguments, and indeed of his whole Hypothesis.</p>
            <p>And so I come to his Argument, the Sum of which, is this.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is <hi>Divine Energy,</hi> or <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and therefore, That the <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Divine Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> and Lastly, That this <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is <hi>Mutual-Consciousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it is certain, That there is not one of all these Three Propositions true; but that is no fault of mine: since if they were cast into a Syllogism, that would not mend the Matter; for the Syllogism must proceed thus.
<q>
                  <l>Unity of Divine Energy, or Operation, is Mutual-Consciousness.</l>
                  <l>Unity of Divine Nature is Unity of Divine Energy, or Operation.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>And therefore,</hi> Unity of Divine Nature is Mutual-Consciousness.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Every one of which <hi>Propositions</hi> is still salse. And yet I shall referr it to this Author himself, or to any one, who has Read and Considered his Book, to form a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Argument from what he has said of a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with reference to the present Subject, if he can.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless whether it be an Argument, or no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, my Answer to his Allegation of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with relation to the <hi>Unity of the Divine Nature,</hi> and to <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> is thus.</p>
            <p>First, That it is one Thing to be a <hi>Proof</hi> of a Thing, and another to be that wherein the <hi>Nature of the Thing proved,</hi> does consist. Thus actual Ratiocination is a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:101779:112"/>
certain Proof of a Principle of Reason, yet nevertheless it is not that wherein a Principle of Reason does consist, since that may be and continue, when actual Ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ceases. In like manner I will allow the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be a Proof of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But I absolutely deny, That the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101779:112"/>
it self, That they did not take <hi>Unity of Operation,</hi> and <hi>Unity of Nature</hi> for one and the same Thing. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Supposing (but not granting) that it were so, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Unity of Operation</hi> did not only prove, but really was it self this <hi>Unity of Nature,</hi> or <hi>Essence;</hi> yet how will this Author prove, that <hi>Unity of Nature,</hi> or <hi>Unity of Operation</hi> is properly <hi>Mutual-Consciousness?</hi> Is there so much as one Tittle in the <hi>Fathers</hi> expressing, or necessarily implying, that it is so? And as to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Thing it self; Will any one say, That there is no other <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2. His next Argument to prove, <hi>That Mutual-Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is formally that Unity of Nature which is in the Three Divine Persons,</hi> is taken from another Expression of the said <hi>Gregory Nyssen;</hi> viz. That there is amongst the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Concerning which, this Author has the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to appeal to any one to judge, whether this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this single Motion of the Will, which at the same instant, is in <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> can signifie any thing but <hi>Mutual Consciousness,</hi> which makes them <hi>Numerically One,</hi> Page 117. Lines 8, 9, 10, &amp;c. And he adds, That it is impossible they should have such a single Motion of Will passing through them all, without this <hi>Mutual Consciousness,</hi> Page 124. Lines
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101779:113"/>
30, 31. And this is the Sum of his Argument from the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>In Answer to which, before I address my self to his Argument, I will give some Account of the Quotation. In which, by his Favour, we are to take the sense of the <hi>Father</hi>'s words from the <hi>Father</hi> himself, and not from the Inferences which he who Quotes them, thinks fit to draw from them (how good soever he may be at that Work.) Now, what St. <hi>Gregory</hi> means by them, appears plainly by his manner of Reasoning. The Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before him was, <hi>Whether the Three Divine Persons were Three Gods?</hi> Which St. <hi>Gregory</hi> denies, and amongst other Proofs, says, That <hi>God</hi> is the Name of <hi>Energy,</hi> and from the <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Energy,</hi> proves the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> and that <hi>three Persons</hi> are but one <hi>God</hi> because the <hi>Operation</hi> is the same in all. To this he raises an Objection from the <hi>Sameness of Faculty, Office</hi> or <hi>Operation</hi> amongst Men, as <hi>Geometricians, Husbandmen, Orators,</hi> whose <hi>Office, Business</hi> and <hi>Operations,</hi> (in their respective way) are the same; which yet does not hinder, but that they are still Three or more several Men. To which he Answers, that these act <hi>seperately</hi> and by themselves; but that it is not so in the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> no <hi>Person</hi> in the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> doing any Thing by himself only, or acting separately from the other Two, but that there is one and the same <hi>Motion ond Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Will</hi> passing from the <hi>Father,</hi> through the <hi>Son,</hi> to the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> This is the force of St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, and the plain meaning of it is no more but this, That Three Men acting the same Thing, are still Three Men, because they act separately and by themselves: but that the <hi>Three Persons</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> are but <hi>One God,</hi> because they do not act <hi>separately,</hi> but that there is the <hi>same Motion and Disposition of Will</hi> in all the <hi>Three Persons;</hi> as, on the contrary, Three Men's not having
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101779:113"/>
               <hi>one and the same Motion of Will,</hi> equally proves, That they are not <hi>One,</hi> but <hi>Three</hi> several Men; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly makes a manifest difference between Three Men acting the same Thing, and the Operation of the <hi>Three Persons</hi> in the <hi>Blessed Trinity:</hi> which is the Sum of St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Answer to the forementioned Objection. And now, what does all this prove? Why truly neither of those Two Things, which this Author must prove, or he proves nothing, viz. <hi>That this Unity of Motion, and Disposition of Will, is properly and formally Unity of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature:</hi> And next, <hi>That this Unity of Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is properly Mutual Consciousness.</hi> These two Things, I say, it is incumbent upon him to prove: But how it can be done from the fore-mentioned Words, or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> I believe, will pose the Learned'st Man alive to shew.</p>
            <p>The proper Answer therefore to this Argument will be much the same with that just before given to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument drawn from the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (of which this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is but a Branch) and it proceeds thus.</p>
            <p>First, I deny the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be any more than a proof of the <hi>Unity of the Divine Nature;</hi> just as either the <hi>Effect,</hi> or the Causality is a sure proof of the <hi>Cause;</hi> but for all that, is not the Cause: or as a Consequent proves its Antecedent without being the Antecedent, or that wherein the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent does consist.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the next place I deny that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is formally and properly the same with <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-Consciousness,</hi> any more than an Act, or Motion of the <hi>Will,</hi> is formally the same with an Act of the <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:</hi> And before this Author takes it for granted, (which is his constant way of proving things) I expect
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:101779:114"/>
that he make it appear, That <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, signifie formally one and the same Thing: And it was boldly done of him (to say the least) to appeal to his Reader about a Thing, in which, if he understood the difference between an <hi>Act of Voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and an <hi>Act of Intellection,</hi> he must certainly judge against him.</p>
            <p>But it may be reply'd, That this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, does at least inserr a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. I grant it may: But affirm, That this is nothing to his Purpose; unless it could follow from hence, that that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs, or proves a Thing, is the very Thing which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs and proves; which it neither is, nor, for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, can be.</p>
            <p>As for what he adds, That this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> cannot be in the <hi>Three Divine Persons, without such a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-Consciousness:</hi> I do readily grant this also. But in the mean time is not this <hi>Dictator</hi> yet old enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between the <hi>Causa sinè quâ non,</hi> or rather <hi>the Condition</hi> of a Thing, and the <hi>Ratio formalis,</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of that Thing? Between That, <hi>without which</hi> a Thing cannot be, and that, which that Thing <hi>properly is?</hi> There can be no such Thing <hi>as Sight,</hi> without a due Circulation of the Blood and Spirits: But is such a Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, therefore, properly an Act of Sight? Or an Act of Sight such a Circulation? To dispute this further, would be but to abuse the Reader's Patience.</p>
            <p>And last of all, if this Author should take advantage of those words from <hi>Gregory Nyssen, That God is the Name of Energy.</hi> Besides, that it is not the bare <hi>Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but use of the Word,</hi> that must govern its significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I would have this Author know, That <hi>God</hi> may have many Names, by which his <hi>Nature</hi> is not signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as well as several others by which it is, and may be.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101779:114"/>
But I must confess, it is a very pleasant Thing (as was in some measure hinted before) to prove the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be Energy,</hi> because the Name <hi>[God]</hi> does not <hi>signifie Nature, but Energy, or Operation;</hi> whereas in Truth (if it proves any thing) it proves that <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Energy</hi> (applyed to <hi>God)</hi> do by no means signifie the same Thing.</p>
            <p>And so I have done with his Argument from the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and effectually demonstrated, That there is not so much as the least shew, or semblance of any proof from this, <hi>That Mutual Consciousness is properly that wherein the Unity of the Divine Nature in the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity does consist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. His Third Argument is from the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, commonly Translated <hi>Circumincession,</hi> and signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Mutual-Inexistence,</hi> or <hi>In-dwelling</hi> of each <hi>Person</hi> in the other Two. The Word was first used in this sence (so far as I can find) by <hi>Damascen,</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> of the 8th. Century. But the Thing meant by it, is contained in those words of our Saviour in <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 11. 21. <hi>Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me;</hi> which, I confess, are a solid and sufficient proof of the <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Identity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> both in the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son;</hi> and withal a very happy and significant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the same.</p>
            <p>But what is this to our Author's Purpose? And how does he prove this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be <hi>Mutual Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi> Why truly, by no Argument, or Reason produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or so much as offered at by him, but only by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, Over-bearing Affirmation, <hi>That there is no other Account to be given of that Mutual In-being of the Divine Persons in each other, (which the Fathers call</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>but by Mutual Consciousness,</hi> Page 125. Lines 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:101779:115"/>
But, by his leave, I must debate the case a little with him, before he carries it off so. And in order to this, I must tell him in the first place, That the Question is not whether <hi>Mutual Consciousness best explains this</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but whether it be the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> it self, and that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in the <hi>Three Persons?</hi> And in the next place, I demand of him, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Saviour's Words do not plainly and expresly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the <hi>Mutual In-being,</hi> or <hi>In existence</hi> of the <hi>Persons</hi> in one another, without any signification of their <hi>Mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Consciousness at all?</hi> And if so, let me hear a Reason, Why we should not take our Saviour's meaning from the Native signification of his own Words, rather than from those of this Author. For will he venture to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That the <hi>Father</hi> cannot be in the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> in the <hi>Father</hi> by a <hi>Mutual In-existence</hi> in one another, but only by a <hi>Mutual Knowledge</hi> of one another? Let him take heed what he says, and how he ventures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Depth. Or will he say, That our Saviour meant the same Thing with himself, but was <hi>not so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in expressing it?</hi> For no other Reason, but one of these two can be assigned, That when our Saviour expresses himself in Terms importing <hi>Mutual In-existence,</hi> this Man shall dare to say, That he means nothing by them but <hi>Mutual Consciousness.</hi> I referr it to the Serious and Impartial Reader to Judge of the Horrible Boldness of this Man: and withal, to observe how extremely he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from himself about this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>First, He sometimes says, That <hi>Mutual Consciousness is the only thing wherein both the Unity of the Divine Nature, and this Mutual In-dwelling of the three Divine Persons does Consist,</hi> Page 124. lines 4, 5. And,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:101779:115"/>
Secondly, He says, <hi>That Mutual Consciousness is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing that can explain, or give an account of this Mutual In-dwelling, or</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Page 125. lines 6, 7.</p>
            <p>To which I Answer, That when he speaks of giving an account of this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, if he means only <hi>an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that there is such a Thing belonging to the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> our Saviour's Words have given a sufficient Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that already. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, If he means such an Account of it, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains and makes clear to us the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>what it is,</hi> and <hi>how it is,</hi> I deny that any such Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can be given (or perhaps <hi>understood)</hi> by Humane Reason; and much less, that his <hi>Mutual Consciousness</hi> does or can give it.</p>
            <p>Concerning which, I shall ask him this one Question, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the <hi>three Persons of the Blessed Trinity</hi> are not <hi>Mutually Conscious</hi> to one another of their <hi>Mutual In-existence</hi> in one another? I suppose he will not (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he dares not) deny it. And if he grants it, then it manifestly follows, That their <hi>Mutual In-existence</hi> in one another, is in Order of <hi>Nature</hi> before their <hi>Mutual Consciousness;</hi> and consequently cannot be the same with it, nor consist in it. For certainly those <hi>Divine Persons</hi> must <hi>Exist Mutually</hi> in one another, before they can know, or be <hi>Conscious</hi> to themselves that they do so.</p>
            <p>So that we see here, that nothing is, or can be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for his <hi>Mutual Consciousness,</hi> whether we consider the <hi>Use</hi> of the Word, or the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Thing. But let us see, how he makes good his Point from the Authority of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which was the grand Thing undertook by him in this his <hi>4th.</hi> Section. And here as for the <hi>Fathers,</hi> he both Despises and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches them, and that very grosly too. For first he
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:101779:116"/>
tells us, <hi>That such an Union amongst the Divine Persons</hi> (as is expressed by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;) <hi>they all agree in, but how to explain it they knew not,</hi> Page 125. lines 17, 18. And why then, in the Name of <hi>God,</hi> does he referr to the <hi>Fathers</hi> to justifie his Explanation of that, which in the very same Breath he says, <hi>They knew not how to Explain?</hi> And the Truth is, the <hi>Fathers</hi> never owned themselves able to explain it; and that for a very good Reason, <hi>viz.</hi> because they held it unexplicable and unconceivable; and not for that scandalous Reason given by him, <hi>viz.</hi> That they <hi>had gross Material Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the Deity,</hi> by conceiving of it as of a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> Page 125. lines 27, 28. For, says he, within two lines after, <hi>Had they Contemplated God as a pure Mind, it had been easie to explain this</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of the Divine Persons in each other. Good God!</hi> That any <hi>Professor of Divinity</hi> should call <hi>that easie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,</hi> which the Reason of all Mankind has hitherto bent under, as a thing too great, and mysterious for it to comprehend, or to grapple with! So that if ever we have cause to cry out <gap reason="foreign">

Nor does this very Author deny it, as appears from his own words, though he quite perverts the sence of the Fathers, by a very sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Remark upon them, <hi>Page</hi> 125. lines 20, 21. <hi>This Sameness</hi> [or Unity] <hi>of Nature</hi> (says he) <hi>might be the Cause of this Union</hi> [in the <hi>Divine Persons,]</hi> viz by a <gap reason="foreign">

For will he make an <hi>Union</hi> (as he calls an <hi>Unity)</hi> in the <hi>Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by Sameness of Nature, a Cause of their Intimate Union by a</hi>

               </gap> to be the same thing <hi>with Mutual Consciousness?</hi> If he does so, he makes the same thing the Cause of it self. For the <hi>Sameness of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the three Persons,</hi> and their <hi>Mutual In-being, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling,</hi> are the very <hi>same thing,</hi> and the <hi>same Unity,</hi> though differently expressed. But however, if we take him at his own word, it will effectually overthrow his Hypothesis. For <hi>if the Sameness of the Divine Nature</hi> in the <hi>three Persons,</hi> be (as he says) the cause of this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and this <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> be the same with <hi>Mutual Consciousness;</hi> it will and must follow, That this <hi>Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or Unity of Nature</hi> can no more consist in <hi>Mutual Consciousness,</hi> than the <hi>Cause</hi> can consist in its <hi>Effect,</hi> or the Antecedent in its Consequent.

            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:101779:117"/>
But as to the Truth of the Thing it self, though we allow and grant <hi>the Unity of the Divine Nature</hi> in the <hi>Three Persons,</hi> and <hi>the Mutual In-being,</hi> or <hi>In-dwelling</hi> of the said <hi>Persons</hi> in each other, to be the same Thing, yet we deny, That this their <hi>Mutual In-being</hi> is the same with their <hi>Mutual Consciousness.</hi> But that their <hi>Mutual Consciousness</hi> follows and <hi>results from it,</hi> and for that cause cannot be <hi>formally the same with it.</hi> And so I have done with his <hi>3d.</hi> Argument, which he has drawn from the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and is indeed nothing else, but a bold down-right <hi>Perversion of Scripture, and a</hi> gross Abuse of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. His fourth Argument is from an Allegation out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> who, though he does not (as our Author confesses) <hi>Name this Mutual Consciousness, yet he explains a Trinity in Unity</hi> (as he would perswade us) <hi>by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Mutual Consciousness;</hi> particularly by <hi>the Unity of three Faculties of</hi> Understanding, Memory <hi>and</hi> Will <hi>in the same Soul, all of them Mutually Conscious to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the several Acts belonging to each of them.</hi> And his <hi>9th.</hi> Book is spent upon this Argument; In which he makes <hi>the mind,</hi> considered <hi>with its knowledge of it self, and its love of it self</hi> (all three of them (as he says) but one and the same Thing) <hi>a faint Resemblance of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Unity.</hi> And this is, what he Argues from St. <hi>Austin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Answer.</p>
            <p>First, That <hi>Faint Resemblances</hi> are far from being so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Proofs of any Thing; and that, although similitudes may serve to illustrate a thing otherwise proved, yet they prove and conclude nothing. The <hi>Fathers</hi> indeed are full of them both upon this and several other Subjects, but still they use them for Illustration only, and nothing else. And it is a scurvy sign that Proofs and Arguments
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101779:118"/>
run very low with this Author, when he passes over those Principal Places in which the <hi>Fathers</hi> have plainly, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and professedly declared their Judgment upon this great Article, and endeavours to gather their sence of it only from Similitudes and Allusions; which looks like a design of putting his Reader off with <hi>something like an Argument, and not an Argument,</hi> and <hi>of which the Tail stands where the Head should:</hi> For according to the true Method of proving things, the <hi>Reason</hi> should always go first, and the <hi>Similitude</hi> come after; but by no means ought the <hi>Similitude</hi> ever to be put instead of the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, To make it yet clearer, how unconclusive this Author's Allegation from St. <hi>Austin</hi> is, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, That this <hi>Father</hi> does not here make use of <hi>an Example of Mutual Consciousness,</hi> by shewing the great disparity between the thing alledged, and the thing which it is applyed to, and that, as to the very Case, which it is alledged for. For we must observe, That <hi>the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Consciousness</hi> of the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity</hi> is such, as is fully and entirely in each <hi>Person;</hi> so that by virtue thereof every one of them is truly and properly <hi>Conscious</hi> of all that belongs to the other Two. But it is by no means so in those three Faculties of the Soul, <hi>Understanding, Memory,</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi> For though the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> indeed be <hi>Conscious</hi> to all that passes in the <hi>Will,</hi> yet I deny the <hi>Will</hi> to be <hi>Conscious</hi> to any Thing, or Act that passes either in the Understanding, or the Memory, and it is impossible it should be so, without exerting an Act of Knowledge, or Intellection; which to ascribe to the Faculty of the <hi>Will,</hi> would be infinitely absurd. It is true indeed. That one and the same Soul is <hi>Conscious</hi> to it self of the Acts of all these three Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: But still it is by virtue of its Intellectual Faculty
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:101779:118"/>
alone, that it is so. And the like is to be said of its <hi>Knowledge</hi> and of its <hi>Love</hi> of it self: For though it be the same Soul which both Knows and Loves it self, yet it neither knows it self by an Act of Love, nor loves it self by an Act of <hi>Knowledge</hi> any more, than it can <hi>Will</hi> by an Act of the <hi>Memory,</hi> or <hi>Remember</hi> by an Act of the <hi>Will,</hi> which is impossible: and amongst other proofs that it is so, it seems to me a very considerable one, That, if a Man could <hi>remember</hi> by his <hi>Will,</hi> this Author in all likelyhood, would not <hi>forget</hi> himself so often as he does. It is clear therefore on the one side, That the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Memory,</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> neither are nor can be <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Mutual Consciousness;</hi> and on the other, that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> do every one of them Exert <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Mutual Consciousness</hi> upon one another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that, as to this thing, there is a total entire difference between both sides of the Comparison. For which cause it is to be hoped, that this Author himself will henceforth Consult the Credit of his own Reason so far, as to give over proving, <hi>That the Unity of the Divine Nature in the three Blessed Persons consists wholly and solely in the Mutual Consciousness of the said Persons,</hi> by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples taken from such Created Things as are by no means <hi>Mutually Conscious</hi> to one another.</p>
            <p>But to manifest yet further the Vanity of this his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> I shall plainly shew, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this <hi>Father</hi> placed the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi> And that, in short, is <hi>in the Unity of their Nature, Essence, and Substance. This is the Catholick Faith</hi> (says he) <hi>that we believe Father,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Patrem, Filium &amp; Spiritum Sanctum, unius ejusdémque Substantiae, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Trinitate, Cap.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>Son, and Holy Ghost to be of one and the same Substance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:101779:119"/>
And again, <hi>Let us believe in the Father, Son, and Holy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Credamus ergo in Patrem &amp; Filium &amp; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum Sanctum: Haec aeterna sunt &amp; incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutabilia, id est, Unus Deus, Unius Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, Trinitas aeterna. Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Ghost. These are Eternal and Unchangeable,</hi> that is, <hi>One God, of one Substance, the Eternal Trinity.</hi> And moreover, speaking of such as would have <hi>Three Gods</hi> to be Worshipped, he adds, <hi>That they know not what is the meaning of one and the same</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Nesciunt enim quid sit Una eadémque Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia, &amp;c. <hi>Lib. de Agone Christiano.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Substance, and are deceived by their own Fancies; and because they see Three Bodies separate in three Places, they think the Substance of God is so to be understood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think it very needless to add the like Testimonies from other <hi>Fathers</hi> (how numerous and full soever they may be) for our Author having here quoted only St. <hi>Austin,</hi> I shall confine my Answer to his Quotation, and think it enough for me to over-rule an Inference from a <hi>Similitude</hi> taken out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> by a <hi>Plain, Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Unexceptionable</hi> Declaration of St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>The Sum of the whole Matter is this, That the thing to be proved by this Author, is, <hi>That the Three Divine Persons are One, only by an Unity of Mutual Consciousness;</hi> And to prove this, he produces only a Similitude out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and that also, a <hi>Similitude</hi> taken from things, in which no such thing as <hi>Mutual Consciousness</hi> is to be found. By which it appears, that his Argument is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly lame of both Legs, and, as such, I leave it <hi>to shift for it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. In the fifth and last place, He tells us, <hi>That the Fathers also resolved the Unity of the God head in the three Divine Persons into the</hi> Unity of Principle; <hi>meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that though there be three Divine Persons in the God-head,</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:101779:119"/>
               <hi>Father, Son and Holy Ghost; yet the Father is the Original and Fountain of the Deity, who begets the Son of his own Substance; and from whom, and the Son, the Holy Ghost eternally proceeds of the same Substance with the Father and Son; so that there is but one Principle and Fountain of the Deity, and therefore but one God,</hi> Page 128. line 6.</p>
            <p>Now all this is very true; but how will our Author bring it to his purpose? Why, thus, or not at all, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Numerical Unity of Nature</hi> in the <hi>three Divine Persons,</hi> by being founded in, and resolved into this <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Principle,</hi> does therefore properly consist in <hi>Mutual Consciousness.</hi> This, I say, must be his Inference, and it is a <hi>large step,</hi> I confess, and larger than any of the <hi>Fathers</hi> ever made: Nevertheless without making it, this Author must sit down short of his Point. And yet if he really thinks, that his Point may be concluded from hence, why, in the Name of Sence and Reason might he not as well have argued from <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>That God created the Heavens and the Earth,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> are and must be one, only by an <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Mutual Consciousness?</hi> For it would have followed every whit as well from this as from the other. But, since the Creation of both, I believe, never Man disputed as this Man does, while he pretends to prove his <hi>Mutual Consciousness</hi> from <hi>the Unity of Principle</hi> in the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>Divine Persons:</hi> And yet, if he does not design to prove it from thence, to what purpose is this <hi>Unity of Principle</hi> here alledged, where the only Point to be proved is, That the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in the <hi>three Persons</hi> is only an <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Mutual Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come a little closer to him. If this Author can make it out, that the <hi>Father</hi> Communicates his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:101779:120"/>
to the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> together Communicate the same to the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> by one <hi>Eternal Act</hi> of <hi>Mutual Consciousness,</hi> common to all <hi>three Persons,</hi> then his Argument from <hi>Unity of Principle to an Unity of Nature, consisting in Mutual Consciousness,</hi> may signifie and conclude something; but this he attempts not, nor if he should, would he or any Man living be ever able to prove it.</p>
            <p>But he is for coming over this Argument again, and tells us, <hi>That (as</hi> Petavius <hi>well observes) it does not of it self prove the Unity (that is to say, the Numerical Unity) of the God-head, but only the</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>or Sameness of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> i. e. as he elsewhere explains himself, <hi>[the Specifick Sameness of Nature.] And that therefore the Fathers thought fit to add,</hi> That God begets a Son, not without, but within Himself, Page 128. line 17, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In Answer to which Observation, though it affects the Point of <hi>Mutual Consciousness</hi> (the only thing now in hand) no more than what he had alledged before; yet in vindication both of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and of <hi>Petavius</hi> himself, I must needs tell this Author, That it is equally an Abuse to both. For as to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> it has been sufficiently proved to him, That neither is there any such thing as a <hi>Specifick Unity, or Sameness of Nature</hi> in the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> nor that the <hi>Fathers</hi> ever owned any such, but still by the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, held only a <hi>Numerical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Nature,</hi> and no other; so that their saying, That <hi>God begot a Son within himself,</hi> was rather a further Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, than any <hi>Addition</hi> at all to it. And as for <hi>Petavius,</hi> whereas this Man says, That he has observed, <hi>That this Argumentation of the Fathers, does not of it self prove the Numerical Unity of the God-head in the three Persons;</hi> I averr, That <hi>Petavius</hi> observes no such thing. He says indeed, <hi>If this Reasoning (viz.</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:101779:120"/>
from Unity of Principle) <hi>were considered Absolutely and Universally, it would prove rather a Specifick than a Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Unity of Nature,</hi> and gives a Reason for it from <hi>Humane Generation:</hi> But then he does by no means say, That the <hi>Fathers Arguments</hi> in this Case ought to be so considered, but plainly limits them to the <hi>Divine Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ex <hi>propriâ</hi> Divinitatis divinaeque Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis Conditione ac naturâ Vis &amp; robur Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentationis istius petitur, quatenus non qualemcunque Essentiae Unitatem sed Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larem &amp; Numeralem inesse Tribus Personis colligit. <hi>Petav. Dog. de Trinitate. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.</note> as of a peculiar kind, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from all others. And thereupon no less plainly As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, <hi>That when the Father begets the Son, he Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to him the same Numerical Substance and Nature,</hi> and says expresly, <hi>That the force and strength of the Fathers Argumentation is taken from the proper Condition and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Divinity, and the Divine Generation, from whence they collect, not any kind of Unity of Essence, but only a Singular and Numerical Unity in the three Divine Persons:</hi> Which he makes good by Instances from St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> and St. <hi>Hilary.</hi> And this is the true state of the Case, and shews, That <hi>Petavius</hi> understood the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> whether he, who takes upon him to be his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector and Confuter, does or no. In the mean time it is shameless to insinuate in this manner, that <hi>Petavius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented these Arguments of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as proving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>[Specifick] Sameness of Nature,</hi> and <hi>not the Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Unity of the God-head,</hi> when he plainly shews, That they designed thereby to prove a <hi>Numerical Unity of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> in the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> and nothing else.</p>
            <p>But this Author seems to assume to himself a peculiar Privilege of saying <hi>what he will, and of whom he will.</hi> In which nevertheless I cannot but commend his Conduct, as little as I like his Arguing. For that, as he makes so bold with so Learned and Renowned a Person as <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius;</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:101779:121"/>
So he wisely does it now that he is laid fast in his Grave. For had <hi>Petavius</hi> been living, and this Man wrote his Book in the same Language in which <hi>Petavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> wrote his (which, for a certain Reason, I am pretty well satisfied he never would) there is no doubt but <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius</hi> would have tossed him and his <hi>New Notion</hi> of <hi>three distinct infinite Spirits,</hi> long since, in a Blanket, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually taught him the difference of insulting over a great Man when his Head is low, and when he is able to defend himself.</p>
            <p>We have seen how little our Author has been able to serve himself of the fore mentioned <hi>Resolution of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Divine Nature, into an Unity of Principle,</hi> by way of Argument in behalf of his <hi>Mutual Consciousness.</hi> Nevertheless, though it fails him, as an <hi>Argument,</hi> yet, that he may not wholly lose it, he seems desirous to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate it as a <hi>Notion;</hi> and upon that score tells us, That it needs something further both to <hi>Complete</hi> and <hi>Explain</hi> it, (which, with reference to his own Apprehensions of it, I easily believe) but however, I shall take some Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what he says, both as to the <hi>Completion, and Explication of it.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>First, For the <hi>Completion.</hi> He tells us, <hi>That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are Essential to one God,</hi> and that upon this Account there must be necessarily <hi>three Persons in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the God-head, and can be no more.</hi> As to which last clause he must give me leave to tell him, That it is not the <hi>bare Essentiality</hi> of the <hi>three Persons</hi> to the <hi>God-head,</hi> which proves that there can be no more than <hi>three</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it: but it is the <hi>Peculiar Condition</hi> of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> which proves this; without which the <hi>Essentiality</hi> of the <hi>Three,</hi> would no more hinder the <hi>Essentiality</hi> of a <hi>Fourth</hi> or <hi>Fifth,</hi> than the <hi>Essentiality</hi> of <hi>Two</hi> could take away the <hi>Essentiality</hi> of a <hi>Third.</hi> And, therefore though
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:101779:121"/>
the Proposition laid down by him be true, yet his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for it will not hold.</p>
            <p>But one choice Passage quoted by him out of a great <hi>Father,</hi> I must by no means omit, <hi>viz.</hi> That upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this <hi>Unity of Principle,</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> calls the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Unam quandam summam Rem,</hi> Page 123. line 8. Concerning which, I desire any Man living (except this Author) to declare freely, whether he thinks that St. <hi>Austin,</hi> or any one else of Sence and Learning would call <hi>three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits</hi> (which are neither <hi>Numerically,</hi> nor <hi>Specificully,</hi> nor so much as <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively one) Unam quandam summam Rem.</hi> But in the</p>
            <p>Second Place: As for his <hi>Explication</hi> of the said <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he tells us, <hi>That he shall proceed by several steps,</hi> and those (as he would perswade us) <hi>very plain, and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally acknowledged by all,</hi> Page 126. lines 16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, by his good leave, I shall and must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur to two of them, as by no means fit to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by any, and much less <hi>such as are acknowledged by all.</hi> And they are the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth.</hi> In which he tells us, That, in the first place, <hi>Original Mind and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and in the second, <hi>That Knowledge of it self,</hi> and lastly, <hi>Love of it self,</hi> are all of them <hi>distinct Acts, and so distinct, that they can never be one simple individual Act:</hi> And withal, that these Acts being thus distinct, must be <hi>Three substantial Acts in God,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Three subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Persons:</hi> By which <hi>three substantial Acts</hi> he must of necessity mean <hi>three such Acts, as are three Substances.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as he adds in the very next words, <hi>That there is nothing but Essence and Substance in God,</hi> Page 130. line 7, 8, 9. to the middle of the page.</p>
            <p>Now against these strange Positions, I Argue thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:101779:122"/>
First, If the three fore-mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> are so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct in <hi>God,</hi> that they can never be <hi>one Simple Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Act,</hi> then I inferr, That the said <hi>three Acts</hi> cannot possibly be <hi>one God.</hi> Forasmuch as to be <hi>one God,</hi> is to be <hi>one pure simple indivisible Act.</hi> And thus we see how at one step, or stroke, he has <hi>Ungodded</hi> the <hi>three Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity.</hi> For <hi>these three Acts</hi> (he tells us) <hi>are the three Persons in the God head.</hi> Though I believe no <hi>Divine</hi> before him, ever affirmed a <hi>Person to be an Act, or an Act a Person,</hi> with how great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence soever (and something else) this Man affirms it here.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If those <hi>three Acts</hi> in the <hi>God-head</hi> are <hi>three distinct infinite Substances</hi> (as he plainly says they are, by telling us, Page 130. line 19. <hi>That there is nothing but Essence and Substance in God)</hi> then in the <hi>God-head</hi> there are and must be <hi>three distinct Gods,</hi> or <hi>God-heads.</hi> Forasmuch as an <hi>infinite Substance</hi> being properly God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>distinct infinite Substance,</hi> is and must be a <hi>distinct God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These I affirm to be the direct unavoidable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of those two short Paragraphs in Page 130. which he makes his <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth</hi> Explanatory Steps.</p>
            <p>But because he may here probably bear himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Maxim, <hi>That there is nothing but Essence and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in God,</hi> (which yet by the way might better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come any one to plead than himself) let me tell him, That that <hi>Proposition</hi> is not absolutely, and in all Sences true. If indeed he means by it, That there is no <hi>Being,</hi> whether <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Accident</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> besides his own most <hi>Pure, Simple, Indivisible Substance,</hi> or <hi>Essence,</hi> (which is the commonly received sence of it) it is most true. But if he therefore affirms, That neither are there any
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:101779:122"/>
               <hi>Modes,</hi> or <hi>Relations</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> this will not be granted him. For in <hi>God,</hi> besides <hi>Essence,</hi> or <hi>Substance,</hi> we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, That there is that, which we call <hi>Mode, Habitude,</hi> and <hi>Relation:</hi> And by one or other of these in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Essence,</hi> or <hi>Substance,</hi> we give account of all the <hi>Acts, Attributes,</hi> and <hi>Personalities</hi> belonging to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> or <hi>God-head.</hi> This is the constant, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously received Doctrine of <hi>Divines, School-men,</hi> and <hi>Metaphysicians,</hi> in their Discourses upon <hi>God,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, it is impossible to Discourse intelligibly of the <hi>Divine Acts, Attributes,</hi> or <hi>Persons.</hi> And as it stands upon a firm bottom, so it may well be defended: And if this Author has ought to except against it, I shall be ready to undertake the defence of it against him at any time.</p>
            <p>But still, that he may keep up that Glorious standing Character of <hi>Self-Contradiction,</hi> (which, one would think to be the very <hi>Ratio formalis;</hi> or, at least, the <hi>Personal Property</hi> of the Man.) Having here, in Page 130. made a very bold step, by Asserting <hi>the three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to be three distinct Acts, and so distinct, that they can never be one Simple, Individual Act.</hi> In the very next Page but one, <hi>viz.</hi> 132. line 13. he roundly affirms, <hi>That the Father and the Son are one single Energy and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Now, how safe and happy is this Man, that no Absurdities, or Contradictions can ever hurt him! Or at least, that he never feels them, let them <hi>pinch</hi> never so close and hard.</p>
            <p>What remains, is chiefly a Discourse about the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent way of the <hi>Son</hi>'s issuing from the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>'s issuing from both: As that the former is called <hi>Generation,</hi> because the <hi>Son</hi> issues from the <hi>Father</hi> by a <hi>Reflex Act,</hi> and the latter termed <hi>Procession,</hi> because the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> issues from both by a <hi>Direct Act.</hi> But
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:101779:123"/>
why a <hi>Reflex Act</hi> must needs be termed properly a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and a <hi>Direct Act</hi> not be capable of being proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so accounted, this our Acute Author very discreetly says nothing at all to; though (under favour) all that he says besides, leaves us as much in the Dark as we were before. And for my own part, I cannot think my self concerned to clear up a Point wholly foreign to that, which alone I have undertook the Discussion of.</p>
            <p>And thus I have finished my Dispute with Him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Authorities of the <hi>Fathers</hi> alledged in behalf of his <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Mutual Consciousness,</hi> as that, wherein he places the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> belonging to the <hi>three Blessed Persons.</hi> The Sum of which whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is resolved into this single Question, viz. <hi>In what the Fathers placed the Unity in Trinity?</hi> And if they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it in the <hi>Sameness,</hi> or <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Nature, Substance,</hi> or <hi>Essence,</hi> (words applyed by them to this Subject at least a thousand Times, and still used to <hi>signifie one and the same thing)</hi> then it is plain that they did not place it in an <hi>Unity of Mutual Consciousness.</hi> For, I suppose, no Man (this Author himself not excepted) will say, That <hi>Essence,</hi> or <hi>Substance,</hi> and <hi>Mutual Consciousness</hi> are Terms <hi>Synonymous,</hi> and of the same signification. And as the whole Dispute turns upon this single Question; so in the management of it, on my part, I have with great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity gone over all the Proofs by which this Author pretends to have evinced his Doctrine from the <hi>Fathers.</hi> The utmost of which Proofs amounts to this, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> proved an <hi>Unity of Nature</hi> in the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> from the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> common to them all: And moreover, sometimes illustrated the said <hi>Unity</hi> by the <hi>three Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the <hi>Understanding, Memory,</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> being one with the Soul which they belonged to. And lastly,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:101779:123"/>
That they resolved <hi>the Unity of the Trinity</hi> into <hi>an Unity of Principle;</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> being upon that account styled, <hi>Principium &amp; fons Deitatis,</hi> as communicating the <hi>Divine Substance</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> and together with the <hi>Son</hi> to the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.</hi> And what of all this, I pray? Do all, or any of the fore-mentioned Terms signifie <hi>Mutual Consciousness?</hi> Why, No: But this Author with a <hi>non obstante</hi> both to the proper signification and common use of them all, by absolute Prerogative declares them to mean <hi>Mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness:</hi> And so his Point is proved, viz <hi>That Mutual Consciousness is not only an Argument inferring the Unity of the Divine Nature in the three Blessed Persons,</hi> (which yet was all, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> used the fore-mentioned Terms for) but, (which is more) <hi>That it is that very thing wherein this Unity does Consist.</hi> This, I say, is a true, though a short Account of all his <hi>Arguments</hi> upon this <hi>Subject;</hi> and (according to my custom) I refer it to the Judicious Reader, to judge impartially, whether it be not so, and withall to improve and carry on the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid <hi>Arguments</hi> in his behalf to all further advantage that they may be capable of.</p>
            <p>But in the issue, methinks the Author himself seems to review them with much less confidence of their Puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, than when at first he produced them. For if we look back upon the Triumphant Flag hung out by him at his <hi>Entrance</hi> upon this part of his Work (the only proper time for him to Triumph in) and when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>That his Explication of the Trinity was the Constant Doctrine of the Fathers and the Schools,</hi> Page 101. lines 24, 25. who could have imagined but that he then fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw, that he should prove his Point with all the strength and evidence which his own Heart could desire? And yet alas! Such, for the most part, is the vast distance between Promises and Performances, that we have him
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:101779:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bringing up the Rear of all with this sneaking Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Page 138. line 22, <hi>&amp;c. It must be confessed,</hi> (says he) <hi>That the Ancient Fathers did not express their sence in the</hi> same Terms <hi>that I have done. But I leave it to any Indifferent and Impartial Reader, whether they do not</hi> seem to have intended <hi>the same Explication which I have given of this Venerable Mystery.</hi> These are his words; and I do very particularly recommend them to the Reader, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving his peculiar Notice. For is this now the Upshot and Result of so daring a Boast, and so confident an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, to prove his Opinion <hi>the constant Doctrine of the Fathers?</hi> viz. <hi>That though the Fathers speak not one word of it;</hi> nay, <hi>though they knew not how to express them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about it,</hi> Page 125. line 18. yet <hi>that to an Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Reader</hi> (and a very <hi>indifferent</hi> one indeed he must needs be in the worst sence) they may <hi>seem to intend the same Explication he had given of it?</hi> So that the sum of his whole Proof and Argument amounts to this and no more, <hi>viz.</hi> That to some Persons <hi>videtur quod sic,</hi> and to others, <hi>videtur quod non.</hi> For see, how low he sinks in the issue. First of all from the <hi>Fathers positive saying, or holding</hi> what he does, it is brought down to their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending</hi> it; and from their <hi>Intending</hi> it, it falls at last to their <hi>seeming to intend it;</hi> and that is all. And now, is not this a worthy Proof of so high a Point; And may it not justly subject this Author to the same <hi>Sarcastical Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> which he passed upon his <hi>Socinian Adversary?</hi> Page 92. line 17, &amp;c. <hi>Right, very Right, Sir, a plain Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But still there is one half of his Promise to be yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, <hi>viz. The proving his Opinion to have been the constant Doctrine of the Schools.</hi> And how does he acquit himself as to this? Why, in a very extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner too. For, first, instead of alledging the Authority
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:101779:124"/>
of the <hi>School-men,</hi> he tells us, Page 138. <hi>That they are of no Authority at all, but as they fall in with the Fathers.</hi> And withall, That instead of doing so, <hi>They use to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake and clog the sence of the Fathers with some peculiar Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties and Distinctions of their own.</hi> And <hi>that, the Truth is, the vain Endeavours of reducing this Mystery to Terms of Art, such as Nature, Essence, Substance, Subsistence, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis, Person, and the like,</hi> (which, he says) some of the <hi>Fathers</hi> used in a very <hi>different sence from each other) have wholly confounded this Mystery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I cannot but desire the Reader to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not a new and wonderful way of procuring Credit to an Hypothesis, upon the score of its being <hi>the constant Doctrine of the Schools,</hi> by telling the World (as this Man here does) that the <hi>School-men</hi> are a Company of <hi>Impertinent Fellows,</hi> of little or no Authority in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and who have by their useless absurd Niceties, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounded this whole Mystery? For if they are of no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority but what they derive from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> (as he avers) why does he quote them upon the same level with the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and plead them both as <hi>two distinct Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</hi> And if they do nothing but pervert and confound this Mystery, why, instead of alledging them, does he not earnestly caution his Reader against them, and disswade him from having any thing to do with their dangerous and absurd Writings? This certainly is a way of proving a Point by <hi>Testimony</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> so beyond all Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ridiculous, that unless the Reader will vouchsafe to read these Passages in the Author himself, and so take his Conviction from his own Eyes, I can hardly blame him, if he refuses to believe my bare Affirmation in a thing so Incredible.</p>
            <p>As for the Terms <hi>Essence, Substance, Subsistence, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the like,</hi> which he so explodes, I hope I have
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:101779:125"/>
given my Reader a satisfactory Account both of their usefulness, and of the uselesness of such as this Author would substitute in their room, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. at large, to which I referr him. And whereas he says, Page 139. line 25. &amp;c. <hi>That the Deity is above Nature, and above Terms of Art; and that there is nothing like this Mysterious Distinction and Unity; and therefore, no wonder, if we want proper words to express it by; at least, that such Names as signifie the Distinction and Unity of Creatures, should not reach it.</hi> It by all this he means, that there are no <hi>Terms of Art</hi> Comprehensive, and fully expressive of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Mysterious Distinction</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Persons</hi> belonging to it, none that I know of thinks o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. But if he means that no <hi>Terms of Art</hi> can be of any use to aid us in our inadequate, imperfect Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of those great things, so as thereby we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of them in some better degree, and clearer manner, than we could without such <hi>Terms,</hi> pray then, of what use are his <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual Consciousness</hi> in this Matter? For I suppose he will allow these to be <hi>Terms of Art</hi> too; and such (I am sure) as he has promised the World no small wonders from. But if he will allow any usefulness in those two <hi>Terms of Art</hi> (of his <hi>own Inventing)</hi> towards our better Apprehension of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> the same and greater has the constant use of all <hi>Church-Writers</hi> proved to be in the <hi>Terms Essence, Substance, Hypostasis, Person,</hi> &amp;c. as the properest and most significant, the fittest and most accommodate to help and methodize Men's thoughts in discoursing of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Immaterial Beings,</hi> of all or any other <hi>Terms of Art,</hi> which the Wit of Man ever yet invented, or pitched upon for that purpose. And I hope, the known avowed use and experience of such great Men, and those in so great a number, is an abundant overpoise to the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:101779:125"/>
contrary Affirmation of this, or any other <hi>Novel</hi> Author whatsoever.</p>
            <p>But all this (it seems) he endeavours to overthrow and dash with <hi>Three</hi> Terrible confounding Questions, Page 139. Lines 22, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which yet I can by no means think so very formidable, but that they may be very safely Encountered, and fairly Answered too. As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. What <hi>(says our Author)</hi> is the Substance, or Nature of God?</p>
            <p>I Answer. It is a <hi>Being</hi> existing of, and by it self, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal, Infinite, Eternal, Omniscient, Omnipotent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. How can Three distinct Persons have but One Numerical Substance?</p>
            <p>I Answer. Every whit as well as they can be said to have but one <hi>Numerical God-head,</hi> or <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> or as they can have one <hi>Numerical Mutual Consciousness</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. What is the Distinction between Essence, and Personality, and Subsistence?</p>
            <p>I Answer. The same that is between a Thing, or <hi>Being, and the Modes of it.</hi> And he, who neither knows, nor admits of a difference between these, is much fitter to go to School himself, than to sit and pass judgment upon the <hi>Schoolmen.</hi> And as for the Terms <hi>Subsistence</hi> and <hi>Personality,</hi> they import the last and utmost Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the Existence of Things, by vertue whereof, they exist by themselves so, as neither to be <hi>Supported</hi> by, nor <hi>Communicable</hi> to any Subject. Of which two <hi>Modes, Personality</hi> belongs only to <hi>Intelligent Beings,</hi> but <hi>Subsistence</hi> to all others, to whom the aforesaid Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does agree. And this is the True, Proper Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and Distinction between these Two. And
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:101779:126"/>
this Author may take Notice of it, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>However, having thus answered his Questions (tho' to what purpose he proposed them, I cannot imagine) yet that he may see how ambitious I am to follow his great Example, I shall, in requital of his three Questions, propose these four to him: As,</p>
            <p>First, Since in Page 139. he affirms <hi>the Deity to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Nature, and all Terms of Art; so that we want proper Words and Names to express the Distinction and Unity of the Divine Persons by, and that such, as signifie the Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Unity of Creatures, cannot reach it.</hi> I desire to know of him upon what ground of Reason it is, That speaking of this same <hi>Mysterious Unity and Distinction</hi> in Page 106. lines 11, 12, &amp;c. He says, That <hi>the Fathers used several Examples, and alluded to several kinds of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, thereby to form an adequate Notion of the Unity of the God-head?</hi> For if the Deity be so far above <hi>Nature</hi> and all <hi>Terms of Art,</hi> that there is an utter want of words, or Names to express the <hi>Unity</hi> of it by, <hi>How could any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, or Allusions drawn from Nature</hi> (though never so many) form in us <hi>an Adequate Notion thereof?</hi> Hitherto both <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Philosophers</hi> have judged the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> absolutely Incomprehensible by any <hi>Adequate,</hi> or <hi>Complete Conception</hi> of it. And for my own part, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>the Unity of it in Trinity,</hi> much less capable of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an <hi>Adequate Notion</hi> formed of it, than the <hi>Deity</hi> considered barely in self is, and consequently that it is as much as Humane Reason can reach to, to have a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> Notion of it, though very <hi>Imperfect and Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate.</hi> But as for an <hi>Adequate Notion of the Unity of the God-head in three Divine Persons,</hi> if this Author can form to himself such an one, let him enjoy it as a Priviledge peculiar to himself, and not obtainable by any other
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:101779:126"/>
Mortal Man whatsoever. And this is not the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his misrepresenting the <hi>Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas this Author in the latter end of <hi>Page</hi> 138, and the beginning of <hi>Page</hi> 139. explodes the Terms <hi>Essence, Substance, Subsistence, Hypostasis, Person,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as useless Niceties, and serving only to confound the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Trinity;</hi> and yet nevertheless in line 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Page</hi> 139. acknowledges, That <hi>these very Terms were found out and made use of to encounter the Heresie of</hi> Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, who had turned this Sacred Mystery into a <hi>Trinity of Names,</hi> or, at most, of <hi>Offices;</hi> I desire to know of him, what greater Proof he could have given of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding usefulness and importance of these Terms, than by thus deriving the invention and use of them from such an Occasion? And especially when, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>all the Curious Examination since passed upon them,</hi> whereby (he says) <hi>they were found in some respect or other defective</hi> (as what Terms are not when applyed to <hi>God?)</hi> experience yet shews, that they have maintained their Use and Credit from that Age all along to this very Day. Certainly it is a great Unhappiness, when a Man can neither forbear Writing, nor yet know when he <hi>Writes for a thing,</hi> and when against it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I desire to know of this Author, whether in the very same place, <hi>viz.</hi> Page 130. in which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to <hi>explain an Unity in Trinity by an Unity of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> he does well to tell us in line 19. of the said Page, <hi>That there is nothing but Essence and Substance in God,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so often, and so positively declared, <hi>That these Terms serve only to obscure and confound Men's Notions of God?</hi> And whether he accounts such Terms, as serve only thus to <hi>confound Men's thoughts and notions about the God-head,</hi> and the <hi>Unity</hi> thereof, the fittest <hi>to explain the Unity of</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:101779:127"/>
               <hi>the said God-head,</hi> with reference to the <hi>Divine Persons?</hi> Which is <hi>the thing there</hi> promised and undertaken by Him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and Lastly, Since this Author has condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the fore-mentioned Terms both as useless, and sit only to <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>confound,</hi> instead of <hi>explaining,</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> I desire to know of him, why he tells us at the close of Page 139. That he <hi>does not think it impossible</hi> (which is only a <hi>Figure</hi> called, a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, signifying, that it is <hi>very possible and easie) to give a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Account of the said School-Terms and Distinctions?</hi> For since by a <hi>Tolerable</hi> he must mean (if he means any thing to the Purpose) such an <hi>Account</hi> of them, as shews them to have a <hi>Rational Sence and meaning under them,</hi> I desire him to tell me whether every <hi>Rational Sence</hi> is not (as such) also a <hi>True one?</hi> And if <hi>True,</hi> whether <hi>one Truth</hi> can any more <hi>obscure, perplex, and confound,</hi> than it can <hi>contradict another Truth?</hi> Which being invincibly evident, as to the Negative, I desire this Author in the last place to tell me, whether it does, or can become a Man consistent with himself, to pass so Reproachful a Character upon the Terms of the <hi>Schools,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Page</hi> 139, and afterwards to give so contrary and commendatory an Account of the said Terms in the latter end of the very same Page?</p>
            <p>I hope the Reader will be pleased to take this Notable Instance also of this Author's Consistency with himself (so far as <hi>Self Contradiction</hi> may be so called) into his Consideration.</p>
            <p>And so these are the <hi>Four Questions,</hi> or <hi>Queries,</hi> which I would have him resolve me, or rather the World, in; for I am sure it concerns him and his Credit, so to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:101779:127"/>
Having thus followed this Author both in his Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Quotations, and found him equally Impertinent in both, I must again desire my Reader to joyn with me in admiring the strange Confidence of the Man. I have already noted, with what a daring Assurance he vouched his new Opinion <hi>for the constant Doctrine both of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and the Schools,</hi> Page 101. line 24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After which Peremptory Asseveration, who could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but that he would have appeared in the Head of Thirty, or Twenty <hi>Fathers</hi> at least <hi>(Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> together) to have rescued his beloved <hi>Hypothesis</hi> from the Imputation and Charge of Novelty, which he seems so desirous to Ward off? P. 100. l. 22. And that besides <hi>Gr. Nyssen, Athanasius, Maximus, Nazianzen, Damascen</hi> (and these for the most part quoted upon an Account not at all relating to his <hi>Hypothesis)</hi> and St. <hi>Cyril</hi> (who is not so much as quoted, but only Named) we should have had <hi>Iustin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origen, Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,</hi> St. <hi>Basil, Theodoret, Epiphanius,</hi> with several more, all alledged in his behalf? And amongst the <hi>Latins</hi> that we should besides St. <hi>Austin,</hi> whom alone he quotes, and St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> whom he only mentions about the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Page 107. line 10. have heard also of <hi>Tertullian, Lactantius,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> and St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> with a great many others? And then lastly for the <hi>School-men,</hi> who could have expected fewer of them also, than Ten, or Twenty? And that we should have seen <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Alensis</hi> (the first who Commented upon the <hi>Oracle)</hi> with <hi>Durandus, Aquinas, Scotus, Major, Biel, Soto, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squez, Cajetan, Gr. de Valentiâ, Estius,</hi> and many more of the <hi>Scholastick Tribe.</hi> all drawn forth in Rank and File, to have fought his Battels? But when after all, none but poor <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> comes forth like a <hi>Doughty Captain,</hi> with none to follow him, this methinks looks
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:101779:128"/>
more like the Despair of a Cause, than the Defence of it. For though our Author calls <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the Schools,</hi> and all know his Sentences to be the Text which the <hi>School-men</hi> undertake to Explain and Comment upon: Yet Experience has told us, That the <hi>Responses of this Oracle</hi> (as well as of those heretofore) are often found very <hi>Dubious and Ambiguous.</hi> Witness <hi>Thomas</hi> and his Followers expounding them one way, and <hi>Scotus</hi> and his Disciples understanding them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and several (amongst whom <hi>Durandus</hi> and <hi>Greg. Ariminensis)</hi> going a different way from both. So that sometimes there is but too much need of a good Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fix the sence of this <hi>Oracle,</hi> (as great a Veneration as the <hi>Schools</hi> may have for him.) And therefore since his Text is not always so very plain and easie as to make an Explication of it superfluous, this Author having quoted <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> in such, or such a sence, ought in all Reason to have produced the Major and more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent part of the <hi>School-men</hi> and <hi>Writers</hi> upon him, and shewn their Unanimous Concurrence in the same Sence and Notion, which he took him in, and quoted him for. And this indeed would have been to his Purpose, and look'd like proving his Opinion to have been the <hi>Doctrine of the Schools.</hi> Otherwise I cannot see how the <hi>Master of the Sentences</hi> can be called, or pass for all the <hi>School men,</hi> any more than the <hi>Master of the Temple</hi> can pass for all the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> Unless we should imagine, that this <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> had by a kind of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Consciousness</hi> gathered all his Numerous Brood into Himself, and so united them all into one Author. So that the Sum of all is this, That this Author, having declared his Opinion, <hi>the constant Doctrine both of the Fathers and the Schools,</hi> to make his words good, has produced for it Three or Four <hi>Greek Fathers,</hi> and Two
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:101779:128"/>
               <hi>Latin</hi> (though even these no more to his purpose than if he had quoted <hi>Dod</hi> and <hi>Cleaver,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, out of <hi>Homer)</hi> and lastly, <hi>One</hi> Sentence out of <hi>one School-man.</hi> Which if it be allowed to pass for a good, just, and sufficient Proof of any Controverted Conclusion, let it for the future, by all means, for this our Author's sake, be an Established Rule in Logick from a Particular, to infer an Universal.</p>
            <p>And now that I am bringing my Reader towards a close of this long Chapter, I must desire him to look a little back towards the beginning of the foregoing Chapter, wherein, upon this Man's Confident Affirmation, That <hi>his Opinion was the constant Doctrine both of the Fathers and the Schools,</hi> I thought it necessary to state what his Opinion was, and accordingly I shew'd, that it consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Four Heads.</p>
            <p>1st. That the <hi>three Persons of the Blessed Trinity were three distinct infinite Minds, or Spirits;</hi> which how far he was from being able to prove from the Authority of any of the <hi>Fathers</hi> cited by him, was sufficiently shewn by us in the preceding Chapter. The</p>
            <p>2d. Was, <hi>That Self Consciousness was the formal Reason of Personality in the said three Persons, and consequently That, whereby they were distinguished from each other;</hi> which (in the same Chapter) I shew'd he was so far from proving from the Authority of those <hi>Ancient Writers,</hi> that he did not alledge one Tittle out of any of them for it, nor indeed so much as mention it in any of the Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there made by him. And as for the</p>
            <p>3d. Member of his said <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Divine Nature in the three Blessed Persons, Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in the Mutual Consciousness belonging to them,</hi> This we have Examined at large, and confuted in this Chapter. But still there remains the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:101779:129"/>
4th. And last to be spoken to, as completeing his whole Hypothesis, and resulting, by direct Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, from the other Three, viz. <hi>That a Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity, explained by the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Terms, or Principles, is a very plain, easie, and intelligible Notion;</hi> which having been in a most Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, Peremptory manner, affirmed by him all along (as I shew in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.) and upon that Score, making so great a part of his <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> ought in all reason to be proved to have been the Sence and Doctrine of the Fathers concerning this Article. But not one word does he produce upon this Head neither. Nor, for my own part, do I expect ever to find the least <hi>Sentence</hi> or <hi>Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> in any <hi>Ancient Writer</hi> tending this way. And I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge this Author to produce so much as one to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, how, and with what kind of words I find these <hi>Ancient Writers</hi> expressing themselves about this venerable Mystery, I shall here set down. Only I shall premise a Sentence or two out of this Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and which I have had occasion to quote more than once before, from Page 106. line 7. viz. <hi>That the Unity in Trinity being</hi> (as he confesses) <hi>so great a Mystery, that we have no Example of it in Nature, it is no wonder if it cannot be explained by any one kind of Natural Union; and that therefore it was necessary to use several Examples, and to allude to several kinds of Union, to form an Adequate Notion of the God head;</hi> and moreover, Page 139. <hi>line</hi> 26. &amp;c. <hi>That there is nothing like this Mysterious Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Unity, and that we want proper words to express it by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which Passages lying clear, open, and express in the fore-cited places of this Author, I must needs ask him, Whether all these are used by him to prove <hi>the</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:101779:129"/>
               <hi>Unity in Trinity a plain, easie and intelligible Notion,</hi> as he has frequently elsewhere asserted it to be? As, to go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver each of the Particulars,</p>
            <p>First, Whether we must account it <hi>plain,</hi> because he says, <hi>It is a great Mystery, of which we have no Example in Nature?</hi> And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whether we must reckon it <hi>easie,</hi> because he says, <hi>That it cannot be Explained by any one kind of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Union, but that several Examples must be used, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of Union alluded to for this purpose?</hi> And,</p>
            <p>Lastly, Whether it must pass for <hi>Intelligible,</hi> because he tells us, <hi>That we want proper Words to express it by,</hi> that is, in other Terms, to make it <hi>Intelligible?</hi> since <hi>to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press a Thing,</hi> and <hi>to make it Intelligible,</hi> I take to be <hi>Terms</hi> equivalent.</p>
            <p>In fine, I here appeal to the Reader, Whether we ought from the forementioned Passages of this Author, to take the <hi>Unity in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity for a plain, easie, Intelligible Notion,</hi> according to the same Author's affirmation so frequently inculcated in so many Parts of his Book?</p>
            <p>But I shall now proceed to shew, (as I promised) how the <hi>Fathers</hi> speak and declare themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this great Point. And here we will begin first <note place="margin">

               </note> Subject thus. <hi>I confidently affirm</hi> (says he) <hi>that the Eternal and Blessed Trinity, which I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, I do yet believe, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with my Faith, what I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend with my Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have here, as I said, given a Specimen of what the <hi>Ancient Writers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> thought and said of the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> and it is, I confess, but a Specimen; since I think that enough for an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally acknowledged, and never before contradicted Proposition: Whereas, had it but in the least seemed a Novelty, (as this Author's <hi>Hypothesis</hi> not only <hi>seems,</hi> but unquestionably is) I should have thought my self obliged to have brought as many Quotations for it from Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as would have filled a much larger Book than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this shall be.</p>
            <p>But as for those which I have here produced, I do so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly appeal to any Man living, <hi>Christian,</hi> or not <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> (who does but understand these Languages) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Fathers</hi> now Quoted by me (and all the rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Subject speak agreeably to them) looked upon <hi>Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity, as a Plain, Easie, and Intelligible Notion?</hi> So that if the Judgment of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and of this Author, be in this point <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same,</hi> it must unavoidably follow, That either the <hi>Fathers</hi> have not yet declared their Judgment and Doctrine, or that this Author has not yet declared his:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101779:132"/>
Since so much as has been declared on the one side, is a direct and gross <hi>Contradiction</hi> to what has been Asserted on the other.</p>
            <p>And moreover the fore alledged Testimonies of the <hi>Fathers</hi> are such, that we are not put to draw what we contend for, by remote, far fetched Consequences from them, but it lies plain, open, and manifest in them; in words too clear and full to be denyed, and too convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to be evaded. So that we are sure both of their Words and Expressions, and of the common sence of all Mankind to expound and understand them by. And will this bold over bearing Man, after all this, <hi>Claim their meaning to be the same with his?</hi> What <hi>his meaning</hi> is, he has told us forty times over, <hi>viz. The Unity in Trinity,</hi> &amp;c. is so far from being an <hi>Unintelligible Notion,</hi> that it is not so much as <hi>difficult,</hi> how much soever the dull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken World has for near 1700 Years thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>And now if this be the true Account and state of this Matter, that when the <hi>Fathers</hi> say of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Trinity,</hi> that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: That is to say, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable, Inconceivable, Unintelligible, Incomprehensible, and (if possible) transcending the very Notion of the Deity it self, above all Humane Understanding and Reason, Discourse and Scrutiny,</hi> I say, if by all this, he can prove that the <hi>Fathers</hi> meant, <hi>That it was a very Plain, Easie, and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Notion</hi> (as, by affirming that those (who used all these Expressions) <hi>meant the same with himself,</hi> he does and must affirm; or say, That they knew not their own <hi>meaning,</hi> or at least were not able to express it, but in words quite contrary to it;) I must needs own the <hi>Fathers</hi> to have been not only <hi>less happy in expressing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:101779:133"/>
about this Mystery, than this Author (as with great Modesty and Deference to them, he often tells us they were) but, which is yet much worse, that they were the most wretchedly unhappy in wording their own <hi>Notions</hi> of all Men, who ever yet set Pen to Paper. And as for this Author, if <hi>Unutterable, Unconceivable and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible</hi> can pass with him for <hi>Plain, Easie, and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,</hi> it is high time for me to leave off disputing with him, and either to have no more to do with him, or without any further demurr, to profess my self as ready to believe and grant <hi>Contradictions,</hi> as he is, or can be, to Write them.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>THough I cannot think that the Nature and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Work undertook by me (which was only to Animadvert upon, and confute this Author's <hi>Novel, Heterodox Notions</hi> about the <hi>Trinity)</hi> does, or can directly engage me to proceed any further; or lay any Necessity upon me to give a positive Account of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Sence</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> about this great <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle;</hi> yet since this Author in asserting his own Opinion, could not be content to do it without reproaching and reflecting upon those <hi>Ancient Terms,</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> has been so long in possession of, and has still thought fit to use in declaring it self upon this Subject, (as if instead of <hi>Explaining,</hi> they served only to <hi>perplex, obscure,</hi> and <hi>confound it)</hi> and since the Reasonableness, or Unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of either <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> is most likely to appear by fairly setting down one, as well as the other, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:101779:134"/>
what this <hi>Opiniator</hi> is gone <hi>off from,</hi> as well as what he is gone <hi>over to,</hi> I judge it neither improper, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>useful to represent what the Church has hitherto held and taught concerning this <hi>Important Article of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> as I find it in <hi>Councils, Confessions, Fathers, School-men,</hi> and other <hi>Church-Writers,</hi> Ancient and Modern. And in this also I must be again content to entertain my Reader only with a Tast, or <hi>Specimen</hi> out of so vast a store; which yet I do, with very good Reason, judge both satisfactory and sufficient, in a Point of <hi>Divinity</hi> Universally owned, received, and embraced; and (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by such as reject and deny the <hi>Trinity</hi> it self) never Impugned, or Contradicted before.</p>
            <p>Now the commonly received <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Schools,</hi> concerning the <hi>Blessed Trinity</hi> (so far as I can judge, but still with the humblest Submission to the Judgment of the <hi>Church of</hi> England in the Case) is this, That the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> having laid this <hi>sure Foundation,</hi> that there is but <hi>one God;</hi> and that there is nothing <hi>(i. e.</hi> no <hi>Positive, Real Being,</hi> strictly and properly so called) in <hi>God,</hi> but what is <hi>God,</hi> and lastly, That there can be no <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> in the <hi>Deity</hi> with any such <hi>Positive Real Being</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the <hi>Deity</hi> it self; and yet the <hi>Church</hi> finding in <hi>Scripture</hi> mention of <hi>three,</hi> to whom distinctly the <hi>God-head</hi> does belong, it has by warrant of the same <hi>Scripture,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. expressed these <hi>three</hi> by the Name of <hi>Persons;</hi> and stated their <hi>Personalities</hi> upon <hi>three distinct Modes of Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence</hi> alloted to <hi>one</hi> and the same <hi>God-head,</hi> and these also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from one another by <hi>three distinct Relations.</hi> Concerning which, we must observe, That albeit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Reality of the <hi>Thing,</hi> the <hi>Subsistence</hi> and <hi>Relation</hi> of each <hi>Person</hi> make but one <hi>Single Indivisible Mode of Being,</hi> yet according to the Natural Order of conceiving. Things, we must conceive of the <hi>Subsistence</hi>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:101779:134"/>
as precedent to the <hi>Relation:</hi> Forasmuch as humane Reason considers Things simply as <hi>Subsisting,</hi> before it can consider them as <hi>Relating</hi> to one another.</p>
            <p>But for the further Explication of the Point before us, it will here be necessary to premise what is properly a <hi>Mode of Being.</hi> And this the <hi>School. Divines</hi> do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be either a <hi>Substance,</hi> or an <hi>Accident</hi> (which yet makes the adequate Division of <hi>Real Beings;</hi> since there is no such <hi>Being</hi> but what is contained under one of them) but a <hi>Mode</hi> is properly a certain <hi>Habitude</hi> of some <hi>Being, Essence,</hi> or <hi>Thing,</hi> whereby the said <hi>Essence,</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> is determined to some particular State, or Condition, which, barely of it self, it would not be determined to. And according to this account of it, a <hi>Mode</hi> in Things Spiritual and Immaterial seems to have much the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to such kind of <hi>Beings,</hi> that a Posture has to a Body, to which it gives some difference, or distinction, without superadding any new <hi>Entity,</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> to it. In a word, a <hi>Mode</hi> is not properly a <hi>Being,</hi> either <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Accident,</hi> but a certain affection cleaving to it, and determining it from its <hi>common general Nature</hi> and <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> to something more particular, as we have just now explained. As for Instance, in <hi>Created Beings, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is a Mode</hi> determining the <hi>general Nature</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to that particular State, or Condition, by vertue whereof it proceeds from, and is supported by another; and the like may be said of <hi>Mutability, Presence, Absence, Inherence, Adherence,</hi> and such like, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are not <hi>Beings,</hi> but <hi>Modes,</hi> or <hi>Affections of Being,</hi> and inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from it so far, that they can have no Existence of their own, after a separation, or division from the Things, or <hi>Beings</hi> to which they do belong.</p>
            <p>And thus having explained, in General, what <hi>a Mode</hi> is, we are to know, That the <hi>Personalities,</hi> by which
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:101779:135"/>
the <hi>Deity</hi> stands diversified into <hi>Three Distinct Persons,</hi> are by the Generality of <hi>Divines,</hi> both <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,</hi> called and accounted <hi>Modes,</hi> or at least something Analogous to them (since no one Thing can agree both to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Creature,</hi> by a perfect <hi>Univocation.)</hi> And moreover, as every <hi>Mode Essentially</hi> includes in it the <hi>Thing,</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> of which it is the <hi>Mode,</hi> so every <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> by vertue ofits proper <hi>Mode</hi> of <hi>Subsistence,</hi> includes in it the <hi>Godhead</hi> it self, and is properly <hi>the Godhead as subsisting with and under such a certain Mode, or Relation.</hi> And this I affirm to be the Current Doctrine both of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and the <hi>Schools,</hi> concerning the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> and the constantly received Account given by them of a <hi>Divine Person,</hi> so far as they pretend to Explain what such a <hi>Person</hi> is.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, as these <hi>Relations</hi> are <hi>Three,</hi> and but <hi>Three,</hi> so the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> to whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, are so too, viz. <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> But then we must observe also, That the <hi>Relations</hi> which the <hi>Godhead</hi> may sustain, are of Two sorts.</p>
            <p>1st. <hi>Extrinsecal,</hi> and founded upon some <hi>External act</hi> issuing from <hi>God;</hi> of which sort are the <hi>Relations</hi> of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, Preserver, Governour,</hi> and the like, to the <hi>Things Created, Preserved,</hi> and <hi>Governed</hi> by him. Which, though they leave a real effect upon the Things themselves, yet derive only an <hi>External Habitude,</hi> and denomination consequent from it upon the <hi>Deity</hi> it self. The</p>
            <p>2d. Sort of <hi>Relation,</hi> is <hi>Intrinsecal,</hi> and founded upon those <hi>Internal Acts,</hi> by which one <hi>Person produces</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or <hi>proceeds</hi> from another: For to <hi>produce</hi> and to <hi>proceed</hi> (whether by <hi>Generation,</hi> or <hi>Spiration)</hi> is that which makes, or Constitutes a Plurality of <hi>Persons</hi> in the <hi>Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:101779:135"/>
From all which it follows, That the <hi>Relation,</hi> by which <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>Creator,</hi> or <hi>Preserver,</hi> respects his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is extremely different from that by which <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>Father</hi> respects <hi>his Son.</hi> The former adding only to the <hi>Deity</hi> an <hi>Extrinsecal denomination,</hi> but the latter lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon it an <hi>Internal Incommunicable Character, Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially Inseparable</hi> from the <hi>Deity.</hi> So that although it may well enough be said, That <hi>God</hi> might never have been a <hi>Creator,</hi> yet it cannot be said of Him, That he might never have been <hi>a Father;</hi> the former being only an effect of his Will, but this latter the Necessary Result of his <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these <hi>Internal Acts,</hi> upon which the <hi>Divine Relations</hi> are founded, and from which they flow, are,</p>
            <p>First, That <hi>Eternal Act,</hi> by which the <hi>Father</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates his <hi>Divine Nature</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly is called <hi>Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that by which the <hi>Son</hi> receives his <hi>Divine Nature</hi> from the <hi>Father,</hi> which is called <hi>Filiation.</hi> And.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Act of Spiration,</hi> by which the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> together, eternally breath forth the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>Lastly, The <hi>Act of Procession,</hi> by which the <hi>Holy Ghost proceeds,</hi> and receives his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> joyntly from them both. These, I say, are those <hi>Internal, Incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable</hi> and <hi>distinguishing Acts,</hi> from which the <hi>Personal Relations</hi> belonging to the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>
            <p>But you will say: <hi>Does not this infer Four Persons in the Godhead?</hi> viz. That as <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Filiation</hi> make two, so <hi>Spiration</hi> and <hi>Procession</hi> should make two more?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:101779:136"/>
I Answer, No: Because the same <hi>Person</hi> may sustain several <hi>Personal Relations,</hi> and Exert, and receive seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Personal Acts,</hi> where those <hi>Acts,</hi> or <hi>Relations</hi> are not <hi>opposite to,</hi> or inconsistent with one another in the same Subject. As for instance, The <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> may Exert both an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Generation and of Spiration,</hi> and so sustain the <hi>Relations</hi> resulting from both without any Multiplication of his <hi>Person;</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> likewise may receive and sustain the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Filiation,</hi> and withal Exert an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Spiration,</hi> without any Multiplication of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality.</hi> And this, because neither are the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> and <hi>Spiration</hi> inconsistent in the <hi>Father,</hi> nor the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Filiation</hi> and <hi>Spiration,</hi> incompatible in the <hi>Son.</hi> Though indeed the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Filiation,</hi> and the <hi>Relations</hi> springing therefrom, would be utterly inconsistent (because opposite) in any one <hi>Person,</hi> as likewise upon the same Account would the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and <hi>Procession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence by plain and undeniable Consequence it follows, That <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Filiation, Spiration</hi> and <hi>Procession</hi> Constitute only <hi>Three Persons</hi> in the <hi>Eternal Godhead</hi> and no more. For <hi>Relations</hi> merely <hi>disparate,</hi> do not Constitute several distinct <hi>Persons,</hi> unless they be <hi>opposite</hi> too. That Maxime of the <hi>Schools</hi> being most true, That <hi>Sola Oppositio multiplicat in Divinis.</hi> So that albeit, <hi>Filiation</hi> and <hi>Spiration</hi> are Terms opposite to their respective Correlates, yet being only <hi>disparate</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to one another, and as both of them meet and are lodged in one and the same Subject, <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Son)</hi> they neither cause, nor infer in him any more than one <hi>Single Personality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now if any one should ask me, What this <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and <hi>Filiation,</hi> this <hi>Spiration</hi> and <hi>Procession</hi> are?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:101779:136"/>
I answer, That herein consists the Mystery; and since such Mysteries exceed the Comprehension of Humane Reason, I am not in the least ashamed, most readily to own my ignorance thereof, in that known Anthem used in the Church.

For tho the Author whom I have been Disputing with, by the help and vertue of Two Wonder working words (able to make one, <hi>who is no Conjurer,</hi> do strange things) undertakes to make this greatest of Mysteries <hi>Plain, Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi> and <hi>Intelligible;</hi> and when he has done this, (as he says he has) owns it nevertheless for a <hi>Mystery</hi> still: yet in the Judgment of other Mortals, to acknowledge a Thing <hi>Inexplicable,</hi> and in the same Breath to offer <hi>an Explication</hi> of it too, will be thought a little too much for one of an ordinary pitch of Sence and Reason to pretend to; and therefore, for my own part, I dare not look so high.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, in discoursing of the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Two Things are absolutely necessary to be held and insisted upon. One, That each, and every Person of <hi>the Blessed Trinity,</hi> entirely contains and includes in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>the whole Divine Nature.</hi> The other, That each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is <hi>Incommunicably different</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> from the other.</p>
            <p>And here if it should be asked, <hi>How they differ, and whether it be by any real distinction between the Persons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, Yes: But for the better explaining of my Answer, we must distinguish of Two sorts of Real Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:101779:137"/>
1. The first greater, <hi>viz.</hi> When Two Things, or real <hi>Beings,</hi> differ from one another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other lesser; as when the difference is between a Thing, or real <hi>Being</hi> on the one side, and the <hi>Mode</hi> of it on the other: Or between Two or more <hi>Modes</hi> of the same <hi>Being.</hi> And this Distinction, or Difference is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Real,</hi> in opposition to that which is wholly founded upon the Apprehension, or Operation of the Intellect, and has of it self no Existence without it. But a <hi>Being,</hi> and the <hi>Mode</hi> adhering to it differ, whether the Mind e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver apprehends and thinks of them, or no. And thus we affirm, That the Divine Persons really differ, and are distinguished from one another, <hi>viz.</hi> by a <hi>Modal,</hi> or <hi>les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> sort of <hi>Real difference;</hi> according to which, the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature Subsisting</hi> under, and being determined by such a certain <hi>Mode,</hi> personally differs from it self, as <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting</hi> under, and determined by another. Forasmuch as the Divine Nature, or Godhead so <hi>subsisting</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined is properly a Person. Nor ought this smallness of difference between the Divine Persons to be any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption against the Truth of what we have delivered concerning the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> as shall be more particularly shewn in Answer to one of this Author's Objections against it, before we come to a conclusion of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>In the mean time to sum up the foregoing Particulars, the Reader may please to take what I aver to be the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> about this great Article, in this following Account of it, viz. <hi>That there</hi> is one, and but one <hi>Self-Existing, Infinite, Eternal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Being, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or <hi>Substance,</hi> which we call <hi>God.</hi> And that this <hi>Infinite, Eternal, Self-Existing Being,</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> Exists in, and is common to <hi>Three distinct Persons, Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Of which the <hi>Son</hi> eternally issues from the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:101779:137"/>
               <hi>Father</hi> by way of <hi>Generation,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> joyntly from both, by way of <hi>Spiration;</hi> which <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> superadd to this <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or <hi>Deity, Three different Modes of Subsistence,</hi> founding so many <hi>different Relations;</hi> each of them belonging to each <hi>Person</hi> in a peculiar Uncommunicable manner; so that by vertue thereof, <hi>each person</hi> respectively differs and stands distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the other Two: And yet by reason of one and the same <hi>Numerical Divine Nature</hi> or <hi>Godhead</hi> equally existing in, and common to all the <hi>Three Persons,</hi> they are all but <hi>One and the same God. who is blessed for Ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I reckon to be a True and Just Representation of <hi>the Doctrine of the Catholick Church,</hi> so far as it has thought fit to declare it self upon this Great and Sacred Mystery. Not that I think this sets the Point clear from all Difficulties and Objections. For the Nature and Condition of the Thing will not have it so, nor have the <hi>Ablest Divines</hi> ever thought it so, (for where then were <hi>the Mystery?)</hi> But that it gives us the fairest and most consistent Account of this Article, both with reference to Scripture and Reason, and liable to the fewest Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against it, of any other <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> or <hi>Explication</hi> of it whatsoever.</p>
            <p>And the same will appear yet further from those Terms, which <hi>the Writers of the Church</hi> have all along used in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing themselves upon this Subject. And that both with respect,</p>
            <p>First, To the <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Agreement of the Three Divine Persons</hi> in one and the same <hi>Nature.</hi> And</p>
            <p>Secondly, To their <hi>Personal Distinction</hi> from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And first, For their <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> in one and the same <hi>Nature.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> expressed this by the Terms <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:101779:138"/>
the <hi>Latines</hi> by <hi>Consubstantialitas</hi> and <hi>Coessentialitas.</hi> By all which I affirm, That they understood an <hi>Agreement</hi> in one and the same <hi>Numerical Nature,</hi> or <hi>Essence.</hi> For tho this Author has affirmed, That <hi>the Nicene Fathers</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood no more by the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, than a <hi>Specifick Unity of Nature,</hi> this Matter has been sufficiently accounted for, and his Assertion effectually confuted in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter.</p>
            <p>In the next place. As for the Terms expressing the Distinction and Difference of <hi>the Divine Persons</hi> from one another, the <hi>Greeks</hi> make use of these, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Notes of Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And agreeably to them, the <hi>Latines</hi> also make use of the following Terms, <hi>Trinitas, Personae, Subsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, Modi Subsistendi, Proprietates, Relationes,</hi> and <hi>Notiones seu Notionalia.</hi> By which last the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> mean such Terms and Expressions, as serve to notifie and declare to us the proper and peculiar distinction of the Divine Persons. And they reckon four of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the above mentioned <hi>Paternitas, Filiatio, Spiratio &amp; Processio,</hi> all of them importing Relation. To which some add a fifth, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and the <hi>Latines, Innascibilitas;</hi> a Term not importing in it any <hi>positive Relation,</hi> but only a meer Negation of all <hi>producibility,</hi> by any <hi>Superiour principle,</hi> and upon that account peculiar to the <hi>Father,</hi> who alone, of all the Persons of <hi>the Blessed Trinity,</hi> is without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. Touching all which Terms, I cannot think it necessary to enlarge any further, in a particular and more distinct Explication of them; since, how differing soever they may be in their respective significations, they
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:101779:138"/>
all concur in the same use and design; which is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press something proper and peculiar to the <hi>Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> whereby they are rendred distinct from, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable to one another.</p>
            <p>But these few general Remarks I think fit to lay down concerning them. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That albeit most of these Terms, as to the Form of the Word, run <hi>abstractively,</hi> yet they are for the most part to be understood <hi>Concretively,</hi> and not as simple Forms, but as Forms in Conjunction with the Subject, which they belong to. In the former abstracted sence they are properly <hi>Personalities,</hi> or <hi>Personal Properties,</hi> viz. Those <hi>Modes,</hi> or <hi>Forms</hi> by which the <hi>Persons,</hi> whom they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to, are formally constituted and denominated what they are; but in the Latter and Concrete Sence, they signifie the <hi>Persons</hi> themselves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second Thing, which I would observe, is, That there has been in the first Ages of the Church some Ambiguity in the use of the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Persona.</hi> For neither would the <hi>Latines</hi> at first admit of <hi>Three Hypostases</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> as taking <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for the same Thing; for that they had no other <hi>Latin</hi> Word, to Translate <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by, but <hi>Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> by which also they Translated <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (the Word <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistentia</hi> being then looked upon by them as Barbarous, and not in use) so that they refused the Term <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for fear of admitting of <hi>Three distinct Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> or <hi>Essences</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which they knew would lead them into the Errour of <hi>Arius.</hi> Nor on the other side would the <hi>Greeks</hi> acquiesce in a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, nor admit of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for fear of falling thereby into the contrary Errour of <hi>Sabellius;</hi> for that they thought the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> imported no <hi>real Internal difference,</hi> but only a difference of <hi>Name,</hi> or <hi>Attribute,</hi> or at most
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:101779:139"/>
of <hi>Office;</hi> and for them to allow no more than such an one amongst the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> they knew was <hi>Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme.</hi> And this Controversie of Words exercised the Church for a considerable time; to appease and compose which (amongst other Matters) a Council was called and held at <hi>Alexandria</hi> about the Year of <hi>Christ,</hi> 362. in which amongst many other Bishops Convened from <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Arabia, Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> was present also <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself. And in this Council both sides having been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard, and found to agree in sence, though they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in words, it was ordained, That they should thenceforth Mutually acknowledg one another for <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi> and for the future cease contending about these words to the disturbance of the Church. By which means, and especially by the Explication given of these words by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> (whereby (as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> tells us in his Panegyrick upon him) he satisfied and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> to the indifferent use of them, and indeed that Oration made by <hi>Nazianzen</hi> himself in the Council of <hi>Constantinople (viz.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond General) before 150 Bishops, not a little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the same;) the sence of these Terms from that time forward came generally to be fixed, and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of them removed, and so the Controversie by degrees ceased between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> and the Words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Personae,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentiae</hi> grew at length to be promiscuously used without any Jealousie or Suspicion, and to be accepted on all hands (though not presently) in the same significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Third Thing which I would observe, is, That some of the forementioned Terms signifie <hi>Causally,</hi> and some only <hi>Declaratively,</hi> that is to say, some import the <hi>Ground and Reason</hi> of the Distinction of the <hi>Divine</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:101779:139"/>
               <hi>Persons,</hi> and some import only <hi>Marks, Notes, and Signs</hi> of such a Distinction. Of the first sort amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and amongst the <hi>Latines, Subsistentiae, Modi Subsistendi, Proprietates &amp; Relationes.</hi> Of the Latter sort amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and amongst the <hi>Latines, Notiones.</hi> But for the fuller and further illustration and improvement of this Note, I cannot but add the Observation of the solid and exactly Learned <hi>Forbesius, viz.</hi> That of these <hi>Modes</hi> called by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there is a Four-fold Use, or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as they sustain Four several Considerations, <hi>viz.</hi> That,</p>
            <p>First, As <hi>Modes of subsistence,</hi> they <hi>Constitute the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi> And</p>
            <p>Secondly, That by the <hi>Relations,</hi> which they imply and include, they cause the said Persons to be referred to one another. And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That as they are <hi>Properties</hi> they distinguish the Persons from each other. And</p>
            <p>Lastly, That, as <hi>Notions,</hi> they are Means, and (as it were) Instruments whereby we are enabled in some measure to apprehend and conceive of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. <hi>Forbesius Instruct. Hist. Theolog.</hi> Lib. 1. Cap. 35. Sect. 16.</p>
            <p>By all which it appears, That the several forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Terms do really import but one and the same Thing, differently considered, according to the several Uses and Effects ascribed to it, in respect of the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> amongst themselves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the Fourth and Last place, we may observe, That the words most commonly and frequently used by <hi>Writers</hi> in treating of the Divine Persons, are the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:101779:140"/>
the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And the Terms <hi>Personae, Relatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Proprietates,</hi> and (in the latter Ages especially) <hi>Subsistentiae,</hi> and <hi>Modi Subsistendi</hi> amongst the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Observations I thought fit to lay down for our clearer and readier Apprehension of the Expressions u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and other <hi>Church-Writers</hi> in their Discourses about this great Article of the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so I proceed now to my Authorities. shewing both from the Aucient and Modern use of the Terms aforesaid, and more especially of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I shall close up these particular Testimonies with some Passages in the Creed, commonly called the <hi>Athanasian;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed.</note> which I place so low, because it is manifest, that <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> was not the Author of it, it being not so much as mentioned in any <hi>Antient Writer</hi> (as the very Learned Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> affirms) till it occurs in <hi>Theodulphus Aurelianensis,</hi> who lived about the latter end of the Eighth Century. <note place="margin">Histor. li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terar. <hi>p.</hi> 146. &amp; 500.</note> Now the Passages are these, <gap reason="foreign">

That is, <hi>The whole Three Hypostases</hi> [or <hi>Persons]</hi> are <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal together, and Coequal.</hi> These Passages are full and plain, and the <hi>Creed</hi> it self may well claim the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity at least of the Eighth Century.</p>
            <p>My next <hi>Authorities</hi> shall be those of the <hi>Councils.</hi> But before I pass to them, I cannot but observe and own to the Reader concerning some of the first of my Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>viz.</hi> those out of <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> and that out of St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that it has been very much questioned by some Learned Men, Whether those Books, from whence they are taken, do really belong to the Authors to whom they are ascribed, and among whose Works they are inserted, or no. This I say, I was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, nevertheless I thought fit to quote them by the Names under which I found them placed; since many very Learned Persons, and much more acquainted with the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>Ancients</hi> than I pretend to be, have upon several Occasions done so before me. And the said Tracts are certainly of a very early date, and though the Authors of them should fall a Century or two lower, yet they still retain Antiquity enough to make good the Point for which I alledged them. Nevertheless I must and do confess it very probable, That the more distinct and exact use of the Terms <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as applyed to the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> did not general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and commonly take place, but as by degrees the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion of the <hi>Arian</hi> and other the like Controversies, through frequent Disputes, grew to still a greater and greater Maturity. And that the use of these Terms did obtain then, and upon that Account, I think a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Argument to authorize, and recommend them to all Sober and Judicious Minds.</p>
            <p>

And so I pass to the Testimonies of Councils concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same. Amongst which, we have here, in the first place, the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> making a Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Declaration of their <hi>Faith,</hi> concerning <hi>the Person</hi>

            <p>I cannot think it requisite to quote any Thing more from the <hi>Greeks</hi> upon this Subject, it being as clear as the Day, that both <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> stated the <hi>Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities</hi> of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> upon <hi>Three dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Hypostases,</hi> or <hi>Subsistences</hi> of one and the same <hi>God-head, Essence,</hi> or <hi>Substance,</hi> distinguished thereby into <hi>Three Persons.</hi>

               <hi>Greeks,</hi> in the free use of the Word <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> were to comply withthe <hi>Latines</hi> in the use of the Word <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>And here we will begin with St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who is full and clear in the case, in his Book <hi>in Symbolum Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> Cap. 2. Tom. 2. in these Words. <hi>Ità ergò rectum, &amp; Catholicum est, ut &amp; unum Deum secundùm Unitatem Substantiae fateamur, &amp; Patrem, &amp; Filium, &amp; Spiritum Sanctum in suâ quemque</hi> Subsistentiâ <hi>sentiamus.</hi> A Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage so very plain, that nothing certainly could more effectually declare, That this <hi>Father</hi> reckoned the <hi>Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities</hi> of the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> to consist in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral and respective <hi>Subsistences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next whom we shall alledge, is St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> who <note place="margin">
                  <hi>St.</hi> Hilary,</note> flourished in the Fourth Century, and wrote Twelve Books of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and some other Tracts upon the same Subject against the <hi>Arians.</hi> He, I confess, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and particularly in Book 4. <hi>de Trinit.</hi> p. 36. <hi>Basil. Edit.</hi> 1570. calls the <hi>Three Divine Persons, Tres Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias;</hi> but it is evident, that he took <hi>Substantia,</hi> in the same sence with <hi>Subsistentia,</hi> or <hi>Hypostasis;</hi> forasmuch as he else where often affirms that, which must of necessity infer this to be his meaning. As for instance, in his Book <hi>de Synodis contra Arianos,</hi> Page 223. he tells us,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:101779:146"/>
That <hi>Nullam</hi> diversitatem <hi>aut dissimilitudinem admittit Geniti &amp; Gignentis Essentia.</hi> And again, That there is <hi>Indifferens in Patre &amp; Filio divinitatis</hi> substantia, p. 224 And <hi>nulla differentis Essentiae discreta Natura,</hi> ibid. And <hi>nulla Originalis</hi> substantiae <hi>diversitas,</hi> ibid. And that there is between them <hi>nulla diversitas Essentiae,</hi> p. 225. None of all which Propositions could possibly be true, if the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> were <hi>three distinct Substances</hi> according to the proper sence and signification of the Word <hi>Substance.</hi> And therefore the Learned <hi>Forbesius</hi> in his <hi>Historico-The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological Instructions;</hi> Book 1. Chap. 2. quoting the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Passage, after the Words <hi>Tres substantias,</hi> subjoyns these of his own, <hi>Eo [nempe] sensu quo Graeci dicebant</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And accordingly St. <hi>Hilary</hi> explaining himself further, in his fore-cited Book <hi>de Synodis contra Arianos,</hi> p. 226. says, That though between the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> there was <hi>nulla diversitas Essentiae,</hi> yet they did <hi>respuere Personalium Nominum Unionem, ne Unus</hi> Subsistens <hi>sit,</hi> qui &amp; Pater dicatur &amp; Filius: Which Words manifestly infer, That the <hi>Father is said to be a Father, and the Son to be a Son,</hi> by a <hi>distinct Subsistence</hi> proper to each of them. And again speaking of those <hi>Fathers</hi> who opposed the Heresie of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> says of them: <hi>Idcircò</hi> Tres Substantias <hi>esse dixerunt,</hi> Subsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium <hi>Personas per</hi> Substantias <hi>edocentes, non</hi> substantiam <hi>Patris, &amp; Filii, &amp; Spiritus Sancti, diversitate dissimilis essentiae separantes,</hi> p. 228. By which Words, he speaks all that the <hi>Greeks</hi> meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the <hi>Latines</hi> of the following Times, by <hi>Subsistentia.</hi> For which reason it is, that the Learned <hi>Collator</hi> and <hi>Editor</hi> of this <hi>Father</hi>'s Works, uses, now and then, to such Passages as these to add an Explicatory Marginal Note to this purpose; as in Page 36. Book 4. <hi>de Trinitate,</hi> he puts in the Margin, <hi>Tres Substantiae, id est,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which manifestly shews, what the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learned Men was concerning St. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s sence in the use of the words <hi>Tres Substantioe</hi> with reference to the <hi>Divine Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From St. <hi>Hilary</hi> we pass to St. <hi>Ierome;</hi> who indeed scrupled the use of the Word <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> (as applyed to <note place="margin">S. Ierome</note> the <hi>Divine Persons)</hi> in Epistle 57. to Pope <hi>Damasus.</hi> But that he did only scruple it, and not absolutely refuse, or reject it, is evident from several other Passages in that Epistle; which shewed his Judgment to be, that there was nothing of it self ill and hurtful in the use of it. For, had he judged otherwise, surely he would not have told <hi>Damasus,</hi> that he was ready to own the Expression of <hi>Tres Personas Subsistentes:</hi> And moreover, That if <hi>Damasus</hi> would command the use of the Term <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> he would use it. But his Exception against it (for it was not the Word <hi>Person,</hi> as a great Man mistakes it, but the Word <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> which St. <hi>Ierome</hi> demurred to the <note place="margin">See the four Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons on 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. <hi>p.</hi> 120. Printed 1692.</note> use of) was built upon these Two grounds, both expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the same Epistle.</p>
            <p>First, That <hi>Hereticks</hi> abused, or made an ill use of this Term, to deceive and impose upon the Minds of Weak, and Unwary Persons. And, in good earnest, that must be a very extraordinary Word indeed, which is uncapable of being one way or other abused by some, and misunderstood by others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The other ground (which, as there is great reason to believe, was the main and principal cause of St. <hi>Ierome</hi>'s dislike of this Term) was its being imposed by an Incompetent Authority, <hi>viz.</hi> That some of the <hi>Greek Church</hi> would needs command him (and him a very warm Man too) who was of the <hi>Latin Communion,</hi> to the use of that, which the <hi>Latin Church</hi> had not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:101779:147"/>
him to. And <hi>Calvin,</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap</hi> 13. of his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. shrewdly intimates the peculiar Pique, which St. <hi>Ierome</hi> bore to the Eastern Bishops, to have been the chief, if not the sole cause of his Exception against this Word; adding withal, that it was not fairly done of him (which <hi>Calvin</hi> was a very Competent Judge of) to Assert (as in that Epistle he does) that in <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Scholis,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was <hi>nihil aliud quàm</hi> Hypostasis; which <hi>Calvin</hi> there says, <hi>Communi tritóque usu passim refellitur.</hi> But after all, it seems, St. <hi>Ierome</hi> could relent from his stiffness, and reconcile himself to this so much scrupled Expression. For in his Epistle, or Discourse <hi>ad Paulam &amp; Eustochium de assumptione Beatoe Marioe,</hi> speaking of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s exercising Two distinct kinds of <hi>Operation,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Two <hi>Natures</hi> combining in one <hi>Person,</hi> has these Words, <hi>Per hoc, quod audiérant, quod viderant, quod tractârant</hi> (viz. <hi>Apostoli) verbam vitoe erat, &amp; nihil aliud ex duabus Naturis, quàm Unum juxta</hi> Subsistentiam <hi>vel</hi> Personam. <hi>Hieronym. Tom.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 113. <hi>Edit. Paris. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Nivellium,</hi> 1579. So that I am in good hopes, that for the future St. <hi>Ierome</hi>'s Authority will not be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against expressing the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> by <hi>Hypostases;</hi> till it be proved, that there cannot be a <hi>Greek</hi> and a <hi>Latin</hi> Word for one and the same Thing: For, what <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies in the <hi>Greek,</hi> That, it is certain, <hi>Subsistentia</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies and declares to us in the <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for St. <hi>Austin,</hi> though he looks upon the Word <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> or <hi>Subsistentia,</hi> as new and strange to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">St. <hi>Austin</hi>
               </note> in the sence, in which it was used by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet he is so far from a bridging the <hi>Greeks</hi> in their way of speaking, that he very amicably allows even of those <hi>Latines</hi> also, who chose to follow the <hi>Greek</hi> Expression, as to this Particular, in his 5th. Book <hi>de Trin. Chap.</hi> 8, 9. where he tells us, <hi>Qui hoec tractant Groeco eloquio dicunt</hi>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:101779:147"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. <hi>Latinè ista tractantes cùm alium modum aptiorem non invenirent, quo enuntiarent verbis, dicunt</hi> Unam Essentiam <hi>vel</hi> Substantiam, Tres <hi>autem</hi> Personas, <hi>ibid.</hi> By which this <hi>Father</hi> manifestly shews, That the <hi>Latines</hi> indeed undestood the very same Thing by <hi>Persona,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> did by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and that they really rendered one by the other, though they were not generally so ready to use the Term. And here I suppose the Reader will easily perceive, that my Intent is not to establish the use of the <hi>Words</hi> hitherto pleaded for, upon the Authority of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> (for the Case needs it not) but only to shew, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this <hi>Father</hi> does both particularly consider, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly speak of the said Terms, yet he does not in the least reject, or disallow of them. But however, in the same Book he proceeds to another Topick very much to our present purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> his stating the <hi>Divine Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalities</hi> upon <hi>Relation,</hi> in these Words, <hi>In Deo nihil se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundùm Accidens dicitur, quia in eo nihil est mutabile. Nec tamen omne quod dicitur, secundùm Substantiam dicitur, sed secundùm Relativum: Quod tamen Relativum non est Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, quia non est mutabile; ut filius dicitur Relativè ad Patrem,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby (as we have said) founding <hi>Personality</hi> in, and upon something <hi>Relative,</hi> he suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proves, That the same neither is, nor can be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in <hi>Self-Consciousness;</hi> this being a Term, in the import' of it, perfectly <hi>Absolute,</hi> and containing nothing <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> in it at all.</p>
            <p>Next to St. <hi>Austin,</hi> we will produce <hi>Ruffinus</hi> a Writer of the 4th Century, and flourishing about the latter end <note place="margin">Ruffinus.</note> of it; who, in the short Account he gives us of what was done in the forementioned <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for the Peace of the Church, and the closing up the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Latines</hi> about the Words

            <p>The next, whom I shall produce to Vouch the same Thing, is <hi>Rusticus Diaconus,</hi> who lived and flourished <note place="margin">Rusticus Diaconus</note> about the middle of the Sixth Century. He in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. of his Book <hi>contra Acephalos;</hi> tells the <hi>Nestorian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> (whom he is there by way of Dialogue disputing with) That <hi>Subsistentia interdum</hi> Personam <hi>significat, non nunquam verò</hi> Substantiam. And accordingly, that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> distinguished in our <hi>Saviour, aliud</hi> &amp; <hi>aliud,</hi> viz. in respect of his <hi>Two Natures,</hi> but not <hi>alium</hi> &amp; <hi>alium</hi> in respect of his <hi>Person,</hi> which was but <hi>One:</hi> And this quite contrary to what we observe in the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Illic enim</hi> alius &amp; alius, <hi>ne Subsistentias confundamus; non verò</hi> aliud <hi>&amp;</hi> aliud. <hi>Unum enim Tria &amp; idem Deitate.</hi> To which Words of the <hi>Synod,</hi> this Author subjoyns these of his own. <hi>Ecce manifestissimè Synodi Universalis Authoritas</hi> Subsistentias <hi>pro</hi> Personis <hi>suscepit atque lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> This also, I think, is very full and satisfactory.</p>
            <p>I shall close these particular Testimonies with Two Passages in the Appendix to the Breviary of <hi>Liberatus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Liberatus Diaconus</note> the Deacon, who also lived about the middle of the Sixth Century, as I find it in <hi>Crabb</hi>'s Collection of the <hi>Councils, Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>P.</hi> 126. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. and which the very Learned Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> observes, is the only Edition of the <hi>Councils,</hi> where it is to be found. The first Passage is this. <hi>Idem Natura &amp; Substantia, quod commune, non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium significat, &amp; idem Persona &amp; Subsistentia, quod pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium, &amp; non commune declarat.</hi> And the other follows a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Ten Lines after in the same Column. <hi>Sanctae ergo Trinitatis una quidem est Natura atque Substantia. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis est enim Trium</hi> Substantia, <hi>non autem una</hi> Subsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, <hi>seu Persona Trium,</hi> viz. <hi>Patris, &amp; Filii, &amp; Spiritûs Sancti, sed Tres Subsistentiae sunt.</hi> In which certainly we
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:101779:149"/>
have so very clear and pregnant a Declaration of the Thing Contended for by us, that a clearer cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be given, nor reasonably desired.</p>
            <p>And therefore to add no more Private, or Single Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, I shall conclude all with that of a <hi>Council;</hi> not <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>under</hi> Martin the First.</note> a <hi>General</hi> one indeed, but that <hi>Lateran</hi> held under Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the first of 105 Bishops about the Year 649, or 650, and by way of Preparation for the Sixth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral one, and of <hi>Constantinople</hi> the third; called (as we have already shewn) by <hi>Constantinus Pogonatus,</hi> and held the following Year against the <hi>Monothelites.</hi> The first Decree of which said <hi>Lateran Synod,</hi> is this: <hi>Siquis secundùm Sanctos Patres non confitetur propriè &amp; veraciter Patrem, Filium, &amp; Spiritum Sanctum, Trinitarem in Unitate &amp; Unitatem in Trinitate, hoc est, unum Deum in Tribus</hi> Subsistentiis <hi>consubstantialibus, aequalis gloriae, unam, ean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>démque</hi> Trium <hi>Deitatem, Naturam, Substantiam, &amp; Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>sit condemnatus.</hi> Now this does as manifestly place the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> in <hi>Three distinct Subsistences,</hi> as it is possible for words to express. For it is evident, that by <hi>Subsistentiis</hi> cannot be here meant <hi>Substantiis;</hi> forasmuch as <hi>[Substantiis consubstantialibus]</hi> would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be Truth, nor Sence.</p>
            <p>And now, all that I pretend to from the foregoing Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies and Quotations, is not to prove, that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church</hi> has alway made use of the Terms <hi>Hypostases, Subsistentiae, &amp; Modi Subsistendi,</hi> about the Explication of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> (for I own it to have been otherwise,) but that from the Fourth Century downward, those of that Communion were not Strangers to, and unacquainted with these Words; many great and Eminent writers having from time to time more or less applyed them to this Purpose. But the main Proof of the Point driven at I state upon the Latter Ages of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:101779:149"/>
Concerning which I dare and do affirm, That for the Five or Six last Centuries, the said Terms have been Universally received and used by <hi>Divines</hi> in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Discourses about the <hi>Trinity;</hi> all stating the <hi>Personalities</hi> and <hi>Distinction</hi> of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> upon so many <hi>distinct Subsistences,</hi> or <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Subsistence;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in following the <hi>Greek Fathers,</hi> who were much more versed in this Controversie, and managed it much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more exactly than the Ancient <hi>Latines</hi> did.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, I shall proceed now to the <hi>School-men;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lombard.</note> amongst whom I shall begin with the Father of them, viz. <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> who in <hi>Book</hi> 1. of his Sentences, <hi>Distinct.</hi> 25. and <hi>Point.</hi> or <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. speaks thus. <hi>Cùm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur alia est Persona Patris, alia Filii, alia Spiritûs Sancti, utique id sanè intelligi potest, ut sit sensus talis; Alia est Subsistentia, vel Hypostasis Patris, alia Subsistentia Filii, alia Subsistentia Spiritûs Sancti; &amp; alia Subsistentia Pater, alia Filius, alia Spiritus Sanctus.</hi> By which surely it is plain, That he states the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> and their <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalities</hi> upon <hi>Subsistence,</hi> if any thing can be so.</p>
            <p>Next to <hi>Lombard,</hi> I shall produce <hi>Alensis,</hi> who in <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <note place="margin">Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Alensis.</note> and <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>de Divinis nominibus in speciali,</hi> has these Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages. <hi>In Divinis non dicitur una subsistentia, sicut una substantia.</hi> Quaest. 57. Memb. 3. And <hi>Tres sunt Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stases unius Essentiae,</hi> Quaest. 58. Memb. 3. And <hi>Persona est Hypostasis proprietate suâ distincta.</hi> Quaest. 58. Memb. 4. By all which he manifestly Asserts the thing here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for.</p>
            <p>After him, let us see what <hi>Durandus</hi> says, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to give the signification of <hi>Substantia, Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentia,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> 
               <hi>Essentia</hi> and <hi>Persona,</hi> with reference to <hi>God,</hi> in order to the Explication of the Term <hi>Subsistentia,</hi> first tells us, What it is to <hi>Subsist,</hi> in these Words. <hi>Subsistere dicit determinatum essendi modum, prout scilicet aliquid est</hi>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:101779:150"/>
               <hi>Ens per se, &amp; non in alio.</hi> A little after which, he tells us, That <hi>Nomen Personoe dicit suppositum Intellectualis Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae, cui omnia Proedicta conveniunt,</hi> scil. <hi>Essentia, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia</hi> &amp; <hi>Subsistentia.</hi> By which he gives us a most exact Account and Definition of a <hi>Person;</hi> which (in <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Beings)</hi> is nothing else but an <hi>Essence,</hi> or <hi>Substance</hi> (Terms Synonymous in <hi>God) under a Subsistence peculiarly belonging to it.</hi> And in the end of this Question, he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explains the <hi>Personalities</hi> of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> by so many <hi>distinct Relations,</hi> in these Words. <hi>Persona, quoe multiplicatur in Divinis, includit in eo, de quo dicitur, aliquid, quod non est omnino idem secundùm rem vel ex natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râ rei cum Essentiâ vel Substantiâ, scilicet Relationem; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione cujus plurificatur Persona in Divinis, &amp; non essentia.</hi> Durandus Lib. 1. Distinct. 23. Quaest. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> also we shall find giving his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the same purpose, and that very fully <note place="margin">Aquinas.</note> and clearly. <hi>Dicendum</hi> (says he) <hi>quòd quamvis hoc Nomen [Substantia] in Latino respondere videatur huic Nomini [Hypostasis] in Groeco, non tamen omninò idem significat secundùm usum utriusque linguoe. Nam hoc nomen [Hypostasis] apud Groecos significat tantùm Substantiam par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularem quoe est substantia prima; sed Latini utuntur No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Substantiae tam pro primâ quàm pro secundâ. Substantia autem particularis nihil aliud videtur, quàm quid distinctum subsistens. Cùm ergo in Divinis invenitur aliquid distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum subsistens, rectè ibi Nomen</hi> [Hypostasis] <hi>dici potest,</hi> secundùm quod Divina verbis humanis significari contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git. <note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> And again, <hi>Dicendum quòd hoc Nomen [Persona] non differt ab hoc nomine [Hypostasis] nisi quòd addit determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natam Naturam; quod patet ex hoc, quòd Hypostasis est In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividua substantia. Persona verò Individua substantia Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis Naturoe. Hypostasis ergo in Rationali Naturâ accepta nihil aliud est, quàm Persona, sicut Animal cum Rationali</hi>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:101779:150"/>
               <hi>Actu nihil aliud est quàm Homo. Unde cùm Divina Natura sit Rationalis, (largo modo accipiendo Rationale pro quolibet Intellectuali) oportet quòd Hypostasis Divina sit idem quod Persona Divina.</hi> And presently after, as to the <hi>Relative Nature</hi> of this <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> he adds this at the end of the Article. <hi>Sicut ergo hoc Nomen [Persona] in Divinis sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat Relationem per modum rei Subsistentis, sic &amp; hoc No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men [Hypostasis]</hi> Thomas in Scripto 2. in Sentent. Lib. 1. Distinct. 26. Quaest. 1. Artic. 1, 2. And again in his Comment upon the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Cap. 1. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil aliud est Persona quàm Hypostasis aut suppositum Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis Naturoe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to <hi>Thomas,</hi> let us hear <hi>Cajetan,</hi> one of the most <note place="margin">Cajetan.</note> Eminent Commentators upon him, who defending <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure</hi> against <hi>Scotus,</hi> speaks thus as to this particular. <hi>Substantia dupliciter sumitur, &amp; pro Essentiâ &amp; pro Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasi</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Subsistentiâ. Atque hoc secundo modo Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia,</hi> id est, <hi>Hypostasis dicitur formaliter de Personâ Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinâ, &amp; quòd simul ac semel Persona Divina est Hypostasis &amp; tamen Relatio.</hi> Adding these Words immediately hereupon. <hi>Hoec omnia communia sant omnibus Theologis.</hi> Cajetan in 1<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Thomae, Quaest. 40. Artic. 2.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cajetan</hi> I shall pass to <hi>Greg. de Valentiâ,</hi> who <note place="margin">Greg. de Valentiâ.</note> discourses of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> and <hi>Personalities</hi> thus. <hi>Ex hóc consequenter apparet, debere concedi in Divinis Tres Subsistentias respectivas, non solùm ut Subsistentia accipitur pro Torâ Personis, ut definitio Ecclesioe declarat; sed etiam ut accipitur pro gradu illo ultimo Substantiali constituente Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonam &amp; reddente illam incommunicabilem, quem Theologi appellare solent Subsistentiam, &amp; est ipsa Personalitas.</hi> G. de Valentiâ Tom. 1. Disputat. generali 2. Quaest. 3. Artic. 2. p. 741.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Gregory de Valentiâ,</hi> we will subjoyn <hi>Estius,</hi> who <note place="margin">Estius.</note> speaking of the Words <hi>Persona</hi> and <hi>Hypostasis</hi> as they
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:101779:151"/>
were used by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> and of the sence of the <hi>Fathers</hi> about them, speaks thus. <hi>Horum Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem posteriores Groeci ità sunt secuti, ut Hypostasim in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinis non aliud intelligant, quàm quod Latini Personam vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, maximè cùm in promptu non esset aliud Vocabulum, quo Subsistentiam illam personalem, quâ inter se distinguuntur Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; Filius, &amp; Spiritus Sanctus, commodè atque inoffensè exprimerent.</hi> Estius in sentent. lib. 1. Distinct. 23. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo 3. By which Words it appears, That according to this Author, it is this <hi>Personalis Subsistentia,</hi> by which the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> are distinguished, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in which the proper <hi>Personality</hi> of each of them does consist.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Estius</hi> let us cast our Eye upon <hi>Suarez,</hi> speaking <note place="margin">Suarez.</note> much the same Thing with those before mentioned. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertendum est</hi> (says he) <hi>hoc nomen [Subsistentia] apud Antiquos Patres frequentiùs accipi in Vi concreti ad signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candam Hypostasim seu Personam. In quo sensu nulla est Quoestio inter Catholicos, nam de fide est, dari in Trinitate Tres Subsistentias realiter distinctas, id est Tres Hypostases.</hi> Suarez in 1<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Thomae de Trinitatis Mysterio lib. 3. cap. 4. And then again for the <hi>Relative Nature</hi> of the said <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences,</hi> he gives this Account of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> and their <hi>Personalities. Ex his quoe hactenus diximus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluditur Relationem Personalem esse etiam proprietatem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituentem Personam [seu quâ constituitur Persona.]</hi> De Trinit. lib. 7. cap. 7. in the beginning.</p>
            <p>To all which I shall add, <hi>Martinez Ripalda,</hi> a short, <note place="margin">Ripalda.</note> but Judicious Writer upon the Sentences, speaking of the Term <hi>[Hypostasis]</hi> in these Words. <hi>Hoeretici</hi> (says he) <hi>referente Hieronymo, eâ voce abutebantur ad decipien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum fideles; jam eâ significantes Essentiam, jam Personali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem &amp; incommunicabilem Subsistentiam.</hi> By which last Expression this Author manifestly shews, That he takes
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:101779:151"/>
               <hi>Personality</hi> and <hi>Incommunicable Subsistence</hi> for Words Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous; and consequently that such a <hi>Subsistence</hi> is and must be that, by which a <hi>Divine Person</hi> is constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted formally, what he is.</p>
            <p>I cannot think it necessary to quote any more of this sort of Writers, nor am I sollicitous to alledge many of them, because I am well assured (according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Saying of <hi>Cajetan)</hi> that <hi>these are the Terms, and this the Language of them all upon this Subject.</hi> Only I think fit to remark this: That, whereas I have alledged some of the <hi>School-men</hi> (and particularly <hi>Durandus, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> and <hi>Suarez)</hi> expressing the <hi>Divine Personalities</hi> by <hi>Relations,</hi> as well as by <hi>Hypostases,</hi> or <hi>Subsistences,</hi> as they do in both these mean but one and the same Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Relative Subsistence,</hi> or a <hi>Subsisting Relation;</hi> so by both of them they equally overthrow this Author's <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> deriving the <hi>Divine Personalities</hi> from <hi>Self-Consciousness.</hi> Forasmuch as <hi>Subsistence</hi> is in <hi>Nature</hi> before it, and <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is opposite to it; it having been demonstrated by me in Chap. 4. That <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is a Thing wholly <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Irrelative,</hi> and therefore cannot possibly be the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of that which is <hi>Essentially Relative.</hi> In a word, <hi>Self Consciousness</hi> is neither an <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> nor a <hi>Relation;</hi> and therefore can have nothing to do here, whatsoever other Employment this Author may have for it.</p>
            <p>And now I shall at last descend to the Testimony of several <hi>Modern Divines,</hi> and all of them Men of Note in the Times in which they lived. And amongst these, let us first hear <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> in his common places <note place="margin">Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon.</note> speaking thus upon this Head. <hi>Satis constat</hi> (says he) <hi>veteres Scriptores Ecclesiae solitos haec duo vocabula discerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>

            </p>
            <p>After <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> let us consider what <hi>Calvin</hi> says; <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> in Book 1. of his <hi>Institutions,</hi> Chap. 13.

Add to these the <hi>Belgick</hi> Confession also, recognized, <note place="margin">The <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note> approved, and ratifyed in the Synod of <hi>Dort;</hi> which in its eighth Article speaks of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> in the <hi>Blessed Trinity</hi> thus. <hi>Haec distinctio</hi> [viz. <hi>Personarum] non efficit ut Deus in Tres sit divisus, quandoquidem Scriptura nos docet Patrem, Filium, &amp; Spiritum Sanctum singulos di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctam habere suis Proprietatibus Hypostasim,</hi> which Words are extremely expressive and full.</p>
            <p>But as touching these Confessions, the Reader ought not in Reason to be dissatisfied that I produce no more of them to the present purpose, (out of those many which are extant) since it has been still the Custom of most Churches to draw up their Confessions in Terms as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and short as they well could. So that we are the less to wonder if we seldom meet with such Words in them as are Explicatory and Particular.</p>
            <p>And now after all these Authorities thus alledged by me, I would desire this Confident Man (whom I am here disputing with) to look back upon the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Fathers, Councils, School-men,</hi> and all those Eminent <hi>Modern Divines,</hi> together with the <hi>Clergy</hi> of whole <hi>Countreys</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> Solemnly and Unanimously declaring themselves in their Publick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed <hi>Confessions of Faith,</hi> upon this great Article and Mystery; I say, I desire him to look all these in the Face, and to tell them, That they have hitherto abused the whole World with false Notions of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> by expressing the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> and <hi>Personalities</hi> by <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stases, Subsistences,</hi> and <hi>Modes of Subsistence,</hi> Words (as he says) importing <hi>little better than Sabellianism,</hi> and serving for nothing else but to <hi>obscure, perplex,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found</hi> the Minds and Thoughts of Men in conceiving, or discoursing of this Weighty and Sacred Point of our <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> This, I require him, in defence of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:101779:154"/>
what he has so expresly, peremptorily, and Magisteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affirmed all along in his Book, to do; if his <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Fore-head</hi> will serve him for it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I have here delivered in all the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin, Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern,</hi> which I think fit to offer in behalf of the Point pleaded for: Though, should I have represented all that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currs in the fore-cited Authors (besides many others not mentioned) to the same Purpose, I should not so much have <hi>quoted,</hi> as (upon the Matter) <hi>Transcribed</hi> them.</p>
            <p>And now, if any one should ask me, Whether I look upon these Testimonies as sufficiently representing the Doctrine of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> upon this Head of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, That barely by way of <hi>Induction</hi> they do not; since an <hi>Induction</hi> ought to consist of a greater Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Particulars. Nevertheless I avouch this Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Testimonies to be a full and sufficient Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sence of the Church herein, if we consider them as joyned with, and supported by these Three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Considerations, As</p>
            <p>First, That it is morally impossible, that the <hi>Persons</hi> above quoted, being of such Eminent Note in the Church, both for Orthodoxy and Learning, and Living (most of them) at such a great distance both of Time and Place, (rendring all Communication between them impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable) should, or could presume to express themselves upon so Sacred an Article, and so Tender a Point, but in such Terms as were generally received, used, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That these Terms were never yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, nor the Users of them Censured by any <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Council,</hi> accounted Orthodox; which in so great, and so revered an Article they would infallibly have been,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:101779:154"/>
had they been judged <hi>unfit</hi> for, or <hi>unapplicable</hi> to, the Things to which they were actually applyed, as this bold Author with great Confidence affirms them to be.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and Lastly, That hardly any Church-Writer of considerable Remark and Name can be produced, who ever treated of this great Subject in any other Terms than those expressed by us, or particularly made use of the Terms <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> to explain it by. All being wholly silent of them in all those Writings in which they do most particularly and exactly design a Discussion of these Matters.</p>
            <p>These Three Considerations, I say, added to the fore-alledged Quotations irrefragably prove them to be a true, just, and sufficient Representation of the Sence and Doctrine of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in this Matter; and that it is utterly inconsistent with the Common Reason, Principles and Practice of Mankind, that it should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. And as for what concerns this Author, whom I am disputing with, I dare affirm yet further, that any one or two of the Passages quoted by me, are more full and clear to the purpose I quote them for, than all that he has produced from the several <hi>Fathers</hi> alledged by him for his <hi>Self Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> put together; and much more than his forlorn <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> cited out of <hi>Gr. Nyssen</hi> to prove the <hi>Son an Infinite Mind distinct from the Father,</hi> Page 102. That is to say, than Three vagrant Words applyed by him, <hi>to he knows not what,</hi> and to be found (for ought appears) <hi>he knows not where.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which being manifestly so, I desire any Sober Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to shew me something but like a Reason to prove, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> and other <hi>Church-Writers</hi> (from whom all these Quotations were drawn) placed the <hi>Personal</hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:101779:155"/>
               <hi>Distinction</hi> of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> in <hi>Self Consciousness, and their Unity only in Mutual-Consciousness.</hi> On the contrary, as these Words were never so much as menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by them, so I affirm, That, whensoever, in speaking of the <hi>Trinity</hi> they proceed beyond the bare Word and Name of <hi>Person,</hi> so as to give any Account of the Thing signified thereby, and the Reason thereof, they do it constantly by <hi>Subsistences, Modes of Subsistence,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi> This I am positive in; and withal, that, as they never mentioned the Terms <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-Consciousness</hi> upon this Subject, so I avert moreover, That when they use the Words <hi>Subsistences, Modes of Subsistence</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> on the one side, and of <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Identity of Nature, Essence, or Substance</hi> on the other, (which they always do) they neither do, nor can mean <hi>Self Consciousness</hi> by the former, nor <hi>Mutual-Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> by the latter, nor yet the Things signified by either of these Terms. And that for these Reasons.</p>
            <p>First, Because all <hi>Modes of Being</hi> importing <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi> are in Order of <hi>Nature</hi> antecedent to the other Attributes of <hi>Being;</hi> such as are <hi>Knowledg, Wisdom, Power,</hi> and the like. And <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> is no more; as being but a branch, or sort of <hi>Knowledg,</hi> and nothing else. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because nothing <hi>Absolute</hi> can give <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Incommunicability</hi> to the Divine Persons, the Rule of <hi>the Schools</hi> being undeniably true, <hi>Non dari in Divinis Absolutum Incommunicabile,</hi> Gr. Valent. Tom. 1. Pag. 874. But such a Thing I affirm <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> to be, and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. have abundantly proved it so. So that it is evident, That all <hi>the Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> in all the Terms which they used to express <hi>the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Divine Persons</hi> by, had no regard to <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> either <hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Thing,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:101779:155"/>
that it is a Term wholly foreign and unapplicable to this purpose. And what is said of their silence about <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> extends to <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And the Truth is, the other forementioned Terms as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted by us against this Innovator, are to be looked on by all Sober Intelligent Men as a set of stated Words, or Forms of Expression first pitched upon by the Ablest <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> then countenanced and owned by <hi>Councils,</hi> and lastly established by a kind of Prescription founded upon a long continued use of the same throughout the several Ages of the Church, as the best and fittest helps to guide Men in their Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of, and Discourses about this great Mystery; and such as the <hi>Church,</hi> in treating of so arduous a Point, never yet would, nor durst go beyond. So that the Question now is, Whether they ought to be abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made to give place to a New, Mushrom, unheard of Notion, set up by one Confident Man preferring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self before all Antiquity? A Notion, (no doubt) long before he was Born, throughly considered, canvased and laid aside, as not only insufficient, but Impertinent to give any tolerable Account of the <hi>Trinity</hi> by.</p>
            <p>Well; but having declared this for the <hi>Catholick, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi> and <hi>Received Doctrine</hi> about the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> viz. <hi>That it is one and the same Divine Nature, Essence, or Substance diversified into Three distinct Persons by Three distinct Modes of Subsistence, or Relations, so that by vertue thereof God is truly and properly said to be Three Persons, and Three Persons to be One God.</hi> Having, I say, vouched this for the Doctrine of the Church, let us in the last place see what this Author has to object against it. And here his</p>
            <p>First Reason (to put it into Form for him for once) may run thus: Whatsoever constitutes and distinguishes
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:101779:156"/>
the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> is really and truly in <hi>God,</hi> bu <hi>Modes of Subsistence</hi> are not really and truly in <hi>God,</hi> and therefore <hi>Modes of Subsistence</hi> do not constitute, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the <hi>Divine Persons.</hi> The Major is evident, and shall be readily granted him. And the Minor he positively asserts, by denying any <hi>Modes to be in God,</hi> as particularly in <hi>Page</hi> 47. in these Words. <hi>All Men grant</hi> (says he) <hi>that there are no Accidents Qualities, or</hi> Modes <hi>in God.</hi> And again, <hi>Pag.</hi> 84. <hi>There are no</hi> Modes, <hi>no more than there are Qualities and Accidents, in the Deity.</hi> So that we see here, what this Author holds concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>Modes</hi> with reference to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Answer to which Argument, as I have formed it (and I challenge him to shew that I have at all wronged him in it, if he can) I deny the Minor, viz. <hi>That Modes</hi> of <hi>Subsistence are not in God:</hi> And as for his Two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited general Assertions: <hi>That Modes are no more to be allowed in God than Qualities and Accidents</hi> (which by the way are so put together, as if <hi>Qualities</hi> were not <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents)</hi> I have these Two Things to remark upon those Two Assertions so positively laid down by him.</p>
            <p>First, That it is a gross Absurdity, and no small proof of Ignorance, to reckon things so vastly different as <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Accidents</hi> are, upon the same Range, or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and then to argue and affirm the same thing of both. And therefore I do here with the same Positiveness tell him, That <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Accidents</hi> do extremely differ; and that none of any skill either in <hi>Logick,</hi> or <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accounted them the same. For an <hi>Accident</hi> affects the Subject, it belongs to, so, that it is also a <hi>distinct Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it self. But a <hi>Mode</hi> affects it so, that it is not a <hi>distinct Being</hi> it self. I will not deny but <hi>Accidents</hi> may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a large and loose sence be called <hi>Modes:</hi> But I deny, That <hi>Modes</hi> are either <hi>Accidents,</hi> or everso called,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:101779:156"/>
where they are particularly and distinctly treated of by themselves. <hi>School-men</hi> and <hi>Metaphysicians</hi> may speak very differently of <hi>Modes</hi> when they mention them <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally,</hi> and when they discourse of them <hi>professedly,</hi> and under a certain and peculiar Head. And whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they do so, if this Author can bring me any one <hi>Logician, Metaphisician, or School-man</hi> who takes <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> and <hi>Modes</hi> promiscuously for the same Things, I dare undertake to forfeit to him a greater Sum, than ever yet he received for Copy-money in his Life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, My next Remark upon his foregoing As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion is this: That as it is grosly absurd to confound <hi>Modes of Being</hi> with <hi>Accidents;</hi> so it is equally absurd to deny <hi>Modes of Being</hi> to belong to <hi>God.</hi> And this I shall prove both from the manifest Reason of the Thing, and from Unquestionable Authority. And</p>
            <p>First, For the Reason of the Thing. If <hi>Modes of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> should not be allowed in <hi>God,</hi> then I affirm it to be impossible for any Distinction, and consequently for any <hi>Persons</hi> to be in <hi>God.</hi> Which I prove thus. If there be any distinction in <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Deity,</hi> it must be either from some distinct <hi>Substance,</hi> or some <hi>Accident,</hi> or some <hi>Mode of Being,</hi> (for I defie him or any Mortal breathing to assign a fourth Thing besides these.) But it cannot be from any distinct <hi>Substance,</hi> for that would make a manifest Composition in the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> nor yet from any <hi>Accident,</hi> for that would make a worse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: And therefore it follows, That <hi>this Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> must unavoidably proceed from one or more <hi>distinct Modes of Being.</hi> This I affirm, and (according to my promise made to <hi>this Author</hi> in <hi>the foregoing Chapter)</hi> I shall be ready to defend <hi>the Truth of this Assertion</hi> against him, whensoever he shall think fit to engage in <hi>the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:101779:157"/>
Secondly, In the next place, for the proof of this from Authority, I affirm, that all <hi>Metaphysicians, School-men</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> (at least, all that I have yet met with) do unanimously concurr in these Two Things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That they utterly deny any <hi>Accidents</hi> in <hi>God.</hi> And</item>
               <item>2. That they do as universally affirm <hi>Modes of Being</hi> to be in <hi>God,</hi> and to belong to him. Nay, and (which is more) That they do in these very <hi>Modes</hi> state the Ground and Reason of the <hi>Personalities,</hi> and the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof respectively belonging to the <hi>Three Persons</hi> of the <hi>Godhead.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And for a further proof of what I have here affirmed, and withal to shew how unable this Man's <hi>Memory</hi> is to keep pace with his <hi>Confidence,</hi> whereas in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>page</hi> 47. He affirms, <hi>That all Men</hi> (mark this Word) <hi>deny Accidents, Qualities and M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>des to be in God.</hi> He himself afterwards, in <hi>page</hi> 48. Owns, That the <hi>School-men</hi> hold these different <hi>Modos Subsistendi</hi> in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and accordingly there sets himself (as well as he is able) to confute them for it. Now how shall we reconcile these blind Assertions, that so cruelly bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t and run their Heads against one another? For will he say, That the <hi>School-men</hi> do not grant such <hi>Modes</hi> to be in <hi>God,</hi> after he himself has done his poor utmost to confute them for holding it? Or having said, <hi>That all Men deny these Modes to be in God, and yet that the School men grant and hold it,</hi> will he say, That the <hi>School-men are not Men,</hi> and so come not under that Universal Appellative? What the <hi>School-men</hi> hold and assert in this Matter, has been sufficiently shewn already. But I must needs tell this Author upon this occasion, That he seems to have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a <hi>bad Memory,</hi> and withal to have more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary need of a very <hi>good one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:101779:157"/>
There is one Thing more which I think fit to observe, and it is something pleasant, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Author ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving exploded all <hi>Modos Subsistendi</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>School-men</hi> for holding them, even to a forfeiture of their very <hi>Humanity;</hi> he yet vouchsafes afterwards, by a kind of Correctory Explication, to allow them in this sence, viz. <hi>That the same Numerical Essence is whole and entire in each Divine Person, but in a different</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, P. 84. Lines 12, 13, 14. By which Words it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing that he grants that of the <hi>Manner,</hi> which he had before denied of the <hi>Modus,</hi> it is a shrewd Temptation to me to think, That certainly this Acute Author takes <hi>Modus</hi> for one Thing, and <hi>Manner</hi> for another.</p>
            <p>In fine, I appeal to the Judicious and Impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Whether a Man could well give a more convincing Argument of his utter Unacquaintance with the True Principles of Philosophy and Theology, than by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Assertion of these Two Positions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That <hi>Accidents</hi> and <hi>Modes of Being</hi> are the same Things. And</item>
               <item>2. That such <hi>Modes are not at all to be</hi> allowed of, or admitted in <hi>God.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Secondly, His Second Objection against our stating the <hi>distinction</hi> of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> upon <hi>Three differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Modes of Subsistence,</hi> is, That <hi>these Modes are little better than Three Names of One God.</hi> Which was the Heresie of <hi>Sabellius.</hi> P. 83.</p>
            <p>To which, I Answer Two Things.</p>
            <p>First, In direct and absolute Contradiction to what he asserts, I affirm, That the difference between <hi>Three Modes of Subsistence</hi> in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and only <hi>Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Names</hi> applyed to it, is very great. For Names and Words depend only upon the Will and Pleasure of the Imposer, and not upon the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Thing it
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:101779:158"/>
self, upon which they are imposed, and for that cause neither do nor can <hi>Internally</hi> affect it. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, all <hi>Modes of Subsistence</hi> spring from <hi>the Nature of the Thing,</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> which they affect, both antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to, and (by consequence) independently upon the Apprehension, or Will of any one. So that altho neither Man nor Angel had ever considered, or thought of, or so much as known that there were such or such things, yet <hi>the Modes of Subsistence</hi> proper to them, would have belonged to them, as really and as much as they do now. And if <hi>this Author</hi> cannot by this see a vast difference between these, and so many bare <hi>Names,</hi> (thanks be to God) others can both see and defend it too. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas he says, <hi>That these Three Modes are but little better than Three Names.</hi> I answer, That his very saying so is Concession that they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at least <hi>more and better.</hi> To which, I add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That <hi>this something</hi> (as small a Difference as it makes) is yet sufficient to discriminate things, which are only <hi>Distinguishable,</hi> and no more. For <hi>separable,</hi> or <hi>divisible</hi> from one another, I am sure they are not. Nay, this is so far from being a just and rational Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against placing the difference of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> in so many different <hi>Modes of Subsistence,</hi> that, in the Judgment of very Great and Learned Men, it is no small Argument for it: For St. <hi>Cyril</hi> says, <hi>That the difference</hi>

               <hi>them, and no more; and to cause that One of them cannot be called the other; the Father not the Son, nor the Son, upon any Account, the Father,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is most immediately and directly to the Purpose, which I here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the whole for.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Divine Persons ought to be distinguished by that, which makes the least distinction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner <hi>Durandus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>That the first Instance of Plurality</hi> [or remove from U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity] <hi>ought to be the least. And therefore that the distinction of the Divine Persons, since it is the first, ought to be by distinct Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations compatible in the same Essence: Which for that cause, is a less distinction than any that can be made by Things Absolute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Lastly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> averrs pofitively, <hi>That the distinction of the Divine Persons ought to be the least that is Possible.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing all along, that it must still be <hi>Real,</hi> and not barely <hi>Nominal,</hi> or <hi>Imaginary.</hi> This was the Judgment of these
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:101779:159"/>
Learned Men; who as they were far from being <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> so they very well knew both what to assert and how to express themselves without giving any ground for their being thought so.</p>
            <p>From all which it follows, That for this very cause, that <hi>Modes of Subsistence</hi> import the least <hi>Real difference</hi> that can be, they are therefore the fittest to state the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> of the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> upon. So that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor here relapses into a fault which he has been guilty of more than once, <hi>viz.</hi> In alledging that as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against a Thing, which is indeed a most <hi>Effectual Reason for it.</hi> And so I come to his</p>
            <p>Third and Last Objection against our making these <hi>Modes of Subsistence</hi> the ground, or <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of the <hi>Distinction</hi> between the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> which is, <hi>That it makes the Three Divine Persons only Three Modes of the Deity, or only Modally distinguished;</hi> whereas (according to his Doctrine) there are no <hi>Modes in the Deity, and much less can a Mode be God.</hi> And that, <hi>As all must grant, that the Father is not a Mode of the Deity, but Essentially God; so no Man can think that the Father begot only a Modus, and called it his Son; whereas a Son signifies a Real Person of the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but distinct from the Father.</hi> Thus he discourses, <hi>pag.</hi> 83. 84. And is not this close and profound reasoning? But as profound as it is, if it be at all to his Purpose, his Argument must lie in this, That all the forementioned Absurdities unavoidably follow from deriving the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> of the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> from <hi>Three distinct Modes of Subsistence</hi> belonging to one and the same <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</hi> But this consequence I utterly deny, and to make out the Reason of this denial, I shall consider what he has said particularly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:101779:159"/>
And here, first of all, I would fain know, Whether this Man will never leave confounding things perfectly different, and taking them for the very same? For to affirm the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> to be only <hi>Three Modes</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> is one Thing; and to affirm them to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Modally distinguished,</hi> is quite another. The former we absolutely deny, and as positively hold the latter. And yet this wretched Fallacy would he impose upon his Reader all along, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Assertors of these <hi>Modes of Subsistence</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> make a <hi>Person</hi> to be only a <hi>Modus Subsistendi.</hi>

For we do not say, That a <hi>Person is only a Modus,</hi> but that it is the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> Subsisting under such a <hi>Modus,</hi> so that the <hi>Godhead</hi> is still included in it, joyned to it, and distinguished by it. This is what we affirm and abide by, and what sufficiently overthrows his pitiful Objection.</p>
            <p>And as for his Absurd Denial of all <hi>Modes</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> that has been throughly confuted already; so that we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to do, but to admire that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible and Glorious Ratiocination of his in these Words, <hi>p.</hi> 84. <hi>No Man</hi> (says he) <hi>can think that the Father begot only a Modus, and called it his Son.</hi> No, good Sir, No; none that I know of is in any danger of thinking or saying so; no more, than that <hi>Socrates</hi> begot only the Shape and Figure of a Man, and then called it his <hi>Son;</hi> or (to turn your own blunt Weapon upon your self) no more than <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> begot

another <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> besides his own, and called that his <hi>Son.</hi> Nevertheless I hope it will be granted me, That <hi>Socrates</hi> might beget <hi>one</hi> of such a Shape and Figure, and (by <note n="*" place="margin">Socrates's <hi>Incomparable</hi> Lady,</note> 
               <hi>Xantippe's</hi> and this Author's good leave) call that his <hi>Son;</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> might beget a <hi>Person</hi> endued with such a <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> (amongst other Attributes) and call that his <hi>Son</hi> too. But I perceive this Author and the <hi>Fallacy of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> are such fast Friends, that it is in vain to think of parting them.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as I told him what we do not hold concerning the <hi>Father</hi>'s Generation of the <hi>Son,</hi> so for his better Information I shall tell him, what the Assertors of these <hi>Modes of Subsistence</hi> do hold concerning it, <hi>viz.</hi> We do hold and affirm, That the <hi>Father</hi> Communicates his Nature under a different <hi>Mode of Subsisting,</hi> from what it has in himself, to another, and that such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of it, in such a peculiar way, is properly called his begetting of a <hi>Son.</hi> In which we do not say, <hi>That the Father begets a Modus,</hi> no nor yet an <hi>Essence, or Nature,</hi> but that he Communicates his own <hi>Essence,</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> under such a <hi>distinct Modus</hi> to another and by so doing begets a <hi>Person,</hi> which <hi>Person,</hi> is properly his <hi>Son.</hi> This, Sir, is the true Account of what the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the <hi>Personal Modes of Subsistence</hi> hold concerning the <hi>Eternal generation.</hi> And if you have any thing to except against it, produce your Exceptions, and they shall not fail of an Answer.</p>
            <p>I am now come to a close of this Chapter, and indeed of the whole Argument undertook by me against this Author. In which I have Asserted the commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Doctrine about this great Article of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> both from the <hi>Ancient Writers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and against this Author's particular Objections; and in both fully

shewn, That the <hi>Three Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity</hi> are one and the same <hi>undivided Essence, Nature,</hi> or <hi>Godhead,</hi> diversified only by <hi>Three distinct Modes of Subsistence,</hi> which are sometimes called <hi>Properties,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Relations. So that a Divine Person is formally and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Divine Nature, Essence, or Godhead with, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a distinct Mode, Property, or Relation.</hi> And this I averr to be the common, current, generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> concerning the <hi>Trinity.</hi> For <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> hold it, the <hi>School-men</hi> teach it, the Confessions of <hi>Churches</hi> (where they are any thing particular upon this Subject) declare it; and all <hi>Divines</hi> both <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Protestant,</hi> in the several Bodies of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity wrote by them, do Assert it; only this Author, who yet (forsooth) owns himself a <hi>Protestant</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> denies and explodes it. To whom therefore (if he were not too great in his own Eyes to be Counselled and Advised) I would give this Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piece of Counsel for once, <hi>viz. That for the future he would not presume at such a rate to contradict the whole World, till he has learn'd not to contradict himself.</hi>

1. And first concerning those of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Author says, <hi>That this Oneness between the Father and the Son, is such an Union, as there is nothing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture like it.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> in <hi>Iohn Ch.</hi> 17. (where this whole Passage is repeated twice) affirms something to <hi>be like it; viz.</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. where he prays to his <hi>Father, That they</hi> (viz. Believers) <hi>may be One, as We</hi> (viz. his <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Himself) are One:</hi> And again, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>That they may be One, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee.</hi> So that our <hi>Saviour</hi> expresly asserts a <hi>Likeness</hi> of something <hi>to this Union</hi> on the one side; and this Author as expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it on the other. In which (according to his blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, undistinguishing way) he confounds <hi>[Likeness]</hi> and <hi>[Sameness of kind]</hi> as all One; as shall presently be further shewn.</p>
               <p>In the next place, our <hi>Saviour</hi> (as plainly as Words can express a Thing) says, <hi>That he and his Father are One, by a Mutual In-being, or In-existence in one another.</hi> And this Man as expresly says, <hi>That there is no</hi> possible <hi>way for them to be one but by Mutual-Consciousness.</hi> But I on the contrary deny, That <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> is <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-Inexistence,</hi> or <hi>Mutual-Inexistence Mutual-Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> any more, than that <hi>Being,</hi> or <hi>Existence</hi> is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Consciousness,</hi> or <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and therefore if <hi>they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly be one, but by Mutual Consciousness,</hi> it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they are not so by <hi>Mutual-Inexistence;</hi> which yet our Saviour, in Words properly and naturally signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>Inexistence,</hi> affirms that they are.</p>
               <p>And the more intolerable is this Assertion in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, for that in <hi>Pag.</hi> 56. he affirms, that these Words of our Saviour <hi>ought to be understood properly;</hi> and if so, I hope they do not only exclude <hi>Metaphors,</hi> but all other <hi>Tropes</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> also; for <hi>[Proper]</hi> is not, adequate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposed to <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> but to <hi>Figurative,</hi> whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

And I do here affirm, That if our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s words be understood of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> they do not signifie <hi>properly,</hi> but <hi>figuratively;</hi> and the <hi>Figure</hi> is a <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> for the <hi>Adjunct;</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as in <hi>God, Being,</hi> or <hi>Inexistence</hi> are to be look'd upon as the <hi>Subject;</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and the like Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes as the <hi>Adjuncts.</hi> And therefore I do here tell this bold Man again, that for him to say as he does, that the forementioned words of our <hi>Saviour</hi> ought to be understood <hi>properly,</hi> and yet to interpret them to a sense not <hi>Proper,</hi> but <hi>Figurative</hi> (which, by interpreting them of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> he evidently does) is both an Absurdity and a Presumption, equally insuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But in the</p>
               <p>2d. Place I charge the forecited Passage of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor with the same Absurdity, for being as Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to his own words, as it was to those of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> For whereas he here says,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That this Oneness between the Father and the Son,</hi> expressed in those words, <hi>I am in the Father, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in me, can be no other kind of Union, than an Union by</hi> Mutual-consciousness. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That it is such an one, that there is nothing in Nature like it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I desire him to turn to <hi>Page</hi> 106. of his Book, where he tells us, <hi>That the Fathers use several Examples, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to several sorts of Union, thereby to form a Notion of the Unity of the Godhead in the Three Divine Persons.</hi> Let him, I say, read this, and tell me, Whether those <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and Allusions</hi> could be of any use <hi>to form a Notion of that Unity</hi> to which they bore no <hi>Resemblance</hi> at all? For I, for my part, ever thought, that there can be no Allusion of one thing to another without some similitude between them, and that a similitude is always on both
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:101779:163"/>
sides; it being not possible for <hi>Peter</hi> to be like <hi>Iohn,</hi> but <hi>Iohn</hi> must be like <hi>Peter</hi> too. And if this Man does not yet blush at such contradictory Assertions, let him turn a little farther to <hi>Page</hi> 126, 127. where he tell us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> explains this <hi>Unity</hi> by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness,</hi> and by several <hi>Similitudes</hi> (mark the words) of which the Unity of <hi>Understanding, Memory,</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> with the Soul of Man is alledged by him for <hi>One;</hi> and that a notable one too, for that <hi>these Faculties</hi> (as he there says) <hi>are mutually in one another;</hi> and the Example of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> in the same Mind, is alledged by him as another such a Simile, affirming them in like manner to <hi>be mutually in one another.</hi> Now, I say, after all this, ought not the Reader to stand amazed, when he reads the Man first affirming that the <hi>Unity</hi> between the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son mutually existing</hi> in one another by virtue of the <hi>Mutual-Consciousness between them has nothing like it in Nature, nor has any Example, Metaphor, or Similitude, besides it self to allude to;</hi> and yet afterwards producing several <hi>Similitudes, Allusions,</hi> and <hi>Metaphors</hi> out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> to explain both this <hi>In-being,</hi> and this <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> by? <hi>God</hi> give him a better Memory; for as these things represent him, no Man living (would he but impart his skill) could be so fit to teach the <hi>Art of Forgetfulness</hi> as himself.</p>
               <p>But after all, I must not omit to give the Reader no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of another of his Absurdities, though of a lower rate, <hi>viz.</hi> That all along <hi>Page</hi> 57. he takes a <hi>Pattern,</hi> or <hi>Example,</hi> and a <hi>Similitude,</hi> or <hi>Metaphor</hi> for Terms equivalent; whereas a <hi>Pattern,</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> imports a perfect entire Resemblance between it self and the thing of which it is the <hi>Pattern,</hi> and indeed approaches next to a <hi>Parallel Instance;</hi> while, on the other side, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:101779:163"/>
in any one respect, or degree, is sufficient to found a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> or <hi>Similitude</hi> upon. And therefore tho it may easily be granted this Author, That there is no <hi>Pattern,</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> of such an <hi>Union</hi> as is between the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son;</hi> yet that does not infer, that there is nothing in Nature that bears any similitude to it; since this may very well be without the other, as that place in <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 11. and 21. has already proved.</p>
               <p>And now I should here have finished my Remarks upon this particular Head, but that there is a certain Passage in order to his proving that there is nothing in Nature like <hi>the Unity between the Father and the Son,</hi> and it is this, <hi>That in Substantial Unions, that which</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, <hi>is greater than that which is</hi> comprehended: So that if Two Substances should be <hi>United</hi> by a <hi>Mutual-Comprehension</hi> of one another, the same would be both greater and lesser than the other, <hi>viz.</hi> greater as it <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended</hi> it, and less, as it was <hi>comprehended</hi> by it, <hi>P.</hi> 57. Now this Proposition I will neither note as Paradoxical, nor absolutely affirm to be <hi>false.</hi> But so much I will affirm, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is nothing at all to his Purpose; and that he can never prove it to be <hi>True.</hi> For besides, that he still confounds an <hi>Example,</hi> or <hi>Parallel Case</hi> with a <hi>Similitude,</hi> I would have him take notice,</p>
               <p>First, That this Maxim, <hi>Omne continens est majus contento,</hi> upon which he founds a Majority of the thing <hi>comprehending</hi> to the thing <hi>comprehended,</hi> is wholly drawn from, and founded upon the Observations made by the Mind of Man about <hi>Corporeal Substances,</hi> endued with Quantity and Dimensions; in which the <hi>Substance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending</hi> is, and must be of a greater Dimension than the <hi>Substance comprehended.</hi> But what is this to <hi>Spiritual Substances?</hi> Concerning which, I demand of this Author a solid Reason, Why Two such <hi>Substances</hi> may not be
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:101779:164"/>
intimately united by a <hi>Mutual-Permeation,</hi> or <hi>Penetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of one another? For all that can hinder such a <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration,</hi> or <hi>Permeation</hi> (as far as we know) is Quantity; which in <hi>Spiritual Substances</hi> has no place; and then, if such a <hi>Mutual-Penetration</hi> be admitted, these <hi>Substances</hi> will be <hi>mutually</hi> in one another, and <hi>United to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> not indeed by a <hi>Comprehension</hi> of one another, (of which there is no need, if such a thing could be) but by a <hi>Mutual-Adequation,</hi> or <hi>exact Coequation</hi> of one to the other; so that nothing of one <hi>Substance</hi> shall <hi>exist,</hi> or <hi>reach beyond,</hi> or without the other, but the whole of both by such a <hi>Permeation, mutually exist</hi> in each other. This, I say, I neither do, nor will affirm to be actually so, but I challenge this Author to prove that it <hi>cannot be so;</hi> and till he can, it may become him to be less confident.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>next place,</hi> I have one thing more to suggest to him about <hi>Substantial Unions,</hi> which he talks so much of, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Term is Ambiguous, and may signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie either,</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Union</hi> of two or more <hi>Substances</hi> together, and so the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> who are not <hi>two Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> but only <hi>two Persons</hi> (as has been shewn in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter) can never be <hi>substantially United.</hi> Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may signifie the <hi>Union</hi> of Two, or more <hi>Persons</hi> in one and the same <hi>Substance;</hi> which is truly and properly the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus, though there is no Instance in <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi> so <hi>united,</hi> yet by way of Allusion and Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the <hi>Union</hi> of the three fore-mentioned Faculties of <hi>Understanding, Memory</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> in <hi>one and the same Soul,</hi> (alledged by St. <hi>Austin)</hi> may pass for a small, or (as this Author himself calls it) <hi>Page 126. Line 28. A</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:101779:164"/>
                  <hi>faint Resemblance</hi> of the <hi>Union</hi> of the said <hi>Three Divine Persons in the same Nature, or Substance;</hi> which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his excellent Talent of <hi>Self-Contradiction,</hi> he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively denies here in <hi>Page</hi> 57. and as positively affirms in that other now pointed at. In fine, this Assertion, <hi>That the Father and the Son cannot possibly be One, or in One another</hi> (which is here the same) <hi>but by Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-Consciousness,</hi> Page 57. Line 23, 24, 25. unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably infers, and implies, That they are not <hi>One</hi> by <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>Substance, Unity of Essence,</hi> or <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> For I am sure neither <hi>Substance, Essence,</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> are <hi>Mutual-Consciousness.</hi> And if the <hi>Church</hi> will endure a Man asserting this, I can but deplore its Condition.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>If we seek for any other Essence, or Substance in God,</hi> (says this Author) <hi>but Infinite Wisdom, Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Essence of God, though considered but as one Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Person, is as perfectly unintelligible to us, as one Numerical Essence, or Substance of Three Persons in the Blessed Trinity,</hi> Page 69, 70.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This <hi>Proposition</hi> is False and Absurd, and to prove it so, I shall lay down these following Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>First, That it is certainly much easier for Humane Reason to conceive one and the same <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or <hi>Deity,</hi> as <hi>Subsisting</hi> in one <hi>single Person,</hi> than in <hi>Three distinct Persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>Essence, Substance, Wisdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> are in the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> (which is a pure simple <hi>Act)</hi> all but one and the same Thing, or <hi>Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That, notwithstanding this, <hi>Essence, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and Wisdom, Power and Goodness</hi> are formally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from one another. That is to say, The <hi>Conceptus Objectivus,</hi> or proper <hi>Essential Conception</hi> of one does not
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:101779:165"/>
imply, or involve in it the proper Conception of the other: Upon which Account one of them cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to be the other.</p>
               <p>Now these Three Things thus laid down, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted to this Man, <hi>That Essence, or Substance, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power and Goodness are really one and the same Being,</hi> and that therefore it is vain and foolish to seek for any <hi>Essence, or Substance in God, which is not also Wisdom, Power and Goodness.</hi> But this, by his favour, is not the point. For if he will nevertheless say, <hi>That the Divine Nature expressed by one Infinite Essence, or Substance Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in One Person, is as unintelligible, as the same Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Three distinct Persons;</hi> Nay, that One and the same <hi>Numerical Wisdom, Power and Goodness</hi> consider'd, as <hi>Subsisting</hi> only in one <hi>Person,</hi> is not more Intelligible than the same, as <hi>Subsisting</hi> under Three; This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly false, and contrary to common Experience, and without any further arguing the case, I appeal to the Reason of all Mankind, whether it be not so?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>PARADOX.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is Intellectual Love</hi> (says this Author) <hi>but the true Knowledge, or Estimation of Things? What is Iustice and Goodness but an equal Distribution of, or a true and wise Proportion of Rewards and Punishments? What is perfect Power, but perfect Truth and Wisdom which can do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it knows?</hi> Page 71, 72.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> We have here a whole Knot, or Cluster of <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> but I shall take them a sunder, and consider them severally: And because they run all in the way of <hi>Interrogations,</hi> I shall take them out of their <hi>Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Form,</hi> and cast them into so many <hi>Categorical Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The first of which is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Intellectual Love is nothing else but the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Estimation of Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:101779:165"/>
This is False and Absurd. For <hi>Love</hi> is one thing, and <hi>Knowledge</hi> another; each of them distinguished by <hi>essentially different Acts</hi> and <hi>Objects, Knowledge</hi> importing no more than a bare Speculation, or Apprehension of the <hi>Object;</hi> whereas <hi>Love</hi> is properly an Adhesion to it: <hi>Love essentially</hi> presupposes the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Thing <hi>Loved;</hi> but <hi>Knowledge</hi> cannot presuppose it self. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> is the first <hi>Act</hi> of an <hi>Intelligent Mind, Love</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. And I would fain know, Whether this Man of <hi>Paradox,</hi> will affirm, That <hi>God Loves</hi> every Thing which he has a <hi>true Knowledge and Estimation of?</hi> But to give him one Argument for all, Are not the Eternal distinguishing Characters of <hi>Two Persons</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Trinity</hi> founded in the distinction of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> issuing from the <hi>Father by way of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> issuing from both <hi>by way of Love?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place he affirms <hi>Iustice and Goodness to be the same thing, and to consist both of them in a true and wise Proportion of Rewards and Punishments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this also is false. These Two being as properly and formally distinguished by their <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Objects,</hi> as the Two former. And I do here tell this Author, That <hi>God's Goodness</hi> is the proper Qualification of his own Actions, without referring necessarily to any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides; but that his Justice bears an <hi>Essential Relation</hi> to the Actions of others, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>Rewardable,</hi> or <hi>Punisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And consequently <hi>God</hi> might have exerted innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable <hi>Acts</hi> of his <hi>Goodness,</hi> though there had never been any <hi>Object</hi> for him to have exerted so much as one <hi>Act</hi> of his <hi>Iustice</hi> upon. And to give him one Instance that may Convince any Man of Sense of the vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of these two Attributes; was that <hi>Act of Creation,</hi> by which <hi>God</hi> first Created the World, an <hi>Act</hi> of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice? Or did that <hi>Act</hi> consist in a <hi>Wise proportion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:101779:166"/>
                  <hi>and Punishments,</hi> before there was any <hi>Act</hi> of the Creature to be Rewarded, or Punished? But I am sure it was an <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Divine Goodness,</hi> whereby <hi>God</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated much of the Perfection of <hi>Being</hi> to something without himself. Again, is Pardon of Sin an <hi>Essential Act</hi> of <hi>God's Iustice?</hi> But I am sure it is an <hi>Act</hi> of his <hi>Goodness.</hi> Certainly this Man neither knows, nor cares what he says.</p>
               <p>His Third Assertion is, <hi>That perfect Power is nothing else, but perfect Truth and Wisdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this also is a gross <hi>Paradox,</hi> and as false, as that <hi>Omnipotence</hi> and <hi>Omniscience</hi> are not Two <hi>distinct Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> of <hi>God. God's Power</hi> acts by and under the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>God's Wisdom,</hi> and therefore neither is, nor can be <hi>formally</hi> the same with it. And besides this, all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> proceed from <hi>God</hi> by a Necessity of <hi>Nature,</hi> but the <hi>Acts</hi> and Exercise of his <hi>Power</hi> by a free determination of his <hi>Will.</hi> For in speaking of <hi>God,</hi> no Man says, That <hi>God is Wise, Knowing, or True, or Acts according to these Perfections, because he will do so;</hi> for he can neither be, nor <hi>Act</hi> otherwise; but we truly and properly say, That <hi>God does this or that, because he will do it;</hi> for if he had pleased, he might have chose, whether he would do it, or no. From all which, I conclude, That nothing could be more improperly and absurdly affirmed than, <hi>That the Divine Power is nothing else but the Divine Truth and Wisdom.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is so gross a <hi>Paradox,</hi> that, I think, it can need no other Confutation than to oppose the sense of all Mankind to it, nevertheless I shall offer this one Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration towards the disproving the Identity of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>Power, viz.</hi> That a Man's Knowledge and Skill about the doing any Work of Art, may increase, as his power of Execution for the Actual doing the said Works may decrease, nay, wholly cease, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot be the same. For suppose a Carpenter disabled by Age, or Accident, that he cannot strike a stroke towards the building an House; does he therefore cease to know how to build it, while another shall build it wholly by the direction of his Skill and Knowledge? This Man may as well prove his Head and his Hands to be one and the same Thing, as <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to be so. But I shall go no farther than this very Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to confute this Author's Assertion, who has told us in <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>l.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>That we understand nothing of the Secrets and Mysteries of Nature; nor are concerned to understand them, any more than it is our Business to understand how to make either a Body, or a Spirit, which we have</hi> no power <hi>to do,</hi> (mark that) <hi>if we</hi> did understand it, <hi>and therefore it would be an useless piece of Knowledge.</hi> Now I beseech the Reader to set these Two Assertions together, <hi>viz.</hi> that in <hi>pag.</hi> 72. <hi>That to know how to do a Thing is to be able to do it,</hi> and that other in the <hi>pag.</hi> 9. <hi>viz. That though we understood how to make a Body, or a Spirit, yet we have no power to do it.</hi> I say let these Two Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be compar'd; and then I hope that for the future, <hi>Knowledge how to do a thing,</hi> and <hi>Power to do it,</hi> ought not, even according to this very Author, to pass for the same thing. In the mean time we see how one of his Assertions contains a gross Absurdity, and the other compleats it with as gross a Contradiction.</p>

               <p>In reply to which, I am amazed to read an Assertion so manifestly false, and yet so positively uttered. For will this Author put out the Eyes of his Reader? He
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:101779:167"/>
tells us here that <hi>Athanasius</hi> (or whosoever else might be the Author of this Creed) <hi>does not herein speak of the Three Divine Persons as distinguish'd from one another.</hi> But I demand of him, does <hi>Athanasius</hi> here speak of them as of <hi>Three Persons,</hi> or no? If the first; then he does and must speak of them as <hi>distinguished</hi> from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, for that without such a Distinction they are not so much as <hi>Three.</hi> But if he does not speak of them <hi>as of Three,</hi> and as <hi>of Three thus distinguished.</hi> What then mean those Words of the Creed? <hi>There is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost?</hi> Do these Words speak of these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>as distinguished,</hi> or do they not? If they do; then what this Man has here said of the Creed, is shamelesly false; and if they do not express the said <hi>Persons as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,</hi> I defie all the Wit of Man to find out any Words that can.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This I have already shewn in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 137. to be both false and dangerous; as by direct consequence either making several sorts of <hi>Gods,</hi> or excluding both the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> from the one true <hi>Godhead.</hi> At present I shall only say thus much, That <hi>[the One only true God]</hi> and <hi>[the true God]</hi> are Terms perfectly equivalent, and not only Commensurate but Identical in their signification; and withal, That this very Author himself affirms <hi>Page</hi> 186. <hi>Line</hi> the last, <hi>That the Son must be included in the Character of the only True God;</hi> which how he can be, without having this Character properly affirmed and predicated of him, and his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining

thereby the Denomination of the <hi>only True God,</hi> let this Confident, Self-contradicting Man declare if he can.

                  <hi>I affirm</hi> (says he) <hi>that the Glory and Majesty and all the other perfections of the Three Divine Persons are as distinct as their Persons are.</hi> And again, <hi>These perfections are as distinct as the Persons, and yet as Numerically one and the same as the Godhead is,</hi> p. 91.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The first part of these Assertions is utterly inconsistent with, and wholly overthrows the last. And it is indeed very horrid, as by inevitable consequence inferring a Tritheisme. For if the <hi>essential</hi> Perfections of <hi>God</hi> (which in truth are only the <hi>Divine Essence</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der several Conceptions and Denominations) are as <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct as the Persons,</hi> whom the Church acknowledges to be <hi>really distinct,</hi> then it will and must follow, That in the <hi>Trinity</hi> there are <hi>Three really distinct Essences, or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,</hi> as well as <hi>Three really distinct Persons:</hi> And if they are thus distinct, it is impossible that the <hi>Three Persons</hi> should by virtue thereof, either be, or be truly said to be, really one; so that this Author, we see, has herein
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:101779:168"/>
asserted a <hi>Trinity</hi> with a Witness; but as for any <hi>Unity</hi> in it, you may go look.</p>
               <p>But I perceive he was driven to this false and absurd Assertion by that Argument of his <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversary urging him, That if the <hi>Essential</hi> Glory and Majesty in <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> be but One, then it cannot be said that their Glory is equal, their Majesty co-eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; forasmuch as <hi>Unity</hi> is not capable of <hi>Equality;</hi> which must of necessity be between two or more. This, I say, no doubt, drove him to this Inconvenience.</p>
               <p>In Answer to which Objection, (though I owe not this Author so much Service) as I shall readily grant, That where there is an <hi>Equality,</hi> there must be also a <hi>Plurality,</hi> of some sort or other, whatsoever it be: So I shall observe, That the <hi>Divine Essence, Glory, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> (which I still affirm to be but different Names of the same thing falling under divers Conceptions) and every other <hi>essential perfection</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> may be considered two ways.</p>
               <p>First, Absolutely and Abstractedly in it self, and as prescinding from all <hi>personal Determinations,</hi> in which sense the <hi>Divine Nature, Essence</hi> (and every <hi>Essential Attribute</hi> included in it) is, and always must be taken, whensoever, in Discourse, it is spoken of, either as <hi>compared with,</hi> or <hi>contra-distinguished to</hi> all, or any of the <hi>Persons.</hi> And accordingly, in this sense being <hi>absolutely One,</hi> it is incapable of any <hi>Relation of Equality.</hi> Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>one Thing</hi> considered but as <hi>One,</hi> cannot be said to be equal to it self. Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, This <hi>Glory, Majesty, or any other Essential perfection of the Godhead,</hi> may be considered as sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Three several Modes of Subsistence in Three distinct Persons;</hi> which said <hi>Modes,</hi> as they found a <hi>plurality in this Essential Glory, or Majesty,</hi> (though by no means <hi>of</hi>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:101779:169"/>
                  <hi>it)</hi> so this <hi>Plurality</hi> founds a Capacity of <hi>Equality;</hi> by virtue whereof, the same Glory according to its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar way of <hi>Subsisting</hi> in the <hi>Father,</hi> may be said to be equal to it self as <hi>Subsisting</hi> after another way in the <hi>Son,</hi> and after a third in the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> so that immediately and strictly this <hi>Equality</hi> is between the Three several <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Subsistence,</hi> which this <hi>Essential Glory,</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> sustains, or (if you will) belongs to the said <hi>Glory,</hi> for and by reason of them. And this is the true Answer to this <hi>Socinian Objection,</hi> which by a manifest Fallacy proceeds <hi>à dicto secundùm quid ad dictum simpliciter,</hi> viz. That because <hi>Equality</hi> cannot belong to the <hi>Essential Glory,</hi> or <hi>Majesty</hi> of the <hi>Godhead</hi> considered <hi>abstractedly</hi> from the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> therefore neither can it agree to the same <hi>Glory,</hi> or <hi>Majesty,</hi> upon any other Account whatsoever, which is utterly false; forasmuch as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered according to the <hi>Three different ways</hi> of its <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence</hi> in the <hi>Three Persons,</hi> it may, as <hi>Subsisting</hi> under any one of them be said to be equal to it self, as <hi>Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> under the other Two.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The second Absurdity is, That he owns a <hi>specifick Unity</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> in the <hi>Divine Persons</hi> (which sort of <hi>Unity</hi> I have abundantly proved in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> not to be capable of) for he says here of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons, That they are not</hi> merely <hi>United by a specifick Unity:</hi> which Words must imply, that however, so <hi>united</hi> they are.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here also is another knot of Absurdities. For, First, <hi>Knowledge, Self-reflection,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are not in Men <hi>distinct Powers and Faculties</hi> (as this unfledged Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher calls them) but only <hi>distinct Acts.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, Admitting that <hi>Knowledge</hi> were a <hi>Faculty</hi> (as it is not) yet I deny that <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Self-refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> would make Two <hi>distinct Faculties,</hi> forasmuch as it is one and the same <hi>Intellectual Faculty,</hi> which both exerts an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Reflection</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or upon it self as producing the said <hi>Act.</hi> For which Cause it is (as has been observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) that Philosophers hold that the <hi>Understanding</hi> is <hi>Facultas supra se Reflexiva;</hi> all of them allowing both

the <hi>direct</hi> and the <hi>reflex Acts</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> to issue from the same Faculty.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If this be a true and good Consequence, then the Ground and Reason of it must be This, <hi>That every distinct Act in God, is, and must be a distinct Person.</hi> And if so, then every Decree in <hi>God,</hi> whether it be his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Election,</hi> or of <hi>Reprobation</hi> (if there be such an one) or of creating the World, and sending <hi>Christ</hi> into it, and at last of destroying it, and the like, are each of them so many <hi>Persons.</hi> For every Divine Decree is an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and an <hi>Immanent Act too,</hi> as resting within him, and (as such) not passing forth to any Thing without Him; that Maxim of the <hi>Schools</hi> being most true, that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creta nihil ponunt in esse.</hi> Nor is this all, but most of the <hi>Divine Acts</hi> are free also; so that there was nothing in the Nature of them to hinder, but that they equally <hi>might,</hi> or <hi>might not</hi> have been; which applied to the <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> would make strange work in Divinity.

                  <hi>Nothing can make God visible but a personal Union to a visible Nature,</hi> Page 234. Line 22, 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This is a most false Assertion, and directly contrary to Scripture. And to prove it so, I shall lay down these Four Conclusions.</p>
               <p>First, That the <hi>Godhead,</hi> or <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> neither is nor can be visible to a Corporeal Eye, by an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate sight, or Intuition of the <hi>Godhead</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>God</hi> is visible to such an Eye only by the special Signs, or Symbols of his Presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:101779:172"/>
Thirdly, That <hi>God</hi> is visible by a Body personally united to him, only as the said Body is such a Sign, or Symbol of his peculiar Presence. And</p>
               <p>Fourthly and Lastly, That a Body actually assumed by <hi>God</hi> for a Time, is during that Time as true, and visible a Symbol of his Presence, as a <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>Nature personally united</hi> to him can be.</p>
               <p>And thus it was, that <hi>God</hi> appeared visibly to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi> in Old Time, and particularly to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Gideon,</hi> and to the Father and Mother of <hi>Sampson,</hi> who thereupon thought <hi>that they should Die for having seen God Face to Face.</hi> For generally all Interpreters hold the <hi>Person</hi> who thus appeared, to have been the <hi>Second Person</hi> of the <hi>blessed Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Eternal Son</hi> of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> though sometimes called simply the <hi>Angel,</hi> and sometimes <hi>the Angel of the Covenant,</hi> from the Office he was then actually imployed in by his Father, as the extraordinary Messenger and Reporter of his Mind to holy Men upon some great Occasions.</p>
               <p>This supposed, I desire this bold Author to tell me, Whether the <hi>second Person</hi> of the <hi>Trinity (God</hi> equal with the <hi>Father)</hi> was <hi>personally united</hi> to the <hi>Body,</hi> which he then appeared in, or not? If not; then the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Assertion, <hi>That nothing can make God visible, but a personal Union to a visible Nature,</hi> falls shamefully to the Ground, as utterly false. But if he was <hi>person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally united to it,</hi> then these <hi>Paradoxes</hi> must follow,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he either laid down that <hi>assumed Body</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or he did not: if he did, then an <hi>Hypostatical Union</hi> with <hi>God</hi> may be dissolv'd; and not only so, but there may be also a thousand <hi>personal Unions</hi> one after another, (if <hi>God</hi> shall think fit to assume a Body, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in it so often;) which would be contrary to the <hi>sense</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:101779:173"/>
of all Divines, and to all Principles of sound Divinity, which own but one <hi>hypostatical Union</hi> and no more. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. He still retains an <hi>Union</hi> to that <hi>assumed Body,</hi> and then there is a double <hi>hypostatical Union,</hi> viz. One to the <hi>visible Body</hi> assumed by him, in which he appeared of old, and the other to that <hi>Body</hi> which he was Born with in the World. All which <hi>Positions</hi> are horrid and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, but unavoidably consequent from the foregoing Assertion. But for the further Illustration of the Case I do here affirm to this Author, That <hi>God</hi> is as visible in an <hi>assumed Body,</hi> whether of Air, or Aether, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever other Materials it might be formed of, as in a Body of Flesh and Blood <hi>personally united</hi> to him: I say, as <hi>visible.</hi> For notwithstanding the great difference of these <hi>Bodies,</hi> and the difference of their <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> One being by a <hi>temporary Assumption,</hi> and the other by a <hi>personal Incarnation;</hi> yet no Corporeal Eye could discern this Difference, during the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but that one was, for the time, as visible as the other; and therefore since both of them were truly Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols of <hi>God</hi>'s peculiar Presence (the only way by which the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> becomes visible to a Mortal Eye) it demonstratively overthrows that positive, false Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Author, <hi>That nothing can make God visible, but a personal Union to a visible Nature.</hi>

                  <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of Man's Redemption by the Merits of <hi>Christ.</hi> For that which leaves no place for <hi>Choice,</hi> leaves no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility for <hi>Merit.</hi> For all Merit is founded in <hi>freedom of Action,</hi> and that in <hi>Choice.</hi> And if <hi>Christ,</hi> after his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> had not this, he could not <hi>Merit.</hi> And whereas the Author says, <hi>That Christ chose all this as the second Person of the Trinity antecedently to his Incarnation.</hi> I Answer, That this is indeed true, but reaches not the present Case. For what he did before he was Incarnate, was the <hi>Act</hi> of him purely <hi>as God;</hi> but a <hi>meritorious Action</hi> must still be an <hi>humane Action;</hi> which could not proceed from the <hi>second Person</hi> before his Assumption of an <hi>humane Nature.</hi> I readily grant and hold, That the Actions of <hi>Christ's humane Nature</hi> received a peculiar Worth and Value from its <hi>Union</hi> with his <hi>Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> yet still I affirm, that this Worth and Value was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and inherent in his <hi>humane Actions,</hi> as such; and thereby qualified them with so high a degree of <hi>Merit.</hi> So that, whencesoever this <hi>Merit</hi> might flow, they were only his <hi>humane Actions, viz.</hi> such as proceeded from him as a Man, that were properly and formally me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious.</p>
               <p>And whereas this Author states the Reason of this his horrid Assertion upon the Predictions of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>peremptory Decrees of God</hi> concerning all that belonged to, or befell <hi>Christ,</hi> I do here tell him, That neither <hi>Predictions</hi> nor <hi>Decrees,</hi> though never so pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and peremptory, do, or can infringe, or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the freedom of Man's Choice, or Election about the things so decreed, or foretold; how difficult soever it may be for <hi>humane Reason</hi> to reconcile them; and if this Man will affirm the contrary, he must either ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all <hi>Choice</hi> and <hi>Freedom of Action,</hi> or all certain <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> and <hi>peremptory Decrees</hi> out of the World; let

him choose which of these two Rocks he will run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against, for he will be assuredly split upon either.

               <p>Concerning <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Personality</hi> he has these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Assertions, which I have here drawn together from several parts of his <hi>Book,</hi> viz. <hi>The Mind is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> Page 191. Line 21, 22. <hi>A Soul without a Vital Union to a Body, is a Person,</hi> Page 262. Line 17. <hi>And the Soul is the Person, because it is the Superiour governing power, and Constitutes the Person,</hi> Page 268. Line 28. <hi>A Beast which has no Reasonable Soul, but only an Animal Life, is a Person,</hi> &amp;c. Page 262. Line 18, 19, 20. And again, <hi>We may find the Reasonable and Animal Life subsisting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and when they do so, they are Two [Persons] and but One [Person] when United,</hi> Page the same, at the end of it. And lastly, <hi>One Agent is One Person,</hi> Page 268. Line 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> In all these <hi>Propositions,</hi> so confidently laid down by this Man, there are almost as many Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Falsities as there are Words. I have already shewn this of some of them in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. and therefore I shall be the briefer in my Remarks upon them here.</p>
               <p>And first for that Assertion, <hi>That the Mind is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> To this I Answer, That the Mind may be taken Two ways.</p>
               <p>First, Either for that <hi>Intellectual Power,</hi> or <hi>Faculty,</hi> by which the Soul understands and Reasons. Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the <hi>Rational Soul</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>In the former Sense, it is but an Accident, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly a Quality: In the second it is an <hi>Essential</hi> part of the whole Man; and therefore upon neither of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:101779:174"/>
these Accounts can be a <hi>Person.</hi> For neither an <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> nor a <hi>Part</hi> can be a <hi>Person;</hi> which (as such) must be both a <hi>Substance,</hi> and a <hi>compleat Substance</hi> too.</p>
               <p>And secondly, Whereas, he says, <hi>That a Soul without a vital Union to the Body is a Person;</hi> I tell him, That the <hi>Soul</hi> without such an <hi>Union,</hi> is still an <hi>incomplete Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> as being originally and naturally designed for the <hi>Completion</hi> and <hi>Composition</hi> of the whole Man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for that reason, cannot be a <hi>Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then Thirdly, whereas he adds, <hi>That the Soul is the Person, because it is the Superiour governing Power, and Constitutes the Person.</hi> I answer, That it is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and does the latter, only as it is the <hi>prime essential part</hi> of the whole Man; and for that very cause is an <hi>incomplete Being,</hi> (as every <hi>part</hi> is and must be) and consequently cannot be a <hi>Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, for an Answer to his saying, <hi>That a Beast is a Person.</hi> I refer him to his own positive Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, pag. 69. line 18. <hi>That a Person, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Substance, are reciprocal Terms:</hi> And the same may serve for an Answer to his next Absurdity, <hi>That when the Reasonable and the Animal Life subsist apart, they are Two Persons.</hi> For the <hi>Animal Life</hi> separate from the <hi>Rational,</hi> is void of all Reason, and the very Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a <hi>Person</hi> is, That it is <hi>Suppositum Rationale, aut Intelligens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the last place, By his saying, <hi>That One Agent is One Person,</hi> (which, I am sure, he affirms universally of every single Agent) he makes every Living Creature under Heaven, a <hi>Person:</hi> For every such Creature is endued with a Principle of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Action,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly acts by it, and by so acting, is properly an <hi>Agent:</hi> From all which it follows, That this Author (as great as his Retinue may be) has many more Persons in his
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:101779:175"/>
Family, than he is aware of; there being not so much as a Rat or a Mouse within the Walls of his <hi>Deanry,</hi> but, according to this Assertion of his, is as truly and properly a <hi>Person</hi> as himself. So that although he <hi>sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> (as he says) <hi>makes Visits,</hi> yet he is sure never to want Company.</p>

               <p>He asserts, <hi>That every Man has two distinct Reasons, and two distinct Wills, and those as distinct as if he had two Souls,</hi> Page 267. Line 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This Assertion, and the Absurdity of it are perfectly his own. For certainly Two <hi>Reasons</hi> and Two <hi>Wills,</hi> and those as distinct in each Man, as if he had <hi>Two distinct Souls,</hi> were never asserted to be in any One [meer] Man, by any Person of Sense and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before: It has indeed been disputed by Philosophers, <hi>Whether there be Three Souls in the same Man,</hi> viz. <hi>A Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, a Sensitive, and a Vegetative?</hi> And it has been generally concluded in the Negative, and that the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Intellectivus, Sensitivus, &amp; Vegetativus</hi> were only <hi>Three distinct Powers,</hi> or <hi>Faculties</hi> lodged in one and the same Soul: But as for <hi>Two distinct Reasons</hi> and <hi>Two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Wills</hi> in one Soul, none that I ever met with, affirmed it. And in Answer to it, it were enough to overwhelm the Asserter of it with the universal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Philosophers holding the contrary, <hi>viz. That in each individual Person there is only One indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual</hi> Reason <hi>and</hi> Will, <hi>and no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I shall discourse the Matter a little further with this Author; though yet as briefly as I can.</p>
               <p>And first of all, I lay down this as certainly true, <hi>That if one single</hi> Reason, <hi>and one single</hi> Will <hi>are sufficient to give an Account of all the</hi> Acts, Offices, <hi>and</hi> Operations <hi>belonging to the Nature of Man, then it is superfluous, and</hi>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:101779:175"/>
                  <hi>consequently absurd to assert any more.</hi> But the former is undoubtedly true. And to shew that it is so, we are to consider what human Reason, and the Offices of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly are; and so for the human Will, and the proper Acts and Functions of that. Now they are both of them <hi>Intellectual Faculties,</hi> and thereby distinguish'd from, and Superiour to all Acts of <hi>Sensation,</hi> whether External, or Internal, and all Acts of <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Appetition,</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the sensitive Appetite. And as they are supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to them, so it is the proper Office of <hi>Reason</hi> to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrate upon, Judge of, and Direct all the Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Reports of the Senses, and upon such a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment passed upon them, to declare authoritatively, <hi>What ought, or ought not to be done;</hi> and in the like manner the <hi>Will</hi> is to govern and control all the <hi>Inferiour Appetites, Desires,</hi> and <hi>Inclinations,</hi> by an effectual disposal of them, to <hi>what shall, or shall not be done.</hi> And this is the Order and Oeconomy of all the <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Sensitive Powers</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> of the <hi>Soul of Man,</hi> and of the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> respectively belonging to them. And now I desire any one to shew me, what use there is of a <hi>Second Reason,</hi> and a <hi>Second Will,</hi> and what are those particular, proper <hi>Acts</hi> proceeding from them, which are neither <hi>Intellectual,</hi> nor <hi>Sensitive.</hi> For if they are either of these, all such <hi>Acts</hi> have been fully accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for, from the <hi>Intellectual</hi> and <hi>Sensitive Principles</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, and therefore must needs be superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Again, I would know, whether these Two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are <hi>Subordinate,</hi> so that one is subject to and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the other, or <hi>Co-ordinate</hi> and <hi>Equal,</hi> and neither of them subject to, or governed by the other? If they are <hi>Subordinate,</hi> the Inferiour is useless, since the <hi>Acts</hi> proceeding from both, being equally <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> the Superiour can and may dictate all that the Inferiour can
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:101779:176"/>
suggest immediately by it self, and without the <hi>Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Operation</hi> of the other; and what I have said of an <hi>Human Reason,</hi> will proportionably hold in an <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Will:</hi> But if, on the other side, there are <hi>Two Co-ordinate Reasons,</hi> and <hi>Two Co-ordinate Wills,</hi> neither of them subject to, or governed by the other, then, in the Direction and Disposal of Mens Actions, they either sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the very same Directions and Commands, or such as are quite different, and sometimes perhaps contrary. If the very same, then <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Wills</hi> are again superfluous: For what need can there be of <hi>two</hi> to suggest the very same things? But if these <hi>two Reasons</hi> suggest different, or contrary Directions, and these <hi>two Wills</hi> exert <hi>two</hi> different, or contrary <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences</hi> upon the Inferiour and sensitive part, then the Soul must be distracted between both, and not able to proceed determinately to Action; but the <hi>two Reasons</hi> must dispute the Matter, and the <hi>two Wills</hi> must fight it out. And this will be the admirable Harmony and State of an <hi>Human Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be here Objected, That we sometimes find men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Scripture</hi> of a <hi>sensual,</hi> or <hi>carnal Reason,</hi> and of a <hi>sensual Will:</hi> and that therefore <hi>two Reasons,</hi> and <hi>two Wills</hi> must be admitted in each Man.</p>
               <p>I Answer, That we read in <hi>Scripture</hi> of the <hi>Old Man</hi> and the <hi>New Man,</hi> in <hi>Persons Regenerate,</hi> and yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not from hence infer, That <hi>two distinct Men</hi> do, or can subsist in <hi>one Person.</hi> And therefore as to that Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>carnal, sensual Will and Reason,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Answer, That <hi>Reason</hi> is call'd <hi>Sensual,</hi> when it directs and prescribes according to the Exorbitant Inclinations and Desires of the <hi>sensitive part;</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> is called so likewise, when it does not interpose its Sway and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but suffers the <hi>sensitive Appetites</hi> to take their
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:101779:176"/>
own course without control: So that this Term <hi>Sensual,</hi> or <hi>Carnal</hi> applied either to <hi>Reason,</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> does not import, or infer another <hi>Reason,</hi> or another <hi>Will,</hi> but the same <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> under different, and sometimes contrary <hi>Qualifications,</hi> and otherwise acting and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themselves, than, according to their natural Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and Office in the Soul, they ought to do. It is indeed a division <hi>Subjecti in Accidentia.</hi> And this is all that can be drawn from thence.</p>
               <p>In fine, I think a stranger and a sillier Paradox could not well be advanced; and it is great pity but the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of it should be Known by this <hi>Glorious Character,</hi> That this is that great <hi>Philosopher</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms and holds, <hi>That there are Three distinct Infinite Minds in One God: And Two distinct Reasons, and Two distinct Wills in one and the same Man.</hi> And long may he live to have the Fame of such Assertions ringing in both his Ears; and when he is dead, I doubt not but he will be remembred by them, though they be never writ upon his Tomb: For certainly he who affirms <hi>Two Reasons</hi> in the same Man, hardly Discourses at the rate of <hi>One.</hi>

But now, the <hi>Will</hi> does not thus <hi>Act</hi> upon the <hi>Body,</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> having no Principle whereby to know, or understand what it Commands. And therefore, when we say, That the <hi>Will Commands the Body,</hi> in strictness of Truth, it is only a Metaphorical Expression. For the <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi> exerting an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Volition,</hi> moves the <hi>Body,</hi> not by <hi>Command,</hi> but by <hi>Physical Impulse:</hi> That is to say, It does by its <hi>native Force, Energy,</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> first move and impell the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Mediation of them so moved and impelled, it moves and impells the <hi>Body;</hi> and this, by as real an Impulse, as when I push, or thrust a thing with my hand. For though indeed a <hi>material</hi> Thing cannot act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively, or efficiently move, or work upon an <hi>Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> yet <hi>Philosophers</hi> grant that an <hi>Immaterial</hi> (as being of the nobler and more active Nature) can move, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, or work upon a <hi>Material;</hi> and if we cannot form in our Minds an Idea of the Mechanism of this Motion, it is because neither can we form in our Minds an Idea of a <hi>Spirit:</hi> But nevertheless Reason and Discourse will Evince, That the Thing must be so.</p>

               <p>He tells us, <hi>That the Human Nature of Christ</hi> may be Ignorant <hi>of some things, notwithstanding its personal Union to the Divine Word; because it is an</hi> Inferiour and Subject <hi>Nature,</hi> Page 270. Line 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> These Words also are both absurd and false. And</p>
               <p>First, They are Absurd, because no Rules of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Arguing, permit us to say of any Thing, or
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:101779:177"/>
Person, <hi>That it may be so, or so;</hi> when <hi>necessarily</hi> it is, and must be so. For the Term <hi>[may]</hi> imports an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,</hi> or at least, a <hi>possibility</hi> to both sides of the Contradiction: So that when a Man says, That a Thing <hi>[may be thus, or thus]</hi> he does by consequence say also, <hi>[That it may not be thus, or thus.]</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to say, <hi>That the Human Nature of Christ, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing its personal Union to the Word,</hi> may be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>of some Things,</hi> when it cannot but be ignorant of <hi>some;</hi> nay, of very many Things, is Absurd.</p>
               <p>And in the next place also, <hi>To make the Subjection of the Human Nature to the Divine, the proper Cause of this Ignorance is false, and the Assignation of a</hi> non causa pro causâ: It being all one, as if I should say, <hi>That such an one cannot be a good Disputant, because he has a blemish in his Eye.</hi> For it is not this <hi>Subjection</hi> of it to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> that makes it ignorant of many Things known by that <hi>Nature;</hi> but the vast disparity that is between these <hi>Two Natures, viz.</hi> That one of them is <hi>Infinite,</hi> the other <hi>Finite,</hi> which makes it impossible for the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> to <hi>communicate</hi> its whole <hi>Knowledge</hi> to the <hi>Finite.</hi> Forasmuch as such a <hi>Knowledge</hi> exceeds its <hi>Capacity,</hi> and cannot be received into it, so as to exist, or abide in it, any more than <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> or <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> or any other <hi>Infinite Divine Perfection</hi> can be lodged in a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And besides this, this very <hi>Author,</hi> in the immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foregoing Page, had not only allowed but affirmed, <hi>That the Body</hi> (which certainly is both united to the <hi>Soul,</hi> and of a <hi>Nature Subject</hi> and <hi>Inferiour to it)</hi> was yet <hi>conscious to the Dictates and Commands of the Soul.</hi> Wherefore where <hi>Two Natures</hi> are <hi>united,</hi> the bare <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> of one to the other, is not the proper Cause, that the <hi>Nature</hi> which is <hi>Subject,</hi> is ignorant of what is
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:101779:178"/>
known by the <hi>Nature</hi> which it is <hi>subject to.</hi> For if <hi>Subjection</hi> were the sole and proper Cause of this Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the <hi>Inferiour Nature</hi> would be equally ignorant of every Thing known by the <hi>Superiour;</hi> which yet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Man's own Doctrine of the <hi>Consciousness of the Body to the Soul,</hi> is not so. This Consideration I alledge only as an Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, by the former Argument, sufficiently proved the falseness of his Assertion.</p>
               <p>But I shall detain my Reader no longer upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; though I must assure him, that I have given him but a <hi>Modicum,</hi> and (as it were) an handful or two out of that full heap which I had before me; and from which I had actually collected several more Particulars, which I have not here presented him with, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to swell my Work to too great a Bulk. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless I look upon this Head of Discourse, as so very useful to place this <hi>Author</hi> in a true Light, that if I might be so bold with my <hi>Reader,</hi> I could wish, that he would vouchsafe this Chapter (of all the rest) a second Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal; upon which I dare undertake, that it will leave in him such Impressions concerning this Man's fitness to Write about the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as will not wear out of his Mind in haste. And yet after all this, I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to derogate from this <hi>Author</hi>'s Abilities, how inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently soever he has trampled upon other Mens; but content my self, that I have fairly laid that before the <hi>Reader,</hi> by which he may take a just, and true measure of them. And so I shall conclude this Chapter with an Observation, which I have, upon several occasions, had cause to make, <hi>viz. That</hi> Divinity <hi>and</hi> Philosophy <hi>are certainly the worst Things in the World, for any One to be</hi> Magisterial <hi>in, who does not understand them.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>In which the Author's <hi>Grammatical,</hi> (and such like) Mistakes, as they are found here, and there in his Writings, are set down, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked upon.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>COuld this Author have carried himself with any or dinary degree of Candor and Civility towards those, whom he wrote against, he had never had the least Trouble given him by me upon this Head of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. But when I find him treating Learned Men with so much Disdain and Insolence, and much liker a rough, ill-bred <hi>School-Master</hi> domineering over his Boys, than a fair <hi>Opponent</hi> entring the Lists with an <hi>Ingenuous Antagonist,</hi> I must confess, I cannot think my self obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to treat him upon such Terms, as I would an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary of a contrary Temper and Behaviour. One Man (and a very Learned one too) he flirts at, as if he could not distinguish between <hi>Conjunctive</hi> and <hi>Disjunctive</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; Vindication of his Case of Allegiance, <hi>pag.</hi> 76. the Two last Lines. Another he <hi>Scoffs,</hi> or rather <hi>Spits</hi> at, as neither <hi>understanding Greek nor Latine.</hi> Vindic. Trin. <hi>Pag.</hi> 95. <hi>Line</hi> 25. and thereby, I suppose, would bear himself to the World as no small Critick in both. As for the <hi>Socinians</hi> (of which number this latter is) I do from my Heart Condemn their Opinions, as false, and destructive, not only of the <hi>Christian,</hi> but (in several
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:101779:179"/>
Instances) even of <hi>Natural Theology</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> it self. Nevertheless I do not find, that these Men use to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached <hi>for want of</hi> Greek, <hi>or</hi> Latine, or for any Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Defect of Parts, either Natural, or Acquired. <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus Socinus</hi> was a Person undoubtedly of great Wit and Strength of Mind, and of Competent, though not very deep Learning; but his Uncle <hi>Laelius Socinus</hi> before him, and <hi>Crellius</hi> who lived some time after him, were Persons very well stocked with both; and so have been many more (indeed too many) besides these. And where the Case stands thus, I think, what the <hi>Poet</hi> said of <hi>Probity</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> may very well be said of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> also, viz. <hi>That it is Commendable even in</hi> an <hi>Enemy,</hi> how much soever we may blame him for the ill use of it. But this Author spares neither Friend nor Foe, but comes like a kind of Hurricano upon his Adversary, not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safing him so much as one grain of Allowance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he finds (or rather thinks he finds) him Trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. And therefore, let him not, of all Men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that he is hardly dealt with, <hi>if with the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, with which he has hitherto meted to others, it be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured to him again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, I shall in this Chapter proceed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his <hi>Grammatical, Vocabular</hi> Mistakes. And that I may do this justly, and without the least shadow of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair dealing, I will first set down the Table he gives us of the <hi>Typographical Errata,</hi> in the first Edition of his Book; that so we may distinguish, what ought to be laid at the <hi>Printer</hi>'s Door, and what at the <hi>Author</hi>'s.</p>

            <p>This is a true and exact Transcript of the Table of the <hi>Errata</hi> prefixed to that <hi>Book.</hi> (Whether the said Table be True, or no) concerning which, I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, That most of these <hi>Errata</hi> are much more easily Corrigible by an Ordinary Reader (without any Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition) than those that I shall mention, and remark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And I shall add further, That, had he but said <hi>[That these and the like Errata the Reader is desired to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect as he shall meet with them]</hi> he should have heard of none of them from me; though I am pretty well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and so will any <hi>Judicious Reader</hi> be too, that as none of them in any probability are, so some of them (as they stand here placed in this Book) neither are, nor could be any one's but his own. But since he has laid in no such <hi>Salvo,</hi> and this stands as a full Account of the <hi>Errata;</hi> and not only so, but since in the Second Edition some Faults not mentioned in this Table, are Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while others remain the same, or as bad, as in the First Edition, there is all the Reason in the World, that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:101779:180"/>
the Author should be charged with that, from which he himself has thus discharged the <hi>Printer.</hi> And besides, in the Second Edition of his Book, the Reader is desired to take Notice, that there is no Table of <hi>Errata</hi> at all; by which we may justly conclude, That he reckoned it so <hi>Correct,</hi> as to need no further <hi>Correction.</hi> So that what I find there, I judge my self, to have all the right that can be, to Account with him for.</p>
            <p>And the rather, for that Ten Years ago he publickly <note place="margin">A Letter to <hi>Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, p.</hi> 1. Printed 1683.</note> declared in Print, <hi>That he was resolved in what he should publish for the future, to Correct the Press himself;</hi> though, on my Conscience, it was one of the unfittest Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (next to the <hi>Writing of Vindications)</hi> that he could take to; as, I doubt not, but this Chapter will pretty well shew.</p>
            <p>Now the Words, which I intend to Remark upon, shall be of these Two sorts.</p>
            <p>First, Such as may be considered singly in themselves. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, Such as must be considered in Conjunction with other Words, in Sentences and Forms of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Of the first sort the Reader may please to take notice of these that follow.</p>
            <p>As in <hi>Page</hi> 16. <hi>Line</hi> 23. I find an extraordinary word called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: The meaning of which I would gladly know: For I can no more find it in any <hi>Lexicon,</hi> than I can in the Table of the <hi>Errata:</hi> And yet certainly it must be some excellent Word, as having stood its ground in both Editions of his Book. I confess I have been apt to think it stands for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; but why it should do so, the Author (who, no doubt, is a <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> in his Heart) may possibly give us a good Reason; but I, for my part, cannot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:101779:180"/>
Such another Word we have cloathed indeed in <hi>Greek</hi> Characters, but, by no means, of <hi>Greek</hi> Extraction; and that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Pag.</hi> 115. <hi>Line</hi> 11. I have read, I confess, of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, signifying <hi>innomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> or <hi>quod nominari non potest;</hi> and I do not deny but that I find <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> also; and that not only in the place here cited out of <hi>Greg. Nyssen,</hi> but twice also in St. <hi>Basil</hi>'s <hi>Hexaemeron</hi> (from whence I quoted it so written, <hi>Ch.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 192.) But I very much question, Whether the Word be so wrote in other and Ancienter Copies of those <hi>Father</hi>'s Works; and that for these Two Reasons.</p>
            <p>First, Because it must be derived from the <hi>Preterperfect Tense</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and if so, then according to the Rule of <hi>Grammar</hi> in such <hi>Verbal Derivatives,</hi> the Augment must be thrown away, and the Original Letter retained; as in <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be admitted, it must be by the <hi>Attick Dialect;</hi> which very often (especially in Compounds) puts an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and several other like Words.</p>
            <p>But my Second <hi>Reason,</hi> why I think the Ancienter Editions of St. <hi>Basil</hi> have it <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> with an <hi>Omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cron,</hi> is, because I find those <hi>Lexicographers</hi> who write it so, quote this Word out of that very place of St. <hi>Basil</hi>'s <hi>Hexaemeron,</hi> where now it stands wrote <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which surely proves that they found it not there so wrote then, when they quoted it from thence. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that it may be so wrote, <hi>viz.</hi> with an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as well as with an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, yet what does, or can this make for our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's <note place="margin">Tusanue. Constantine Stephanus.</note> new-coined <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> so, I think the Author would do well to take notice, that there is a great difference between <hi>Anti-Nicene</hi> and <hi>Ante-Nicene,</hi> between such as lived <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Council,</hi> and such as were <hi>against</hi> it. And the more particular and exact notice ought he to take of it here, since (tho' the difference be only in an <hi>Iota)</hi> he yet knows what a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance this little Letter made in the <hi>Homoousian</hi> and <hi>Homoiousian</hi> Controversie, even so great as to occasion the Convening of this Famous <hi>Council.</hi> Nevertheless, that this word <hi>Anti-Nicene</hi> passed for good and current with this Author, is evident from hence, that it is (as well as some others) free of both Editions of this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Book.</p>
            <p>Again in <hi>Page</hi> 105. <hi>Line</hi> 8. we are told of the <hi>Favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> of some Opinions. As to which, I had thought, that Men use to favour and countenance Opinions, and not to be countenanced and favoured by them. And yet the Word <hi>Favourite</hi> signifies <hi>passively,</hi> and so must be taken for one who <hi>receives favour,</hi> and not <hi>actively</hi> for one who <hi>shews it.</hi> And therefore if to represent any one as the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:101779:181"/>
               <hi>Favourite of an Opinion</hi> be not good sence, I know no way, but by striking it out, and putting <hi>Favourer</hi> in the room of it, to make it better.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 106. <hi>Line</hi> 16. I read <hi>Intension</hi> used in the same sence with <hi>Intention,</hi> or <hi>Purpose;</hi> and I must declare, that I never found it so used before.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Page</hi> 108. <hi>Line</hi> 31. I am told of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran;</hi> and I wondered a good while, what <hi>Council</hi> it should be; for though I had heard of <hi>several</hi> Lateran <hi>Councils,</hi> yet I never heard of the <hi>Council of</hi> Lateran, till I met with it here.</p>
            <p>Likewise I find an Extraordinary Person in <hi>Page</hi> 43. <hi>Line</hi> 1. named <hi>Lucifer Carolitanus,</hi> and was thereupon in some thoughts with my self, whether there might have been any place called in former times <hi>Carolina,</hi> or by some Name like it. But then out comes the Second Edition and alters it into <hi>Caralitanus;</hi> which (in my poor Opiniou) looks very suspiciously, as if some Body had a mind to Correct it, but knew not how. As for <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> so called from <hi>Calaris,</hi> now <hi>Cagliari,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> I have heard much of him; but I will suppose our Author had some Body else in his Eye. And upon this occasion, I cannot but take notice of some other <hi>Writers</hi> quoted by him, whom the World seems as much unacquainted with, as with this <hi>Carolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> As for instance St. <hi>Hillary</hi> in his <hi>Apol. P.</hi> 15. at the latter end. And <hi>Albaspinus</hi> in his Defence of Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet, Pag.</hi> 165. <hi>Line</hi> 22. And <hi>Nonn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> in his <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, Page</hi> 218. Now St. <hi>Hilary</hi> indeed; a Famous Father of the Church, and Bishop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and <hi>Albaspinaeus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> Eminent for his Learned Works, and <hi>Nonnus</hi> who Wrote a Paraphrase upon St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel, in <hi>Greek</hi> Verse, are every one of them known and celebrated by all. But as for St. <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,</hi>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:101779:182"/>
               <hi>Albaspinus</hi> and <hi>Nonnas,</hi> I never heard of them till this Author was pleased to bless the World with these New Names.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Erronious</hi> instead of <hi>Erroneous,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> instead of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they are small things, and ought to make no difference amongst Friends, though I have known many a poor <hi>School-boy</hi> forced to <hi>Water his Plants</hi> for a less Mistake.</p>
            <p>But there is a Word of singular note, which I have met with at least six or seven times in this Book, and four times in one Page, <hi>viz.</hi> 227. and it is <hi>Prosopopaea,</hi> which also, as well as its Companions has given the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of <hi>Errata</hi> the slip, and so, weathered it out in Two Editions: But what to make of it, I cannot tell. There is indeed a certain Figure in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopopoeia,</hi> which I know well enough, but <hi>Prosopopaea</hi> I am wholly a Stranger to: And surely this Author could not mean the Figure <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; forasmuch as the strict Literal signification of that is <hi>fictio Personae.</hi> And I cannot imagine how this Author should mistake about this <hi>Word</hi> (of all others) having had so Excellent an Hand at the <hi>Thing</hi> signified by it; as having, I dare say, <hi>made more Persons</hi> than ever <hi>God</hi> thought fit to furnish the World with.</p>
            <p>And to shew the Reader that our Author's store ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends much further than one Book, I will present him with some more of the like Rarities out of some of his other Pieces.</p>
            <p>As first in <hi>Page</hi> 65. of his Answer to the <hi>Protestant Reconciler,</hi> he makes mention of <hi>Exorcisme, Chrysom, Unction, Dipping, Trine Immersion,</hi> &amp;c. as rejected by the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And here I was extremely at a loss to learn what <hi>Chrysom</hi> was; and after all my search, no <hi>Lexicon</hi> could inform me, till at last I hit upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:101779:182"/>
little <hi>Lexicon,</hi> called, <hi>The Bill of Mortality,</hi> and there I found a Word very near it, as differing from it but by one Letter, which was <hi>Chrisom,</hi> signifying a Child that dies presently after it is born: But then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering again, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> did not declare her self to reject such, I was as much at a loss as ever; till at length setting my Guessing Faculty on work, I concluded, that certainly it should be <hi>Chrisme,</hi> which is a <hi>Greek</hi> Word for <hi>Unction,</hi> as <hi>Immersion</hi> is a <hi>Latine</hi> one for <hi>Dipping.</hi> And this our Author should have taken notice of, for though he quotes it out of the <hi>Reconciler,</hi> yet since he neither rectifies it, nor reflects upon him for it, we may very reasonably suppose, that he took it for good Payment; and really thought, that it ought to be <hi>Chrysom</hi> as he found it. Otherwise he who had been so quick and sharp upon him at other turns, would, no doubt, have took him upon such an advantage, and well-favouredly exposed him for so foul a Blunder.</p>
            <p>But to go on. In <hi>Page</hi> 209. <hi>Line</hi> 13. of the same Book, I find mention of the <hi>Quadrigesimal Fast.</hi> And this put me as much to a stand, as the other, to imagine what kind of <hi>Fast</hi> this should be. For the nearest and likest Word I could derive it from, was <hi>Quadriga,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a <hi>Coach, Cart, or Waggon.</hi> And accordingly as the <hi>Jews</hi> had their <hi>Feast</hi> of <hi>Weeks,</hi> and of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> so I did not know, but the <hi>Papists,</hi> or some <hi>Christians</hi> like them, might have some <hi>Fast,</hi> called, <hi>The Fast of Coaches, or Waggons;</hi> and might possibly give it that Name from its being carried on with the Discipline of the <hi>Whip</hi> and the <hi>Lash,</hi> as <hi>Coaches</hi> and <hi>Waggons</hi> used to be. This Conjecture, I say, I made with my self. For I concluded, that this Author could not mean it of the <hi>Lenten-Fast;</hi> for that is called <hi>Quadragesima,</hi> or <hi>Jejunium Quadragesimale,</hi> and issues from the Numeral <hi>Quadragin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:101779:183"/>
and so is quite another Thing from this <hi>Quadrigesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal-Fast;</hi> which I cannot find in all the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of our Church; though perhaps when those <hi>Excellent Persons</hi> spoken of, <hi>Apology, P.</hi> 5. <hi>Line</hi> 20. have finished their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Alterations of our Rubrick,</hi> we shall find it there too.</p>
            <p>In the next place, let us pass to such of his Words as stand conjoyned with others in Sentences, or Forms of Speaking. And here let us first of all consider his absurd use of that form of Expression <hi>[as I may so speak]</hi> which he has at least Twenty times in this one Book: Now the proper use of these Words, is to bespeak excuse for that which they are joyned to, as for something that is <hi>legen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum cum veniâ,</hi> and containing in it a kind of <hi>Catachresis,</hi> or at least some Inequality, some Defect or other in the Expression, with Reference to the Thing designed to be expressed by it. And this, I am sure, is all the true and proper Reason assignable for the use of these Words <hi>[as I may so speak.]</hi> But this Author applies and uses them, even when he pretends to give the properest and most Literal Account and Explication of Things, and such an one, as is not only better than all others, but even exclusive of them also, as the <hi>only</hi> True Account that can be given of them. As for instance, where he affirms <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> to be the True and only <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Personality,</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> to be the same of the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in the <hi>Three Persons,</hi> he ushers it in with those Words <hi>[as I may so speak] Page</hi> 56. <hi>Line</hi> 6, 7, 8, &amp;c. Which (according to what he holds about these Two Terms) is all one, as if I should say, <hi>God</hi> is an Infinite, Eternal, Almighty Being <hi>(as I may so speak)</hi> and <hi>God</hi> is the Creator and Governour of the World <hi>(as I may so speak)</hi> and Man is a Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, having Two Eyes, Two Arms, and Two Legs;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:101779:183"/>
               <hi>I may so speak)</hi> all which is egregiously Absurd and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. And the more so; for that this very Author reproaches one of his Adversaries (whether <hi>Owen, Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Lobb,</hi> or the <hi>Reconciler,</hi> I cannot at present remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but the Thing I perfectly do) for using the like Expression <hi>[as I may so say,]</hi> with great scoff and scorn, telling him thereupon, That <hi>certainly no Man had ever more need of (so says) than he had.</hi> Now for my own part, I think this <hi>Author</hi>'s <hi>[so speaks]</hi> are every whit as bad and contemptible as his Adversary's <hi>[so says]</hi> unless he can perswade the World, That a Man may <hi>speak</hi> an Absurd thing much more excusably than he can <hi>say it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this we may add some more such Absurd Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. As for instance, that in <hi>P.</hi> 55. <hi>Line</hi> 26. where he says, <hi>That the Three Divine Persons are so United to each other, as every Man is to himself.</hi> In which Words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the falseness of the Proposition; it being impossible for the <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> to be so <hi>United</hi> to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to be but <hi>One Person,</hi> which yet <hi>every Man is,</hi> we ought to note also the Absurdity of the Expression. For all <hi>Union,</hi> or <hi>Unition,</hi> is <hi>Essentially</hi> between two things at least; so that unless the <hi>Man</hi> be <hi>One thing,</hi> and <hi>himself</hi> another, He cannot be said <hi>to be United to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> He may, perhaps, be properly enough said to <hi>be One with Himself;</hi> but to say, <hi>That he is United to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> is unpardonable Nonsence. Again, in <hi>Page</hi> 85. <hi>Line</hi> 8. He tells us, <hi>That the Infinite Wisdom which is in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is [Identically the same]</hi> which is as much as to say, <hi>That a Man is Wisely Wise, Honestly Honest, Learnedly Learned,</hi> and the like: For though I know what it is to be <hi>perfectly, or absolutely the same;</hi> yet to affirm any Thing, or Person to be <hi>Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the same,</hi> is an Idle, and a Nauseous Tautology. Likewise in <hi>Page</hi> 182. <hi>Line</hi> 19. He tells us, <hi>That God</hi>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:101779:184"/>
               <hi>intercedes with no Body but himself.</hi> Concerning which Form of Speaking, I must observe, That when the Term <hi>[But]</hi> is used as a Particle of <hi>Exception,</hi> it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys the Thing, or Person excepted from others, to be of the <hi>same kind,</hi> or, at least, <hi>condition</hi> with the rest, from which it was excepted. And therefore, unless <hi>God</hi> were a <hi>Body,</hi> it can with no Congruity of Speech be said, <hi>That God intercedes with no Body but himself.</hi> So that this also must pass for another Blunder. With the like Absurdity he tells us in <hi>Page</hi> 124. <hi>Line</hi> 15. <hi>Where there are Two distinct and divided Operations, if any of them can act alone without the other, there must be Two divided Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> Now it is a Maxime in Philosophy, and that such an one, as, I think, ought to take place in <hi>Grammar</hi> too, That <hi>Actionis non datur Actio.</hi> And accordingly if the <hi>Reason of Things</hi> ought to be the <hi>Rule of Words,</hi> then to say, That <hi>an Operation Acts, or Operates,</hi> is extremely Senceless and Ridiculous.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, he has a way of promiscuously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying such Words to <hi>Things</hi> as are properly applicable to <hi>Persons</hi> only, such as are <hi>[who]</hi> and <hi>[whose.]</hi> As for instance, he tells us of the Being of a Thing <hi>[whose]</hi> Nature we cannot conceive, <hi>Page</hi> 6. <hi>Line</hi> 11. And in the same Page, <hi>Line</hi> 23. <hi>We may know</hi> (says he) <hi>that there are a great many things [whose] Nature and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we cannot conceive.</hi> And in <hi>Page</hi> 7. <hi>Line</hi> 18. <hi>It is so far from being a wonder to meet with any Thing [whose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture] we do not understand,</hi> &amp;c. But is this Sence, or <hi>Grammar?</hi> Or does any Man say, <hi>Reach me that</hi> Book, [who <hi>lies there] or that</hi> Chair [who <hi>stands there?]</hi> No, certainly, none who understands what proper speaking is, would express himself so. And moreover (to shew that he can speak of <hi>Persons</hi> in a <hi>Dialect</hi> belonging only to <hi>bare Things,</hi> as well as he did of <hi>bare</hi> Things in words,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:101779:184"/>
proper only to <hi>Persons)</hi> he tells us of a <hi>Son produced out of the Substance of</hi> [its Parent] instead of <hi>his Parent, Page</hi> 257. <hi>Line</hi> 19. which is a way of speaking every whit as improper and absurd as the other. In the next place he has a custom of joyning a Verb of the <hi>Singular Number</hi> with a Noun of the <hi>Plural,</hi> and so <hi>vice versâ.</hi> As <hi>there is Three Gods,</hi> instead of, <hi>there are Three Gods, Page</hi> 2. <hi>Line</hi> 9. And <hi>the Nature of most things</hi> [are] <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dark and obscure,</hi> instead of <hi>[is so] Page</hi> 6. <hi>Line</hi> 20. which also is so Ungrammatical that it would not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured in a <hi>School-Boy;</hi> it being as arrant a Solecism in <hi>English,</hi> as <hi>Homines currit,</hi> or <hi>Socrates disputant</hi> would be in <hi>Latine.</hi> Likewise he often uses the Particle <hi>[then]</hi> instead of <hi>[than]</hi> as, <hi>The Scripture teaches more</hi> [then] <hi>Natural Reason does.</hi> Pag. 148. Line 19. And <hi>a more Glorious Authority</hi> [then] <hi>he exercises himself,</hi> Page 173. Line 28. This, I say, is familiar with him, but withal exceedingly Absurd, Improper, and not <hi>English.</hi> For <hi>[then]</hi> is a Note of Time, but <hi>[than]</hi> is a Note of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, importing a greater or lesser degree of that Thing wherein the Comparison is made; and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly joyned with the Words <hi>sooner,</hi> or <hi>rather,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with some word or other, denoting the <hi>Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Degree</hi> of a Thing. As, <hi>such</hi> an one has more or less Strength, or Wisdom [than] another. And I will Die <hi>sooner,</hi> or <hi>rather</hi> [than] I will do such a Thing, or the like. But no Man who Speaks, or Writes true <hi>English,</hi> will use these two words indifferently. But I must not omit that Notable Passage, <hi>Page</hi> 119. <hi>Line</hi> 25. where he tells us, That there is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. These are the very words, and as they stand (though in conjunction with Two or Three <hi>English</hi> Words to complete the Sentence) do in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, carry much of the Air of a Solecisin upon them;
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:101779:185"/>
so that according to the Construction of them here, if it had been for my Life, instead of saying, <hi>There is</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I would have said, <hi>There is</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and so have joyned true <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>English</hi> together.</p>
            <p>But there is an extraordinary Passage in his Book of Judgment, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 164. of the last Edition, (which should be the most correct) and I was doubting, whether I should charge it upon his Ignorance, or his Insolence; but both of them play their Parts very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably in it. For first he makes a most false, illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and absurd Translation of a Verse, or rather part of a Verse in the New Testament, and then reproaches the received Translation, as wrong, and very faulty, for rendring it otherwise. The place is in 2 <hi>Pet. c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. In which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders only the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, dividing them from the rest of the Sentence, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and by that means from the <hi>Verb</hi> in this <hi>latter</hi> part of it, which should govern the <hi>Noun</hi> in the <hi>former;</hi> thereby making <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be governed not by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as it ought to be) but most falsely and Ungrammatically by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and so he renders <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>casting them,</hi> viz. the Apostate Angels, <hi>down into Chains of darkness.</hi> And this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he builds partly upon the pretended Reason of the Thing here discoursed of, and partly upon the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but upon both of them very absurdly. From the Reason of the Thing he argues, that if <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> should signifie the Apostate Angels <hi>being cast down into Hell,</hi> how could they be said upon Sentence passed upon them at the last Judgment, to be then cast into Hell, if they were there before? To which the Answer is very easie and obvious, That im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:101779:185"/>
upon their sin they were cast down into, and kept in those lower Regions called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Hell lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> but not cast into <hi>Hell-Torments,</hi> till the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has passed upon them; so that with full accord both to Scripture and Reason we are to distinguish the <hi>place of Hell,</hi> where they now are, from the <hi>Judicial pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torments of Hell,</hi> which they shall be adjudged to, and endure in that place hereafter; as we distinguish the Prison wherein Malefactors are kept, from the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they are there kept for: As indeed this Text with great significance alludes to both: So that his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from hence falls to nothing. His other Reason is from the signification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which he affirms to signifie <hi>only to cast down.</hi> But on the contrary, I must here tell him first, That <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> does not only import the Act of casting down, but (being derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) signifies also the <hi>Term ad quem,</hi> or the Place, into which this casting down is. And I refer him to all the <hi>Greek</hi> Lexicographers (not one of them excepted) whether they do not render <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by <hi>in Tartarum detrudo, dejicio,</hi> or <hi>praecipito;</hi> and if so, how can <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> possibly here agree with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; for if <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be the Term <hi>ad quem</hi> of the Act, how can <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be so too; since one single Act can have but one Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Term <hi>ad quem?</hi> And even this Man himself does not allow <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be one and the same thing. And besides this, I must tell him further, That if <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> imported the <hi>Term, Thing,</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> into which God cast down the Apostate Angels, it ought not to have been <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the motion of casting down, importing a <hi>Local descent</hi> to something, the Dative Case cannot in true Grammar answer it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:101779:186"/>
And therefore the old <hi>Latine</hi> Version makes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to import, not the <hi>Term</hi> to which, but the Instruments or means by which these Angels were thus brought down, rendring the Text thus, <hi>Rudentibus Inferni de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractos in Tartarum tradidit,</hi> &amp;c. which, as it is not strictly a <hi>Translation,</hi> but an arbitrary <hi>Paraphrase,</hi> so it is a very forced and unnatural one too; as importing not a <hi>casting</hi> but a <hi>drawing down these Angels into Hell.</hi> In which case, who must be the Person drawing them? For since God (to whom <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> does and must here agree) ought to be considered by us as in the Highest Heaven, how can this drawing <hi>down</hi> be applyed to him, which, in the Nature of it, supposes the Person <hi>drawing</hi> to be in that lower place, to which he is drawing others? For all <hi>Traction</hi> is a motion of the Agent forcibly bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing something to himself, but <hi>Trusion</hi> a motion by which he removes or forces something from himself.</p>
            <p>It is clear therefore, that according to all the Rules of Grammatical Construction, and proper speaking, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> cannot be governed by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore something else must be sought for to govern it, which can be nothing besides <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And then the whole Sentence will be properly and plainly transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thus. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> [God] <hi>having cast or thrust them</hi> [viz. <hi>the Apostate Angels] down into Hell</hi> [or the <hi>Lower Regions]</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>delivered,</hi> or <hi>put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chains of darkness,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>kept,</hi> or <hi>reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to</hi> [or <hi>for] Iudgement.</hi> And this is sence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Speech, agreeable both to the Natural Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the Grammatical Syntax of the Words. But the Translation so imperiously and ignorantly given by this Man (in correction of that of the Church) is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to neither. For it both divides one part of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from the other, from which it must not be devid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:101779:186"/>
and then makes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be governed by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which cannot govern it, and quite cutting it off from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which alone can.</p>
            <p>And now, ought it not to be matter of Amazement to all Men of Sense and Sobriety, to see a Puny, who is not able to master three words of <hi>Greek,</hi> presume to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul such great Masters of that Language, as the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators of the New Testament into <hi>English</hi> undoubtedly were? Nay, and thereby to reflect upon the Church her self, which has received and owned this Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to whose Judgment and Authority (if he be so nearly related to her, as he pretends) he ows so great and <hi>filial</hi> a Deference? Let him rather instead of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the <hi>English</hi> Translation (a Work which he was never born for) thank God, and the Translators for it; there being few Men living more beholden to it than himself. And therefore leaving his forlorn Criticisme (as new every whit as his Divinity) to shift for it self; I, for my part, like my <hi>English</hi> Bible, for his dislike of any part of it, better than before. For I can by no means see any force or consequence in this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That because this Author is much better at <hi>quoting</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Sentence than at <hi>construing</hi> it; therefore the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Translation of this Text in St. <hi>Peter</hi> is a <hi>very bad Translation:</hi> I say, I cannot admit, or yield to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.</p>
            <p>And thus I have presented the Reader with some of this Author's Ways and Forms of Expression, which <hi>Grammarians</hi> call <hi>Loquendi Genera.</hi> From all which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the singular skill he has shewn in this sort of Learning, it is to be hoped, that as he has already blest the World with a New Divinity and Philosophy, so he will in due time oblige it with a new <hi>Grammar</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:101779:187"/>
And great need (as we shall presently see) there seems to be of such an one. In order to which, I shall mention but one more of this Author's Pieces. And that is a Book, Intituled, <hi>A Defence of Dr.</hi> Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of which, there is a <hi>Table of Errata</hi> prefixed, that fills almost a whole Page; so that I verily thought, that it had so clearly carried off the whole Crop, as to leave no Gleanings behind. Nevertheless I shall present the Reader with this small <hi>Spicilegium</hi> of what I gathered up after it; not mentioning any one Word that stands Corrected there.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 53. therefore, and <hi>Line</hi> 10. He tells us of a Counterfeit <hi>Epithite;</hi> but what that is, I do not know. I have indeed often heard of an <hi>Epithete</hi> from the <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, signifying <hi>quid appositum aut adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> and imports properly, an Adjective joyned to a Substantive, and giving the Substantive a Denomination accordingly. But as for this Author's <hi>Epithite,</hi> it may, for ought appears, signifie something to <hi>stop Bot<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>les.</hi> For as for any other Signification (that I know of) it has none.</p>
            <p>In the next place, <hi>Page</hi> 64, 65. he quotes <hi>Baxter</hi> for an Expression used by him, <hi>viz. of such people as talk through a Window on the West-end of</hi> Moore-Fields; and calls it Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Elegant Paraphrases</hi> for Madmen. But here (besides the mistake of <hi>Paraphrases</hi> for <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasis,</hi> which is only one Number put for another) our Learned Author must give me leave to tell him, That by this Passage, he seems not to understand what a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrasis</hi> means. For a <hi>Paraphrasis,</hi> or <hi>Paraphrase</hi> (to put it into <hi>English</hi> for his sake) signifies properly a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of some <hi>Writing,</hi> with Additions and Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Illustrate and Explain the sence of it, and is
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:101779:187"/>
therefore usually called <hi>Liberior Translatio.</hi> In which sence we read of this or that <hi>Paraphrase upon the Psalms,</hi> and <hi>Erasmus</hi>'s <hi>Paraphrase</hi> upon the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> and the like. So that unless the <hi>Mad-men</hi> here spoken of, were a certain <hi>Book,</hi> or <hi>Writing,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Words concerning them, an <hi>Explicatory Translation</hi> of the said <hi>Writing,</hi> this <hi>Great-Good</hi> Man could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call them a <hi>Paraphrase.</hi> But what must we call them then? Why truly the forementioned Words might be properly enough called a <hi>Periphrasis,</hi> or <hi>Circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (which, being so like the word <hi>Paraphrasis,</hi> might easily deceive a Man who cares not what he Writes) and when it is so taken, it is a certain Figure in Speech, whereby we express a Thing by several Words, which otherwise might, and, for the most' part, is expressed by one. As <hi>Sophronisci filius,</hi> is a <hi>Periphrasis</hi> for <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and <hi>the Man who Conquered</hi> Pompey the Great, is a <hi>Periphrasis</hi> for <hi>Iulius Caesar;</hi> and so to bring the matter home to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Instance; that forementioned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of, <hi>Men who talk through the Windows at the West-end of</hi> Moore-Fields, is a proper <hi>Periphrasis</hi> for <hi>Mad-men.</hi> But as for a <hi>Paraphrase upon Madmen,</hi> I leave it to this wonderful Person, to make a <hi>Paraphrase</hi> upon any Man, (whether Mad or Sober) if he can.</p>
            <p>Likewise in <hi>Page</hi> 112. and the last Line, he tells us, out of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Epistles of a <hi>Publica praecum formula.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, though I must confess, that I do by no means aspire to be one of the Number of this Author's <hi>Excellent Persons,</hi> who were for <hi>altering</hi> our Liturgy, or Publick Form of Prayer. Yet, if it were expressed by <hi>Publica praecum formula,</hi> I should be one of the foremost who should desire that <hi>Praecum</hi> might be altered into <hi>Precum.</hi> In the mean time, why should any one who had reàd but a Page in <hi>Calvin,</hi> quote him for such a
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:101779:188"/>
word as could not possibly drop from so Learned a Pen?</p>
            <p>But it would be endless to descant particularly upon all this Author's <hi>New-found Latine,</hi> and Proprieties of Speech. And therefore to set them down briefly as they offer themselves. In <hi>Page</hi> 122. in the Quotation in the Margin, the Reader will find a most choice word, <hi>viz. Conscionator,</hi> not to be met with in any such puny <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> as we commonly call <hi>Classick,</hi> but cited by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>Concionator</hi> out of the 57th Canon of our <hi>Church;</hi> which, I must tell him, is not an ordinary slip, but a foul <hi>stumble,</hi> attended with Two more in the same Quotation, <hi>viz. Sique</hi> for <hi>Siqui,</hi> and a lesser one, which is <hi>Utrum,</hi> for <hi>Utrum;</hi> for that is no greater than the difference of a Noun from an Adverb, which, we know, is below a Person, Paramount to all rule, to take notice of. Though by his good leave the <hi>Church of England</hi> both Writes and Teaches better <hi>Latine</hi> to such as are disposed to learn it.</p>
            <p>Again in <hi>Page</hi> 139. in the Quotation on the side, we have these Words cited out of the third <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Optatus Milevitanus. Recordamini quomodò à vobis jamdudum Matris Ecclesiae membra distracta sunt, non enim [Unum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quamque demum] semel seducere potuistis.</hi> Of which Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage I must confess I could make neither Sence nor <hi>Grammar,</hi> till consulting the Author himself of <hi>Albaspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>'s Edition, instead of <hi>Unumquamque demum,</hi> I found it <hi>Unamquamque Domum;</hi> which, no doubt, is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Various Lection (of which this Author ought to have the Glory) upon the Text of such a <hi>Father.</hi> But this is not all the Blunders which this fruitful Sentence affords us; there being yet another, <hi>viz. recedit</hi> for <hi>rese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;</hi> and that such an one as utterly perverts the sence of the Author, who speaks here of some who <hi>left,</hi> and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:101779:188"/>
some who <hi>remained in</hi> the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them in this respect to one another; as, <hi>Aut</hi> ivit <hi>uxor, aut</hi> resedit <hi>maritus, aut Parentes seducti sunt &amp; filii sequi noluerunt, aut stetit frater migrante sorore,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the Father here speaks; but, pray, what opposition could there be between <hi>aut ivit uxor</hi> aut <hi>recedit maritus,</hi> any more than there is between <hi>going away</hi> and <hi>depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Besides, that all the rest of the Verbs running in the <hi>Preterperfect Tense,</hi> this must needs do so too, or make a very gross fault in the Construction: So that this is an Illiterate Perversion of the sence of this <hi>Father.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, as well as upon other occasions, I look upon this as the only sure Rule of dealing with this Author's Quotations, <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>trust them</hi> no further than one <hi>can see</hi> them in their Originals.</p>
            <p>In like manner, <hi>Page</hi> 178. in the place there quoted in the Margin out of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s 55. <hi>Epist.</hi> (and not the 52d. as this Author there mistakes it) we meet with these words, <hi>à Coepiscoporum suorum Corpore &amp; ab Ecclesiae Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate [discisserit:]</hi> But the word in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is (as it ought to be) <hi>descisceret,</hi> from <hi>descisco</hi> to fall off; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which, and the other word used by this Author, there is a wide difference, <hi>descisceret</hi> being a most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Latine</hi> Word, but <hi>discisserit</hi> so far from <hi>Proper,</hi> that it is not so much as <hi>Latine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in <hi>Page</hi> 187. <hi>Line</hi> the last, we find <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which makes the whole Period neither Sence nor <hi>Greek.</hi> Again, <hi>Page</hi> 188. <hi>Line</hi> the last but one, we have this Passage, <hi>Videte annon dicantur marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, sed aliquid</hi> [Alium] <hi>dici mereantur;</hi> which being there put for <hi>Aliud,</hi> is a downright Solecism. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in <hi>Page</hi> 198. in the Quotation in the Margin, we have those remarkable words, <hi>Simiarum more,</hi> [qui] <hi>cùm homines non sint, homines tamen imitantur?</hi> Which
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:101779:189"/>
is another Solecism every whit as bad and scandalous as the former.</p>
            <p>Now all these Words and Passages, I assure the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as they stand in the Authors, from whence they are quoted, carry a very different face, from what this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has given them; which shews, that whensoever the words of the <hi>Fathers</hi> are transcribed into any of his Books, they are quite out of their Element. For amongst them (as they stand here) there are some such vile faults, or rather such clamorous sins in <hi>Grammar,</hi> that should a <hi>School-Boy</hi> tender an Exercise to his Master with but Two or Three such in it, he would soon find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self very roundly and severely <hi>took up</hi> for them; and that perhaps more ways than one. But <hi>Hands that can restore dispossessed Princes,</hi> may Write any Thing, and Authorize what they have Wrote, by their very <hi>Writing</hi> it. For otherwise, the Truth is, the <hi>Latine,</hi> which the forecited Passages are dressed up in, seems a sort of <hi>Providential Latine,</hi> as being above all <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of Speaking and Writing whatsoever.</p>
            <p>As for faults about Accents, such as are <gap reason="foreign">

But this I desire him to take notice of, upon the whole that has been produced by me, That as none of the forementioned Faults are in the Table of the <hi>Errata;</hi> so some of them in the first Edition of his <hi>Vind. Trin.</hi> stand Corrected in the second; as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Page</hi> 115. <hi>Line</hi> 1. of the Quotation in the Margin of the first is Corrected into <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the latter. And therefore according to the old Maxime, That <hi>Exceptio firmat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulam</hi>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:101779:189"/>
               <hi>in non Exceptis,</hi> it is to me a sufficient proof, That since this Author Corrected some Passages, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which yet need correcting as much, if not more, it was, because <hi>His Acuteness</hi> did not see, that these last needed any <hi>Correction</hi> at all: And in such a case some are of Opinion that where the Words escape it, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himself ought to have it.</p>
            <p>But because some perhaps will hardly be satisfied with so General a Charge without an Allegation of more Particulars, I shall here give the Reader a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of this Author's <hi>Greek Errata</hi> in the 2d Edition of his Vindication of the Trinity (which should in Reason be thought the most correct) together with their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection confronting them.</p>

Now all these <hi>Errata,</hi> one would think, make up a jolly <hi>Company</hi> to rendezvous together in the compass of less than half a dozen Pages of an <hi>English</hi> Book; a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany fit for our Author to march Triumphantly in the Head of.</p>
            <p>But I shall hold my Reader no longer upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, how diverting soever it may be; this being enough to satisfie any Rational Person, how unfit this Man is to upbraid any one <hi>with wars of</hi> Greek, <hi>or</hi> Latine: Though had I in my first perusal of his several Pieces foreseen this my Engagement with him, I might and would have presented my Reader with a more complete Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Elegancies. For I had not gone far in the Reading of him, but I found the Blows come so thick and fast upon poor <hi>Priscian,</hi> that, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent downright Blood-shed, still as I drew near to a <hi>Latine</hi> Quotation of any length, I presently advised him as a Friend to get out of the way as fast as he could.</p>
            <p>And now, if either he, or any one else for him, shall pretend to slight and despise this charge, and tell me that the Faults and Mistakes here alledged by me, are <hi>small Things;</hi> so, say I, is the point of a Dagger too; but for all that, it may stab a Man to the Heart; and, I think, it matters not how small the Thing is, which wounds a Man's Credit, if it chance to bleed to Death of the Wound. But there are some Things in the World, the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of which seems but small, but the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of them is not so. And certainly of all Men living, such as will be Writers, especially provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Insulting Writers, are concerned to tread tenderly, and to take every step with the utmost Caution, where they do not find a <hi>Grammatical</hi> Bottom firm under them. For my own part, I dare account nothing small, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable,

which may either do a Man a great mischief, or is necessary to prevent one. The first step in any Ascent may be reckoned but a low and a mean thing, nevertheless there is no getting to the top without it. As the Great St. <hi>Basil</hi> himself tells us, <hi>That nothing is to be slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>In which is given some Account of this <hi>Author</hi>'s Temper and insolent way of Writing, as well in Extolling himself, as in Depressing and Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Adversaries;</hi> in both which he has not his Parallel.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THough in all Contests and Controversies, how sharp soever on both sides, and just on one, there is still a Duty, which every Man ows both to Decency and to Himself, always obliging him to utter only such things, as may become him to speak, whatsoever his Adversary may deserve to hear; yet, as to the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary himself, it is, no doubt, a course justifiable beyond all exception, to take ones measures of Treating him, from the measures he has allowed himself of dealing with others. And, as I hope, for my own, and the Churches sake, to acquit my self as to the former part of the Rule, so let my Adversary take his lot as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For I doubt not but to satisfie the World, (were it not superabundantly, from his own Writings, satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already) That he is a Person of such an insufferable Insolence both of Style and Temper, that all, that he has met with in the foregoing Chapters, has by no means paid off his Scores. In all his expressions concerning his
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:101779:192"/>
Antagonists, he is infinitely scornful; and not only so, but very often also, extremely spiteful and malicious. For what but the height of spight could make him in his Vindication of his <hi>Case of Allegiance</hi> tax his Learned Adversary, as an <hi>Epicurean and an Atheistical Ridiculer of Providence,</hi> only for maintaining, that the Passages and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vind. Case,</hi> &amp;c. p. 58. l. 28.</note> Events of Providence are not the Rule, which God will have us govern our Actions by; but the Precepts and Prohibitions of his Law? And what, but the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, could make him insinuate that the same Author was inclined to <hi>Popery and an Infallible Interpreter,</hi> only for saying that one Text of Scripture was <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>much controverted?</hi> Which yet St. <hi>Peter</hi> had said of many <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epistles,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. and yet without giving any wise Man the least occasion from thence to think that he was then providing an Argument for the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of his supposed <hi>Successor.</hi> And Lastly, what but the bitterest Rancour could make him charge his <note place="margin">Vind. Case <hi>p.</hi> 48. and the two last Lines.</note> Adversary, as if he had compared the swearing Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to K. <hi>W.</hi> and Q. <hi>M.</hi> for the great and notorious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of it, with the Villanies foretold by the Prophet of <hi>Hazael;</hi> only, because he had told Him, that <hi>as</hi> Hazael <hi>had changed his mind;</hi> (notwithstanding his confident O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of himself to the contrary;) <hi>so had this Author too?</hi> For who but one of equal Virulence and Ignorance would have stretched the comparison, which respected <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vind. of the Case,</hi> &amp;c. p. 79. l. 10.</note> only <hi>the changing of Minds,</hi> to a Comparison as to the <hi>merits of the Cause,</hi> which it had no relation to at all? Indeed no more than that Reply of <hi>Hazael, Is thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant a Dog?</hi> Was design'd to convince the Prophet, <hi>That he had not four Legs,</hi> and not rather only to clear himself from such a currish and belluine temper of mind, as those Actions foretold of him must needs imply? And I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:101779:193"/>
when a certain Person speaking of the New Oath to a certain Bishop, said, <hi>My Lord, I will be Crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> 
               <note place="margin">B. K.</note> 
               <hi>I will take this Oath,</hi> His meaning was not, that he thought the taking it more Painful and Tormenting than a <hi>Crucifixion,</hi> but that he had a greater unwillingness to take the one, than to undergo the other. And yet this was this Author's way of Treating a very Worthy Man, an old Acquaintance, and a fair Adversary. I am not at all concern'd to espouse or abett the Cause de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by that Learned Person. But this I do, and ever shall averr, That there is a <hi>Ius Belli,</hi> in these Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versial, as well as in Military Conflicts, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an obligation to Truth and Justice and common Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity even in the exercise of the greatest Hostilities. But this Man's usage of his forementioned Adversary is not more Senseless and Illogical, than Disingenuous, Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and Unchristian. And so let the Reader take this as a Specimen of his impotent Spleen and Malice. After which, let us shew him in his next good Quality, his <hi>Insolence;</hi> and first in that Branch of it, which concerns his wonderful Opinion and Applause of Himself.</p>
            <p>As to which, we shall first of all see him (as we have in some degree shewn him before) preferring himself before all the Fathers, as <hi>much happier in giving an explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Trinity than they were;</hi> and this, in such a fleering scoptical way, (scoptical I mean as to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> but highly <hi>Commendatory</hi> of himself) that it would even turn ones Stomach to read his fulsom Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. For he tells us, (and that with the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found humility, no doubt) <hi>p.</hi> 101. <hi>l.</hi> 1. &amp;c. <hi>If that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication which I have given, be very consistent with, nay, be the true Interpretation of that account the Antients give of a Trinity in Unity, I hope it will not be thought an unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:101779:193"/>
               <hi>Novelty, if I have expressed the same thing in other Words, which give us a more clear and distinct apprehension of it,</hi> &amp;c. And again, <hi>p.</hi> 126. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>I hope this is no fault neither, to give an Intelligible explication of that, which all the Fathers taught, but were not equally happy in their expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it.</hi> No; for his comfort, no; to excel and outdo all the Fathers (if a Man can do it) can be no fault at all. But before this be allow'd him, I do here require him to name and produce me but one (who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges a Trinity) in the whole World, besides his own modest <hi>self,</hi> who ever preferr'd his explication of the Trinity for the <hi>Happiness and Intelligibility of it,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that given by the Fathers. I say, let him produce me so much as one affirming this, if he can. So that, in short, the Comparison here stands between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and this Author: And we see the Preheminence given him above all the Fathers by the sole and single <hi>Iudgment of one Doctor,</hi> and that Doctor is <hi>Himself:</hi> Nay, and (which is more) to put the matter past all Comparison between him and them for the future, He tells us (as was also observed before in my 7th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>That the Fathers neither knew how to speak their own Thoughts of the Trinity, nor indeed so much as to conceive of it aright, by reason of the</hi> grossness of their Imaginations: <hi>Whereas, if they had</hi> (as he adds) <hi>but conceived of it, and expressed themselves about it, as he has done, all would have been plain, easie, and intelligible.</hi> And as for <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> (from whom he had Quoted more than from all the rest of the Fathers together) he gives him a cast of his Temper at last, <hi>p.</hi> 119. <hi>l.</hi> 5. and sends him away with this rap over the Pate, <hi>That he could not tell what to make of him and his Reasonings; for that, in his judgment,</hi>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:101779:194"/>
               <hi>he destroyed all Principles of Individuation.</hi> And in this manner we have him Pluming himself, clapping his Wings, and crowing over all the Fathers; for which, and his quarrelsome domineering Nature together, most think, it is high time, that <hi>his Comb were cut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, let us see what Elogies he bestows upon himself for his Atchievements in the <hi>Socinian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie. Concerning which he tells the Men of that Persuasion, That after his Vindication of the Trinity <hi>He believes they will talk more sparingly of Absurdities and Contradictions for the future.</hi> pag. 153. But, why, I pray? Is it because this Author has got the <hi>Monopoly</hi> of them, and engrossed them all to himself? And that therefore the Laws will be very severe upon such as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade his Property? For, as for any other Reason, they have none, that I know of, to <hi>talk more sparingly of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities and Contradictions,</hi> than they used to do, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so many more, out of his Writings, to talk of, than ever they had before. But he proceeds, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his Work with this Triumph over his Antagonist (and in him, I suppose, over all the rest of that Tribe) pag. 272. <hi>That he is pretty confident, that he will never be able to reason to any purpose in this cause again.</hi> As for his <hi>confidence,</hi> none doubts of it; but as for his <hi>Prediction,</hi> if he proves no better a <hi>Prophet</hi> in what he here <hi>foretels</hi> of his <hi>Socinian</hi> Opponent, than in what he foretold of that Learned Person, who answered both his <hi>Case of Allegiance,</hi> and his <hi>Vindication of it.</hi> viz. <hi>That if he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vind. Case <hi>p.</hi> the last.</note> 
               <hi>would but well examine his Arguments before he answered them, he should expect to hear no more from him:</hi> And if withal this <hi>Socinian</hi> be but able to handle him at such a Rate, as that close Reasoner has done, I dare under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for him, that he shall go out of the World the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:101779:194"/>
most baffled Person, that ever lived in it. But why, (for God's sake) must the <hi>Socinians</hi> Reasoning Abilities <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See his four Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons on the</hi> 1 John 14. p. 71, 72.</note> (which his great Lord and Patron has given so high, so signal, and so peculiar an <hi>Encomium</hi> of) all of a suddain fail them, upon this Author's Publication of his Book? What can the meaning of this be? Why the meaning of it is this. <hi>Hic vir, hic est,</hi> &amp;c. according to the words by which <hi>Virgil</hi> pointed out <hi>Augustus Caesar. This, This, is the Man.</hi> This is that Incomparable, Mighty, and Irrefragable Divine, who has wrote more convincingly and effectually against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> (if you will believe him) than all, that ever wrote against them before, put together. For notwithstanding all that has been wrote by those great Men, who from time to time have appear'd in this Controversie, the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie is still alive, and the <hi>Socinians</hi> continue writing and reasoning still: And even by this Author's confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (once at least) <hi>to some Purpose.</hi> For otherwise how could he say of his <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversary, <hi>That he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to reason to any purpose in this cause again,</hi> if he had never reasoned so at all? But so far are the <hi>Socinians</hi> from being put <hi>out of Countenance,</hi> and much less <hi>out of Heart,</hi> by what this Man has wrote against them, That I assure him, they look upon him as an Opponent accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Hearts desire; as having play'd a fairer Game into their hands than ever was dealt into them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: So that next to their wishing all the World their <hi>Friends,</hi> they wish they may always have such <hi>Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> And therefore if they should resolve to <hi>reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him no more,</hi> he will have great cause to thank ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Inadvertency for over-looking the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage given them, or their good Nature for not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it. For the Book called by him, <hi>a Vindication of the</hi>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:101779:195"/>
               <hi>Trinity,</hi> is certainly like a kind of Pot or Vessel with handles quite round it; turn it which way you will, you are sure to find something to take hold of it by.</p>
            <p>And the truth is, upon a strict impartial comparing of things together, I cannot see any new Advantage that he has got over the <hi>Socinians,</hi> unless it be That he thinks his <hi>Three Gods</hi> will be too hard for their <hi>One.</hi> And perhaps it is upon Presumption of this, That he discharges that clap of Thunder at them in his Preface, where he tells us, <hi>That having dipp'd his Pen in the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of so glorious a Cause, by the grace of God he will never desert it, while he can hold Pen in hand.</hi> In which words, methinks I see him ready Armed and Mounted (with his Face towards the <hi>West)</hi> and brandishing his Sword aloft, all wreaking with <hi>Socinian</hi> blood, and with the very darts of his Eyes looking his poor <hi>forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Friends</hi> through and through. For in good earnest the Words sound very terribly to these Men; but most terribly of all to the Article it self: (which is like to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer most by his <hi>Vindication:)</hi> For thus to threaten that he will never leave off vexing it <hi>as long as he can hold Pen in hand,</hi> (which, I dare say, will be as long as he can tell Money with it) This, I say again, sounds very dreadfully.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, as fierce and formidable as these words may represent him, he has yet, like a merciful Enemy, very great reserves of compassion. For otherwise how come so many <hi>Socinian</hi> Pieces wrote against him to lie so long unanswered? He has indeed lately wrote an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for writing against the</hi> Socinians; but where is the Apology for writing in such a prevaricating way against them at first, and for never writing against them since?
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:101779:195"/>
For has he lost his daring <hi>Polemick Pen?</hi> Or has he <note place="margin">
                  <hi>William Giles</hi> sometime, of <hi>Mark-Lane,</hi> who wrote (forsooth) in Defence of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Papists.</note> lost the <hi>use of</hi> his <hi>Hand?</hi> Or has he run himself <hi>out of Breath?</hi> If this last be his case (as by some <hi>Asthmatick Symptoms</hi> one would think it is) he will do well to call in his old Friend, and Defender, the <hi>Foot-man,</hi> to second him: Especially since the Contention, which now seems most likely to be, is, who shall <hi>run</hi> fastest from the Enemy, and keep furthest from Him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I wonder that in the mannage of this Disputation, he does not take the same course that other Learned Men in the like cases use to do. For he frequently taxes his Adversary with <hi>Fallacies;</hi> telling him that this is a <hi>Fallacy,</hi> and that is a <hi>Fallacy:</hi> But why does he not express to his Reader, what the particular <hi>Fallacy</hi> is? There being no Sophism or Fallacy incident to Speech or Argumentation, but what falls under one of the Thirteen reckoned up by <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreover,</hi> while he is Animadverting upon the History of the <hi>Unitarians,</hi> he will, I believe, hardly get clear of a scurvy lapse in that History himself. For concerning the Exposition given by the <hi>Socinians</hi> of that Text in the 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. where our Saviour tells the <hi>Iews, That he came down from Heaven.</hi> He writes thus: <hi>Did</hi> Socinus <hi>find it so easie a Thing to reconcile this Text to his Darling Opinion, when he was forced to</hi> Fast and Pray <hi>for it, and to pretend</hi> Revelation <hi>because he wanted Reason to support it?</hi> viz. <hi>That Christ before he entred on his Prophetick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, was taken into Heaven to be instructed in the Gospel, and then came down from Heaven again to publish it to the World;</hi> pag. 143. l. 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, the Person here spoken of, and intended by this Author, must needs have been <hi>Faustus Socinus,</hi> and I believe he will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:101779:196"/>
that he meant any other; which being supposed, This Remark of his will appear to have been a very great mistake. For neither was this the Text, about which this <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Pretence of Revelation</hi> was, (for <hi>Fasting</hi> is a word of this Author's putting in:) nor was <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi> the Person who did any of these Things upon this occasion. But the Text was that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 58. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.

            <p>But as this may satisfie the Reader that the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned place in <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 58. was the Text, for which this <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Pretence of Revelation</hi> is said to have been, and consequently may suffice to shew this Author's Blunder; so I shall yet further shew, that the other Text in <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 13. concerning <hi>Christ's coming down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> was not accounted by <hi>Socinus</hi> of so difficult an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, as to need those peculiar Methods of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> for the Discovery of it, as this Author has been pleased to affirm. And this will appear from these words of <hi>Socinus</hi> concerning it. <hi>Postquàm ex Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riâ natus est, in coelo, antequàm moreretur, rever à esse po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit; nec solùm potuit, sed (ut ita dicamus) debuit. Si enim homo ille Paulus Christi servus ad Tertium usque Coelum an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te mortem raptus est, nullo pacto nobis verisimile est Christum ipsum ante mortem in coelo non fuisse.</hi> And, a few Lines after, speaking of the same again with reference to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s having been taken up into the third Heaven, he thus discourses. <hi>Certè Christus (in quo sine ullâ men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surâ rerum omnium Divinarum cognitio, ut fuit, sic esse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit, quin ibi</hi> (viz. <hi>in coelo) per aliquod Tempus antequàm munus coele sti doctrinâ homines imbuendi sibi à Patre manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:101779:197"/>
               <hi>publicè susciperet, versatus fuerit, nullo modo dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum videtur. Socinus in Responsione Priore ad Parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesim Andreae Volani,</hi> Tomo <hi>2do. Fratrum Polon.</hi> p. 380. Col. 2. By all which we see, that <hi>Socinus</hi> was so far from apprehending any difficulty in finding out this exposition of the Text, That he affirms it was <hi>nullo pacto verisimile,</hi> There was <hi>no likelyhood</hi> that it should be otherwise, <hi>&amp; nullo modo dubitandum,</hi> that <hi>no doubt</hi> could be made, but it was and <hi>ought to be</hi> so. Which surely are not forms of expression, to shew the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of conceiving, or finding out how the said Thing <hi>could</hi> be so. So that this is a manifest mistake in this Author; and let him set it off with never so much brow and confidence, yet no doubt his <hi>Socinian</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries despise him for it sufficiently. And the Truth is, one would in all Reason imagine, that to the Answering the <hi>History of the Unitarians,</hi> a little more knowledge of their History would have done no hurt.</p>
            <p>But after the many ample and extraordinary Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies he has passed upon himself for his Writings, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it is something Pleasant to see him in his <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the Defence of Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet, <hi>p.</hi> 121. <hi>l.</hi> the 4. &amp;c. strutting himself in these words, <hi>I am no Arch-bishop yet.</hi> Which shews what his most early thoughts ran upon, and what <hi>his Modesty</hi> would be at from the very first. For otherwise, the purpose of the place, where this comes in, had been fully served by saying, <hi>I for my part am no Arch-bishop, nor expect to be one.</hi> But the addition of that little word <hi>yet</hi> was very significant, and shews, that out of the <hi>Abundance of his heart his mouth spoke.</hi> For though indeed he presently adds, <hi>And I very much suspect I never shall be one,</hi> yet
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:101779:197"/>
those words were put in only <hi>ad frangendam invidiam,</hi> and to qualifie the fulsome arrogance of the first expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Howbeit in that he spoke his mind, in this he fences against an Inconvenience; in that we have <hi>an account</hi> of <hi>his Nature,</hi> in this only <hi>a Copy of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</hi> And, I question not, but by this time his pretended suspicion is passed into a contrary expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the <hi>Deanry</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi>'s begins to make him think himself Heir apparent to <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder, if while big with such Thoughts, speaking in his Apology of Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> and <hi>Himself,</hi> he sets himself before Him, <hi>p.</hi> 29. in these words. <hi>He</hi> (viz. <hi>The Melancholy stander-by) concludes with an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy charge upon my self, and Dr.</hi> Wallis. By which, I suppose, he would have Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> know his proper place. Though I must tell him, that not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Modesty, but also the common Custom of the World, makes wise Men whensoever they mention themselves with others, place themselves last. And so it might have become this Author too, especially speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himself in conjunction with such an one, as Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> who was a Person of Fame and Eminence, while this Man was learning his Grammar; if ever he was so.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, and pass from his applauding himself to the other Branch of his Arrogance, in his scornful undervaluing all such as write against him, or differ from him, (though yet no more, nor in any other Thing, than in what his Worship had differed from himself). We have him in the 4th. <hi>page</hi> of his <hi>Preface to his Case of Allegiance,</hi> calling such as in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings could not fall in with his <hi>last</hi> sentiments about the <hi>New Oath, Little Writers.</hi> Concerning whom I
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:101779:198"/>
must tell him, that it is often with <hi>Writers,</hi> as it is with <hi>Books;</hi> Amongst which there are many <hi>Little ones,</hi> that exceed the worth, and outlive the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of much <hi>Greater.</hi> If indeed number of Pamphlets makes a great Writer, this Author is in no danger of being accounted a <hi>Little One.</hi> But as there is such a Thing, as <hi>multum in parvo,</hi> so there is also <hi>Parvum in multo;</hi> and He who will digest the trouble of Reading this Authors Writings, will need no other Argument to prove it so. But as for those excellent Persons, whom he first slights, then <hi>challenges,</hi> and afterwards <hi>flies from,</hi> by never replying upon them, I would have him know, that the World has already past it's judgment both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them and him too: and therefore I would advise his <hi>Haughtiness</hi> for the future to forbear calling his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonists <hi>Little Writers,</hi> till by his Answers he has <hi>made them so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A further discovery of his rude, undecent way of treating such as he writes against, is the Language he has bestow'd upon a certain Writer, a <hi>Nonconformist</hi> indeed, but yet a Man of Learning (as a much greater Man than this Author has found by experience) whom he calls a <hi>Trifling Scribler, who understands little more</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Alsop.</note> 
               <hi>than Quibbles and Iests;</hi> Charging him withal with <hi>Pertness</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> to complete his Character, <hi>p.</hi> 15. of his Preface to his Defence of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi> And in the 12. <hi>page</hi> of the Book it self, and the five first lines, He represents him under the name of the <hi>Inquirer,</hi> as one, <hi>who cannot understand plain and familiar sense; nor carry the Connexion of three or four Sentences together.</hi> Very civil Language indeed, becoming a Scholar, a Divine, and a well-bred Man, to a Person who had not in the least provok'd Him. For my own part, I
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:101779:198"/>
have no knowledge of the Man, but from his Writings; and upon the Stock of that knowledge have often won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, that one so able to humble this Reviler, would take such gross Reproaches at his hands.</p>
            <p>But the Truth is, when I consider (as I noted first in my Preface) how patiently our whole Clergy has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto suffered him to call them <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> by charging all those, as <hi>such,</hi> who concur not with him in holding the Three Divine Persons to be <hi>Three distinct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Minds, or Spirits</hi> (which, I dare say, not one of them held at the time of his uttering this Lewd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach) I say, when I consider this, I have cause to surcease all wonder, that any Private Man should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this Insolent <hi>Huff</hi> to insult over him in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But I shall insist no further upon this master-piece of his Scurrility, having in some measure accounted with him for it already. Only I shall add this, That as it is beyond Example marvellous that any one single Member of a Church should presume to load all the rest with such a charge, so it is yet a greater marvel that all should bear it.</p>
            <p>It would be endless to set down all the dirty stuff that has flowed from his <hi>Billingsgate Pen.</hi> But to repeat and bring together so much as we have taken notice of, the Reader may be pleased to bear away in his Memory such Expressions, and Appellations as these, viz. <hi>Epicurean,</hi> and <hi>Ridiculer of Providence, Popishly inclined,</hi> and <hi>looking towards an Infallible Interpreter, Disaffected to, and a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of the Government, Little Writers, Fools</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Errant Fopp, Trifling Scribler, shamefully Ignorant and Impudent, Fit to be sent to School again, One that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands little else but Iests and Quibbles, One that cannot understand plain and familiar sense, One that understands</hi>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:101779:199"/>
               <hi>neither</hi> Greek <hi>nor</hi> Latine, and the like. These are the choice Embellishments of his Style. But above all, that beloved word, <hi>Nonsense,</hi> is always ready at hand with him; and out it flies at all Persons and upon all Occasions. And hardly can he write three or four Pages together, but, right or wrong, he throws it in his Adversary's Face. One would think that he was Born with the <hi>Word</hi> in his Mouth, and that it grew up with him from his Infancy, and that in his very Cradle he <hi>Cryed Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,</hi> before he could <hi>Speak</hi> it.</p>
            <p>But to check this ungovern'd Humour of his, in thus using this word at all Adventure; Let me tell him, that it is both a very rude, unmannerly <hi>Word;</hi> and most commonly, as applyed by him, a very <hi>false Charge.</hi> As for the rudeness of it, since he owns himself a <hi>Son of the Church</hi> of England, I think he would be much his own Friend, if he would remember the Reprimand given him by his old <hi>Acquaintance</hi> and <hi>Antagonist Dr.</hi> Owen; who in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 72. having, upon occasion of some of his profane Scoffs, called him <hi>Goodly Son of the Church of</hi> England! Immediately subjoyns, <hi>That he intended it not as a Reflexion upon the Church it self,</hi> but only <hi>to remind this Man of his Relation to that Church, Which</hi> (he there says) <hi>to his Knowledge, taught better Learning and better Manners.</hi> In the next place, as for the falseness of the Charge in his usual application of this Word, I would have him know, That the Charge of <hi>Nonsense</hi> does not properly lie against every one who asserts a false Proposition, or is guilty of a mistake. For <hi>Nonsense</hi> is not properly opposed to strict <hi>Truth,</hi> but to such plain and manifest <hi>Truth</hi> as is obvious to <hi>Common sense.</hi> For <hi>Truth</hi> oftentimes lies deep, and abstruse, and requires a more than ordinary sagacity to reach and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:101779:199"/>
fetch it out; which that low Pitch of Reason, which we call <hi>Common sense,</hi> cannot always do. For in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse a Man may be sometimes mistaken in laying his Foundation or Principle, and yet be very Clear and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional in the Consequences he draws from it; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he may fail in drawing Consequences from a True and well-laid Principle; in both which cases, the whole Discourse is certainly False and Inconsistent: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less (according to the common acception of the Word) this cannot be called <hi>Nonsense.</hi> It may indeed be called Error or Mistake; which is a weakness cleaving too close to Humane Nature, for any one of the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to reproach another for it. But on the contrary, if every Thing, that is not strict Demonstration and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Truth,</hi> must pass for <hi>Nonsense,</hi> I fear, it would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlay whole Volumes, and not only prevent the 2d. 3d. and 4th. <hi>Editions</hi> of many Books, but shrewdly also endanger the <hi>Sale</hi> of the <hi>First:</hi> Especially if 2d. and 3d. by the unlucky escape of some scattering Copies, should chance all to appear in the space of Three or Four Days, As in the first Publication of a certain Book Entituled, <hi>The Case of Allegiance,</hi> &amp;c. it fell out. But great, no doubt, is the Art of Bestowing several Title-Pages, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting <hi>divers Editions,</hi> upon Books of one and the same Impression: And may serve to teach the World, what a fruitful Thing the Press is, when impregnated by the <hi>Prolifick Genius</hi> of some Writers; and that (when it is for the credit of any extraordinary <hi>Book</hi> and it's <hi>Author)</hi> it can bring forth <hi>four, five,</hi> or <hi>six</hi> Editions of it at the same time. Which certainly is a most Ingenious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance; but whether it were the <hi>Author</hi>'s or the <hi>Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller</hi>'s, is a Question; though some think, it uses to be done by a kind of <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> between both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:101779:200"/>
But to return to the Point in hand. According to the common use of the Word <hi>Nonsense,</hi> He, who Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Things obvious to the ordinary Apprehensions of Men, with gross and palpable Contradictions of one thing to another, or with a plain, manifest Incoherence of one part of his Discourse with the other, that Man is properly and justly chargeable with <hi>Nonsense.</hi> And let those (in the Name of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason)</hi> take it to themselves, who have most claim to it.</p>
            <p>But because the best way of Illustrating Things is by example. I shall also take this course here. Thus for instance. For any one to own a Thing for a <hi>great and sacred Mystery</hi> (the very Notion and use of the word <hi>Mystery</hi> importing something <hi>Hidden and Abstruse)</hi> and at the same time to affirm it to be very <hi>Plain, Easie</hi> and <hi>Intelligible,</hi> is <hi>Nonsense.</hi> To say, That in Men <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> are <hi>Commensurate;</hi> nay, That <hi>Knowledge is Power;</hi> so that whatsoever a <hi>Man knows how to do,</hi> he is by vertue thereof <hi>also able to do it,</hi> is contrary to the <hi>Common Sense</hi> of all Mankind, and consequently <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense.</hi> To say, <hi>A Beast is a Person,</hi> and yet to say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>That a Person and an Intelligent substance are Terms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal,</hi> is both <hi>Nonsense,</hi> and <hi>Contradiction too,</hi> with a Witness. To affirm, <hi>That a specifical Unity can make any Thing or Person Numerically One,</hi> is <hi>Nonsense.</hi> To affirm, <hi>That there are two distinct</hi> Reasons <hi>and two distinct</hi> Wills <hi>in each Man, and those as really distinct, as if the same Man had Two distinct Souls,</hi> is <hi>Nonsense.</hi> And to affirm, <hi>That the Body</hi> (which is utterly void of any Intellectual Power or Faculty) <hi>is conscious to all the Dictates and Commands of the Will,</hi> is gross and inexcusable <hi>Nonsense.</hi> So that whereas this Author (according to his mannerly way) charges his Adversary with <hi>unintelligible Nonsense,</hi> p. 227.
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:101779:200"/>
l. 6. it must needs be granted, that he has much the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of him in this Particular; since all must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that his own <hi>Nonsense</hi> is very <hi>Intelligible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I could easily direct him where he may be supplyed with several more such Instances, as those newly alledged; but that I think these may suffice for the Purpose they are produced for. In the mean time I would advise him for the future to use this rude Word more sparingly, and cautiously; and to apply it only where the generally received way of speaking applies it: And now and then also to cast his Eye upon his own Writings. These things, I say, I would advise him to; and to consider withal, how unreasonable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just it is, for him to bestow about the <hi>Word</hi> so freely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, while he keeps the <hi>Thing</hi> to himself.</p>

            <p>I AM at length come to a close of that Work, which I should much more gladly have been Prevented, than engag'd in, by being a <hi>Reader,</hi> rather than the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of a Reply to this Man's strange, unjustifiable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations upon this great Article of our Religion. But it is now a considerable Time that the Book, here Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverted upon, has walked about the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any publick Control; And though in private Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse generally censur'd by all, yet, (as to the Point undertook by me) hitherto Answered by none; which may well be Matter of <hi>Melancholy Consideration</hi> to all Hearty Lovers of our Church, and Ancient Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whereas, I dare say, had this Heterodox Piece been wrote and published in a Language understood by Foreigners, we should long since have had several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futations of it sent us from abroad; and probably not without some severe Reflexions upon the <hi>English</hi> Church, and Clergy, for their silence in a Cause, which so loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called for their Defence. To take off therefore this Reproach from our Church (in some degree at least) I have (while others, far more able to <hi>Defend it,</hi> chuse rather to sit still and <hi>enjoy it)</hi> ventur'd to set my weak Hand to the Vindication of a Principal Article of her
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:101779:201"/>
Faith, against the rude Attacks of this bold Undertaker. In which, though I freely own, that all, that has been done by me in it, is extremely below the Dignity of the Subject, which I have employed my self in, yet I am well assured that I have fully and effectually answered this Man; and if it should prove otherwise, I must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it to a peculiar Misfortune attending me; since none besides, has hitherto wrote against him, but has confuted him. In the Work I have here presented the Reader with, I have examined and gone over all that, I conceive, requires either Answer or Remark; and that according to the following Method and Order, which I shall here briefly set down.</p>
            <p>I have, in the first place, laid my Foundation in the Explication and State of the Sense of the Word <hi>Mystery;</hi> which I shew, in General, signifies something <hi>Concealed, Hidden,</hi> or <hi>Abstruse</hi> in <hi>Religious Matters;</hi> and amongst Christian Writers not only that, but something also nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Discoverable</hi> nor <hi>Comprehensible</hi> by bare Reason: According to which, I shew, that this Author's frequent affirming, that his <hi>Hypothesis</hi> and Explication of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> rendred the Notion thereof very <hi>Plain, Easie,</hi> and <hi>Intelligible,</hi> was utterly incompatible with the <hi>Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> of the same. I shew also upon what absurd Grounds he stated the Nature of a <hi>Contradiction;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, joyned with another of his Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I shew, That no Man could be justly charged with <hi>Contradiction,</hi> though he discoursed never so incoherent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and falsely upon any Subject whatsoever. From hence I proceeded to consider the <hi>Ancient Terms</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly received and used by <hi>Councils, Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> in speaking of the <hi>God-head</hi> and <hi>Trinity,</hi> which this Author in his Book had confidently and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowedly condemned, as <hi>obscuring</hi> and <hi>confounding</hi> Men's
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:101779:202"/>
Notions about these great Matters; and upon a distinct Explication of each of them, I shew the Propriety and singular usefulness of them, both against all his Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and above those other Terms, which he would needs substitute in their Room: And under the same Head, I laid open the Contradiction of his <hi>Vindication</hi> and his late <hi>Apology</hi> to one another, as I had done before in my Discourse about the Nature of a <hi>Mystery.</hi> From hence I passed to his New Notions of <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Mutual-Consciousness;</hi> in the strength of which two Terms he pretended to make a <hi>Trinity in Unity</hi> a <hi>plain, easie, and intelligible Notion;</hi> nay so very <hi>plain, as to solve</hi> 
               <note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>all Difficulties about it;</hi> these being his very words. And as he pretended <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> to be the <hi>formal consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent</hi> Reason of <hi>Personality</hi> Universally, both in Beings Create and Uncreate. I first Demonstrated the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Created Beings; and that both from the general Reason of Things, and from Two manifest Instances; and withal examined and confuted several extremely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd Propositions, and Assertions advanced by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Personality.</hi> From this I passed on, and proved that neither could this <hi>Self-Consciousness</hi> be the formal Reason of Personality in the Divine Persons, shewing the impossibility thereof by several clear and unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Arguments. And in the next place, with the same Evidence of Reason I proved, That <hi>Mutual-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness</hi> could not be the Ground or Reason of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Coalescence of the Three Divine Persons in one and the same Divine Nature; and all this upon known, allowed Principles of Philosophy, as well as Divinity. And so I Naturally went on to the examination of that monstrous Assertion of his, by which he holds and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Three Divine Persons to be Three distinct <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Minds or Spirits;</hi> which I shew unavoidably and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:101779:202"/>
irrefragably inferr'd them to be <hi>Three Gods;</hi> It being impossible for the God-head, which is essentially <hi>One single Infinite Mind or Spirit,</hi> to be multiplyed into three distinct <hi>Infinite Minds or Spirits,</hi> without being multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed into as many <hi>Gods.</hi> This Opinion of his, I shew, was easie enough to be confuted; But for all that, I must here add further, that for the insufferable Scandal of it, it is much fitter to be <hi>censured</hi> by a <hi>Convocation,</hi> though even he himself (since <hi>John Goodwin</hi> and <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> are gone off) should be <hi>Prolocutor</hi> of it. After this, since he had the Confidence to vouch his Hypothesis <hi>for the constant Doctrine of the Fathers and the Schools,</hi> I first proved it quite otherwise in the Point of <hi>Self-Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and in his Assertion of Three <hi>distinct Infinite Minds;</hi> For the latter of which he quoted <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> Fathers, and <hi>One</hi> Sentence out of one <hi>Schoolman,</hi> viz. <hi>P. Lombard</hi> (which, one would think, was far from proving it the <hi>constant Doctrine</hi> either of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>the Schools)</hi> and yet even these very Quotations, I shew were no more to his Purpose, than if he had alledged them to prove that twice Three makes Twenty. And as for <hi>Self-Consciousness,</hi> which is one of the Two main Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or Members of his Hypothesis, he does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, nor so much as mention one <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>School-man</hi> in the behalf of it; so exact is he in proving his <hi>Doctrine</hi> the very <hi>same</hi> with Theirs. And then, in the next place, for the proof of his <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> from the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>School-men,</hi> I have distinctly considered his Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for it, and forming them into Arguments (such as the matter would afford) found them the saddest woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest things to be called by that Name, that perhaps ever appeared in the World, since Argumentation was in use. And to complete his excellent and peculiar way of Arguing from the <hi>Fathers</hi> (for not so much as one <hi>School-man</hi>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:101779:203"/>
is cited in favour of <hi>Mutual-Consciousnsss)</hi> his whole business, I shew, was to reproach the <hi>Fathers</hi> as neither <hi>able to conceive</hi> rightly of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> nor yet <hi>express</hi> themselves Properly and Intelligibly about the same; and all this, because they neither conceived of it, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed it, according to his Terms and Hypothesis, which yet he affirmed to be the <hi>Constant Avowed Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of those very Fathers;</hi> though (God help them, poor Men) they were not so <hi>happy,</hi> as to know it. And this, I hope all the World will acknowledge, to be a most extraordinary way of proving a Thing from the Authority of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> by thus representing them as a Company of Dolts, who neither knew how <hi>to think</hi> or <hi>speak,</hi> as they should, upon the subject which they were professedly treating of. Upon which Head, having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished my Answer as to the main Point I first engaged in, I proceeded to mark out, and Animadvert upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his <hi>Paradoxical</hi> Absurd Assertions, both in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity and Philosophy. And I did not only alledge them for such, but also by the most commonly received and current Principles of both, effectually proved them such; and I refer it to any Man of clear and impartial Sense, upon a survey of the Particulars there distinctly examined and remarked upon, to pass as Judge between this Author and my self, whether the Proof falls at all short of the Charge. Next to which, because of his Insolent Reflexions upon some Learned Men, I took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to consideration also his <hi>vocabular</hi> Sins, and manifold <hi>Transgressions</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> of Grammar and Philology: And whereas he had vilified his Adversary as <hi>having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Greek <hi>nor</hi> Latine, I shew, that albeit the Charge had been never so true, yet that he was one of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fittest Persons living to make it, for some certain Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons fairly presented to him in that Chapter. And lastly
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:101779:203"/>
to bring up the Rear of all, I thought it expedient to lay open the Temper of the Man, and his way of Writing; His Immoderate Applauses of himself above all <hi>before</hi> him, or <hi>about</hi> him, together with his disdainful Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that come in his way, as if they were not worthy to <hi>carry his Books after him.</hi> Though (by what some of them have Wrote against him) it appears, that they have made too good use of their <hi>own Books,</hi> to be fit <hi>to carry his.</hi> In fine, I have in my Perusal of this Man's Writings, with the utmost exactness I was able, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his way of speaking both of himself, and others; and upon the result of all do most seriously and sincerely affirm, That never did I (nor perhaps any one else) meet with so much confidence with so thin a Bottom to support it; and yet surely that Man ought to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a very broad and firm Bottom indeed, who ventures to defie all the World.</p>
            <p>And thus, to relieve the Reader's Memory, I have given him this brief draught or Scheme of the whole Work. In which, as it is this Author alone, whom I have undertook, so I think fit to declare, That if any one besides him, shall attempt an answer to this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I shall not in the least trouble or concern my self about him, whosoever he be; but if this Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self shall be disposed to defend his New Notions and Hypothesis by a just and Scholastick Reply to what I have here offered against them, I will not fail (God affording me such a measure of Health and Strength as may enable me for Study) to attend his Motions upon this Subject, as soon, and as often as he pleases. For I can hardly perswade my self that I have yet paid him all, that I owe him. Nevertheless I must leave this Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition with him, That I neither can, nor shall account such a Pamphlet, as his late <hi>Apology,</hi> a just and sufficient Answer to these <hi>Animadversions.</hi>

In the mean time, since the Reverend Dr. <hi>J. W.</hi> (spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the preceding Chapter) in his <hi>Letters</hi> about the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and <hi>W. I.</hi> another very Learned Person, in his 2d. <hi>Letter</hi> to the said Doctor, upon the same subject, have both of them been pleased to commend this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>for several excellent Things in this Book,</hi> I do with <note place="margin">An humble Address to the Learned Doctor <hi>J. W.</hi> and <hi>W. I.</hi>
               </note> the greatest earnestness of Entreaty, as well as with the profoundest deference of Respect to their great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beg of them, that they would by a kind of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Benefaction to such low, and mean Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as mine, vouchsafe to point out in particular, what <hi>those excellent Things</hi> are, and in what part of his Book they may be found; and whether I have hit upon any of them in my <hi>Three</hi> immediately foregoing Chapters. For I have read the Book over and over; as (after I had took up Thoughts of Answering it) it concerned me, in all Reason, to do. And I do thereupon solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profess, that, according to the best of my poor Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that ordinary Measure of Learning which God has vouchsafed me, I can hardly find throughout the whole Work (unless perhaps, here and there a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage or two against the <hi>Socinians)</hi> so much as one True, Through Stroke either in <hi>Divinity,</hi> or <hi>Philosophy,</hi> or <hi>Logick,</hi> or even in <hi>Grammar;</hi> and I confidently appeal to the ingenuous, and unbyass'd Reader, whether I have not in the foregoing <hi>Animadversions</hi> given very pregnant and particular Instances of this Author's gross Defects in every one of these. And therefore my poor Opinion and Advice is, That if these two Learned Men are resolved to persist in their Commendations of this Author (as there is nothing by which they can oblige him more) and withal to commend him upon sure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Grounds, they would hereafter wave all the forementioned Topicks of Commendation, and pitch
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:101779:204"/>
upon his true excellency by commending him for his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment;</hi> for that certainly is very commendable.</p>
            <p>And now, that I am taking my Leave of my Reader, (for this time at least) that I may not leave him with any just Distaste or Grudge in his Mind against me, as if I had treated this Man too severely, I do assure him, that nothing has been here utter'd by Chance; or in the heat of any present passion, but upon a due, calm, and sedate Consideration of what he had said <hi>falsly</hi> of others, as a Warrant for what was to be <hi>truly</hi> said of him. And I do further assure the Reader, That I would by no means have treated a Candid, Civil, and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Adversary, at the Rate, I have treated him, who has shewn no sign of any one of these Qualifications, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Writings or Behaviour. And therefore tho' to <hi>accept Persons</hi> be a Fault in the Sight of God and Man, yet certainly to <hi>distinguish</hi> them is none. I have used him, as I found him; and for what I found him, he may thank himself.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, he has carried on an Offensive War with most that have Wrote; and there are very few, whom he has not, one way or other, struck at and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. So that the Matter being in effect brought to this point, Whether He shall be too hard for the World, or the World for Him? I hope it will not be long in decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He has for a great while, and in a very Audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner been preying, and privateering upon many a Worthy and Good Name, and as far as he was able made prize of the Reputation of Men better than Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: And therefore it is now high time for such to think of repaying the good Turns done them, and for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured World to retaliate upon the Lawless <hi>Aggressor.</hi> For this is, and has been the <hi>Custom of Nations;</hi> and all
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:101779:205"/>
must grant it to be a most just, equal, and allowed Course; and since it is so, 'tis to be hop'd, that this is not the last <hi>Reprisal</hi> that will be made upon Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the most Holy and Blessed Trinity, Three Glorious Persons in one and the same Undivided God-head, be rendred and ascribed all Honour and Praise, Thanksgiving and Adoration, now and for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> Amen.</p>
