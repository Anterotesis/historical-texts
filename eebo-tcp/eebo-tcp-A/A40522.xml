            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHAT prompted me, after ſo many Years Silence,
to expoſe this Piece to the World, was not ſo
much the Old Topick, Importunity of ſome, as
the Impertinencies of others; there being more than Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Queries now by me, to which I was preſſed for Anſwers, and
wherein I found a neceſſity, if I declined this Work, to appear
from other Hands in Print. This then was the firſt and chief
Cauſe; reſting all that while content, that many Foreigners had
their Memoirs tranſlated, whereby I thought my ſelf excuſed
this Task; moſt of whom, I had either ſeen or heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Sea, but never had read any of their Works, nor knew of
their Intentions to declare themſelves to the World: Finding
therefore on my Return, that they had been before-hand with
me, I did believe it almoſt impoſſible, ſo many writing on the
ſame Subject, ſhould not in many, and the moſt material Points
eſpecially, if they followed Truth, relate the ſame things; which
made me ſtill deſiſt, ſuppoſing it a loſt Labour.</p>
            <p>But at laſt, conſidering thoſe Travellers before me had few
of them been in thoſe Parts where I had been, or at leaſt not
dwelt ſo long there, I venture to offer ſome Novelties, either paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
over by them, or elſe not ſo thoroughly obſerved.</p>
            <p>And indeed, this being the firſt of this kind I know of, wrote by
our own Countrymen, ſince the Ingenious Sir <hi>Thomas Herbert,</hi>
I hope it may find the more favourable Acceptance; ſince it bears
no other Deſign than the Good of my Country, ſetting before
them the True State of their Trade in <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:53433:4"/>
The reclaiming of Atheiſts, by leading them firſt to behold
the Beauty, Order, and admirable Diſpoſition of the Univerſe,
and then to ſee if they can ſo far abuſe their Reaſon, to deny
the Author; which if they ſhould, the <hi>Indians,</hi> how barbarous
ſoever eſteemed by them, are to be preferred before them for
Men of Senſe; who out of the very Principles of Nature,
keep to that Law written on their Minds, <hi>That there is a God
to be ador'd;</hi> and rather than be without, will frame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
one of their own creating; which Depravity of theirs
while Atheiſts deride, they admoniſh them of as great an Error
in owning none.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, To inform thoſe buſy Tranſlators, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
of our own Nation is not fallen beneath that of <hi>France,</hi>
whoſe Language and Manners we ſo ſervilely affect, as to think
nothing Excellent or <hi>Alamode,</hi> which has not a <hi>French</hi> Dreſs;
but that it ſtill is in the Power of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to retrieve their
former Renown both by Pen and Sword: <hi>Tam Marti quam
Mercurio.</hi> Nor will any <hi>Engliſhman</hi> accuſe me of Self-Confidence
or Arrogance, when it is a Juſtice only intended my
Country againſt its Decriers; nor in the leaſt to undervalue the
Authors or the Books tranſlated, but to whet our Endeavours to
equalize, if not outdo them.</p>
            <p>As to the Method I have taken, it is unconfin'd (it being
the Privilege of a Traveller) not bounded with the narrow
Terms of an Hiſtorian, nor looſely extravagant, like Poetical
Fictions, but ſuited both to Time and Place, and agreeable to
the Nature of the Relation: And herein I have followed <hi>Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bequius;</hi>
which though it may make ſome Unevenneſs in the
Stile, as where the Ruggedneſs of the Ways interpoſe, or the
Subject-matter is varied, it muſt happen, yet the Warp quite
through is moſt of the ſame Thread; which being the Clue to ſo
many and intricate Meanders, trodden by a few, I am the more
pardonable when I ſlip: Though I do declare my deſire is, To
ſhew my Diligence in collecting, and Sincerity in compiling what
may make the Road more eaſy to the next Adventurers, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
the preſent Enquirers.</p>

                  <p>IN the Afternoon I went aſhore, which was near two Miles from

its freſh Current into the Salt Sea; the Beach was ſandy, and
eaſy going aſhore.<note place="margin">The Natives accoſt us with their Wares.</note> Here met us whole Troops of the Natives with
their ſeveral Wares, ſome offering us Cocoes, others Oranges and

ſeen in <hi>England</hi> to be ſold; and all at the price of a cleanly
Rag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a Bunch of Ribbons.</p>
                  <p>Before us in a Valley was a moſt ſtately Grove of Cocoes and<note place="margin">A ſtately Grove.</note>
Oranges (through which ran the Stream our Men filled their Casks
with Water) ſurrounded with a Wall.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of which Trees, ſo much celebrated for its uſefulneſs,
deſerves as much for the pleaſure it affords the Sight. It grows with
an upright, tall, and ſlender Body, the Bark of an Aſh colour, lori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated;
not ſending any Branches forth till it come to its chiefeſt
Summit, where it ſpreads its ſhady Branches with ſome reſemblance
to our <hi>Oſmond</hi> Royal Fern,<note place="margin">Of the Cocoe Tree, its beauty and uſefulneſs.</note> but more like the Palm; and under theſe
protects its weighty Fruit; which hang very thick round about the
Tree, to which it yields but one Stalk, but that fit to ſupport its ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs;
every Moon produces a freſh Harveſt both of Fruit and
Boughs; the firſt being gathered, the others being thruſt off when
ſapleſs by the young ones: If the Juicy ones be wounded, there diſtills
an heady Liquor, which they preſerve in Earthen Pots fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, but that ſpoils their bearing Nuts. Next to the Stalk it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows
a Calix, not differing (only in bigneſs, and that it is ſmoother)
from that of our Acorn; from which proceeds the Rind of a lighter
Green, under which a fibrous ſubſtance preſents its ſelf, which might
ſupply them with Utenſils, for Roaps and Sails; beneath which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
a ſpacious brown Shell, proper for many Neceſſaries, big
enough for a Drinking Cup, a Ladle, and many more; ſerving them
for the chief part of their Houſholdſtuff: Encloſed in this is a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Meat, white in Colour, cloathed with a pithy matter, as our
Haſle-nuts, and not inferiour to them in Taſte; this they chuſe for
their ordinary Nouriſhment. Nor does it afford them a leſs grateful
emulſion, contained in the Nut to the quantity of a Pint, or Pint
and half; in colour like Whey, and of that conſiſtency, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
far excelling.</p>
                  <p>When the Meat of the Nut grows rancid, they expreſs an Oyl
ſerviceable for their Lamps.</p>
                  <p>Thus abundantly has Providence furniſhed them from this one
Root. The figure of the Fruit, take it intire, is oval, and as big as
the largeſt Melons.</p>

                  <p>They ſaluted us with the civility of the Hat, and Congeed to the

but no Caſements, built with Mud and Stone, as all their Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

                  <p>They invite us with an Hubble-bubble (ſo called from the noiſe it

which were placed in a Military Order here and there: Nearer the

And now we began to think of returning, when we met with

all but our own Fleet, with a brisk Gale we gave our Ships
head to the <hi>Eaſtward</hi> of the <hi>South;</hi> whereby we came nearer to the
Coaſt of <hi>Africa;</hi> the <hi>Northern Monſoons</hi> (if I may ſo ſay, being

we are forced to ſteer more <hi>Eaſterly,</hi> either to fetch a Wind to croſs the
<hi>Aequator,</hi> or gain a Side-wind from the conſtant ones to carry us to
<hi>Braſil.</hi> For which cauſe thoſe Ships bound for St. <hi>Helen</hi>'s from
<hi>Europe,</hi> muſt come into the Latitude of 28 deg. <hi>South,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> before they can bend their Courſe
thither, though in a direct Line it would cut off three quarters
of the way.</p>
               <p>When we were in four degrees of the Line, and Longitude from
St. <hi>Iago</hi> 7 deg. 22 min. <hi>Eaſt,</hi> (renewing thence our Meridian) we
became ſubject to the moſt parching Heat of the Torrid Zone; whoſe
Effects were ſo much the more outragious, by as much as the Winds
ſhrank upon us from off the Coaſt of <hi>Ginea</hi> (which we drew nigh
to) and had left us at a ſtand, the uſual Treatment hereabouts,
imputed to the ſcarcity of Mountains on that vaſt Tract of ground:
Inſomuch,<note place="margin">Near the Coaſt of <hi>Ginea</hi> met the <hi>Tornados.</hi>
                  </note> that we lay wholly at the mercy of the two unruly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Fire and Water; the one aſſailing us with flaſhy Lightnings,
and horrid Noiſes, breaking forth the Airy Region; the other pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on us whole Streams of unwholſome and dangerous Flouds,
when they fall in Spouts, (which are frequent here:) Nay the kindeſt
and the ſofteſt downfal on our Bodies is productive of Vermin, ſuch
as Flies, and Maggots, if our Cloaths be not quickly dried and
ſhifted; (theſe Seaſons the Seamen term the <hi>Tornados.</hi>)</p>
               <p>But above all, when theſe had played their parts, the ſcorching
<hi>Sun</hi> making towards us with his fiery Face made us almoſt breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs:

In this remedileſs Condition we lay,<note place="margin">Chap. II.</note> till Heaven pitying our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing

<hi>Eaſt.</hi> And now we were to the <hi>Northward</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> four degrees,
with whom circling a little <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in nine days time we were in a

               <p>Before we leave this Ecliptick Circle, we muſt obſerve at the

but once; beyond them never; becauſe hence may naturally be
collected all the Seaſons of the whole Year; unleſs ſome accidental
Cauſe, as the Interpoſition of Mountains, Headlands, Lakes, or ſuch

               <p>But in his Solar Progreſs Through the twelve Signs, the <hi>Sun</hi>
always carries Rain along with him, its Heat otherwiſe could not
be endured; for which reaſon, the firſt Contriver and Former of all
things,<note place="margin">The Courſe of the <hi>Sun</hi> through the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> the cauſe of the Seaſons of the Year.</note> has ordained the wet Seaſon a <hi>Winter</hi> to thoſe inhabit here, and
to them as dreadful as our cold Seaſons to us (which we ſhall evidence
more experimentally when we come to live among them): On this
account is it, that under the Line two <hi>Winters</hi> and two <hi>Summers</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53433:20"/>
alternately ſucceed, but not above three quarters of that length as
the one at each Tropick, they continuing four Months together;
to wit, four Months <hi>Winter,</hi> as many <hi>Summer,</hi> and the other four
Months moderate or cold Weather; though nearer the Line, the
Rule holds not good as to the cool Weather, for that cauſe more
frequently viſited with Wet than the Sunſhine.</p>
               <p>Our Men at length tired with ſalt Proviſions, began to be ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious

one, of a brave ſhining Colour, with ſpiked Fins; but the other
preferred by the Palate, bearing the make of our Jacks; both of

               <p>There is another Fiſh they call a <hi>Stone-Baſs,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Hitherto having kept moſtly a <hi>South-Weſt</hi> Courſe, furthered in

                  <note place="margin">Gales from the <hi>Weſt</hi> to reach the <hi>Cape.</hi>
                  </note> near the Latitude of

               </p>
               <p>It is obſervable here,<note place="margin">The Current of the Sea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wind.</note> that the Sea had a contrary Courſe with the
Wind, preſumed to proceed from its blowing ſo long in one Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and now not altered ſo long as to be powerful enough to turn
the Current of the Waters.</p>
               <p>Gaining upon the <hi>Eaſt</hi> with a ſlow pace, we met with thoſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

               <p>Three Months being near conſumed, we were at laſt accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with long lookt for <hi>Weſtern</hi> Blaſts, and now we fly afore the
Wind: But by the way take notice a <hi>South-Weſt</hi> Wind becomes as

the Year being undergone in this time, we may begin to calculate
our Ephemeris afreſh; and as a fit Platform, <hi>Eaſter</hi> Holy-days bring
with them ſuch Weather as is eſſential to Chriſtide.</p>
               <p>But bidding Adieu to theſe Fancies, the Wind that till now ſeemed
to dally, proves in good earneſt, and begins a frowning <hi>April,</hi>
driving the trembling Sea on heaps, and on them piling more, till
the ſwelling Surges menace the lowering Skies, leaving a Hollow
where they borrowed their Gigantine vaſtneſs, as if they were
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53433:20"/>
intended to exenterate the Treaſures of the Deep. At top of which
'twas dreadful to behold the angry Surface of the foaming Billows,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Winter</hi> Storms and Tempeſts attend us to the Cape.</note>
deſcending down beneath no leſs uncomfortable, when the Vans of
the next Ships (though groveling with a neighbouring Wave)
could not be diſcerned.</p>
               <p>This toſſing Condition laſted long, and was taken kindly too,
as long as we ſpooned before the Sea, and kept from running foul
of one the other; but when a Fret of Wind rowled the Waves
athwart our Quarters, it made our Ship ſhake, proving the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her Sides, where had ſhe given way never ſo little, we muſt
have ſunk without Bail or Mainprize. Still the Tempeſt encreaſes,
and brings with it Guſts of Rain and diſmal darkſome Weather,
whereby we were ſeparated from the reſt of our Fleet: For all, we
put our Lights abroad as did they, yet in the badneſs of the
Night we loſt them, and were left alone to ſhift with the boiſterous
Winds.</p>
               <p>At laſt the Morn appears,<note place="margin">We and the <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Fleet for two Days.</note> but with the Symptoms of a blowing
Day. She had not wafted many Hours, but on the advantage of a
riſing Wave, we ſpied a Sail to Leeward with her Fore-top-maſt by
the Board, which at Noon we knew to be the <hi>Caeſar</hi> crowding under
all its Sails.</p>
               <p>In this Encounter we ſhipped many a perilous Sea, (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being well-drenched our ſelves): Such was the force of this
Nights Storm, that our Boat, and ſome of our Men, were not
without difficulty reſtrained from being carried over-board. In
this pickle we reeled out this Day, and out-ſtretching the <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
we made what Sail we durſt, and by the next Light had ſight of
our Fleet, who ſhortning Sail, we came up with them, to whom
we declared the misfortune of the <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and that it bore <hi>South-Weſt;</hi>
wherefore they lay by, (the Wind ſlackning) and in half an
hour we ſaw the Hull, and preſently after it made up our Company
compleat again.</p>
               <p>Near the middle of this Month we could have made that known
Cape, the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi>

But the <hi>Dutch</hi> having ſome Forts there, it was thought no good
Policy; wherefore veering to the <hi>South,</hi> the Cape bore <hi>Eaſt-North-Eaſt,</hi>
ſome thirty Leagues off us; for heaving our Dipſy-lead we
were in ſoundings eighty Fathom depth, which the Pilots note to
be in that diſtance.</p>
               <p>Here we made two Sail to Leeward, and one to Windward,
who directed her Courſe with us; but the Wind from the Shore
coming <hi>Eaſt,</hi> they Tacked, and ſhe paſſed without ſpeaking to her:
But the Leeward-moſt came up boldly to us and the <hi>Ann</hi> (we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Aboard one of them, the <hi>Johanna,</hi> a Ship of 700 Tuns laden from
<hi>Bantam,</hi> who told us, That five more were in Company with
them from the Coaſts, but diſperſed by Tempeſts; the other Ship
was the <hi>Bernardiſton;</hi> that which eſcaped us, the <hi>Rebecca.</hi>

They alſo inform'd us, The <hi>French</hi> had worſted the <hi>Flemmings</hi> in

they had beat the <hi>Moors</hi> out of St. <hi>Thomas:</hi> That on our ſide never
a Ship was loſt, as they heard. So likewiſe giving them an Account
of what we knew, with ſome Inſtructions communicated on both
ſides, we left them to take their Courſe, which ſerved them for

which he retains within his Jaws, but ſpouts the Water out with the

from an hole in his Neck, opening after the faſhion of a Mouth or
Slit; at the performance of which Action it contracts its ſelf into
an Orbicular Figure, and again dilates its ſelf in its Diaſtole: The

of Fins, the true mark of Diſtinction for a Whale: The extreme part

the Winds deſcending in deſperate Guſts drive them into the Trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds,

better ſucceſs, and came all ſafe to Anchor under a Lee-ſhore, which
ſufficiently protected them from the Winds by the highth of the

Ruins, nothing remaining but the Marks of former Induſtry (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
the <hi>Portugals</hi>) here being left Walls of an huge thickneſs,
compoſed of Stone, and cemented with Lime: To every Houſe a
Portal, but miſerably defaced with Age; the Planks of their Doors
ſewed together, their Buildings not exceeding one Story; againſt
theſe, Lazineſs has ſuggeſted them to lean their Flaggy Manſions:
Flags eſpecially in their Villages (by them called Cajans, being Co-Coe-tree
Branches) upheld with ſome few Sticks, ſupplying both
Sides and Covering to their Cottages. They commonly order their
Model ſo, as to make a Quadrangle with only one Entrance, all the
reſt being cloſed outwards without any Windows; in which every
Houſe of Note on the Right-hand has a ſhady Contrivance, like the
Walks to our Tennis-Courts, but not ſo long; on the upper end of
which ſits the Maſter of the Family on a Bed of Rattans, a kind of
Cane: Here he, with the Steward of his Houſe, are obſerved by

them only a place left for entrance at the Weſt end. They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
Matted on the Floor, though not hung ſo much as with a

very clean. In the Piatzos (for ſuch their Porches had)
ſtands on the Right-hand a ſquare Stone Ciſtern, full of Water; and
the whole without any Doors always open. The Nobler of the Two

                  <p>Having given you the Deſcription thus far,<note place="margin">The King's Court.</note> I muſt crave leave
for my Error, in not giving it the Style of Regal before now: For
it proves to be the Seat of one of their Kings, which I had almoſt
forgot, had not my greedy Eye eſpied a Houſe more eminently
ſeated, and more decently covered than the reſt, but the Materials
not much different; only they have allotted him a little more Air
to breath forth his ſwelling Title, King of <hi>Johannah</hi> Town. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
after a ſmall Enquiry, it was manifeſt it was the Palace Royal;
nor did I much doubt it, after we had gained admiſſion; where did
ſit the King in ſtate, at the upper end of ſuch a Place as before was
taken notice of, on a Cott, or Bed, ſtrewed with a Quilt. On a
Bench at each Elbow were placed two of his Nobles by him: We
being introduced, inſtead of Kiſſing his Majeſty's Hand, he took us
one after another moſt graciouſly by the Fiſt, and by the Mouth of
his Interpreter pronounced us heartily welcome, and bad us take our
Seats according to our Qualities; which, after we had put our Hats on,
we did; and the Interpreter with great Reſpect took his on the Floor
crouching in the midſt of us. In this manner, without ſhew of
dread or fear of being miſconſtrued, we talked freely of matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to both our States; as he firſt examining if we had any Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder
or Compaſs-Glaſſes to ſpare him? We ſeconded his Demands
with what regarded Proviſions for our Voyage; for which Licenſe
our Captains are obliged to make him Preſents of Scarlet-cloth, and
other <hi>Europe</hi> Rarities, that they may unmoleſted buy the Bullocks,
Cows, Goats and Hens of his Subjects. Both being at length out of

<hi>Arabick,</hi> we as good <hi>Engliſh</hi> as we could; we had liberty in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval

a large White Turbat, and had as good a White Shirt on his Back;
from his Girdle half way his Legs, a Blue Silk Veſt fringed with
Purple, without Shooes or Stockins to his Feet, which he often
pulling up into his Cott or Couch, would ſmilingly croſs them, and
with his Nails claw off the Dirt. By him lay a Purple Silk Robe,
attended with a Black-guard of ſome a Dozen Slaves; compared
with whom he looked great, and was a comely well Limb'd Perſon,

below which, an odoriferous Plant ſeizes the Smell; and winding
through its ſubtile Meanders, revives the Faculties of the Brain:
Here the flouriſhing Papaw (in Taſte like our Melons, and as big,

now at an Anchor, ſome years paſſed, they filched ſome ſlight

                  <p>To proceed; They are like the Country they live in, innocent;

                  <p>The while we were there, they had a great Veſſel on the Stocks;
Stocks like the Checks to our Long Boats; the Keel of it was a whole
Tree, no otherwiſe fitted than it grew, only the Branches lopped
off. To it, for Stem and Stern, were faſtened two others, ſhorter;
on both ſides Planks ſewed to the main Timbers, with the Thread

I ſaw a Man writing with a Pen made of a Cane, in the bottom of
a Bowl beſmeared over with black; conſidering a-while, at length I

               <p>At firſt the King rejected him, as having no promiſing look; ſtill
<hi>Siegmanjaffa</hi> interceded, and deſired his Lord to allow him like a

Which condeſcended to, a <hi>Brachmin</hi> (who are become the Farmers
of the King's Rents) was diſpatched to offer him the Loan of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
which he willingly accepted of, and therewith put himſelf into
an handſome Equipage, both for Apparel and Attendants (which
ſpecious Shews recommend here more than profoundneſs of parts)
and withal Fed and Whored (which is a great point of Manhood) as
well as the beſt of them. Wherefore after a ſhort time he was again
brought into the King's Preſence, who now began to have ſome
hopes of him; and therefore to try him farther, he gave him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
ſupply of Money; and bad <hi>Siegmanjaffa</hi> put him on ſome lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Enterprize in his Army, of which <hi>Siegmanjaffa</hi> was General;
which he undertook with much Alacrity, and behaved himſelf with
that Gallantry, that at length the Old King ſent him a Tipſtaff with
a Royal Robe, requiring him to come to Court in one of the King's
own <hi>Palenkeens:</hi> At which he was diſmay'd, Saying he ſhould never

               <p>However, by <hi>Siegmanjaffa</hi>'s encouragement he apparelled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

liſted. His Body is a Symetrical Deformity (if I may ſo ſay);
the Hanches and Quarters clapt together ſeem ſo many heaps; his
Neck ſhort, flapping Ears like Scates, little-Eye'd, a broad Face,
from which drops his <hi>Proboſcis</hi> or Trunk, thruſting it out, or ſhriveling

be a Judgment on them, as the Generation of the Aſſaſſins and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
of the Bleſſed Apoſtle St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> one of whom I ſaw at
<hi>Fort St. George.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Within the Walls ſeven Churches anſwer to as many Gates; the
Rubbiſh of whoſe ſtupendious Heaps do juſtify the truth of what is
predicated in relation to its priſtine State.</p>
                  <p>The Builders of it were the <hi>Portugals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Confounders the <hi>Moors,</hi> who ſurprized them wallowing in
their Wealth and Wantonneſs.</p>
                  <p>The preſent Competitors are the <hi>French,</hi> who are very unlikely to
keep it (not for want of Valour, but for that few and unprovided,
are not able long to reſiſt multitudes) the <hi>Moors,</hi> and thirdly, the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> whoſe Intereſts are to deſtroy the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>India;</hi> Which
the <hi>French</hi> foreſeeing, had wiſely ſolicited a Truce with <hi>Gulconda,</hi>
and had hopes of that King's complying, till the Arrival of the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> when they could not be heard. For conſidering a Kindneſs
extorted not ſo obliging as that freely offered, and his Honour at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
by their Swords being ſtill in their hands, he cloſed with
the Hatred of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> for their final Extirpation.</p>
                  <p>Before which be accompliſhed, he may chance to find it an hard
Task, eſpecially had the <hi>French</hi> and hopes of Succours: For now
they are 600 ſtrong in the Fort and Ships, all ſtout Fellows, every
Soldier fit to be a Commander. Their greateſt ſcarcity will be of
Food, with which had not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> privately befriended them,
they could not have ſubſiſted hitherto. Though the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſhould
they have War with <hi>France,</hi> would find them to be an Annoyance to
their Trade: So that were the City again in the hands of the <hi>Moors,</hi>
or even with the Ground, it were better for us.</p>
                  <p>Here it may be queried,<note place="margin">King of <hi>Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda</hi> weak at Sea.</note> Why <hi>Gulconda</hi> being a Potent Prince,
ſhould permit Gariſons to be in the hands of Aliens? To this may be
anſwered, That this of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> was founded when the <hi>Indians</hi>
were naked and unarm'd. But this ſatisfies not the Queſtion, ſince
that the <hi>Moors</hi> having conquered it, they again offered it the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi>
who ſlighted the Propoſitions, unleſs they would reſtore them
their Guns which they carried away with them. The true reaſon
then is this, That <hi>Gulconda,</hi> as all the <hi>Indian</hi> Princes are, is weak at
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53433:39"/>
Sea; therefore it is a Maxim among them to commit their Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
on the Sea-Coaſts to thoſe they can call their Friends, for not
only preventing Invaſions at the Charge and Courage of Foreigners;
but they (not being Abſolute, but ſubject to the Authority of the
<hi>Great Mogul</hi>) upon any Defeat, have theſe Places as ſure Aſylums
of Retreat.</p>
                  <p>Amidſt theſe Scenes of Affairs, what next offers to our View, is
odd in it ſelf, To find an Aptneſs in theſe People to improve all Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

either of Religion or Cuſtoms of the Old World; for they

that end. Before them went the <hi>Brachmins,</hi> making a Noiſe with
their loud Muſick; after them their dancing Wenches (who always
Morning and Evening tumble afore their Gods, which with ſome
Mimical Geſture is all their Dancing) with Ephods of Silk and

the dancing Boys, all naked but a Clout about their Privities, like
the <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Youths that uſed to revel it with <hi>Flora</hi>'s Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus went they in Proceſſion, till they came to a Pageant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

waſhed by a Shower of Water, by the <hi>Brachmins</hi> placed on purpoſe;

Day began to peep, a Thicket of Twenty Sail of our Enemies were
diſcovered ſtemming the flowing Tide at an Anchor. Our Fleet
might have paſſed them without giving Battel; but that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
<hi>Britains</hi> ſcorned to fly, chuſing rather to lye a Battery for
them, than cowardly to flinch: Wherefore they braced their Sails to
the Maſts, and being to Leeward, ſtayed for the Wind which favoured
the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> who coming up with our Fleet, made as if they
would have gone by them; but were intercepted by the headmoſt
of ours: Which perceived by the forwardeſt of theirs, they ſent their
Shallops aboard their Admiral for Orders, for <hi>vis conſilii expers mole

was but too truly the fault of our Commanders, over-confident of

                  <p>When they came back again,<note place="margin">

who after an hours hot diſpute almoſt board and board with one of
their biggeſt Ships, bore off hardly able to keep above water, and
never came in again, having received 80 Shot in her Hull, and
ſome between Wind and Water, ſo that in the Hold there was

The next Ship that behaved her ſelf ſtoutly, was the Admiral's;

                  <p>Therefore on theſe Coaſts the <hi>South Winds</hi> blow for Eight Months,<note place="margin">The <hi>Monſoons</hi> on both Coaſts, and Obſervations thereon.</note>
four of which are <hi>May, June, July, Auguſt.</hi> Then the Sun is ſo

thoſe Vapours which the Sun draws up in the Day; and by decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his exorbitant Heat, leaves them to be condenſated at Night;
when the Air is more groſs, and the Earth is cooled either by thick
Miſts, or a more palpable Moiſture (which you may call pouring

                  <p>That which makes this the more plauſible is, That the <hi>Aſiatick

the Heat by a courſe wet Cloath, continually hanging before

that they can looſe hence their Ships for <hi>Perſia, Maecha</hi> and <hi>Juddah,</hi>

                  <p>Concerning the Regularities of theſe Winds, perhaps ſome others
may give patter Gueſſes than my ſelf, who am not conceited enough

                  <p>And here one thing may be worthy our Curioſity, That after the

to ſwell their Banks, and thereby abundantly to encreaſe the Border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>To go on then from whence we deviated,<note place="margin">What Import this Iſland is to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </note> it is neceſſary you ſhould
be firſt acquainted, That after <hi>Vaſquez de Gama,</hi> in the Year 1547,

they have fondly reported. It ſuffices then, to avoid a Volume of
Diſcourſe, that <hi>Bombaim</hi> with theſe Iſlets continued ſtill in their

if we conſider the different Intereſts, as well as Remoteneſs
of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-India.</hi> It is confeſſed they

they were all Couſin-Germans at leaſt; but for his Commands, if

contrary to their Factions, they value no more than if they were
merely titular; as may appear by what follows. For notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Vice-Roy to a negation; otherwiſe to expect never to

the Commanders of his Majeſty's Ships, who by their own Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
made good Improvements; and the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
began to be ſenſible that their Trade would be impaired in the
vending their Commodities at home, and their Ships in <hi>India</hi> little
bettered by the King's Port in <hi>India;</hi> and above all, they being lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be Sufferers for the Hoſtilities committed by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Officers on the <hi>Indians</hi> (who underſtand no diſtinction between
King and Company) they as freely ſupplicated for, what his Majeſty
was as willing to grant, the Iſland: They holding it, from that time,
of his Majeſty about four years after the King had poſſeſſed it, they
defraying all Charges.</p>
                  <p>In this Exigency on either ſide, the Martial as well as Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
are wholly devolved on the Merchants; and now how they
will manage the Sword as well as the Quill, concernes them.</p>
                  <p>The Old Soldiers are conſtrained to ſubmit,<note place="margin">The Old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſtomach the Yoke of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's Servants.</note> or disband, which
makes them ſtomach a hard Service under harder Maſters: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that natural Antipathy betwixt the Subtilty of the one, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
of the other; the ſtupendious elevation of their Servants
on this new acquired Power thrown into their hands, Men, moſt
of them of no Experience or Education, coming young hither, but
what they learn from a Luxurious and Griping People, whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
quadrates not with a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Militia: It will not be eaſy to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53433:50"/>
conceive, as well from the incoherence of Diſpoſitions, as the Lordly
Government of a Servant, what Grudges or Miſcarriages may be
produced? For where the Soldiers and Generals have different Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
and mutual Obligation is interrupted, the courſe of things
muſt neceſſarily run-counter: Moreover, where they ſhould be moſt
eminent in Dangers and Aſſaults, and lead them on to bold Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes;
yet if a tenderneſs to Self-preſervation ſtep in between the
Publick Honour and Safety, (as it always does, where that bane to
Noble Actions, Covetouſneſs, is concomitant) and which is almoſt
eſſential to a Merchant, a fear of being laught at for venturing too
far; the Caſe is deſperate. For Inſtance, Our Ten Ships, moſt of
them hired by Merchants, and the Commanders ſome of them (not
to ſay all, for there were of them as worthy Men as any in the World)
Principal Owners, were more willing to ſhift for themſelves, than
to hazard a ſtout and unanimous Reſiſtance: Which had they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
boldly, as they imprudently gave the firſt Onſet (by the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
own confeſſion) they had gained a Victory never to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
by them, nor for our Fleet ſufficiently to have been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed;
whereas for want of wiſe Conduct, and a joint Defence, they
impreſſed on themſelves and Nation a Blur never to be wiped off.
Yet ſuch, by the Conſtitution of the Company it ſelf, is the preſent
Misfortune, that inſtant Gain is preferred before Glory or a future emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument;
which is the reaſon, why they are leſs ſolicitous for ſetling
by Power, what they muſt ever be forced to beg, a Trade; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with Injuries, than command a Submiſſion, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> do: But
here alſo being left Tenants at will, they think it enough to leave Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
in no worſe plight than they found it.</p>
                  <p>And here might be conſidered, Whether it were not more for the
Publick Welfare, ſhould His Majeſty be pleaſed to make it a Royal
Company, or a National Concern, as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> is; than to
let it be at the will of the Company under the forementioned Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
to impoſe Governours on the Iſland.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of which was Sir <hi>George Oxendine,</hi>

not long after finiſhing his days, together with his Preſidency at <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,
Goodyeer</hi> haſtens thither in hopes to ſucceed, when gaping for that
which included this, he is excluded of both: Upon which account
there happened an <hi>Interregnum</hi> at <hi>Bombaim;</hi> whereby this Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
grew up into an Anarchy, and ſet upon its weak Limbs a <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuple</hi>

Mr. <hi>James Adams,</hi> Chairman, (outed in two days) Mr. <hi>Sterling,</hi>
a <hi>Scotch</hi> Miniſter, Mr. <hi>Cotes,</hi> Captain <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Houghton;</hi>
who upon the juſt and happy choice of the Honourable <hi>Gerald Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier,</hi>

Mr. <hi>Philip Gyfford</hi> was put in; who deſerves to be remembred for
his great care in raiſing the Baſtions, and in a manner finiſhing,
what always was ſtill but beginning by the reſt. He ruled three Years,
when the Company thinking their Work to go on too faſt, gave the
Charge of Deputy-Governour to Captain <hi>Shaxton,</hi> and an handſome
Recruit of Soldiers; which revived the not yet extinguiſhed Fewd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53433:51"/>
the Merchants and the Soldiers: Whereupon <hi>Shaxton</hi> was kept
from it a full year; and in that Interim, the Preſident diſtaſted at
the Inſolencies of the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Governour at <hi>Surat,</hi> and fearing a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Confuſion of Government at <hi>Bombaim,</hi> together foreſeeing
Clouds gathering from the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> not minding ſo much thoſe
of the Seaſon (the <hi>Muſſoons</hi> being about to enter) inſomuch, that
narrowly eſcaping a Dangerous Voyage, he came and took the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
himſelf in the Year 1671. where theſe three Years he has
regulated Affairs with that Prudence, that whereas he found a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
and Incongruous Council, he has now knit them into a Bond
of at leaſt ſeeming Friendſhip; and does daily ſtudy to advance the
Company's Intereſt, and the good and ſafety of the People under
him.</p>
                  <p>To this the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are witneſs;<note place="margin">Strength of the Iſland.</note> for the Spring before our

to their Boats without any Booty, and the next day hoiſted
Sails (for, ſaid they, <hi>Bombaim</hi> been as ſtark as de Deel) and not
without good reaſon; for within the Fort were mounted 120 Pieces
of Ordnance, and in other convenient Stands 20 more, beſides 60
Field-pieces ready in their Carriages upon occaſion to attend the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi>
and <hi>Bandarines.</hi> To the Fort then belonged 300 <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
400 <hi>Topazes,</hi> or <hi>Portugal</hi> Firemen: To the <hi>Militia</hi> out of <hi>Portugal</hi>

300. Beſides ſome Thouſands more would make a Shew, but
not to be relied on, ſhould it come to the puſh. Moreover in the
Road were riding Three Men of War, the beſt of 30 Guns.</p>
                  <p>Thus were they provided at our Arrival;<note place="margin">The Fort ill contrived.</note> nor were their Forces
leſſened by our coming. Since which a Trench out of the hard Rock
the Fort is founded on, is digging to Moat it with the Sea: And they
are deviſing Horn-works for its better ſecurity; a thing, to ſpeak
truly, of greater undertaking and expence than ever to endure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
by the Company; and without it, it will prove a thing
of ill contrivance, it being ſtraitned for room to receive a ſufficient
number of Defendants, and worſe ſupplied with Water for Store, or
Granaries for Proviſion for a Siege. The firſt Modellers were to
blame in not enlarging it to a Tank that ſtands without the Parade,
which they might have done with almoſt the ſame Charges.</p>
                  <p>From whence let us walk the Rounds.<note place="margin">The Town.</note> At diſtance enough lies the

Oleas of the Cocoe-Trees, all but a few the <hi>Portugals</hi> left, and ſome

                  </p>
                  <p>At the end of the Town looking into the Field, where Cows and

interr'd, where are ſome few Tombs that make a pretty Shew at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring

mightily to be deſired.</p>
                  <p>There are no Freſh Water Rivers,<note place="margin">Freſh Water-ſprings ſcarce.</note> or falling Streams of living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:

Twenty Miles, the Length Eight, taking in <hi>Old Woman's</hi>
Iſland, which is a little low barren Iſland, of no other Profit, but to
keep the Company's Antelopes, and other Beaſts of Delight.</p>
                  <p>The People that live here are a Mixture of moſt of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Countries,<note place="margin">A mixt People.</note> moſt of them Fugitives and Vagabonds, no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
being here taken of them: Others perhaps invited hither
(and of them a great number) by the Liberty granted them in
their ſeveral Religions; which here are ſolemnized with Variety of
Popperies (a Toleration conſiſtent enough with the Rules of Gain),
though both <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Portugals</hi> deſpiſe us for it; here licenſed out
of Policy, as the old <hi>Numidians</hi> to build up the greateſt Empire in
the World. Of theſe, one among another, may be reckoned 60000
Souls; more by 50000 than the <hi>Portugals</hi> ever could. For which
Number this Iſland is not able to find Proviſions, it being moſt of it
a Rock above Water, and of that which is overflowed, little hopes to
recover it. However, it is well ſupplied from abroad both with
Corn and Meat at reaſonable Rates; and there is more Fleſh killed

                  <p>The Government here now is <hi>Engliſh;</hi>

the Climate being extremely Unhealthy; at firſt thought
to be cauſed by <hi>Bubſho,</hi> rotten Fiſh; but though that be prohibited,
yet it continues as Mortal: I rather impute it to the Situation,
which cauſes an Infecundity in the Earth, and a Putridneſs in the
Air, what being produced ſeldom coming to Maturity, whereby
what is eaten is undigeſted; whence follows Fluxes, Dropſy, Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Barbiers (which is an enervating the whole Body, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
able to uſe Hands or Feet) Gout, Stone, Malignant and Putrid

Choice of thoſe to whom Poverty threatens Contempt at home:
What elſe could urge this wretched Remedy? For theſe are untrodden
Paths for Knowledge, little Improvement being to be expected from
Barbarity. Cuſtom and Tradition are only Venerable here; and it
is Hereſy to be wiſer than their Forefathers; which Opinion is both

wants that active Fire that always mounts, as if it were extinguiſh'd

be wholly taken up with ſuch mean (not to ſay indirect) Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations;

reſpect of Commerce it ſeems to offer many Conveniences; the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyans</hi>

which they put the preſent Preſident in ſome hopes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying

but that depending on ſo many Intricacies, muſt be not only a work
of Time, but Power to bring to paſs; as afterwards may fall more

                  <p>Our preſent Concern then is with the <hi>Portugal, Seva Gi,</hi> and the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul:</hi>
From the firſt is deſired no more than a mutual Friendſhip; from
the ſecond, an Appearance only; from the laſt, a nearer Commerce:
The firſt and ſecond become neceſſary for Proviſions for the Belly,
and Building; the third for the Groſs of our Trade: Wherefore
Offices of Civility muſt be performed to each of theſe; but they

not different from the Faſhion of our Noblemens Stables, only at the

(together with two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factors, who were appointed by the

a Clock at Night arrived at <hi>Choul,</hi> a <hi>Portugal</hi> City on the Main,
into which he could not enter, the Gates being ſhut up, and Watch

in order to their more ſpeedy diſpatch, make their Buſineſs known

He then took occaſion to diſcourſe with him concerning the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

And to that effect was daily ſending down more Ordnance, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,

               <p>Our Ambaſſador replied, The Preſident had no other Deſign in

the Miſeries each Party endured, and the general obſtruction
of Trade, occaſioned by the War; but ſince he deſired him to deſiſt
mentioning it to the <hi>Rajah,</hi> he ſhould not trouble him therewith; but
what was more conſiſtent with our own and his Intereſt; which was
the encouraging Trade and Merchandiſe in his Country, and opening
the ways to <hi>Baligaot,</hi> that Merchants might with ſafety bring down
their Goods to Port; which would be much to the <hi>Rajah</hi>'s Profit,
and encreaſe of his Treaſury: And this he recommended to his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

to be a Man of Prudence and Eſteem with his Maſter: So after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſitting he took his leave of him, having firſt preſented him with
a Diamond Ring, for which he expreſſed a liking; and his Eldeſt Son
a Couple of <hi>Pamerins,</hi> which are fine Mantles.</p>

returned from <hi>Purtaabgur,</hi> when the Ambaſſadour ſollicited <hi>Narun
Gi Pundit</hi> to procure his leave to paſs up the Hill into <hi>Rairee</hi> Caſtle:
The next day they receiv'd order to aſcend the Hill into the Caſtle,
the <hi>Rajah</hi> having appointed an Houſe for them; which they did;
leaving <hi>Puncharra</hi> about Three in the Afternoon, they arrived at the
top of that ſtrong Mountain, forſaking the humble Clouds about
Sun-ſet.</p>
               <p>It is fortified by Nature more than Art,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rairce</hi> a ſtrong Hill.</note> being of very difficult
acceſs, there being but one Avenue to it, which is guarded by two
narrow Gates, and fortified by a ſtrong Wall exceeding high, and
Baſtions thereto: All the other part of the Mountain is a direct Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice;
ſo that it's impregnable, except the Treachery of ſome in it
betray it. On the Mountain are many ſtrong Buildings, as the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>'s
Court, and Houſes of other Miniſters, to the number of about
300. It is in length about two Miles and an half, but no pleaſant
Trees, or any ſort of Grain grows thereon. Their Houſe was about
a Mile from the <hi>Rajah</hi>'s Palace, into which they retired with no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

Particulars appointed for them; which they took well ſatisfied with
them; and the <hi>Rajah</hi> aſſured them we might trade ſecurely in all his
Countries without the leaſt apprehenſion of Ill from him, for that
the Peace was concluded. Our Ambaſſadour replied, that was our
Intent; and to that intent the Preſident had ſent him to this Court
to procure the ſame Articles and Privileges we enjoyed in <hi>Indoſtan</hi>
and <hi>Perſia,</hi> where we traded. He anſwered, it is well, and referred
our Buſineſs to <hi>Moro Pundit</hi> his <hi>Peſhua,</hi> or Chancellour, to examine
our Articles, and give an account what they were. He and his Son
withdrew into their private Apartments, to conſult with the <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>

chiefly conſiſted in Abſtinence and Purifying; till which be over, he

ſide, can he force his Subjects to take thoſe Monies whereby they
ſhall be Loſers; but if our Coin be as fine an Allay, and as weighty
as the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s, and other Princes, he will not prohibit it. To the
other he ſays, that it is againſt the Laws of <hi>Conchon</hi> to reſtore any
Ships, Veſſels, or Goods, that are driven aſhore by Tempeſt, or
otherwiſe; and that ſhould he grant us that Privilege, the <hi>French,
Dutch,</hi> and other Merchants, would claim the ſame Right; which
he could not grant without breaking a Cuſtom has laſted many Ages:
The reſt of our Deſires he willingly conceded, embracing with

being to be gotten for them), which he did accordingly, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of half a Goat a Day, which he found very profitable for
him, and thereupon was taken with a Curioſity to viſit his new

had overcome all other Difficulties, occaſioned by the Grant of the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> to the <hi>Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Nevertheleſs this
Fairy Gift was the Ground of a long and tedious Quarrel in each
of the World's Ends; ſo that our Ships encountring with their
<hi>Carracks,</hi> ſeldom uſed to part without the loſs of one or both. Nay,
the long-liv'd People yet at <hi>Swalley,</hi> remember a notable Skirmiſh
betwixt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Portugals</hi> there, wherein they were neatly
intrapp'd; an Ambuſcado of ours falling upon them behind in ſuch
ſort, that they were compelled between them and the Ships in the
Road, to reſign moſt of their Lives; and gave by their Falla me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Name to a Point they yet call <hi>Bloody Point,</hi> for this very
reaſon. But ſince theſe Sores are fortunately bound up in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
Tye betwixt our Sacred King and the Siſter of <hi>Portugal,</hi> laying
all foul Words and Blows aſide, let us ſee how the Affairs ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who followed our Steps, and got in at
the Breach we made. They made them more Work, not only beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them out of their <hi>South-Sea</hi> Trade, but poſſeſſed themſelves of all
their Treaſures of Spice, and have ever ſince kept them, with all
their Strong-holds, as far as <hi>Goa;</hi> they only enjoying the Gold Trade
of <hi>Moſambique</hi> undiſturbed; the <hi>Japanners</hi> having baniſhed both
their Commerce and Religion.</p>
               <p>Wherefore our Ships almoſt alone,<note place="margin">The Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enrich this Port.</note> were it not for a little the
<hi>French</hi> of late, lade Calicuts for <hi>Europe:</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> have a Factory
here, that vend the Spices they bring from <hi>Batavia,</hi> and inveſt part
of the Money in courſe Cloath, to be diſpoſed among their Planters,
or ſold to the <hi>Malayans,</hi> and ſend the reſt back in <hi>Rupees:</hi> So that we
ſingly have the Credit of the Port, and are of moſt advantage to the
Inhabitants, and fill the Cuſtom-Houſe with the ſubſtantialeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes.
But not to defraud the <hi>French</hi> of their juſt Commendations,
whoſe Factory is better ſtor'd with <hi>Monſieurs</hi> than with Caſh, they
live well, borrow Money, and make a Shew: Here are <hi>French
Capuchins,</hi> who have a Convent, and live in Eſteem.</p>
               <p>And here I might conclude,<note place="margin">The Diamond Trade better in the hands of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants than in theirs.</note> did not the Diamond Trade and other
Jewels interpoſe; which I could wiſh for the Company's ſake might
never be ſtruck out of their Indulgence allowed to their Servants:
For it will never amount to Advantage in their hands, becauſe the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who are the chief Chapmen in <hi>England</hi> will blow upon them,
unleſs they come to their Prices, when more than enough is offered
them. But in particular hands the Caſe is otherwiſe, every one
ſnatching at a Prize, which none is ſenſible of, but the private Buyer;
but when they are publickly Invoiced, it will be at their own Wills to
make their Bargains. Withal, in the Company's Servants hands, it
not only keeps them Honeſt, but they grow Rich without wronging
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53433:62"/>
the Company: Whereas ſhould they retract this, not only the <hi>Jews</hi>
would find others to furniſh them, as the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> with
their Encomiendums; but other Monied Gentlemen in <hi>England</hi>
might be tempted to ſet up for Interloping, who know not how bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to diſpoſe of their Monies on any Bank, than by adventuring
Large Sums, that do now to my knowledge return them in a Year
and a half's time from 50 <hi>l.</hi> to 70 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> advance, and the Factors
good Gainers too; and all this while no Prejudice done either to
Freight or the Company's Trade; which if they will not believe, let
them experiment to their own Coſt. Nor can I ſay more on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
than both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Jewellers coming over Land do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
who have made good Purchaſe by buying Jewels here, and
carrying them into <hi>Europe</hi> to be Cut and Set, and returning ſell

Fees from them, or elſe they are ſure to be ſet on work, without any

Grievance, by the Reſiſtance of a ſturdy <hi>Patan,</hi> (who is ſprung from
a Warlike People, of whom it is ſaid, They never draw their
Swords, but Blood muſt follow): And thus it happen'd; The <hi>Patan</hi>
having employ'd a Taylor at his houſe, one of the Governor's Men
ſeized him for his Maſter's Service; but the <hi>Patan</hi> ruſhing in to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe

informed, ſome Exemplary Puniſhments are inflicted: Some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
whereof I ſhall relate.</p>
               <p>The one was of an <hi>Armenian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Some exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 
                  <hi>Chawbucked</hi> through the City for ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Wine. The other was of a Goldſmith who had coined Copper
<hi>Rupees;</hi> firſt they ſhaved his Head and Beard, as our Country men do
Bayliffs when they preſume to Arreſt in Priviledg'd Places; then
putting a Fool's Cap on his Head, they ſet him on an Aſs, with his
Face to the Tail, which is led by an <hi>Holencore,</hi> and one of their
Drums is beat before him, which is an Affront of the higheſt degree;
thus they lead him up and down the City, where the Boys and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
treat him but ſcurvily, pelting him all the way he paſſes: Being
brought back to Priſon, they cut off his Hand, and let him lye du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Governor's Pleaſure. The Third was of a Pack of Thieves
that had infeſted the Roads a long time, and after ſome whiles Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
the <hi>Banyans</hi> proffered Money for their Redemption; but the
<hi>Great Mogul</hi> ſending an Expreſs, they were led to Execution; They
were Fifteen, all of a Gang, who uſed to lurk under Hedges in nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Lanes, and as they found opportunity, by a Device of a Weight
tied to a Cotton Bowſtring made of Guts, (with which they tew Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton)
of ſome length, they uſed to throw it upon Paſſengers ſo, that
winding it about their Necks, they pulled them from their Beaſts, and
dragging them upon the Ground ſtrangled them, and poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of what they had: One of theſe was an Old Man with his
two Sons, the youngeſt not fourteen. This being their Practice,
they were ſentenced, according to <hi>Lex Talionis,</hi> to be hang'd;
wherefore being delivered to the <hi>Catwal,</hi> or Sheriff's Men, they
led them two Miles with Ropes about their Necks to ſome wild Date-Trees:
In their way thither they were chearful, and went ſinging,
and ſmoaking Tobacco, the <hi>Banyans</hi> giving them Sweetmeats, they
being as jolly as if going to a Wedding; and the Young Lad now
ready to be tied up, boaſted, That though he were not Fourteen
Years of Age, he had killed his Fifteen Men; wherefore the Old
Man, as he had been a Leader of theſe Two, was firſt made an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for his Villany, and then the two Striplings were advanced, as
all the reſt were, half a Foot from the Ground; and then cutting
their Legs off that the Blood might flow from them, they left them
miſerable Spectacles, hanging till they dropped of their own
accord.</p>
               <p>The following Delinquents being of another kind,<note place="margin">Delinquents of another kind.</note> we ſhall ſee
how they fare: The one was of a Rich Merchant of the <hi>Moors</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Wife, and a Child he had by her of Three Years old, upon
taking her with her Paramour in Adultery; for which Crime a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary
Mulct excuſed him: The other was a Boy's ſticking a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domitiſh
Moor</hi> to the Heart with his own <hi>Catarre,</hi> while he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon his Body; which Fact was ſo far from being accuſed as a
Fault, that the Boy came off with Commendation; though there
is nothing more frequently committed among them, than the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Sin of Buggery.</p>
               <p>There is another thing above all the reſt an unpardonable Offence;<note place="margin">The Crime of growing rich.</note>
for a <hi>Banyan</hi> or Rich Broker to grow Wealthy without Protection of
ſome Great Perſon; for it is ſo mighty a Diſquiet to the Governor,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53433:67"/>
that he can never be at eaſe till he have ſeen the bottom of this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
which is always cured by Transfuſion of Treaſure out of the
<hi>Banyans</hi> into the Governor's Coffers: Which makes them become
humble Suiters for the Umbrage of any of Quality, to skreen them
from this Violence.</p>
               <p>The next in the Executive Power is the <hi>Catwal,</hi>

hundred Men, to ſcower the Streets and Brothels of Idle Companions;
to take an account of all People late out, to diſcover Fires and Houſe-breakers,
and to carry all lewd Perſons to Priſon, which is ſolely
committed to his Charge: So that all Night long he is heard by his
Drums and Trumpets, ſhouting and hallowing of his Crew in their
Perambulation through all Parts of the City; with Lights and Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaus,
with ſome few of his Companions in Coaches or <hi>Palenkeens:</hi>
Moreover he ſeiſes all Debtors, and ſecures them, and has the care of
Puniſhing and Executing all Offenders.</p>
               <p>This is a Place of great Truſt,<note place="margin">The Chief Cuſtomer.</note> but neither ſo Honourable or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
as the <hi>Shawbunder</hi>'s is; who is King of the Port, or Chief
Cuſtomer, though ſomething abated by the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s too fondly in a
Religious Vanity granting Immunity to the <hi>Musſlemen</hi> lately, which
is no ſmall detriment.</p>
               <p>The Cuſtom-houſe has a good Front, where the Chief Cuſtomer
appears certain hours to chop, that is, to mark Goods outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
and clear thoſe received in: Upon any ſuſpicion of default
he has a Black-Guard that by a <hi>Chawbuck,</hi> a great Whip, extorts Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion:
There is another hangs up at the daily Waiters, or <hi>Meerbar's
Choultry,</hi> by the Landing-place, as a terror to make them pay <hi>Caeſar</hi>
his due; the Puniſhment, if detected, being only Corporal, not
Confiſcation of Goods: This Place is filled with Publicans, Waiters
and Porters, who are always at the Receipt of Cuſtom, but are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
too tardy ſometimes in the delivery of Goods, making the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant

the Morning (invited by the novelty and incredibility of the thing)
he was Seated on a four-ſquare Stage or Altar, with three Aſcents,
ſome Two Feet high, and as many Feet ſquare, ready to ſhew:
While he was in a muſing poſture, other <hi>Fakiers</hi> (whoſe Duty it is
daily to ſalute the Sun at his Height, Riſing, and Setting, with their
Muſick of long hollow Canes) blew them for an hour, or <hi>Ghong;</hi>
after which he fell to his Mattins, which he continued till the Sun
began to be warm; then riſing he Bleſſed himſelf with Holy Water,
and threw himſelf along on the loweſt ſquare, ſtill muttering to
himſelf on his Knees, he at length, with one Leg bowed upright
between his Thighs, riſes on the other, telling his Beads (which
both <hi>Moormen</hi> and <hi>Gentus</hi> wear) which he had in his hands a quarter
longer, and ſtands, like a Gooſe, unmoved all the time; then caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf down, he exerciſed himſelf, as Wraſtlers do here, very
briskly, but guarding the poſition of his Leg, which he kept ſo
fixed as if it had grown in that nature, as well when he roſe as gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
on the ground; acting thus a quarter more, it had the

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53433:69"/>
brought him to a Stool; he taking his Purifying-pot in his hand,
marched on one ſide, where he tarried not long before he returning
took up his Beads he had left; and in this Interim four Fires being
kindled (any of them able to roaſt an Ox) at each Corner of the
upper and leaſt Square, he having finiſhed ſome Fopperies with his
Pot, <hi>Scaevola</hi>-like with his own hands he increaſed the Flames by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
combuſtible Stuff as Incenſe to it; when removing from his
Neck a Collar of great Wooden Beads, he made a Coronet of them
for his Head; then bowing his Head in the middle of the Flames,
as it were to worſhip, holding the other Beads in his hands, with
his Head encircled between his Arms, his Face oppoſite to the Sun,
which is the fifth Fire, he mounted his Body with his Feet bolt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and ſo continued ſtanding on his Head the ſpace of three hours
very ſteddily, that is, from Nine till Twelve; after which he ſeats
himſelf on his Breech croſs-legg'd after their way of ſitting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
ſo without either eating or drinking all the reſt of the Day,
the Fires ſtill nouriſhed, and he ſweating (being one of a good Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letick
Habit, and of a Middle Age) as if baſted in his own Greaſe.</p>
               <p>This is imagined to be an Impoſture;<note place="margin">Whether it be an Impoſture,</note> but if it be, it would make

Heat from the Fires to be allayed by that overpowering one of the
Sun; which I cannot wholly incline to, ſince we daily when abroad
roaſt our Meat by Fires made in a clear Day without any ſhelter:
But I rather conceive Cuſtom has inured his Body to it; for the very
Mountebank Tricks declare it a Practice; and the other I think as
feaſible as to eat Fire, tread on Hot Irons, (which is here uſed), or
for Cooks to thruſt their hands into ſcalding Water without Injury.</p>

String from the <hi>Banyan</hi> Tree, and had a Pompous Attendance of
ſuch ragged <hi>Fakiers</hi> their Admirers, with Muſick, Flags, and <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals:</hi>
The Eldeſt having undergone the compleat Term, to crown
all, was intombed in the ſame ſtanding Poſture Nine Days without
any ſort of Food; and leſt any Pretext of that kind might leſſen his
Undertaking, he cauſed a Bank of Earth to be heaped on the Mouth
of his Cave, whereon was to be ſown a certain Grain which ears in
Nine Days, which accordingly being done, eared before his being
taken thence. I ſaw him preſently after his Reſurrection, in great
State raiſed on a Throne under a Canopy, before which was a Fire
made in the Pit he had been, where he put his Hands, being anointed
with Oyl, untouch'd by the Flames: Which whether this may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Cheat of both this and the other, that ſuch an Unction
may be to reſiſt Fire, Naturaliſts have not agreed in; and therefore
I judge this rather a Deluſion, I having not been preſent at this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment:
But that this is none I am aſſured, That the <hi>Banyans</hi> gave
him Divine Honours, and ſaluted him proſtrate, offering before him
Rice, and throwing Incenſe into the Fire: He had a Red Trident in

Friend as Foe, found out this Remedy; delivering a Graver to their

if they were unruly, whereby the great Bulk fell to the Ground.

But afterwards they learned by ſtriking on the Vertebra's of the Neck,
to rule them; which Cuſtom I ſee here maintained. After theſe
came a Dozen Leopards on State-<hi>Hackeries</hi> with their Keepers, who
train them up to hunting. At convenient diſtances the Trumpets
ſounded, and Camels of War with <hi>Patereroes</hi> on their Saddles,
marched with a Pace laborious to the Guiders, giving them a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe

Two or three Striplings (his own Children) rode ſmiling with him,

State he rode to a Place ſet apart for this Day's Solemnity, out of
the Walls, to the Queen's Garden-Gate, before which it ſtands,
where after Prayers he receives the Compliments of the Grandees,
and returns to Feaſt.</p>
               <p>At this time the Walls of the City, and Towers of the Caſtle,
wanted not their Adornments, being beſtuck with bloody Enſigns,
and ſmoking with Guns of Jubilee, as well as tooting with their
Trumpets, and beating with their Drums; as the <hi>Jews</hi> on their

               <p>The laſt Day they prepare a couple of Coffins, and have a Man or

Arrows; theſe ride reeling, and ready to drop off their Horſes for

afloat with a loud Cry, and then returning, repeat with great Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

injured, having others put over their heads, as 'tis termed; but if by

The firſt ground of this Quarrel being upon unneceſſary
Appendices to the Fort, as Palliſadoes in Mud, ſo contrived, that
they were rather a means to take than defend it, which afterwards
were all waſhed away by the Rains; to theſe ſome Deſpight being

for Experiment, I and two more got upon it, and the <hi>Tortoiſe</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned
carried us: Its Head is loricated with Scales, the Neck
reaching as far as the Hut, ſoft and undefenſible; the Fins are
four, placed inſtead of Legs, by which it crawls as well as ſwims;
the Belly is covered with a Breaſt-plate called the <hi>Callapee,</hi> ſoft and

wreathed like a Serpent's; altogether it is as lovely as a Toad: It

               <p>I cauſed it to be opened,<note place="margin">The Fable of its having three Hearts confuted.</note> and examined its Heart, which (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

be Three, grounded on this Miſtake; the Auricles being larger than
in other Creatures, equalling almoſt the Ventricles and whole Body
of the Heart, which is bigger in proportion than belongs to ſuch an
Animal, being as large as an Ox's; which might be the reaſon of
its Puſilanimity: The Veins and Arteries were filled with Currents
of cold black Blood: It participates more of Fleſh than Fiſh, of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viparous
than oviparous Offspring, yet lays imperfect Eggs without
a Cruſt (only covered with a Membrane, being moſt Yolk) buried
by it in the Sands, to receive from the Sun's heat the perfection of
their Hatching (as the Eggs of <hi>Egypt</hi> from Furnaces, or others
from Dunghills): It ſpawns them as Fiſh do, in huge quantities, as
much at one time as will more than fill a Seaman's Bonnet (every
one being as big as an Hen's Egg) By them aboard Ship they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
like buttered Eggs of a Fowl, though nearer akin to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's,
hanging together as thoſe do.</p>
               <p>For this end they come aſhore, and when purſued, caſt up with
their Claws a Cloud of Sand to blind their Enemies; when overtaken

the Conceit of its Tripartite Community, of Fiſh, and Fleſh, and
Fowl; the outward Covering being Shelly, the inner Meat Carnous,
its way of preſerving its kind being by Eggs, as the Feathered Fowl
do: To me it ſeems (though the Fleſh be highly extolled for the
taſte and colour of Veal) neither Fiſh, nor Fleſh, nor good Red

                  </note> I hired an Ox, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
they had too much Burthen, travelling more adviſedly by
Moonſhine, (through a better Soil, and more exchange, as Arable
Ground, Heaths, Foreſts, and Woods, ſome of which were on Fire
two or three Miles together) from Six till Twelve, when we took
up our Reſt at a poor Village called <hi>Moorbar,</hi> ſix Courſe from
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53433:81"/>
                  <hi>Intwally:</hi> This place was not able to afford us an Houſe or Shed, but
we were forced to creep into one of their Cottages, half finiſhed,
they thatching it with Bents ſhelving from the Ridge down to the
Bottom on both ſides, no bigger than a Man might carry.</p>
               <p>I kept the <hi>Coolies</hi> to their Watch,<note place="margin">Force to keep watch.</note> notwithſtanding their hard
Days labour, as well to keep Tigres and Wild Beaſts from us, as
Thieves and Robbers: The day following I ſtaid here till Four in
the Afternoon to avoid the Soultrineſs of the Weather, which I could
hardly do where I was lodged, there being no Air; which cauſed me
to remove out of the Town at Sun riſe to the left of two pitiful
<hi>Tanks</hi> belonging thereto; they being all here ignorant Idolaters, and
Husbandmen, every one chuſing his own God; no Family being
without ſome <hi>Pan Daemon,</hi> or <hi>Incubus;</hi> which they paint with hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Forms, bedaub with ſtinking Oil, and offer the Fruits of the
Earth to: Moſt Abominably Superſtitious, that an ill <hi>Augury</hi> ſhall
detain them idle a whole day, though they and their Houſhold muſt
ſtarve, if they work not; ſuch as an Hare croſſing the Way, or a
Crow on the Left hand. They have no publick <hi>Pagod,</hi> or Place of
Worſhip, beſides theſe <hi>Tanks,</hi> where they waſh and burn their Dead,
giving me a Noſegay of one of their Carkaſes, before I got my Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
as I lay to repoſe under a Tree; which made me range for
Game, and diſperſe my Servants for Provant, being otherwiſe likely
to go without; they living upon <hi>Batty,</hi> or Seeds of Graſs, eating
neither Fiſh nor Fleſh, neither indeed have they any, unleſs by
chance; for after my Purveyors had made diligent ſearch, with much
ado they purchaſed one Hen, tho ſeveral Villages were in ſight, and
all of them greedy enough to take Money, had they had Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
It is all Plowed Land hereabouts, but <hi>Seva Gi</hi> commonly
reaps the Harveſt, leaving hardly ſo much to the Tillers as will
keep Life and Soul together.</p>
               <p>And now going to ſet out,<note place="margin">The Guides lead us about.</note> I began by the murmurings of the <hi>Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
to underſtand that the Guides, being jealous of falling into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
hands, had a deſign to lead us about; (but every one beſides the
<hi>Cauns Peons</hi> being Strangers, and they fearful to diſcover themſelves,
we were perſuaded to reſign our ſelves to their Conduct) over Hilly,
but none of the worſt Ways; two or three Miles together they are
all burnt, bearing nothing but withered Benty-Graſs, which burning
afore the Rains, benefits the Ground much; and are now out of diſtruſt
the <hi>Moguls</hi> ſhould Forrage their Army here.</p>
               <p>Below this, we paſſed over a fine Meadow checquered with Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Brooks, and three Villages, much about an equal diſtance one
from another: And now the broken Ribs of theſe lofty Mountains
ſeen ſo far off at Sea all along from <hi>Cape Comory,</hi> as if founded for an
Aſcent unto the Skies, begin to be diſcovered by our near approach;
when Night interpoſing her black Vail between our Eyes and them,
they became veſted with a more benighted Darkneſs than hung over
us; which ſerved as a ſable Cloud to direct us to <hi>Dehir,</hi> by Eleven
a Clock at Night, nine Courſe from our laſt Stage, ſeated at the end
of a large Plain, at the foot of that Chain of Hills ſuppoſed to croſs
the <hi>Taurus,</hi> trending through the Continent <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> as that

into the Market-place, by a ſmall Party which lighted on me in their
Rounds; when I ſent my <hi>Gulleon Peon,</hi> one of our Guides, with
his Maſters <hi>Chitty,</hi> or Paſs, to the Governor, who received it
kindly, and gave me leave to be my own Quartermaſter (little
Complements being expected from Soldiers).</p>

lain aſleep with <hi>Bang,</hi> who opened with ſuch a Clamour, that I was
afraid it would have brought all the Watch about us, had they not
been in the ſame tune, calling on one another, as Children when the
Light is out, do for fear; beating their Drums, and ſounding their
Trumpets (Shriller than the <hi>Moors,</hi> and more Tuneable) all Night
long; by which means, and my Quarrelſome Inmate, I could
compoſe my ſelf to no Quiet; though for the latter, at length I
thought of an Expedient, plying him with <hi>Arack</hi> till his Tongue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
its ſelf in Silence, which was much more grateful than his
Bawling.</p>
               <p>The next Morning when Day had cleared our Eyeſight, I ſaw the
Idol, this Drunken Prieſt Adored, hard by me; it was thick and
ſhort, Carved in Stone, of a Monſtrous Viſage, whisking his Tail
over his Head; the upper Parts to the Waſte, were Painted with Red;
it inſulted over another ugly Creature it trod on; it was of a Sooty
Colour, and Swam in ſtreams of Oil; yet it called in a great many
<hi>Devotes,</hi> who came to pay their <hi>Salams.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſent to the <hi>Havaldar,</hi>

of this Plain to ſupply them with Hay and Corn, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
them to have the greater Force, and makes it the Reſidence of
an <hi>Havaldar,</hi> who is a kind of petty General: Changing the Town
for the open Fields, I was led to a Grove of <hi>Mangoes</hi> and <hi>Thamarinds,</hi>
at the end of which, was a Moſque, and a great many Tombs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Stone, Demoliſhed; one of which they remember with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
by the Name of <hi>Melech-Bury,</hi> a great Warrior; however,
that which pleaſed me moſt of all, was a ſudden ſurprize, when they
brought me to the wrong ſide of a pretty Square Tank, or Well,
with a Wall of Stone, Breaſt high; where expecting to find it cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with Water, looking down five Fathom deep, I ſaw a clutter of
Women, very Handſome, waiting the diſtilling of the Water from
its dewy ſides; which they catch in Jarrs, and conſtantly carrying
it away, leave it only weeping: It is cut out of a firm Black Marble
Rock up almoſt to the Top, with broad Steps to go down.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:53433:82"/>
Now we could not only ſee their Forts, but hear alſo the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

                     <hi>Seva Gi</hi>'s Forts all about.</note> to and again among the Hills, the main ſtrength of this

Comrade very Merry, and packing up his Houſholdſtuff, his <hi>Bang-bowl,</hi>
and <hi>Hubble Bubble,</hi> to go along with me, before I had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
leave from the <hi>Havaldar,</hi> who had newly ſent word he was
ready to receive me.</p>
               <p>I made him not tarry long, following the Meſſenger, who brought
me into the middle of a ragged Regiment, diſtinguiſhable from the
<hi>Mogul</hi>'s on that ſcore, but more peculiarly by their Hair appearing
on both Ears under their <hi>Puckeries;</hi> their Weapons are much alike,
though to me they give more cauſe of Laughter, than Terror
(conſidering the awkwardneſs of their wearing them) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they are the Inſtruments of Death.</p>
               <p>When I came before the Governor,<note place="margin">State of the <hi>Havaldar.</hi>
                  </note> I found him in State, though
under an Hovel; where were many <hi>Brachmins</hi> with Accompt-Books,
writing at ſome diſtance; nearer, his Privy-Council, with whom
he ſeemed to Adviſe: I was placed on his Left hand, and deſired
my Interpreter to acquaint him my Errand, withal intreating his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
for my ſecure paſſing the Hill: He made it a piece of difficulty,
and told me I muſt return to <hi>Bimly</hi> for Orders, to whoſe <hi>Havaldar</hi>
he was accountable, not to him of <hi>Gulleon;</hi> which was within half a
days Journy from whence I ſet forth. Hearing this I bore my ſelf as
ſedately as I could, having been informed of the advantage they take
of a diſturbed Countenance; and ſweetned him with his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
being ſufficient, telling him of his Maſter's Kindneſs to the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and their Friendſhip towards him; which worked him to a
yielding Temper; yet he ſcrupled my <hi>Caniſter,</hi> or Trunk, might be
lined with Pearl, my Horſe ſold to the Enemy, hoping to ſuck ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
out of me; I replying, What I had brought were at his liberty
to ſearch, and that I went only on an amicable account to Cure a
Sick Perſon, and ſhould be as ready to ſerve him, if required, his
Fury was quite pawled; but perceiving an hungry look to
hang on them all, and ſuſpecting leſt they ſhould ſerve me
ſome Dog-trick, I made a ſmall Preſent, and he ſigning the

               <p>Being clear,<note place="margin">Got clear of <hi>Dehir.</hi>
                  </note> I could not ſo readily ſhake off my <hi>Fakier,</hi> he would
march with me; when we were not gone above two Courſe, or
three Miles, the Liquor working out by his Walking, he began to
grow weary, and called out for the Horſe, which I had cauſed the
<hi>Portugueze</hi> to Mount, which he took in ſuch dudging, ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
on Foot, and him on Horſeback, that he turned Tail, and
went back again to his Vomit, without bidding adieu.</p>
               <p>And now our mighty Task began to try our Feet,<note place="margin">A trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome paſſage over the <hi>Gaot.</hi>
                  </note> as well as weary
our Eyes: I not caring to hazard my ſelf longer in my <hi>Palenkeen,</hi>
alighted, and though I thought it a work impoſſible to conquer, I
put the beſt face on it I could, tarrying till they were all together, the
better to chear them. The <hi>Coolies</hi> providing themſelves with Staves,
diſtruſted not only their own Legs, but the Ground they went on,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53433:83"/>
it having forſaken many a tall Tree around us; ſome holding by the
mouldring Earth with half their Roots bare, others half buried in
Pits they never grew in, lay expecting their <hi>quondam</hi> Neighbours

               <p>The buſy Apes,<note place="margin">The Monkies afrighted.</note> the Forlorn hope of theſe declining Woods,
deeming no place ſafe where they beheld us, made ſtrange Levaltoes
with their hanging Brats from one Bough to another, Chattering an
Invaſion; but theſe ſaw us preſently exalted beyond their Bowers,
and feared us from above, as much as we to ſalute them below:
Thus far was paſſable enough, when the Sun levelled himſelf unto
our Steps, and we looked for Day beneath us. Here I made a ſecond
pauſe, and promiſed them Nectar in the Skies; this proved but a
faint Cordial to the <hi>Fraſſes,</hi> who failed afore they got a quarter up;
for whom after I had provided (the Moon aſſiſting us with a leſs
parching Light) I found my Hands as neceſſary to Clamber as my
Feet, Travelling on all Four; the Stones were laid ſtep by ſtep, but
in little order; and now ſo ſteep, that it differed little from Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular,
only by the winding of the Mountain; and ſo Narrow, that
Two Men could not paſs abreaſt; where chiefly were laid Trees
and Timber to make work for the Army, ſhould they attempt this
Way; which ſorely increaſed our trouble, being the firſt Adventurers,
beſide the danger we incurred of being Aſſaulted from above, they
not yet knowing who we were. To look down made my Brains turn
round; over my Head pendulous Rocks threatned to Entomb me.</p>
               <p>We had not gone long thus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Flurries</hi> from the Hills carry Men and Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down the Precipice</note> before the Cry came, the Ox was
fallen; 'twas well he choſe not the place where I was in, for the
leaſt lapſe had irrecoverably whirled him to the bottom: Arguments
were too weak to perſuade the <hi>Coolies</hi> to go back to him to help him;
I therefore proceeded to Threats, which made Two of them return
to his Aid: I confeſs the ſenſe of their hard Labour urged me to
pity; the Anguiſh of which extorted Tears from ſome, unſeaſonable
at this time to take notice of to them; we had only this Comfort,
the Even was Calm and Serene, and we were mounted beyond the
humble Miſts, which we could diſcern fluctuating againſt the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable
Promontories; which may be the reaſon ſometimes (they
ſay) Men and Oxen are hurled down the Precipice by ſudden Guſts,
when they are exalted to the Clouds, and they break with too great
an Impetuoſity: For all this Light we ſeemed Obſcured, the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the Moon being ſhaded by the ſides of the Mountains, which
appeared here all Marble.</p>
               <p>The Horſe (being a <hi>Turky</hi> one) made the beſt ſhift of all, and was
more forward than convenient, pelting us with great Stones his
Hoofs had removed, which cauſed us to retard his haſte, and leave
him to come laſt.</p>
               <p>About Nine a Clock at Night the Moon ſhone over our Heads,
more joyful at her preſence, than her feignedly beloved <hi>Endimion:</hi>
An hour after we came tired to the Brow, through a narrow Cavern
cut out of the main Rock; here being no Guard, the noiſe of the
Army being over, I was the ſecond Man Trampled on the Top, half an
hour after the <hi>Palenkeen</hi> came, and all the reſt within two hours more:
Here I was as good as my word, and diſtributed <hi>Arack</hi> among them,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53433:83"/>
which made them, for all their tedious Tug, run amain to the next
Town <hi>Oppagaot;</hi> where early in the Morning I crowded under an
Old Shed.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Gur</hi> or Hill is reckoned four Courſe up (every Courſe being
a Mile and half):<note place="margin">The heighth of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> From whence is beheld the World beneath all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

with terrible repeated Sounds, meeting freſh Objects to reundulate

               <p>Here is a ſenſible alteration of the Air:<note place="margin">Alteration of Air on the Hills.</note> The Dawn of the Morning,
and latter part of the Night, 'twas ſharp, cold, and piercing; ſo
that all I gathered about me would ſcarce keep me warm; and all
the Day there were fine cool Briezes, though below we were almoſt
choaked with ſoultry Heats: The Reaſon whereof I judge to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the High Mountains reverberate the flowing Particles of the
Atmoſphere; as we ſee the Rocks do Water more ſtrongly, by how
much more force the Waves aſſail them; ſo here the Air (which is
thicker below) driven againſt theſe Hills breaks off in Flurries, which
ſeeking to retire into their own Ocean, mitigate the violence of the
Heat in their paſſage, by fanning as it were the Air; by which means,
and the Sun's rarifying the Miſty Vapours, they are left pure, and fall
at Night in more limpid Dews to cool and refreſh the Earth: To

I ordered him to ſend it with one of the <hi>Gulean Peons;</hi> but he
made Anſwer, the Governor having been up all Night, was not
then at leiſure. While we were talking, a Drove of <hi>Combies</hi> (Hinds)
paſſed with Proviſions on their Heads for the Caſtle; and I having
ſtaid till Three in the Afternoon, not getting any other Anſwer, I
commanded the <hi>Coolies</hi> to march, though the <hi>Subidar</hi> prohibited
and kept them from following them with my Men and Arms, as
Carbines and Blunderbuſſes; and the Governor not coming as he
told my <hi>Peons</hi> they would, by Four, I diſmiſſed the <hi>Gulean Peons,</hi>
they daring to go no farther; and if there were farther occaſion for
a Paſs, to bring it after me; thereby fruſtrating their Intention,

They durſt no more than curſe, for all I departed without leave,
taking my Courſe into a deep Valley, which winded and turned like a

on both ſides, the Doors of which Creeked in our paſſage
(but I was cautious of being too Circumſpect) till we came to an
aiery Choultry; where was placed a Bed hung with Silk Curtains;
to which being brought, I was Commanded to place my ſelf cloſe by
it, from whence I might conveniently Diſcourſe and Feel her Pulſe,
putting my Hand under the Curtains. It was agreed among them
to impoſe upon me; wherefore at firſt they gave me a Slaves Hand,
whom I declared to be Sound and Free from any Diſeaſe, nothing
contradicting the true Tenor and Rythme of Pulſation; when they
began to be more ingenuous, telling me, it was done to try me:
Then was given me another Hand, which demonſtrated a weak
languid Conſtitution; and collecting the Signs and Symptoms, I
feared not to give Sentence; which met with their Approbation, and

propounded the Commodity might ariſe from an intercourſe of

of whom might be exchang'd the ſame Goods procurable at

over the Low Countries; which is not a matter of ſuch impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
ſhould they earneſtly ſet upon it, conſidering the Avenues are
open: But by that proceeding, it would take away a powerful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
to the maintaining ſo vaſt an Army as is always in <hi>Duccan,</hi>
whereby a main Body of the Soldiery would be out of pay; which
is abſolutely againſt the Generals intereſt, and therefore he would
never conſent: This I ſoon ſaw was the main Argument, though he
coloured it with pretext, that 'twas a work of more pains to reduce
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53433:86"/>
                  <hi>Seva,</hi> than was repreſented, in reſpect of his Situation, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
not only to make Excurſions, but to bid them Defiance.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I told him, If the latter was not feaſible, it was in
vain to propoſe any thing in relation to the former, for that all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
was ſtopped if the Low Lands were not cleared; the <hi>Havaldars</hi>
being unconſcionable in their Cuſtoms, and without doubt would
interrupt what might be ſerviceable to their Enemies, or bring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to their Prince; whereas were the Ways free, it would enrich
his <hi>Jageah</hi> beyond the <hi>Bunder</hi> at <hi>Surat,</hi> and tie the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Truce, who were known in theſe Parts addicted to Traffick,
and Friends to Peace: He asked further, How far we deſired to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this Liberty? I replied, beyond the <hi>Portugal</hi> Dominions, which
would front the Iſland of <hi>Bombaim</hi> about <hi>Tull;</hi> otherwiſe we muſt
be at the charge of double Cuſtom, to them as well as the <hi>Mogul.</hi>
He ſaid all this had been moved to <hi>Badur Caun,</hi> but thoſe to whoſe
hands the Preſents for him had been entruſted, had defrauded him of
them, on whom nothing was to be wrought without liberal <hi>Piſcaſhes,</hi>
he bearing it as high as the King himſelf, and at this juncture he was
an unfit Mediator to him, having lately had ſome jarrs with him
(the Governor of <hi>Jeneah</hi> undervaluing his Authority in an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
not long enough ago to be thoroughly forgot); however
did the Preſident immediately apply himſelf to him, he was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
enough to let him Settle Factories; which I gave him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
without a mutual Benefit on both ſides, was not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Deſign; but for the eſteem we bore to Men of Honour, and that
made account of their Word, it was wiſhed the <hi>Moguls</hi> were poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of thoſe Parts; which was never to be cultivated, either with
good Manners, or Profit, whilſt Perfidy reigned there.</p>
               <p>This being the ſubſtance of our Diſcourſe, after he had related
the Buſineſs to his Council (he replied) he would intimate what
might be effected in it, to the Preſident, in anſwer to his Letter.</p>

though in old Characters; however it is left a deſolate Habitation
for Batts and Waſps; to diſturb which it is dangerous, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
and deſperately revengeful, following their Aggreſſors till
they have Whealed them into Contrition for their unadviſed Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
To be out of the Noiſe of theſe buzzing Hornets, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
our ſelves from the ſurprize of any diſturbed Idolater, who
might bellow the report of our being here, we haſted to the ſafer

circling with its Stream ſeveral Iſlets, and half-way up to the
City paſſes under a Bridge of 36 Arches of Stone; and from thence
runs a Cauſeway of Stone two Miles in length, admitting the Flood
only by two Sluces, into Wears or Dams made for Fiſh and Salt, and
ends with three Arches more: A little beyond which is depainted
on a Church, a Story of a Ship brought from <hi>Cape Bon Eſperanzo,</hi>
hither in one Night, and fixed where the Church is now built, and
by that means helping them with Timber for the Roof, and two
Croſſes ſet up as far off as the Ship was in length; whether true or

a long Gallery, hung round with the Pictures at length of all the
Vice-Roys that had been in <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> down to the preſent Vice-Roy:
At the upper end was the Canopy Royal and Chair of State; upon

Preſence; he received us Standing, and after a little Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
diſmiſſed us. A Proper Man, Courteous to Strangers, his
Name <hi>Lewis Mendoſa de Albuquerque,</hi> newly created Marqueſs by the
King; in this Room was another Canopy of State, with the Arms of
<hi>Portugal.</hi> Coming into the Court-yard we ſaw ſome Men in Gowns,
like our Aldermen, the Emburgadors, or Council of the City,
going to attend the Vice-Roy to his Devotion at the Church of
<hi>Miſericord,</hi> where was to be Preſented a Pious Comedy; but their
Repreſentations being too tedious, and the generality making Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
the leaſt of their buſineſs, not reſpecting either God or the
King, they made ſuch a rout among the Women, that we were glad
to leave and Reimbark for our Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>At Night we were alarmed by a paultry Fellow that took our
Houſe for his Sanctuary, being forced to it for his own Security;
the Soldiers aſſuming great licenſe for want of Pay, and the <hi>Cofferies</hi>
for want of Victuals, ſo that every one walks the City with his
naked Sword in his Hand for his own defence at Evening; and now
within Doors, and in a Private Houſe, we were forced to make our
Arms our Pillows.</p>
                  <p>The next day we paſſed the <hi>Bar</hi> for <hi>Vingula;</hi>

did briskly for Two hours, ſtriving to board us, caſting Stink-pots
among us, which broke without any Execution, but ſo frighted our
Rowers, that we were forced to be ſevere to reſtrain them; they
plied their Chambers and ſmall Shot, and flung Stones, flouriſhing
their Targets and Darting Long Lances; they were well Manned in
a Boat ten times as big as our Barge, and at leaſt Sixty fighting Men
beſides Rowers; we had none to manage our ſmall Gun, the Gunner

running away at <hi>Goa</hi> after Sluts in Brothels: One of the Factors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking

his Cloaths a-flame in the Ocean, ſo that they were fully bent to

by a Platform of Two Great Guns on every ſide, and Two Great
Bulwarks, bearing Smaller Guns at the Two Corners of the Houſe;
the Front is <hi>Italian</hi> Faſhion, paſſing to it over a Draw-Bridge; at
Night we walked into the Town, part of it lately deſtroyed by the

beyond a Garden watered by a Freſh Stream, where we bathed: After

round full of Streamers of Orient Colours; the inferior Stories were
painted with deformed Figures of their Saints, on every ſide Portals:

ever to be faithfully obliged to their Lord; in which point their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Faith has rarely failed, Intereſt teaching them to be true to
him that raiſed them; they thereby being liable to the envy of
thoſe they are purpoſely ſet as a Checkmate to; for by their exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the ſwelling exorbitancy of other Princes is corrected, and
they being only at the Will of their Maſter, are tied to their good
Behaviour.</p>

                  <p>However, when the King gets them in the Toil, they are treated
as they deſerve; for he makes bold with their Heads, takes their
Eſtates wholly into his Cuſtody and for his own Uſe, beſtowing
them on his Creatures, when Forfeited, making them underſtand,

for which Sport they have a Breed of Cocks as
big as Turkies; which they Arm with Razors tied flat under their
Claws, and faulched Two Inches inſtead of Gavelocks, with which
they ſlaſh one another Mortally; ſo that the Diſpute endures not

                  <p>For our own Diverſion here we had none beſides Shooting,<note place="margin">Diverſions.</note> in

no Beef being to be Bought here, though up the Country from the

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53433:107"/>
Wild Hogs, and ſometimes Wild Cows. Going in queſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
one of our Soldiers, a Youth, Killed a Tigre-Royal; it was
brought home by Thirty or Forty <hi>Combies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Tigre Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected.</note> the Body tied to a long
Bamboo, the Tail extended; ſo they brought it to the Houſe,
where we ſaw 'twas Wounded in Three Places, one through the
Head with Two Bullets, another through the Body ſlanting up to
the Shoulders, a Third in the Leg; it was a Tigre of the Biggeſt
and Nobleſt Kind, Five Feet in Length beſide the Tail, Three and an
half in Height, it was of a light Yellow, ſtreaked with Black,
like a Tabby Cat, the Ears ſhort, with a few Briſtles about the
Lips; the Viſage Fierce and Majeſtick, the Teeth gnaſhing, Two
of which ſhe brake againſt the Stones for anguiſh, the Shoulders and
Fore-legs thick and well ſet, the Paw as Large as the biggeſt Fiſt
ſtretched out, the Claws thick and ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>The Boy Shot it in the Night from a <hi>Chouſe,</hi> or <hi>Eſtarzo,</hi> as it came to
Drink, ſuppoſing it to have been a Deer; the firſt Shot was that under
the Shoulder, which made her Spring Three times an incredible
Height, at the laſt of which ſhe fell into the <hi>Chouſe</hi> from whence ſhe ſaw
the Flaſh, where with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Boy were a <hi>Comby,</hi> and a <hi>Comby</hi> Boy
of Eight Year old, aſleep a little on one ſide; ſhe pawed the Straw
with her Feet, while all but the Child aſleep fled; but being wrung
by her Pain, ſhe ſoon left the place with an horrible Noiſe that made
the Woods tremble, all which awaked not the Lad, nor had it any
Harm.</p>
                  <p>In this interval, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Youth Charged again with a couple of
Slugs, and tracing the Blood, as ſhe was making at him, diſcharged
through the Brain-pan, at which ſhe was quiet; but to make ſure,
he made another ſhot at her, which he believed was that in the Leg:
All this time the Moon was Obſcured and Cloudy; the <hi>Comby</hi> that
had left him and his Son, at length came with a many more, calling
<hi>Fringi,</hi> the Term they have for <hi>Europe</hi>-Men and <hi>Franks;</hi> the Boy
was walking about, fearing to venture within reach, till at laſt laying
aſide his well-adviſed Suſpicion, he approaching, found the Terror
of the Wood Slain.</p>
                  <p>Diſrobed of its Royal Hide,<note place="margin">Two Bones bound in the Shoulders im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in the Fleſh.</note> Two Bones of the Bigneſs and Figure

in the ends of each Pectoral, and the Three circumducing
Muſcles, towards the joining of the Shoulder-blades, and the upper
Bones of the Fore-feet, commonly called Shoulder-bones; of theſe
there goes a Story handed by Tradition, as that Licking the Right
Shoulder it appeaſes Hunger, the Left it whets it where theſe Bones
lie; but probable enough it is, that Nature added theſe for its greater
Strength; The Entrails were little variable, but the Heart was
mighty, and the Liver (they ſay) had as many Lobes as that was
Years old, which were Six and an half, like to a Foxes.</p>
                  <p>The Chief,<note place="margin">The Cuſtom of the <hi>Ombrahs</hi> on any grat Action.</note> to encourage the Lad, told him, That though he were
a Boy, he had done a Manly Action, and therefore according to the
Cuſtom of the Country, in preſence of all his Admirers, he plucked off
his own Coat, which was <hi>Venetian</hi> Cloath of Silk and Silver, and gave
it him. The Great <hi>Ombrahs</hi> always do the like upon any hazardous

                  <p>It is memorable what is atteſted,<note place="margin">Monkies the common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt of the Tigre.</note> by theſe Woodmen, of the Tigre,
that when he intends to Prey on the Monkies (with which theſe

his firſt approach give warning by their confuſed Chattering, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
betake themſelves to the higheſt and ſmalleſt Twigs of the
Trees; when the Tigre ſeeing them out of his reach, and ſenſible
of their fright, lies Couchant under the Tree and then falls a Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
at which they trembling let go their hold, and tumbling down
he at leiſure picks them up to ſatisfy his Hunger: They are his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
Repaſt, ſeldom making Man his Meal, and they are judged
(as St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Barbarians</hi> did him) guilty of ſome horrid Crime that
ſuch Vengeance overtakes; the Woods and Mountains yielding
them variety of other Food. The Tigre is dull Scented, and not
long Nimble, Three Leaps Tiring him, otherwiſe it's probable he
would make more havock than he does. The She brings forth but
once in Twelve Years, and then but a ſingle Cub; they are Ingend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Three Months, in which time their Fury as well as Luſt rages
upon one another; thus has Providence ſuppreſſed the Growth of
this maſterleſs Creature: Beſides, if the Proverb be true, the Bitch
brings forth but once in her life, or very rarely more; <hi>Iteratus haud

the Devil without doubt cannot eaſier work on any, than the Weak

upon that account may probably delude and overawe theſe People,

Air than would be allowed by the Poet under the Fifth Zone, under
which the greateſt part of it lies; as often as the Sun viſits the
Arctic Pole, it brings with it grateful Showers and Winds (whoſe
Heat otherwiſe would be intolerable) by which the Earth is cooled
and made Productive; neither in the extreameſt Heat does it want
by the equality of Days and Nights after Sun-ſet, the favourable
Dews of the Heavens, when you ſhall ſoon perceive a kind Moiſture
fall to refreſh the Earth, and nouriſh the almoſt ſcorch'd up Plants;
though theſe alone are not ſo powerful to take away the Labour from
the induſtrious Husbandman, who this Seaſon is forced by artificial
Channels to aſſiſt Nature to produce, otherwiſe ſhe would fall one

                  <p>What has been Experienced in the particular Accounts, I muſt
confirm again in this general one, That the firſt Full Moon in <hi>May</hi>
brings the Rains, when it Rains a Fortnight only, and holds up till
the middle of <hi>June,</hi> in which times, Empyemas, Fluxes, Fevers of
all ſorts (except Peſtilential) Haemorrhages, rage; after the Rains
are fully ſettled, it grows Healthy. From the ſetling in of the
Rains till the Full Moon in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> it Rains without intermiſſion, after
which it clears up for a Fortnight, and with little variation (bating
the accidental Cauſes of its beginning earlier or later) it Rains all
<hi>September</hi> till the <hi>Elephant</hi> breaks up, the laſt Rainy Star: After
which is the Harveſt for Rice, when it is gathered; and then juſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Rains they are moſt Sickly, the Sun exhaling Vapours, the
Earth grows Muddy and Stinking, though abundantly Productive:
From thence to the latter end of <hi>January</hi> commences the Cold Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
when their Bodies are Healthier, and a lovely Verdure Cloaths
the Earth; at the latter end of this they reap another Harveſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
extraordinary pains; all this time the Evenings are very ſharp,
and at <hi>Surat</hi> I have ſeen an hoar Froſt in the Morning. From <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi>
the firſt, till the Rains ſet in, are the Heats, and in <hi>March</hi> the
Leafs fall off the Trees, yet always ſupplied with freſh, ſo that the
Trees are always Green, though the Graſs and Fodder are quite
burnt up; and with difficulty, by the advantage of Aquiducts, a
lean Harveſt is brought forth: The Peaſants Morning and Evening
draw Water out of Wells by <hi>Buffola</hi>'s, or Oxen; or elſe by a
thwart Poſt poiſed with a ſufficient weight at the extremity, laid
over one fixed in the Earth; the Water is drawn by a Bucket of Goats
Skins; others have Pans or Buckets of Leather hanging round about
a Wheel, ſome always in the Water, others riſing up, and at the
ſame time others pouring out as the Wheel turns round: And thus
are their beſt Gardens kept alive.</p>
                  <p>The Mountains here are one continued Ridge,<note place="margin">Mountains:</note> dividing the Two
Coaſts each from other, and are all along called the <hi>Gaot;</hi> they run
<hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> till they croſs the <hi>Imaus;</hi> and are the reaſon of ſome

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53433:113"/>
They are plentifully ſtored with Woods, and Increaſe of all
things, except Rivers, which are in ſome Places compenſated by
living Springs out of the Rocks, but every where by Water falling
in the Rains.</p>

for ſome Hundreds of Leagues, but for its Purity in the eſteem of
the moſt Religious; beſides all which, are great Tanks or Ponds of
Rain-Water, where it wants the other Benefits, with deep Wells, of
extraordinary Coſts and Charges; ſome purely for Pomp, and to
tranſmit their Names to Poſterity; others for the good of Travellers,
but moſt for the ſake of Religion, in which they are extravagantly
profuſe, every great City ſtriving to outvye each other; the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable

out of the main Rocks, ſeeming rather the Works of many Ages

Rice thrives beſt in Watry Places, it ſwimming always there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

rejoices better in drier Grounds; Cotton is a Lover of the ſame, from
whence comes all the Wealth to <hi>India, quae effodiuntur opes,</hi> which

of his Breath, ſo contracted his lower Belly, that it had nothing

Columns by turns. The Aetiology whereof I think to be this; that
while all the Contents of the Belly are moved upwards, all Reſpiration

upon the Nerves (the Mind or Soul commanding them) while the
Vital or Natural are compelled to the contrary.</p>

Whether the Cauſe may be attributed to the Air, or Temperance in

Stink behind them, notwithſtanding they eat nothing Carnous, which
remains upon their Excrements; and for that reaſon it is ſomewhat
ſtrange the Kine ſhould be ſo fond of them: And hence is it that in
their Streets, and near the Towns and Cities, it is but ill taking the
Air. Yet however Natural this becomes to them, as well as the reſt
of Mankind, they are not in this particular to be taxed with Sloth
and Sluttery in reſpect of their Bodies; for beſides their conſtant
Waſhings at the Times of their Devotion, they never eat nor drink

from Head to Foot; nor will they ſuffer their ſecret Parts to harbour
any Naſtineſs, they uſing Depilatories for Breaſt, Arm-pits and

could not live, their Pay being inconſiderable. And by this ſmall

rubbing the Stone hard upon the Chalk, if it leave an Olive-Colour it is
good. Alſo touch any with a Red-hot Iron, which you ſuſpect becauſe
their Colour is lighter than ordinarily they uſe to be, and if they fry like
Reſin or Wax, they are naught. Sometimes they are tried by putting
them into clear Water, and if there ariſe upon them ſmall white Bubbles,
they are good, and if none, they are doubtful. The uſe of the Hot
Iron is eſteemed infallible.</p>

                  <p>The Rough Diamonds that ſeem Greeneſt, prove of a good Water when
cut; and thoſe that ſeem White when rough, prove often Bluiſh
being cut.</p>
                  <p>Care is to be taken likewiſe in Choice of Rough Diamonds, to avoid
thoſe that have Veins, for they will never cut well, ſeeming as if they
were filed with a rough File.</p>
                  <p>For vending, Stones of ſix Grains and under, to one and a half,
are beſt.</p>
                  <p>For Trial of a Diamond, take a Pointed Diamond, ſuch as Glaziers
uſe, try it on any Stone but a Diamond, and it will cut the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The Diamond that is Sandy, or hath any Foulneſs in it, or is of a Blue,
Brown, or Yellow Water, is not worth half the Price of a perfect Stone
of a White Water.</p>
                  <p>For cutting of Diamonds, you muſt never mould any Diamond in Sand
or Cuttle-bone, but you muſt uſe the ſecond Lead to make a Patern of,
becauſe the firſt will come ſomewhat leſs than the other.</p>
                  <p>Never caſt it off but of the perfect Lead; for if you ſhould caſt it with
Tin, it being the lighter Metal, you may wrong you Judgment thereby,
but in Lead you will find the Experiment to be good; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take the Mould of the Stone you would buy, which having moulded,
caſt it off in perfect Lead, then make a Patern of it; but before you go
about to make a Patern (of the Stone you would cut) weigh the Lead,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53433:126"/>
and ſet down the Weight in a Piece of Paper; then form the Piece of
Lead to what faſhion you think beſt and moſt advantagious to the Stone;
then re-weigh the Lead ſo formed, and ſetting down the Weight, you
may find what the Stone will loſe in cutting. The Lead will weigh three
times as much as the Stone, which is a ſure Rule; and commonly it loſeth
one third part in cutting.</p>
                  <p>To make Diamonds clean; if you ſee a thick Table Diamond in a
Ring, a Jewel, or in a Collect for a Jewel, you muſt firſt make it cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Heat of the Sun permits not the Vapours to condenſe themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

when the <hi>Shemauls</hi> blow from the Sea to aſſwage them; this Climate,

<hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Imaus</hi> continued hither: By either of theſe Winds when
they blow impetuouſly, the Sands are whirled about, to the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

which here is verified in an high degree on the Natives; nor are they
leſs afflicting to Strangers newly arrived, chaſing and fretting their
very Skin to Rawneſs, and then vexing them by their freſh aſſailing
with Botches and Blanes. To theſe Winds we may add the Diary,
or <hi>Terrheneos</hi> from the Mountains, which breathe a gentler Air all
the Morning, hardly curdling the Ocean; in the Afternoon ſtronger
from the Sea, refreſh the Fiery Plain.</p>
                  <p>The moſt unhealthy of theſe are the <hi>South-Eaſt,</hi> for that then the

towards its <hi>Southern</hi> Progreſs; for upon its return the Skies do
clear, and the Clouds, which uſed to hang about the Mountain-tops
till Mid-day, vaniſh earlier at the Sun's approach; whereupon this
Climate is not ſubject to the greater part of Diſtempers a more Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

Dropſies; oftner obnoxious to Jaundice, Obſtructions of the Spleen,
Meſentery, and Windineſs of the Hypochondrias: They dread not

the Incommodity of a ſtifling Air, it being ſo near the Hills that the

of limpid Water, for which it is highly valuable; and by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry

                  <p>The conſtant Din of a great many at this Work together, like the

calamitous for want of kindly Moiſture; in lieu of which, hot

we ſaw (what before we believed) the tardy Fowls pay for their lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring

Nor does this proceed from Heat alone, but the Seas nearneſs, which

Motion determines generally the various Seaſons of the Year,

not equally hot and dry, nor do all Winters ſhare of the like Cold and

Moiſture; whereupon ſome Summers bring Swarms of Flies and
Gnats, others are clear from them; and on this account is it ſo many
Armies of Locuſts have invaded theſe Quarters (which though
often, is not perpetual), that they have devoured all things as they
bud, unleſs where the Husbandmen have drove them away by Fire;
ſo that I am willing to incline to the unaccuſtomed Alterations of this

ſomething more Mortal by ſome unwonted Conjunction of Planets,

of their full Maturity; at which time they look for the ſame
Unhealthineſs we do in our Autumn; though I find them not ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly
addicted to Symbols, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to their Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks,
yet they expreſs the Year by this Tree; becauſe this
Tree, ſay they, of all others alone (which I before noted of the
Coco-Nut Tree, and therefore I think it a kind of Palm) at every
appearance of the New Moon procreates a freſh Branch, by which
Twelve Productions the whole Year is reſembled and compleated;
the Trees are Tall and Slender, bearing their Boughs all a top, like a
ſhady Tuft, ſome ſtanding bolt upright, and others ſpread abroad,
with others flagging and ready to give way to the Birth of more;
when they are Young and in their Infancy, they no ſooner ſprout
up but the prickly Leafs guard its tender Head, which is of a pithy
ſubſtance, and when Wounded ſpoils the Trees Growth, ſo that it
Dies; but while it eſcapes that danger, it riſes by degrees after the
former Order, the under Branches bowing Archwiſe to their upſtart
Youngſters; the Leafs are ſet in Rows<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>like Ribs to a great Spine,
ariſing from a Circular Baſe, till it end in a ſharp Point; under theſe
Boughs the mighty Branches hang full of Dates in Cluſters, and

                     </q>
So patient under great Loads of this Fruit, that they ſeem to rejoyce
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53433:136"/>
with a more chearful Verdure, and unconcerned reject the withered
Boughs, whilſt a more lively Product makes them glad by a new
Succeſſion; by which means it keeps Green the whole Courſe of
the Year.</p>
                  <p>Nor when the old ones all, are theſe only fit for the Fire;
for they being orderly laid, and finely Gilded or Painted between
the Beams of the ſame Wood, ſupply the Ceilings and other Adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their beſt Houſes; nor are they leſs ſerviceable to Thatch
their meaner Cottages: The Trunk being deprived of thoſe Comb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
from the main Head is beheld a flouriſhing Peruke of Palms, fit
to be worn by the greateſt Heroes; from whence downwards without
any Sprouts, it appears all in Coat of Mail Cap-a-pee, or like a Pine-Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from its ſcaly Structure, cauſed by the falling of the precedent
Branches, by which compactneſs it emulates its Conelike Figure.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe Trees there are Male and Female, and which is worthy our
Notice, the Female Palms (which only Bear) will not Bring forth
before they are Impregnated at the Roots with the Seed of the Male,
firſt pounded into Meal and ſprinkled about them; which how true
I diſpute not; but certainly Tradition has confirmed the Practice,
and they are not to be perſuaded to neglect the Cuſtom.</p>

for here the Way was not only Intricate but Difficult; whereby I

declared the manner, I forbear here, it being exactly the ſame] for
theſe Eight or Nine <hi>Munſels</hi> they care not to Houſe them, but only
Cover them with <hi>Yawpengees,</hi> or Horſe-Cloths, and expoſe them to the
open Air; which is not ſo Unhealthy for them, as for Human Bodies,
who carefully prevent ſuch Lodgings for fear of Aches, and other
Inconveniences incident thereupon; wherefore in the middle of the
Vale we repaired to the <hi>Caravan Ser Raw,</hi> almoſt buried in the Sand,
it being the only obſtacle to their rowling Billows.</p>
                  <p>The next Morn we were waited on by the Country Women
bringing us Cheeſe, and Butter made before our eyes, with no
other Churn than a Goatskin, in which they ſhook the Milk till
Butter came; Fiſh, Roots, and Herbs, with all ſorts of Pullen: In
theſe Two <hi>Munſels</hi> we only meet with theſe Servitors, in other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Men appear alone, not allowing their Women that Freedom;
but were they no more tempting than theſe Swains, they'd have
ſmall cauſe for the Reſtriction; for they are Strapping Sunburnt
Laſſes, with little more Cloaths on than a dark coloured Smock, or
Frock; and for their Meen it is not enticing; theſe bring us Water
to Drink out of their Tanks, newly filled, which was Thick,
Troubled, and Slimy; for which reaſon the Vapours, or rather
Fumes from the Sun's violence, were very Offenſive, and the more
irkſome, becauſe we were conſtrained to tarry here another Night,
for that the River <hi>Rute Conna Shure,</hi> or Salt-Water, was now over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown
by the Waters falling from the Mountains beyond the Barks
to that exceſs, that it could not be Forded by Travellers, and the
Stream ran with that Rapidneſs, that it was unſafe to venture over
till the deſcending Cataracts had left off pouring on the overſwell'd
Brinks, and emptied themſelves into the wider Gulf, not many
Leagues diſtant hence.</p>
                  <p>The Day after, as ſoon as we heard the Waters were abated, we
ſet forward, and found it true what had been reported (Three <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phala</hi>'s
not daring to paſs the Lake, where they had lain ſome Days,
till we dhad led the way). It was ſultry Hot when we aſſayed to go,
but Delays in this caſe were dangerous: beſides, we were uncertain
whether it would hold up ſhould we tarry, which made us confide
on our Guides, who gave us aſſurance, that the Marſhes were paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
we were more troubled with Waves of Sand than Water, both
which, by Rain, or Wind, keep on their Courſe with ſome noiſe till
ſilenced in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf.</p>
                  <p>Athwart this Fen,<note place="margin">A Great Bridge.</note> which was upward of Three Miles, was Built

but by the Negligence of theſe People, as well as Injury of Floods
and Sands, it was broke down in ſeveral places, eſpecially where the
Torrent made the deepeſt Channel, ſo that though firm and ſtrong
in the greateſt part of it, yet by its being ruined in the moſt
needful, it is become impaſſable; and though a Work of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Benefit and Charge, yet already rendred of little
Uſe.</p>

The reſt of this day's Journy was between the Mountains, where
we were encounter'd by ſtrange Flaſhes of Lightning, the Foretellers
of this Night's Rain,<note place="margin">Caureſtan.</note> which we hardly eſcaped before we came to
<hi>Caureſtan,</hi> in all Twenty Miles: This <hi>Caravan Ser Raw</hi> is named from
a Tree growing here, and a Village properly ſo called (of which it
is a Compoſition in <hi>Perſian</hi>), it being the firſt we met with whoſe
Houſes were fixed.</p>
                  <p>The following Day we continued going between two Chains of
Dry and Burnt Hills,<note place="margin">The Place where Men and Beaſts have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Heats.</note> through a ſtony Valley, not without fear of
ſuffocating, although it was near Evening e're we ſet out, and Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday's
Showers had benignly diſtilled on the Fiery Drought, to
cool the parched Earth: But this is the dreadful Vale, where when
the Hot <hi>North</hi> Winds blow at this time, it ſweeps both Men and
Beaſts away, either by Night or Day, the Heat being as intenſe and
as intolerable as that from the Mouth of an Oven: We were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
through this Furnace by the Divine Protection (without
being put to make uſe of the common Remedy in this Exigency,
which is, upon perceiving of the hot Blaſts, to caſt our ſelves flat on
the Ground till they are over, thereby to prevent the Fate attending
thoſe who refuſe to ſtoop to this known Preſcription, which is, to
fall down dead, never to riſe more alive), till we were mounted
where theſe two Chains are linked to each other, and by their mutual
Aſcent we were lift up on high, and then gently deſcending we were
let down to <hi>Goorbazergum,</hi> Fifteen Miles from <hi>Caureſtan.</hi>

a grateful Cooler in this Extremity of Heat: <hi>Goor-Bazergum</hi>

                  <p>Hence up Hill and down Hill, through broken Rocks and unſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Stones, through kindled Fires from ſulphurious Caverns, and the
more raging effects of the burning Orb, enlightening and enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the World beſide; here it kills and conſumes the un-nurtur'd
Plants, leaving them dry and ſapleſs; as if theſe great Heaps of
Rocks were made for no other end but to counterpoize the more
Fruitful Part of this Terreſtrial Globe; inſomuch that it had been
utterly impoſſible to have drawn Breath in this Place, had not the
late unuſual Rain ſomething allayed the Fury of the Heats, which
yet were troubleſome enough by reaſon of the ſteaming Miſts ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

moſt Ancient of this Country eſteemed ſo far out of courſe, that
their Memory fails them to relate the like.</p>

an <hi>Abaſſin,</hi> had built an old Caravan, Twenty Miles from <hi>Cormoot;</hi>
where we met a <hi>Caphala</hi> of light Aſſes going for the Port; and here
we were obliged to change more of our Camels, they being quite
tired.</p>
                  <p>In this Plain the Heats increaſed upon us ſo, that we could not
touch the Walls but they were like Fire, the Winds that ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
us were ready to inflame us, nor was any thing cool but the
Water, which they had kept in Earthen Veſſels dipped in their Wells
or Tanks, where being drowned they came up ſhivering cold, which
was all the Comfort we received here; wherefore at Sun ſet we made
for <hi>Lhor,</hi> choaked with Duſt and Heat; half-way, at a new <hi>Caravan
Ser Raw,</hi> we encountred three <hi>Caphalaes</hi> laden with Dry Fruit for
the Port: This was founded by the Overſeer of the Building of the
Long-Bridge over the Lake leading to the Gulph, who raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

                  <p>About Nine in the Morning we came to <hi>Lhor,</hi>

from <hi>Sham Zaugee.</hi> The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have here a neat, but ſmall
Dwelling, whither their Commodore comes ſometimes: In this we
deſigned to have worm ſome days away, but neither the Heat nor
<hi>Musquitoes</hi> would let us reſt long in this City; wherefore deſiring to
fly from theſe, we changed our Camels for Mules, that we might
make better ſpeed than theſe ſlow Animals would endure; for theſe
intemperate Seats were too hot for us, ſo that the ſame Afternoon
we mounted, and on Horſeback ſaw the remaining part of the City
leading us on our Way. The Road from <hi>Bunder</hi> to it is ſpacious and
open, through a pleaſant Campaign for near Twenty Miles, the
Mountains obſerving a modeſt diſtance on that ſide, although behind
it is begirt with enough for defence; at top of which is a notable
Seat, fit for a Caſtle, being of difficult Acceſs, from whence thoſe

                     <q>It grows after this manner;<note place="margin">How bred.</note> there is a Place in <hi>Perſia</hi> called <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon,</hi>

beyond <hi>Lhor,</hi> in whoſe Fields there ſprings up an Herb like
Saffronand Hermodactyls, on which the Flocks of Goats (or
Sheep) feed, and by their eating thereof theſe Stones concrete
and become an hard Subſtance; but I ſuſpend my Vote, whether
in the Stomach, Reins, or Bladder: However, that Belief may be
gained for any of theſe, ſeeing them halt and complain as much as
Men under the ſame diſtreſs, would more than incline the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous.
They are not, ſays he, unlike the <hi>Europe</hi> Goats, only
they have logner and ſtraiter Horns: They are not of divers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
as the affirms, neither go they in Flocks or Herbs together;
though I have eaten of their Fleſh more than once, hunted by
Greyhounds, being turned looſe from the Mountains, they having
much of the Nature of Veniſon both in their Taſte and Aſpect.
Moreover theſe Creatures (rather Sheep than goats) as they breed
greater or leſſer Stones, they diſcover it by their Gate, of which
both the crafty <hi>Armenian</hi> as well as <hi>Perſian</hi> are well adviſed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Other Creatures as well as theſe are ſubject to this Diſtemper, as
Cows, Sheep, and Apes; which laſt is reckoned the moſt excellent
<hi>Bezoar</hi> by more than a few.</p>
                  <p>To the Directions already given,<note place="margin">Its Trial.</note> I ſhall add, That the true <hi>Bezoar</hi>
Stones have a Straw, or ſomething in reſemblance thereof, which
never fails but in the Adulterate; and if the upper Coat being ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ff, there ſucceed not another Round, as is viſible in Onions,
till you come to the Straw, without doubt it is Counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>But the following Method will better betray the Cheat, becauſe
they leave nothing unattempted to impoſe upon the Buyers: If you
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53433:139"/>
rub the Stone with a little Lime, and if in the chafed Part there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
a Purple Colour, it declares it true and genuine, without ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication.
Or if you caſt them into a Baſon of Water, after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Account is taken of their Weight, and they be taken out Three
Hours after, and weighed again, and it anſwer the firſt Account, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loſing nor gaining by their ſtay in the Water, then pronounce
them right: But if being rubbed with Lime they chance to crack, or
a Flaw be made in the Trial, or that they alter upon their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion
in the Water, you ſlander them not, if you ſay they are
Falſe.</p>

by no other means than by terrible Earthquakes from the Bowels of

paſſed the Sands, which hold not digging ſuch a depth, this

                  <p>And now we began to be acquainted with the ſhift they make for

holds on many <hi>Pharſangs</hi> together for the advantage of the Vallies;
and this I look upon to be as much the cauſe of the Generation of

                  <p>And as a Boundary thereto, is oppoſed the ſteepeſt Hill we have

                  <p>On theſe Mountains the <hi>Maſtich</hi> Tree brings forth plenty of that

                  <p>And now the time approaches we muſt paſs over in one Day as
many Mountains as we have hitherto been conquering, ſome of
whoſe Clifts could never be gained, had they not been joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by vaſt Arches from Rock to Rock, their diſmal Pits otherwiſe
being rendred impaſſable: Thus by inexpreſſible Endeavours we
ſtrive to clear this formidable Chain of Hills, all in the Heat of the
Sun (not daring to truſt our ſelves in the Night), whereby we had
our Skins flead off of thoſe Parts expoſed to the Solar Rays; and thoſe
that fared beſt had Bladders raiſed, as if ſcalded or burnt by the Fire;
for which, when we had travell'd One and twenty Miles, we found
at <hi>Gerom</hi> a ready Medicine of the Butter of the Seed of Gourds made
into an Ointment, which appeaſed the Inflammation by its cooling
Virtue, and immediately aſſwaged the Pain by Baſting our ſelves

have but half an Eye.</p>
                  <p>The Occaſion whereof,<note place="margin">The Cauſe of their Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> as they report, is, becauſe little pretty

had emptied its ſelf; not being much concerned at the Accident, and
meeting a Country Fellow who by chance had a Cheeſe, he caſt it

Tale; which I mention for this end, that the true Appellation the
<hi>Perſians</hi> now give them, and their Reaſon for it may be recovered.</p>
                  <p>The Bridge over the River is very old, raiſed high by four Arches,
in the middle a Watch-Tower for the <hi>Rhadars</hi> to look out on, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

                     </note>
as this Day we had cauſe to ſuſpect; for this Evening the Rear of
our <hi>Caphala</hi> we had taken with us, being only Servants with Arms
(the other coming more leiſurely, kept the direct Road), were ſet
upon twice; but finding them in a condition to receive them, they
wheeled off in the Dusk, but with an intention to take us napping
when we were in our Lodgings at <hi>Meergoſcoon,</hi> Twelve Mile off the
Bridge, ſmooth Way, full of Farms and Country Towns; among
which Plain dealing ſeems moſt an end to be their only Guard; for
they being alarmed by the Rogues that dogged us, roſe immediately
in our defence, and gave us notice of our Danger, after one of the
Villains, on pretence to light his Pipe, had rudely broke in upon us,
to diſcover in what Poſture we were, who perceiving their Pains
would be only Blows, gave us no farther diſturbance.</p>
                  <p>However we were the more willing on this account to get up by
the crowing of the Cock,<note place="margin">Perſepolis <hi>now</hi> Chulminor.</note> to purſue our Journy to <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> whoſe
Ruins we had reached by Break of Day; when having compaſſed
its Marble Foundations (being above, an Area of a large Extent, on
the Plain an high Wall, giving ſome Pains to the attollent Muſcles of
the Neck, to give the Eyes leave to reach its Height), we clambred
a ſpacious Staircaſe united ſome part of the Way up, when on each
hand it led to the ſeveral Apartments two different Ways; at top
were the Portals, and the Heads of the Columns worn with Age
(<hi>damnoſa enim quid non imminuit dies</hi>) which conſumes every thing;
whoſe Bodies were <hi>Corinthian,</hi> but the Pedeſtals and Capitals of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
Order, as might be gained from what had reſiſted the corroding
Jaws of Time, hardly lifting up their Reverend Crowns, though
of moſt durable Stone.</p>
                  <p>Being entred the <hi>Pomaerium</hi> of <hi>Cambyſes</hi> Hall (if Faith be to be
given to the moſt Learned of theſe Relators), at the Hall Gates we
encountred two horrid Shapes both for Grandeur and Unwontedneſs,
being all in Armour, or Coat of Mail, ſtriking a Terror on thoſe
about to intrude; their Countenances were of the fierceſt Lions,
and might paſs for ſuch, had not huge Wings made them flying Gryf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fons,
and their Bulk and Hinder-Parts exceeded the largeſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.</p>
                  <p>In this Auguſt Place only Eighteen Pillars of Forty remain,<note place="margin">Stocks build on the Pillars.</note> about
Fifty Foot high, and half an Ell Diameter, of the diſtance of eight
Paces one from another, though we could count the Twenty two
Baſes; which agree with the <hi>Perſian</hi> Memoirs, who therefore ſtill
call it <hi>Chulminor, The Palace of Forty Pillars:</hi> Theſe may be ſeen on
the Plain a great way, and at preſent are the Reſidence only of the
Tyrants of the Lakes and Fens, Storks only keeping their Court
here, every Pillar having a Neſt of them.</p>

                  <p>Which may ſerve to contradict the received Opinion, of Storks
abiding only where Commonwealths are; this always having been
an Empire, and at this time is the moſt Abſolute in all the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Beyond theſe, many Pieces and Scraps of Antiquity offer us a
View, and great <hi>Coloſſus's</hi> ſupporting vaſt Giants, as if they had
been Yeomen of the Guard in the Anti-room to the Preſence-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which was Eighty Foot Square, where on the Fragments of
Walls ſtanding, and over the Porticoes eſpecially, were moſt curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
cut out of delicate White Shining Marble, Men in Military
Habit, like the Old <hi>Grecian Phalanx</hi> (if there be leave for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture)
encompaſſing a Monarch repreſented ſitting on his Throne,
with a Moving Canopy, ſuch as the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Kings have carried over
them: On other parts <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> or if that pleaſe not, ſome <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
Steed priding himſelf to carry an Emperor, or ſome Demi-god.
Becauſe neither <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> nor after him <hi>Plutarch,</hi> mention
the reedifying this Palace either by <hi>Alexander</hi> or any of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
yet I cannot let it paſs without this Remark, That they are
habited more like the Ancient <hi>Grecians,</hi> than <hi>Perſians</hi> now are; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the Hair of their Heads is hanging down, and not tied up,
which is different from the Modern Faſhion of this Country.</p>
                  <p>In this Apartment Eight Doors ſeem to anſwer each other, Two
on each ſide of every Square; which Conformity is attended with
extraordinary Elegance and Workmanſhip; the Roof ſeems never to
have had any intervening Pillars, and whether the Beams were of
Cedar, it is not ſo fortunate as to have a Voucher of its own Nation.
Many other Parts declared Coſt and Pains enough, but nothing
more worthy Study than the Characters fairly impreſſed and engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which would unfold the Truth of the Founders of this Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
were they as Intelligible as Legible; for they remain like the
Hand-writing on the Wall (<hi>Mene Tekel</hi>), till ſome Divine Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor
interpret them; yet I muſt needs ſay, many of the Characters
may be found in the <hi>Greek</hi> Alphabet.</p>
                  <p>This vaſt Fabrick is made bigger, by being joined to a great
Mountain, out of whoſe Entrails were worn, rather than digged,
Noble Caverns with Stately Sculptures, and wide Ponds of living
Water conſtantly diſtilling from the Marble Rocks, either for bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or neceſſary uſes: It is an admirable Piece, overlooking all the
Plain, where we took this day's Repaſt, and over Head ſaw the
Corniſh of the Frontiſpiece embelliſhed with the Royal Arms of the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Emperor, immediately on the Union of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
into one Empire, which was a Ram's Head delineated as far as
the Cheſt.</p>
                  <p>In the Afternoon we ſaw another of the ſame Make,<note place="margin">A Ram's-head the Arms of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                     </note> anſwering
the other part of the Palace, and underneath on the Plain took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of Two Pillars at a fit diſtance, the one for the Goal, and the
other for the Starting-place of their Courſers when they run Races.
Having thus finiſhed our Perambulation, we deſcended on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53433:146"/>
ſide we came up, and found there Goats and Sheep grazing on
the Graſs between the Joints of the Pavements; but on the Walls of
the Staircaſe (which conſiſted of an Hundred and twenty Stairs of
Black Marble on each ſide, till they united to Forty more, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
us to the Plain) were the Portraictures both of Men and
Beaſts on each ſide, and more of this Ancient Writing diſtinct in
large Panes; at the Bottom whereof our Horſes waiting us, we
mounted, and returned to <hi>Meergoſcoon,</hi> not a full <hi>Pharſang</hi> from
hence.</p>
                  <p>The following Day drove us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ruſtam</hi> a Prince of the <hi>Gaurs.</hi>
                     </note> out of the ſame Curioſity, over ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Branches of <hi>Bindamire</hi> River, to enquire for other Structures
of the like Nature, of which theſe Mountains afford plenty, bating
the great Area of <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> which diſtinguiſhes it from theſe; but
we did not alight for theſe, ſatisfying our ſelves to ſtare on them
from beneath, they being fit only for <hi>Atlaſſes,</hi> or for Winged Folk
to look into, there being no paſſage to them, appearing like Dens or
open Holes on the ſides of the Rocks, from their very Mouths per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
to the Ground: Only one above the reſt attracted our
Sight and Animadverſion, reported and ſtill averred to be of old
the Court of <hi>Ruſtam,</hi> an Ancient King of the <hi>Gaurs</hi> or <hi>Gabers</hi> (the
true Original <hi>Perſian</hi> Race), whoſe Statue was of a Gigantine Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
on as large a ſized Horſe, triumphing over his Foes at the Front
of his Cave, with many Attendants clad down to the Heels, with
Caps on their Heads (not Turbats) and their Hair looſe about
their Shoulders.</p>
                  <p>From whence obſerving frequent Numbers of theſe,<note place="margin">Uncertain whether it be <hi>Perſepolis.</hi>
                     </note> I was apt to
collect, that even what goes now for the <hi>Perſepolis</hi> which <hi>Alexander</hi>
gave leave in a Drunken Fit to be ſet on Fire at the Requeſt of the
Coſtly <hi>Thais,</hi> may be the Ruins of ſome Heathen Temple, having
ſeen of the ſame Receſſes among the Idolatrous <hi>Indians,</hi> which they
ſtill pay Adoration to, and own to be the Temples of their Gods.</p>
                  <p>But that that City might ſtand in this Plain, not only the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Tradition among all <hi>European</hi> Travellers, but the concurrent
Opinion of undoubted Hiſtorians, certify with all the probable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.</p>
                  <p>From hence under theſe high Hills we kept our Courſe, proving it
to be a Wealthy Plain, ſtored with all Cattel, Corn, and Wild Fowl,
by the plentiful Afflux of Water to the River from the Mountains,
and Cuts from the River into the Plain, whereby it might be a fit
Situation for the mighty <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> as it now is for ſtore of Country
Towns, beſides whole Armies of <hi>Nomades,</hi> or wandring Shepherds,
who pitch their Tents with all their Families, wherever they find a
Soil ſuitable to their Employment. Not far from whom were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of ſuch Tombs as we met with at <hi>Bonaru</hi> Level, which perhaps
may give ſome ſurer Account than that more Romantick one in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
we met with there, of their being the dying Trophies of
former Battels; though here wants not matter to countenance ſuch
Tales to thoſe of eaſy Faith.<note place="margin">The Straits where <hi>Artiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes</hi> repulſed <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                     </note> For two Mountains ſhut up this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Campaign ſo, as if Nature had taken ſpecial Care of its Security;
which as formerly they terminated the Territories of the contending
<hi>Gaurs,</hi> by their oppoſite Poſition, that nothing could creep between
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53433:147"/>
them unexamined, ſo it is not unlikely that theſe were the Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
<hi>Artibazanes</hi> defended againſt <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he repulſed
him, and had put a Stop to the Torrent of his Victories, had not a
<hi>Perſian</hi> Ruſtick ſhewed him an unknown Paſſage by the <hi>Pylae Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicae,</hi>
or Poſtern-Gates on the back of theſe Mountains, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Way to his farther Progreſs, as well as to the raviſhing this
thus baſely betray'd Country to the Lawleſs Rape of an ungovern'd
Ambition. To conclude therefore from hence, That theſe Burial-Places
took their beginning ſo long ago, as it would ſavour of ſmall
Judgment in the Affirmative, yet it may leave ſome ground to the
credulous, that it is poſſible ſome as notable Fights might ſucceed,
for the gaining ſuch a Key to ſo Rich and Spacious a Valley, as well
from time to time after <hi>Alexander,</hi> as that not a Century ſince, this
Part remained almoſt unſubdued, till <hi>Shaw Abas</hi> the Great brought
it to perfect Obedience, when there might be occaſion for ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terments,
if their Piety extended to ſuch a Care of the Dead.</p>
                  <p>But theſe Field-Inhabitants incline me to think it their Work, being
far from any Town; though the common Fame give it to the other
Report, as well to aggrandize their foregoing Anceſtry, as to caſt a
Luſtre on the preſent Poſterity. This may ſerve alſo to prove their
<hi>Scythian</hi> Antiquity; for as the Worthy Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> obſerves,

                  <p>From <hi>Meergoſcoon</hi> to this Strait is meaſured Twenty Mile,<note place="margin">Maijm.</note> which
finiſhes not this Stage, for now we were encompaſſed again with
Rocks and Stones among the Mountains, (which we know whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation
it was to command they ſhould be made Bread), our Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
being ſpent which we had taken for this Deviation; wherefore
we were forced to march Twenty Miles farther, to <hi>Maijm,</hi> before
either we or our Cattel baited; where we arriv'd before our <hi>Capha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
we had left at <hi>Siras,</hi> they pretending they had loſt their Way, but
more truly lingred, not having us to ſpur them on; wherefore we
were obliged this Night to make the Earth our Lodging, our Arms
our Bolſters, and the uneven Stones our Feather-beds; which though
we Travellers often do in this Journey out of choiſe, yet we found
it diſagreeable, becauſe the Nights now were as intenſely Cold, as
the Days were Hot. In the Forenoon to the next Day the <hi>Caphala</hi>
came, which created us this Day's Stay at <hi>Maijm,</hi> a Town where
grows the beſt Walnuts, of the ſame bigneſs with the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and
the choiceſt Tobacco <hi>Perſia</hi> affords.</p>
                  <p>After a ſweet Night's Repoſe, early in the Morn between the
Straits of the Mountains, we traced the Source of the River <hi>Araxes,</hi>
purling under ſlippery Pebbles, which no ſooner removed, than the
Cryſtal Water bubbles forth, by which means, though a little ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
at firſt, in Half a Mile's ſpace it emits a Stream able to drive
Three Mills, which notwithſtanding were not forcible enough to
reſtrain the impetuous Blaſts of Heat pent in between the Hills:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53433:147"/>
Although on the other ſide when we approached in the Night, all
the Cloaths we had wrapped about us, could hardly preſerve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Warmth, when the Sun had ſhrowded its ſelf under the Horizon.</p>
                  <p>At Noon-day we overcame an high Mountain after a troubleſome
Luctation, this delivering us to another Golden Plain of <hi>Ojoan,</hi>
gilded over with Ripe Wheat, being no more than Five Miles from
<hi>Maijm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Ojoan</hi> glories in the Sepulchre of another Royal Prophet,<note place="margin">Ojoan.</note> which

wild, if it may be called a Tree, and not a Shrub; the Body reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles

for the Sickle: On the other hand, in the Meadows and Marſhes
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53433:148"/>
were Droves of Fat Cattle, and all things appeared with the ſame

                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> the firſt, we brought
the higheſt part of another Mountain under our Feet, it dividing
this Plain from another Rich Valley cloathed with Green Graſs, and
therefore dedicated to the Paſture of the King's Breed of Horſes,
among which were Choice Ones of very great Value: We paſſed

                  <p>As we ſtrove early the next Morning to reach the end of the

                  <p>Having undergone the Pompous Fatigues of Saluting, and being
thereby taught the Formalities of Compliments, more than truly
acquainted with the Current of Affairs here; I found it true, That
an exalted Pitch of State is more tireſome than a meaner Condition,
it being only a more conſpicuous Confinement; for not to move
abroad without a Retinue, is to have a Superviſor to every Motion,
and a Man is leſs free either to obſerve or act: Wherefore being
tutored before-hand what a Diſrepute it was to the Nation whoſe
Title we bore, to appear to its Diſgrace, I reſolved to avoid that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency,
and change my <hi>European</hi> Cloaths for a <hi>Perſian</hi> Veſt and
Turbat, that I might walk about undiſcovered, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
to the Publick Miniſter of my Country, and give my Eyes
that Satisfaction my Ears were not capable of receiving; by which
Expedient my View was leſs tranſient, and I had time to dwell lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

in the <hi>Buzzars,</hi> mixed among a Crowd of other Tradeſmen; who
ſell by Retail, and paſs without any Brand, having their Synagogues
open every Sabbath day. Theſe are the greateſt Brokers, and as
cunning, if not exceeding the <hi>Banyans,</hi> who alſo are in every Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

the Name of <hi>Jelfalines:</hi> We paſs to this City through two or three
of the Palace-Yards, by a great Gate that brought us to a long Walk
planted on both ſides with high Sycamors, aſpiring like the lofty
Cedar, whoſe Roots are waſhed with two Streams all the length of it.
In the middle is a neat Bridge, built more politely than the other
(though the Water has long ſince forſook the Channel): Leaving

Theſe ſeem to me the moſt lively Repreſentations of the Figures
both on the Rocks, and on the Palace it ſelf at <hi>Perſepolis:</hi> Theſe
are Inſtances how momentary the Grandeur of this World is:
Theſe, once the Lords of all the Earth that the Ocean waſhes on
this Side, and the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> ſhuts in on the other, forgetful of the
Everlaſting Name of the <hi>Grand Cyrus,</hi> who firſt ſubjugated the

Seat of the Empire among their Renowned Anceſtry: Theſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
for their Sloth and Cowardiſe, are the reproachful Relicks,
nay, Dregs rather of the former Glory of their Name and Nation,
which once gave her Laws, as Unalterable Decrees to all People,
Nations, and Languages: Theſe thus dwindled and degenerated,
are the miſerable Poſterity of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> who for ſo many Ages
have with a tame Patience ſubmitted by a ſordid Servitude to thoſe
whom their Forefathers would have ſcorn'd to have admitted to be
their Slaves; only that they might idely enjoy their Country Gods,
Adore the Eternal Fire, and the Influence of the Sun upon their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
now Beaſtly and Impious more than ever, becauſe they have
contaminated them with the Impure Rites and Diabolical Cuſtoms
of the worſt of <hi>Pagans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For there are ſome of them Couple together in their Sacred
Feaſts (as they term them) promiſcuouſly,<note place="margin">Their Impure Feaſts.</note> when they meet in
their <hi>Delubriums;</hi> where they ſpread a clean Table-cloth on the Floor,
on which they place their Banquets to inflame their Laſcivious Hear,
which muſt be acknowledged to be ſet on Fire by Hell, whatever the
Extract that they Worſhip as a Spark of the Sun, may be defended
to be. When they take away, they ſtrew the foul Cloth with Meal-Flower,
and the better to perpetrate their Inceſtuous Luſts, they
put out the Lights, and ſhifting themſelves ſtark naked, both Men
and Women, the Men caſt their Breeches on an heap in a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Room: Which being done, the Women run in the dark
to catch as catch can; and whatever Lot they light on, the Lamps
being again lighted, they firmly embrace for their Lover, if it be
Father or Brother, or any other Relation: And which is ſtill worſe,
the Night being ſpent in Beſtiality, the naſty Flower (which by
their Filthineſs either of Vomit or Excrement in which they wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like Brutes) is kneaded into a Paſt, and eaten as a Sacrament to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the ſame ungodly Feſtival Annually, as if it were a Sacrifice
well-pleaſing to their Deities. But Propagation after this kind is as odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to Mankind, as offering Children to <hi>Moloch,</hi> or making them run
through the Fire is execrable and abhorrent to Nature: Which made
an Ancient Heathen, in deteſtation of ſuch horrid Crimes offered as
grateful Services to the Gods, burſt out into this Exclamation: <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Whether we mayn't here find the Induſtrious Mr. <hi>Shering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Labour in ſearch of Truth anſwer'd in his far-fetch'd <hi>Aſae;
Aſa</hi> being the Commoneſt Name among the <hi>Gabers,</hi> whom he makes

however Degenerate they now appear. Among this Off-ſcum

                  <p>Though the State,<note place="margin">The <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Governor of their own, as well as one of the <hi>Moors.</hi>

according to the Succeſſes of eithers Forces, for a long time;
removing them from <hi>Erewan, Taberez,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> their Native

Protection of the Queen-Mother, aſſerting thereby their Rights and
Privileges in an higher manner (abating ſome little Circumſtances)
than the <hi>Moors</hi> themſelves; by which they became not only ſafe

after they themſelves have been brought up, they train
their Children under the ſafe Conduct of Experienced Tutors,
who inſtruct them firſt to Labour for a Livelihood, before they are
permitted to Expend.</p>

prudent Emperor, by Favouring their Deſigns, and taking all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
from their Adverſaries of Injuring them, expoſed as they were
to open Violence; and at Home Securing them from the Treachery
and Envy of his own Subjects; not only allotting them a place
over-againſt his own Palace to Build their City, but encouraging
them to Rear Coſtly and well Endowed Temples, without any
Moleſtation, to the Honour of the Bleſſed Name of Chriſt; ſhaking
off thereby the dreadful fear of Captivity, they began to hope for
better things, than they could promiſe themſelves in their diſtreſſed

                  <p>The Series after this Succeſſion of Patriarchs, as it was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
puddled with the Mud of Hereſy, ſo it often was diſturbed by
the Impoſition of the Secular Power, forcing not only Ignorant but
Ungodly Men upon them; who now at this Time have their <hi>Conge
d' Eſlire</hi> from a Prince of another Religion, and many times purchaſe
it by Simoniacal Contracts: So that the Purity of Chriſtianity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be expected, where Gain is made of Godlineſs, and theſe high
Cures of Souls are bought and ſold; entring upon them with the
Emperor's Licenſe, not the Approbation of their own Clergy; not
by Deſert and Merit, but by Fraud and Circumvention: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Humility and Godlineſs, Learning and Ingenuity, ſhould be the
Qualifications, now Pride and Envy, great Gifts with Stupidity are
exalted: And which is moſt deplorable, generally ſuch Men are put
into the Patriarchates as are moſt odious to them; whence it comes
to paſs, that theſe Prelates have as little Integrity as Orthodoxy,
they favouring the <hi>Jacobites</hi> even to this day.</p>

                  <p>They have Five Sacraments, leaving out Confirmation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Unction, which makes theirs leſs by Two than the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>They buy and ſell the Sacraments of the Church for a Price.</p>
                  <p>The Clergymen Merchandize.</p>

                  <p>They adminiſter the Sacraments to Children, before the Uſe of
Right Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>They deny the Superiority or Primacy to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and
they uſe this Interrogation for an Argument, <q>Why rather That than
the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in which City we were firſt called Chriſtians,
by the Preaching of St. <hi>Peter?</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are againſt Purgatory. For which reaſon the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> affix
the Error of the <hi>Abaſſins</hi> upon them, Of Cauterizing when they
Baptize Infants, or initiate any into the Church; according to the
Words of St. <hi>John, He ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with
Fire;</hi> taking the Words literally: Wherefore the <hi>Abaſſins,</hi> not the
<hi>Armenians,</hi> are called St. <hi>John</hi>'s Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>They diſtribute the Euchariſt in both kinds to the People, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
of the Body of Chriſt, dipping the Wafer into the
Wine and Water mixed together, and then give it to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants.</p>
                  <p>They wrap the Word of God in a clean Piece of Silk, which
when the Prieſt unfolds, he kiſſes the Bible, and bows: The like
Ceremony is uſed at the Elevation of the Hoſt, which he gives to all
alike to ſalute, as alſo both the Teſtaments.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Cuſtoms and Opinions divulged and maintained by
their Patriarchs,<note place="margin">The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs inſtall'd with Pomp.</note> to whom great Honour is paid; being introduced
into their ſeveral Sees as well by the Pomp of the <hi>Moors</hi> as the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Chriſtians: The <hi>Cauns</hi> of the Provinces conducting them
with all their Train, and Forces of Horſe and Foot, with Banners
flying, and loud Muſick reſounding, great Guns diſcharging, and
all the Expreſſions of Joy congratulating their Inſtalment, and the
King's Favour towards them.</p>
                  <p>The Clergy meet them in their ſeveral Habits; the Laity alſo ſhew
their Gallantry, and the Patriarchs themſelves are in their Holy Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Rich Copes, Mitres, and Croſiers, beſet with ineſtimable
Jewels. They are diſtinguiſhed from the Biſhops by wearing Rings
on their Fingers, embelliſhed with Diamonds, whereas the Biſhops
wear only plain Gold Rings. Their Pontificals being put off, they
walk in a Black Gown with a Mitred Hood and Paſtoral Staff, as do
the <hi>Vortobeeds,</hi> who are the learned'ſt and beſt eſteem'd of all their
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53433:157"/>
Orders, and in abſence of the Patriarch and Biſhops exerciſe all the
Pontifical Functions: Theſe are Eloquent Preachers in their Pulpits;
theſe only vow Chaſtity, and what is more ſtrict, endure not the
ſight of a Woman; and if in the Street by chance they meet one,
they preſently turn their Backs; and if they have any Buſineſs in
that part of the Church allotted them by Cuſtom, they commit not
themſelves to them, but cauſe them to be drove away, before they
will read the Service.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Jelfa</hi> ſome Forty of theſe live a Celibate Life,<note place="margin">The <hi>Vortobeeds</hi> or Monaſticks.</note> at the Monaſtry
joining to the Cathedral, in Cells and Cloyſters, with an Archbiſhop
of the ſame Order, faring hardly, and living devoutly.</p>
                  <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Jelfa</hi> ſubmits his Province to the Patriarch of
<hi>Vagarſiabat;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</note> he is a goodly Reverend Old Man, ſnowed with Age,

                  <p>The other Orders of the Clergy,<note place="margin">Their Clergy marry.</note> whether Prieſts, Deacons, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
or Choriſters, uſe Chriſtian Liberty in reſpect of Matrimony,
it being diſallowed none but the <hi>Vortobeeds:</hi> They are diſtinguiſhed
no other ways from the Ruſticks, than their wearing Blue Veſts,
Turbats, and Tunicks, as they do, unleſs a long Cloak, or Gown of
Black over all, points them out to be an <hi>Armenian</hi> Father, or an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick
in Orders: They are ſhaved as the <hi>Romans</hi> are, and unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Heads in Salutation; they are conſtant Frequenters of their
Churches, and have Lamps always burning in them; and every one
takes his turn in the Order of the Prieſthood, to wait Day and Night
in the Temples, according to the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Inſtitution, to whom are
appointed Lodgings adjoining to their Churches; at other Times
they live with their Families in the City: Every one approaching
them pays them a Reverence, and begs their Bleſſing, kiſſing the
Hem of their Garments, which the Prieſts return to the <hi>Vortobeeds,</hi>
the <hi>Vortobeeds</hi> to the Biſhops, and the Biſhops to the Patriarchs.</p>
                  <p>Having been preſent at their Maſſes for the Dead, for Infants in
Baptiſm, and for the Husband and Wife new-married; I ſhall thence
take occaſion to relate in ſhort their Banquets, Faſts, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
uſed on their Celebrating theſe Rites.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall begin with their firſt Admiſſion into the Pale of the
Church.<note place="margin">Baptiſm.</note> While they are at Divine Service a proper Maſs is ſaid,
when the Midwife or Nurſe brings the Child to Church, with a Tribe
of Women, where ſhe delivers it to the Godfather, who carries it to
the Miniſter waiting at the Font on the Right Side beneath the Altar,
who unwinding the Swathes, receives the Infant naked, and his
Thumb being anointed with conſecrated Oyl or Balſom, ſigns it
with the Sign of the Croſs, not only on the Forhead, but on the
Breaſt and Back, Feet and Arms, and all the other Parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
After this, pouring of the ſame Chryſm into the warm Water
in the Font, reciting ſome ſpecial Prayers, and dipping the Crucifix
into it, it becomes an Hallowed Bath, in which the Babe is waſhed
all over by the Prieſt: When it is taken out, it is croſſed from Head
to Foot, and ſpitting into the Ears and Eyes it is diſmiſs'd with an
Amulet hung at its Breaſt for Eight Days, as a Charm againſt Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53433:158"/>
and reſtored to the Women to be cloathed. The Maſs being
done, the Gueſts return to the Houſe of the Parents, with a Noiſe
of Muſick before them, and the Choir in Proceſſion ſinging Anthems,
where they all make merry before they depart. If it be a Girl it is
Eſpouſed immediately after Baptiſm, to prevent its being ſent for into
the <hi>Haram</hi> by the Emperor, who pretends a Power over them to
chuſe for his own uſe out of thoſe not betrothed.</p>
                  <p>The great Feſtivity of the Birth and Baptiſm of our Saviour, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> is celebrated with Rites of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for they conſecrate the Tank or Ciſtern, filled with Water and
Odoriferous Oyls, which, after the Sacrament received, is given out
among the People with great Clamour and Striving.</p>
                  <p>This Solemnity has been ſo Splendid, that the Emperors and the
Court were wont to honour it with their Preſence, when they were
entertained with Interludes, and Repreſentations of the Birth, the
Morning being uſhered in with Vocal and Inſtrumental Muſick,
with Millions of Flambeaus, and ſhewing the Angels and Shepherds,
with the Heavenly Hoſt, <hi>Singing praiſes to God on high, and good will
towards Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When this was performed, the Rich Merchants ſtrove to expreſs
their Senſe of theſe Favours, by inviting them to extraordinary Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting
and Feaſting; and after Expenſive Repaſts, the River being
conſecrated for the purpoſe, the Ceremonies of Baptiſm were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
when notwithſtanding it is extreamly cold, thoſe of Riper
Years were baptized, and ſwam about for the Diverſion of the Court;
concluding all with a Night of Jollity.</p>
                  <p>The modeſteſt account of which Pranks muſt be, The Hopes of
gaining Proſelytes by ſuch Shews, rather than to expoſe their moſt
Holy Religion to the Contempt of Infidels, out of any Deſign or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;
otherwiſe this Practice admits of a ſcandalous Interpretation:
But alas! it is too true in the affirmative, That in <hi>India</hi> among the
Idolatrous it might take, but among thoſe that abhor all manner of
Forms and Shapes in their Worſhip, it turns to the Reproach, and not
Advancement of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>The next thing after being Baptized,<note place="margin">Matrimony.</note> is to commit Matrimony,
the only way they have of propagating their Faith; it being a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
no leſs than Capital, to attempt by any means to perſuade a
<hi>Muſſleman</hi> to abjure his beſotted Fancy concerning their Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
but that is not ſo much the Reaſon, as prevailing Cuſtom,
which has from Age to Age led them to marry their Children very
young; chiefly becauſe the Advantage made by their Bargain is not
of ſuch Concern as in <hi>Europe,</hi> where Portion, more than Honeſty of
the Family, is conſidered; but here the greateſt Dowry is the Credit
of the Relations, and the Women not the Men make the Price, they
being Miſtreſſes of nothing more than their Beauty and Virtue; ſo
that they never are ſnatch'd up for their Great Fortunes, however
Wealthy their Parents are, they being wholly at their Diſpoſals who
make the Matches, without the Courtſhip or Knowledge of the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be married; wherefore they are entred into that ſort of Life
before they know how to get out of it; for they rarely paſs their
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53433:158"/>
Childhood before they are tied in that indiſſoluble Band; whence
ſome Excuſe may be made, for the Prieſts ſo frequently taking Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to Unmarry them; a thing I have heard more than once wiſh'd
for in other Countries, but in vain; though they promiſe to be as
liberal to the Parſon who had that Knack, as any one grieved with
the Gout, would be to the Phyſician who had an infallible way to
Cure that Diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremonies enjoined by the Church are agreeable enough to
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Inſtitution: Returning home, the Wedded Pair are kept
cloſe up together for Forty Days, loaded with Roſaries and Images,
and none ſuffered to come at them, that are Strangers, nor the
Womankind to ſpeak to any but their Husband; leſt an evil Tongue
ſhould have a Sorcerous effect, or a bad Eye ſhould Inchant their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Bliſs.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Quadrageſſimal</hi> Reſtraint being over (if no Faſt intervene,
of which their Church is full) they prepare themſelves to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the Nuptials with their Kindred, which is on this manner:
The Eldeſt of the Family on the Husband's ſide, opens the Feſtival
by firſt Inviting the Gueſts to the Marriage Feaſt, where the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
appears in a mean Dreſs and poorly Habited, till the Prieſts
have received Richer Habiliments of the Grandfathers, or Eldeſt
Uncles Gift, and brought them covered into the middle of the
Gueſt Chamber, where they Sanctify them and Bleſs them for his
uſe, the Youth ſtanding by; to verify what <hi>Paladius</hi> uſed for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>Inveſtem Puerum quaſi imberbem,</hi> when he called a Beardleſs
Boy by the Epithet of an Undreſſed Lad; and every one taking their
Places, the Servants lay them down on the Carpets, and unwinding
the Silk Embroidered for to wrap them in, diſcover only the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's
Suit, with an old ruſty Sword of the Family's, not worn
ſince <hi>Shaw Abas</hi> reduced them; for in theſe Countries it is not the
Cuſtom that Women of good Fame, or Repute, ſhould meet in
Publick Conventions with the Men, but they Tranſact their own
Affairs in their own Houſe of Parliament among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>On the Heels of the Servants come the Clerks with their Choir,
and taking the Cloaths, only one (which is all Cloth of Gold) being
the uppermoſt Garment, is a looſe Coat of <hi>London</hi> Cloth, without
Sleeves, Lined with Sables to keep off the Winters Cold; when the
Reverend Sages call forth the new Married Stripling, whom they place
between Two Bridemen about his own Age, they all Three Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
while they Sing the <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> not ſo much as lifting up
their Heads till all the Rites are finiſhed; then they wait on the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
into another Room, whither his Robes are carried, and when
he is ſhifted, he returns attended by his Bridemen; when every one
of them Salute the Hands of all that are called to this Solemnity,
and, after an Ancient Cuſtom, Invite them to take a Cold Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
among the Tombs, to put them in mind of Mortality at the
ſame time they are contriving to continue the World.</p>
                  <p>The Young Spark being lift up on Horſeback, and ſome time
carefully held on each ſide on Foot, leads the way to the Cavalcade,
Riding in State, after a Noiſe of Fidlers, Drummers, Pipers, and
other Lacquies, Pages, and Footmen; after whom an innumerable

Concourſe of Horſemen follow to the Graves, near a Mile out of
the City (among whom are ſome very noble Sepulchres fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſo great a Company) but in fair Weather they ſpread their
Carpets, and ſet up their Tents near the ſide of a Brook, almoſt
waſhing their Burial place.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> having ſhewn their good will to <hi>Venus,</hi>
(for it is known without them no hearty Sacrifice is paid her) <hi>Hymen</hi>
delivers out his Torches, the Sun having withdrawn his; and every

only Bonfires, Flambeaus, and Fireworks Illuminate the Road all
along: Entring <hi>Jelfa,</hi> the ſtately Gates of their Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

Tapers in divers Coloured Paper Lanthorns; which look gracefully
and divert the Company with variety of Artful Fires, each ſtriving
to outvie others; and are Entertained at the ſame time with Wine
and Sweetmeats, Drinking of Healths, and at laſt diſmiſs'd with
freſh Tapers given to all the Gueſts.</p>
                  <p>This continues in the Way to the Cathedral, where about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
the Bridegroom arriving, begs the Bleſſing of the Archbiſhop,
and they hardly return to the Houſe from whence they ſet out, till
almoſt Break of Day.</p>
                  <p>Where they are ſcarcely compoſed to Sleep, before the Father of
the Bride knocks on the ſame Errand, calling the Gueſts to accept of
a Treat at his Houſe; where thoſe Invited are carried into a noble
open Banquetting-Houſe in a Garden, with Tanks and Adornments
very Magnificent, after their Faſhion; the Room is Perſumed with
coſtly Odours, Smoaking out of Antick, Weighty, Silver Perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Pots, or Pans; and being Seated, Voiders of Sweatmeats
(with a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Coat, as they call it) a Dram of Brandy is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
every one; and then the Servants bring the beſt Raiments yet

the Ceremonies are the ſame of the Clergy, only with
this addition, the Bridemen which Kneeled yeſterday, to day ſtand
upright with flaming Flambeaus in their Hands.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Ceremonies ended, and the Sweatmeats taken off, a Table
is ſpread, and more than twice Seven Plates are differently Modified
to invite the Palate to Luxury; to which that of <hi>Muturantius,</hi> for

But here are ſuch loads of Proviſions, that none need fear a quicker
Eye than Appetite, at leiſure to take notice what each Eats; for

before their Portions ſink.</p>
                  <p>Yet all theſe Preparations, with the enticing Poinant Sawces,
and provoking Pickles, prevail not on the Bridegroom to fall to,
till the Father-in-Law lays to his new Son's double Meſs, a Purſe of
Gold; and this is the only thing they bear away by way of Dowry:

After this Debt is cancelled, no Cloud appears to diſturb the Mirth,
Eating, Drinking, and facetious Diſcourſe is all the Buſineſs; and in

as if they never thought you Welcome before you had Eat
like a Glutton, and Drank like a Swine: After ſhifting of Plates
unaccountably, and every one's Health has reaſon done it, they take
off the Table-Cloth, but not remove their Seats; Fruit, Wine, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,

Figures; at laſt they bring the News that the Matrons had diſmiſſed
the Bride Adorned with all her Wealth and Gallantry; when they
riſe, but proceed not till ſhe is delivered to her Groom, who waits on
her to her Horſe; when they are both Mounted, the Eccleſiaſticks
marſhal the Proceſſion; all the Streets are Illuminated, the loud
Drums and Trumpets proclaim their approach; in the Front is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

peculiar Habits, which were Rich, and the Choiriſters Surplices full
of Red Croſſes; after theſe the Bride and Bridegroom, He nobly
Mounted and ſplendidly Accoutred with Magnificent Trappings;
his Horſe led, and the Bride held on by Matrons, Croſs-legg'd, after
the Country Faſhion for Women to Ride, but Vailed all over with
a Saffron-coloured Vail;

Leſt if the Bluſhes of the Virgin Bride ſhould be diſcovered, or if too

                  <p>Nor do they go far before they repeat their Banquets, with Preſents
of Tapers, Sweetmeats, Squibs, Serpents and Rockets, as they paſs;
the Glory of this Night is always deſigned to pay their Reſpects to

as on their Feaſt-days by a Chriſtian Chearfulneſs, to declare to the

as a Refreſhment after ſincere Humiliation and Penance.</p>
                  <p>Two Days in every Week they hold a ſtrict Faſt, not only from

St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> has exempted Women with Child, the Infirm and

their own deciſion; for it is a queſtion among them, If it be not moſt
probable, that after the bright Phoſphor of the Heavenly Hoſt, the
Shepherds Eyes might not be dazled, and for that reaſon wanting
more than the Light of the Stars, were conſtrained to kindle dry
Twigs, or Boughs of Trees to light them in queſt of the declared
Meſſias? However this ſatisfies not the Generality, but that it has
many Oppoſers, and they ſay, it was on the Morning to the Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Bleſſed Virgin, when Old <hi>Simeon</hi> had his Age Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
and became Young enough to Embrace the Child Jeſus, and

have armed it on purpoſe; it being a Four-footed Beaſt, with Three
Partings of the Hoof, built on thick ſtrong Thighs, but ſhort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the great bulk of its Body which preſſes them; it is Tall
enough to reach the Bowels of its Antagoniſt with its Horn, with
which it Gores him to Death; nor has ſhe given him leſs firm Bones

its very Hide with a Coat of Mail; wherefore before on the

                  <p>Whether the Rhinoceros be the Unicorn, I ſuſpend my belief,
ſince I have ſeen an Horn turned with Furrows and Ridges from the
Baſis to the Point, and Tapering like that of our King's Arms: But
what <hi>Petrus Angelius</hi> relates concerning the <hi>Onager,</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Aſs,

for though his Verſes are moſt Elegant in his 5. <hi>lib. Cyneget,</hi> yet the

His words in Proſe are theſe; <q>The Wild Aſſes of <hi>India</hi> are as big,
or bigger than Horſes, whoſe Heads are of a Purple die, their
Eyes Blew, the reſt of their Body White; on their Foreheads they
have an Horn a Cubit in length, whoſe lower part for Two Hands
breadth is White, and the Top, which is ſharp, inclining to a
bright Red, but the Middle part is blood Red; of theſe they make
Cups, out of which whoſoever Drinks, neither Cramp nor Falling
Sickneſs ſeizes them; nor has any manner of Poiſon any force, if
that immediately before or after taking of the ſame, either Water,
Wine,</q> or other Liquid thing be taken out of theſe Cups.</p>
                  <p>That this Opinion is taken up upon the account of the Rhino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceros
his Horn, I can certainly verify, and that great Prices are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

that Experiment they are often deceived by falſe Horns made
into drinking Cups; thus much is true of the Rhinoceros, but the
other part of it holds not Water; they come from <hi>Bengala,</hi> and are

come down with the laſt themſelves: Some of theſe we ſaw tried,

of the Country to be too hard for them; whereby it is familiar to
give an Hundred <hi>Thomands</hi> for a right <hi>Muſcovia</hi> Hawk; of which

Some of them in their Swoops are ſo couragious, as to ſeize the
Heads of Deer or Antelopes, and ſeating themſelves with their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
between their Horns, pick out their Eyes, or doze them with
their Beaks, or ſtupify them with their Strokes; ſo that no Hunting
in the World is like it, to ſee them ſoaring in a wide Plain where
Herds of theſe are, (eſpecially if there be theſe Water-pits for the
Courſes under Ground), at once to obſerve them guarding their
Fronts, ſcampering with their Heads to the Earth, to avoid the
tow'ring Enemy aloft; ſometimes unawares to fall Captives into
theſe Wells, not ſuſpecting the Danger under foot, ſo much as
avoiding that which threatens them over head, whereby they run
into Thickets, or againſt Shrubs and Stumps of Trees, tumbling
and leaping unadviſedly, ſo that Greyhounds being ſet upon them,
eaſily overtake them.</p>
                  <p>Not by this Stratagem to derogate from their Greyhounds,<note place="margin">Greyhounds.</note> which

worth than Food, being forced to ſend Camels to fetch it many

                  <p>In our Return we obſerved ſeveral Tombs of the Ancient <hi>Gabers,</hi>

as well as the lamentable plight all the <hi>Mahometans</hi> were in,
they ſuppoſing that Orb to be in Labour, and therefore by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Incantations concerned at its Delivery, all the time beating
Pots of Braſs, making a Noiſe as dreadful as the Day of Doom:
The Eclypſe being over, the Weather cleared up again, as alſo the
Madneſs of the People was allay'd.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>September</hi> the Mornings and Evenings were ſharp,<note place="margin">The Suburbs.</note> and the
<hi>North-Weſt</hi> Winds began to bring the Winter's Cold, though the Day-time
was Hot and Serene; wherein we made another Excurſion
through the Suburbs on the farther ſide of the Court, to <hi>Jelfa,</hi>
through new <hi>Buzzars,</hi> finer and better Arch'd than thoſe in the City,
terminating in the Squares of divers Noblemen, who had reared
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53433:166"/>
them at their own Charge and Advantage; whereby they were
more Coſtly and Neat, broad enough for two Coaches to paſs
abreaſt, though this City is unacquainted with thoſe Carriages; nor
indeed would they be convenient, by reaſon of the Narrow Streets
within, and Mountains without.</p>
                  <p>Theſe brought us a long way to the River-ſide,<note place="margin">A Third Bridge.</note> adorned with
Dwellings of their Great Men, over which, to the Chriſtian Town,
lay another Bridge, inferior neither for Length, or Elegancy of
Structure, to either of the former two, but much later built. At
the Foot of it is a large Coppice of Willows, reaching a great way
by the Water-ſide; here the <hi>Jelfalines</hi> met us with their uſual Noiſe
of loud Muſick, and led us directly up to a Mountain, where the
Emperors have digged a Grotto overlooking all the City, at their
Retirements hither ſhading them from the Sun's Violence: This is

                  <p>Hence in two days we compaſſed the two Cities of <hi>Iſpahaun</hi> and

<hi>Spain,</hi> in half a Year, eſtimating by Balance of Six thouſand Aſs or
Mules Loads of them expended every day: For though they have
good Butchers Meat and Poultry, their chiefeſt Diet is on Fruit; and
if ſuch vaſt Quantities be brought out of the Country daily, beſides
what may be planted within their own Walls, it may be concluded
ſome Thouſands of Inhabitants contribute to the devouring of them;
though it muſt not be credited what is ſpoken hyperbolically by theſe
Citizens, That it is the biggeſt City in the World, and therefore by
way of Excellency called, <hi>The World.</hi>

                  <p>To ſhut up therefore this Diſcourſe, I ſhall borrow an Indication
from the Tall Trees growing in a free Air; for from their bending
towards any Point of the Compaſs, thence is collected from what
Quarter of the Heavens the moſt forcible and frequent Winds do
come, in what Region ſoever they blow; ſo Trees growing near the
Sea-ſhore, incline towards the Land, but up-land in <hi>Perſia</hi> they
grow upright, which ſhews no conſtant Winds to have any ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence;
though from the <hi>Autumnal Equinox,</hi> the <hi>North-Weſt</hi> uſhers
in the Wet Weather, to make way for the Froſt and Snow till <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
yet it is often variable, and veres to the <hi>East,</hi> when it is pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Cold, from <hi>January</hi> to the middle of <hi>February.</hi>

                  <p>The firſt New Moon in <hi>October</hi> brings the <hi>Muſſlemens</hi> Lent of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazan,</hi>
which hapned on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> this Year, and was the ſame day
our Agent ſet forth for <hi>Bunder,</hi> leaving me ſick behind. The 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
of <hi>November</hi> put an end to their Faſt, and began a Day of Jubilee;
when the Leafs were all dropped off, and the Earth and Trees were
naked; after which, Bodies indiſpoſed ſue for a Writ of Eaſe, and
as the Winter is more piercing, they recover Health.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>December</hi> locks up all in Ice and Snow,<note place="margin">Sharp Winter here.</note> and conſtipates the Pores
of the Earth that it cannot be tilled; the Tops of Mountains are
all capped, and the Sharp Winds and Serene Air make it leſs tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> it being ready to cut you through; though
then in the Sun it is ſo warm, that the Poor are beholden to it for
their Stores: It ſeldom ſnows above three or four days together, but
that is ſufficient to load the Mountains, and to fill the Valleys for
many days, before it be diſſolved. And then it proves fatal to the
Houſes built only of Mud; for whilſt they ſeek to ſecure the Roof,
many times by ſweeping it thence, the Snow melts at the bottom,
and undermines their Foundations, that oftentimes they become
mixt with the Dirt in the Streets.</p>

Cold Parts of the World, by which they cheriſh the innate
Heat, otherwiſe like enough to be oppreſt; which they do after a
peculiar manner: In the middle of a Square cloſe Room, they dig
an Hearth Fourſquare (not raiſed, as in our College-halls), over
which is ſet a Square, Low, but Large Table, whereon is thrown
a Quilt, and upon the Hearth is only ſet an Earthen Pot of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53433:168"/>
all the reſt of the Room is ſpread with Beds and Quilts, into
which, whoever comes (after his Slippers are put off) he thruſts
his Feet under the Quilt covering the Table; which way, though
it keep them warm, is prejudicial to the Nerves and Brain, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Mercurial Fumes ariſing from the Charcoal; being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to uſe that for want of plenty of Wood to Burn in Chimnies;
the Conveniency whereof they are unacquainted with, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeen any Chimney but what is in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory.</p>
                  <p>Their Kitchins are all over of a Smoak like our Malt Kills,
with ſuch ventilating Tiles as they have, they rounding their Cook
Rooms with ſmall Furnaces, ſuch as our Chymiſts make in their
Laboratories, ſetting their Earthen, or Copper Pots thereon, not
hanging them on Pothooks as we do.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all,<note place="margin">A pure Air without Soil.</note> for a final and undeniable Experiment of the
Pureneſs and Clearneſs of the Air here, let a Sword, never ſo well
Poliſhed, (and they have the beſt Damaſcened Swords) lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheathed
a whole Night, or longer, in Snow, or Water; take it
thence and never wipe it, and it ſhall not Ruſt: Beſides, now at

which proceeds from the remoteneſs of <hi>Spahaun</hi> from any Sea,

which is Five hundred Miles off; beſides its being environed with
dry barren Mountains, whence come fine, rare, and thin Blaſts;
inſomuch that could Bodies ever be in an Equilibrium as to their
Temperament, certainly it might be preſerved here rather than in
any other place; for whatſoever Stranger comes hither with an
Healthy Conſtitution, it is very laſting; and the Natives who

merrily, becauſe of the common Neceſſity of Death, as in this Ode
he exhorteth <hi>Sextius;</hi> but to compenſate for our paſt Labours, and
enable us the better to undergo this troubleſome Journy: Here we
indulged in a never-dying Green Orchard, mixing the Flavour of
the Oranges, which are as good as grow, with our new <hi>Siras</hi> Wine,
exhilarating our ſelves with the true Reliſh, and Natural Sweets of
this delightful Rural Seat.</p>
                  <p>But the Checquer-work of this World prepared other Buſineſs for
the ſucceeding Day, bringing us over high Rocks, made plain by
Coſt and Pains: Here on the Tops of Mountains we only ſaw the
Snow; however, the Winds blowing off thence, made us feel our
quaking Joints ſtruck through with horrid Numbneſs; by which
means nothing more frequently happen'd, than one quarter of an
hour to be ſeized with ſhivering Blaſts; and when they were over,
the Sun by its powerful Heat another Quarter to ſcorch our Skin,
expoſed to his Rays; by which ſudden Alterations, not only our
Hands and Faces were vexed, but our whole Bodies ſuffered Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment,
as <hi>Ovid</hi> before us had tried in his Exile.

Maudlin, Tanſy, Sowthiſtles, White Horehound, or rather Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dactyl,

Bezoar-Goats do feed; the Lilly of the Valley, as alſo, which is
rare, Graſs, or rather a kind of Graſs like our Moſs, or ſuch as we
ſee grow among Pavements after a Shower of Rain with us: This
was admired by our Interpreter, as if no Place in the World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled

                  <p>In the middle Way between <hi>Pokutal</hi> and <hi>Bury,</hi> we were threatned

nigher a Dun Colour than a Dark Red, without Beard, nor haired
all from the Head down to the Creſt and Thighs; about the Lips it
had Briſtles like a Cat, and when the Keeper ſtreaked it, it would
make a Noiſe much the ſame as a Cat when ſhe purls: Theſe are
kept to ſet upon Bulls before the Emperor, which they do ſneaking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
coming behind them to leap upon their Quarters, which one of
our right bred <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſtiffs would ſcorn to do; a true Bull dog
being too hard a Match for one of theſe Lions, which has often been
proved at the Court of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to the Commendation of their

                  <p>Hereabouts the Locuſts have for theſe Three Years ſucceſſively

purpoſe: All Waters, in general, participate of the Mixture and
Nature of thoſe Places through which they take their Current,
though all do not alike ſtrike the Senſes, becauſe ſome have a leſſer
Tincture than others; and Heterogeneous Particles confounded, or
confuſed, in a larger Vehicle, are not ſo eaſily perceived by the
Tongue; which proves no more than this, That whatever Water
has a ſingular propriety from the common Water, muſt come under
the denomination of Mineral Water.</p>
                  <p>Which,<note place="margin">Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Common.</note> with <hi>Varenius,</hi> we draw from a threefold Fountain, <hi>viz.</hi>
from Corporeal, Spiritual, and a Mixture of either; thoſe which
run through Subterranean Meanders, in which the Metalline Earths
are not over denſe, they carry with them the Grains of thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
and therewith beget the firſt Corporeal Waters.</p>
                  <p>If the Ores are leſs denſe, as Vitriol, Sulphur, and Salts, which
diſſolve of themſelves in Water, theſe create the ſecond Claſs of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreals,
or Mixed.</p>
                  <p>And thoſe in their paſſage which are impregnated with the Fumes
of theſe Minerals, are, as it were, rectified Spiritual Waters, and
make the moſt refined Order of them all.</p>
                  <p>Out of theſe Three proceed Mineral Waters, which are either
Golden, Silver, Tin, Lead, or Iron, Waters; Waters of common
Salt, Aluminous, Vitriolated, Bituminous, Sulphurious, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial:
Waters of ſeveral Earths, Stones, Lime, Chalk, and
Ochre, Cinnabar, Marble, Alabaſter, and laſt of all, Mercurial
Waters.</p>
                  <p>The differences are to be referred to the individual Species of every
Water,<note place="margin">Their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</note> as far as relates to their Eſſence; but becauſe to inferior
Capacities ſuch do not ſo readily occur, they are made more familiar
by Sower, Bitter, and the like: The Explanation whereof, both as
to their Cauſes and Generation, is the Buſineſs in hand.</p>
                  <p>Sea-Waters, Salt or Bitter (Bitterneſs being only an exalted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Saltneſs) come rather from the Pores through which they
are ſtrained, than from the groſſer Particles remaining after the heat
of the Sun has Boiled off the Flegmy parts: Rain-Waters extracted
by Rarefaction, are again Condenſed, and become Sweet in their
falling: River-Waters vary according to their Colour and Taſte
from the Qualities of thoſe Conduits through which they take their
Courſe, as do Spring-Waters, which have a double Origination;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53433:173"/>
either from the Deep, or from Above; the one from the Ocean, the
other from Snow or Rain; for by an obſcure Conveyance, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Sea iſſues through the Bowels of the Earth, leaving both
Salt and Bitter Taſte behind, and forces it ſelf in nature of a <hi>Syphon</hi>
up to the higheſt Clifts, as is demonſtrated by thoſe Hydraulick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
commonly known among us, ſuppoſing at the ſame time the
Sea to equal the Talleſt Peak the Land can brag of.</p>
                  <p>Sower Waters have for their Progenitors Vitriol and Alum, (not
the Smoke of Sulphur) either of which are imbued with Acidity or
Acerbity, whereas Sulphur enjoys neither; which is found true,
however the Chymical Spirit of Sulphur drawn off, as alſo of Salt,
become ſo ſharp. But to obviate that, If Sowerneſs muſt be beholden
to the Sulphurious Vapours, how comes it to paſs that all Hot Baths
have not that very Taſte? Which both ſufficient Authority and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
prove to have their Entity from theſe Two Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>1. By the Admixture of Sulphurious Effluviums, while the Water
creeps through theſe Mines, for to break out of the Fountains from
which they are ſtrained.</p>
                  <p>2. From Fumes, Vapours, or Exhalations, within the Earth,
where the Brimſtone is Pure or Impure, as from Pit-Coals, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe Waters of <hi>Genoe,</hi> as far as I could gather by Spagyrical
Solutions, have to their Sulphur an Addition both of Antimony and
Nitre, whence ariſe their ſweet Salt, and fore-recited Operations.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe Baths,<note place="margin">The Medical Benefits of their Baths or Hummums.</note> which are rare, there are more commonly
<hi>Balneo's</hi> to be hired at eaſy Rates; of which I ſhall ſay no more than
of the Benefits received by them (not to note the Injunction of their
Law); when Bodies are parched by intolerable Heat, and the Duſt
galls and frets the Skin by Travel, then are they not only cleanſed,
but highly refreſhed by bathing in ſweet Water; ſo that they are
convenient both in Dry and Moiſt Airs; for in Dry, without theſe

Bags of Water on the Top of <hi>Olympus;</hi> and in Moiſt, they are
as neceſſary to waſh Dirt and Sand out of the Pores of their Bodies.</p>
                  <p>As for the Medical Intent, many Diſtempers cauſed by Fulneſs of
Humours, or ill-bred Chyme, are expelled by this Exorciſm; but
the Grand Expectation relating to Venereal Diſeaſes, is baffled and

filled with putrid Humours, whence proceed Malignant Fevers, Gout,

according to the Mind of the great Author of Phyſick,
<hi>Aph. 16. lib.</hi> 5. Which notwithſtanding, as every Nature is diſpoſed,
ſo it is affected with this or that Diſeaſe: For the Fountain of all
Maladies, with their ſeveral kinds, ſpring either from the Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities
of Air or of Diet, ſince we are nouriſhed by both, and can
no longer live than while we breathe and ſuck in Air, than we can
ſubſiſt without Food: Such therefore as the Air is, ſuch are the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and Humours generated thereby; ſuch as the Humours, ſuch
are the ſolid Parts of the Body, and in general the whole Microcoſm.</p>
                  <p>By Repletion therefore of the Brain, the Optick Nerves are debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated
and clouded by the Impurity of the Innate and Adventitious
Air: The beginning of the Nerves being filled with Humidity, not
only the forementioned Sickneſſes, but Ulcerous and Foul Sores, by
the aptneſs of the Air at this Juncture combining with other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
Accidents, make an open Way for their Procreation. Hence
the Maritime Coaſts, from the filthy Exhalations and naſty Vapours
diffuſing themſelves, impreſs a Dyſcraſy, or undue Mixture over the
Maſs of Blood: <hi>To wit;</hi> As if the Sulphurous Saline Particles ſhould
be exalted, a Rankneſs of Temperament follows; by which means
the Spirits are depreſs'd, and the Blood alter'd into a ſickly corroding
Habit, for want of liberal Evacuation through the Emunctuaries,
and ſo are quite degenerated. As we ſee, for inſtance, now daily,

                  <p>To avoid therefore the Stench of the Port, as well as Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication

him, and give him a Staff in his Hand with ſome <hi>Deneiros</hi> for his

wrap us cloſe; for all which, few eſcaped without complaining of a

who had indulged too largely on Raw Fruits.</p>

not a Man among us, nor hardly an Horſe, but ran freely at the

which might have ſome Influence upon us, it being preferred before
all others, as having the Sun and Ocean for its Parents: The River-Water
here is muddy, and is often carried under Ground by Pits,

relates only to us; for the Natives make light of ſuch things as we
call Colds, though they are affected with them this Seaſon, but not
to ſo high a degree as we; for they eat and drink rather the more for
them, and ſlight them at this time of the Year, but towards the
Winter Quarter they are more cautious. I muſt confeſs it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
my Opinion, Colds were not hurtful, ſo long as they keep
within the Bounds of a ſimple Cold, but rather a means to rack off
the Impurities from the Blood, as the Fermentation of Wines is of
the like Advantage to them; but when inſtead of clarifying it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds

In theſe Straits they find Pretences to caſt an Odium on the <hi>Divan</hi> or

at Court, laying to his Charge not only the Miſcarriage of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
but the effeminating and debauching him with Wine and Women,
and enervating him by Witchcraft, (he being neither able to Stand
or Ride); and for Proof of this latter, they had taken from his
Surcoat a Paper wrote in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, full of Magick:
Which whether true or falſe, half a dozen <hi>Jewiſh Levites,</hi> accuſed

a Continuation of their Miſeries, a ſad Cry for Want of Bread
continuing.</p>
                  <p>Although the Emperor eſpouſed this Great Man's Cauſe,<note place="margin">The Steward reſtored to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician hang'd.</note> at once

till he had given full Satisfaction to his Revenge; <hi>viz.</hi> his Chief
Phyſician: He being diſmiſs'd the Court, lived in Repute ſome time
in the City, till the Emperor diſcarded his Chamberlain; when
being informed that this imprudent Phyſician was entertaining at a
Feaſt the Eunuch he had turned out of his Service, ſent a Meſſenger
to call his Phyſician; who ſuppoſing it was to be readmitted, ſpruc'd
himſelf, that he might be the better accepted before the King, and
went on chearfully, till coming under the Palace-Gate he ſaw a Rope

                  <p>Amidſt theſe Diſtractions and Heats, it was no time for our Agent

be as big as Camels; and though they were young, proved ſwift

for what he could get to ſatisfy his Hunger; whilſt an <hi>Hodge</hi> (one
of their Pilgrims to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Tomb) who was at his Devotion on
the moſt conſpicuous place of the <hi>Ser Raw</hi> (they loving to be ſeen
of Men), had placed a Bowl of Buttermilk tempered for his Tooth,
ready by him, to fall to after his Prayers; he bowing his Face to the
Ground, as their Cuſtom is to worſhip, and there lying proſtrate:
The Dog ſcenting the Bowl, mounted the Quadrangle, and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
one Leg on the Neck of the <hi>Hodge,</hi> kept him in that Poſture,
while he had made cleaner Work than the Pilgrim, who for fear
durſt neither ſtir nor cry out, leſt he ſhould provoke ſo terrible a
Monſter to devour him; but ſilently paſſed by both the Affront
(for if a Dog touch them they are <hi>Nigeſs, i. e.</hi> defiled) and the Loſs;
while in the mean time it was occaſion of much Laughter to the
whole <hi>Caravan Ser Raw,</hi> to behold the Man of lofty Thoughts of
his own Purity, thus handled by the Beaſt, and none offering to
ſtep in to his Reſcue, till we had called him off; for which the <hi>Hodge</hi>
thought himſelf obliged to return us Thanks, for delivering him
from ſo great danger.</p>

one of the Robbers (or one apprehended as one of them) that ſo

the Fact Notorious. Some people more than whiſper, as if the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous

                  <p>In this Paſſage the Evenings and Mornings were ſo intenſely Cold,
as to fix Icicles to our Metarrhaes, as they hung under our Horſes
Belly; although from Nine in the Forenoon until Three in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
it was extremely Hot.</p>
                  <p>When we left <hi>Spahaun;</hi> Cotton had juſt broke the Cod, and an
imperfect ſort of Barley, ſown only to ſoil their Cattel, was crept
out of the Hoſe, being as Green as Graſs; but as we drew nearer
<hi>Siras,</hi> all was mowed, and the Vintage being over, they were left
common to the Cattel, who fatten on theſe Shrubs; ſo that what once
tickled the Spleen of a Philoſopher, might here hourly give him
the Diverſion, Thiſtles being their choiceſt Fodder.</p>

till I was certain the <hi>Caphala</hi> was out of the City, when waiting on

the Factory, there being preſent a Number of Chriſtians and others
to attend our Motion out of the City, moſt thought I had received
a Rich Reward, therefore they demanded how I had ſped? I anſwered,
As I had before; at which one that knew the Temper of the Man,

It was very well you came home with your Hat, and that he took

in: In the Fields were Millet, hurtful to Pullen, but Food for the
Poor for Bread; in the Garden, Wall-Flower, and Violets, Garden
Mallows, and Crocus: For all that, at Night the Cold was ſevere;

permitted to eat; for which they plead their being unaccuſtomed to
Labour; which exempts them from an Impoſition they lay on the
more hardy, not touching ſuch heavy Burthens with the leaſt of
their Fingers: Wherefore the poor Mule-men made hard ſhift to get
to <hi>Lhor</hi> the Morning before the Evening the New Moon appeared
on, <hi>viz.</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> when I ſaw the Old Moon go out on the

in of this Dew, ſo they are generated more Fair, or Obſcure; as may
be ſeen in his Book, where he ſpeaks of thoſe Pearls called <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions,</hi>
and of the Shell-fiſh in which they are found, <hi>lib. 9. c.</hi> 28. But this
Opinion of <hi>Pliny</hi> concerning their Conception, is not, by <hi>Anſelmus
Boetius,</hi> thought conſentaneous to Truth: For, ſaith he, I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of theſe Shell-fiſh many <hi>Margarites,</hi> and they are generated
in the Body of the Creature, of the ſame Humour of which the
Shell is formed; which Viſcous Humour is expelled ſometimes (not
always) for the Fabrick of another Shell; for whenever this little
Creature is ill, and hath not ſtrength enough to belch up or expel
this Humour which ſticketh in the Body, it becometh the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or beginning of the Pearls; to which, new Humour being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and aſſimulated into the ſame Nature, by concreting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealing
begets a new Skin or Film for the former Rudiments; the
continual Addition of which Humour generates an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> or Pearl;
even as Stones are generated in the Gall or Bladder of a Man; and
after the ſame manner the <hi>Bezoar</hi> is generated in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Goat.
<hi>Cardanus, lib. 7. de Lapidibus,</hi> ſaith, It is a Fabulous thing that the
Pearl ſhould be generated by the Dew of Heaven, ſeeing the Shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhes
in which they are conceived have their Reſidence in the very
bottom of the Deep. That which is reported of them, That they
are ſoft in the Water, and grow hard, like Coral, as ſoon as they are
taken out, is not true, ſaith <hi>Boetius, p.</hi> 84. For the firſt, not only
common Fame, but common Experience avouches; for the latter, I
know not why it may not be as probable, as for an Egg newly laid, to
have the Shell harden'd as ſoon as dropped into the Air, when before
in the <hi>Ovarium</hi> it participated of a Slippery, Tough, Glewy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
not otherwiſe to be ſuppoſed to come forth, than by endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
the <hi>Foetus.</hi>

be adulterated. There are fictitious Jewels made of double Glaſs,
which being ſet in Gold, Jewellers cannot diſcern from Pearl, except
they take them out: Some will adulterate them with the Powder of
the Shell of the <hi>Margarite,</hi> and others with Chalk covered with
Leafs of Silver, and then anointed with the White of an Egg. Some
adulterate them with the Powder of Pearl mix'd with the White of
an Egg, and dried, and then poliſhed; but theſe will eaſily be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the True, by their Weight and Colour.</p>

of many Rivulets into one Stream, or that they flow from
great Lakes; the former of which every one hinders, while they
draw every Brook to their own Uſe; ſo that inſtead of filling large
Channels, they almoſt drein them quite, which might otherwiſe
merit to be called great Rivers; to wit, that of <hi>Siras</hi> and <hi>Perſepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
which waſhing its Plain, makes a long Journy before it mixes

diverſified in reſpect of the Place, Time, and Perſons; for the Forms
of thoſe of the Citizens, Nobles, and Peaſants, are not all alike: As
thoſe in Sandy and Hot Places are of one Shape, and thoſe in Rocky,
Stony, and Cold Parts of another: So likewiſe the Anniverſary Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in any of theſe, make them fit their Habitations for thoſe
Quarters.</p>
                  <p>The Palaces of the Potentates are built moſtly after this manner:
Towards the Street appears little or no Frontiſpiece, more than the
Porch, which makes a ſquare ſtately Building, arched at top, under
which is a ſtately Balcony, open on every ſide, over the Haſtle,
which compaſſes neat Apartments, and are defended from the Sun's
Heat by large Umbrelloes or Penthouſes, ſtretching themſelves wide
to draw in the cool Air, the embowed parts whereof are fretted, and
the out-parts ſhine with Blue inlaid with Gold: The Caſements, or
Folding-doors rather, ſparkle with Glorious Panes of Glaſs of ſeveral
Colours, and declare the Workmanſhip of the Carvers; as does the
outſide Slates the Skill of the Tilers in Glazing and Painting, as
well as the Marble Facing the Ingenious Deſign of the Surveyor.</p>
                  <p>From the Portal runs on each hand round the Garden a Mud-Wall
very high, though not very thick, which another Wall thwarts juſt
in the middle, from the Porch to the main Building, thereby to part
the Mens Quarters from the Womens; the latter whereof encloſes
the Kitchen-Garden; the other is deſtined for Fragrant Plants, Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Flowers, and outſtretching Trees for Pleaſure, as well as
bearing Fruit for Uſe. The Houſes are ſo contrived, that in the
Summer they are open Banqueting-Houſes, refreſhed with Fountains
as they ſit in <hi>Friſco,</hi> which deſcend thence to all the Quadrangles
by Water-Courſes. Since the greateſt part of this Empire is not far
off the <hi>Northern</hi> Tropick, it is therefore no wonder it ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of Heat, eſpecially in the Summer, at which Seaſon the Sun
ſtrikes the Earth more directly with its Rays; for which cauſe,
amongſt all of them, Aquaducts and Fountains in the very Rooms
below Stairs, are mightily prized, with Water-works playing to cool
the burning Particles of the incenſed Air; and the whole Structure
is conſtituted ſo, that it may receive theſe Refreſhments every way it
is capable: Wherefore they defend their Dwellings from the Sun,
and are conſtantly ſprinkling Water around their Seats from theſe
Currents; and from their Tops have many Breathing-places to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Wind, which are ſo fixed, that whatever Breezes ſtir, they
ſhall ſuck them in, and tranſmit them to all the Rooms of the
Houſe, as they liſt.</p>
                  <p>In Winter, if they be remote from the Sea, they ſhut up their
open Halls and Parlours, and make them cloſe Apartments, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-down
thoſe Umbrelloes that ſhaded them in Summer, to keep
them warm in the cold Winter, till its Severity be paſt, ſpreading all
the Floor with Quilts thick and warm, and kindling Stoves in all
their Bedchambers: Theſe alſo are of a different Model from thoſe
nearer the Sea, They being moſtly flat, Theſe arched: Their Roofs
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53433:188"/>
are made of Wood fetch'd from <hi>India,</hi> with tranſverſe Beams upon
Clay walls, or Stone with untempered Mortar, till they come to
the juſt Altitude of their Houſes, when the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> or Spaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Beam and Beam are filled with Palm-Leafs neatly laid and
painted, which ſerve for Cieling.</p>
                  <p>It is univerſally common to Spherical, Arched, or Plain Buildings, to
lay vaſt Loads of Mud at top; and what is more wonderful, only with
Mud and Clay, they will rear moſt ſpacious Arches, without other
matter of Aſſiſtance; whereupon either againſt Snows or Rains,
ſhould they continue (which they never do long) they would make
but faint Reſiſtance; for being ſoaked thoroughly, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
into their firſt Entity: Whence in great Snows, to defend and
keep their Dwellings ſtanding, they ſhovel it all from the Tops of
their Houſes into the Lanes, and thereby obſtruct the Paſſages of
their moſt Publick Streets, when the Snow has not fallen above
two days, and alſo endanger the Foundations; which the Rich bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſecure by Brick Bottoms, than the Poor, whoſe Fabricks often
totter on ſuch occaſions: However, they have a better Opportunity
againſt Fire, their Manſions affording little combuſtible Subſtance
for that to feed on.</p>

preſuming to exalt them to an unbecoming Height, in regard
of either of their Stations: Their Caſements are latticed, not going
to the Price of Glaſs, which is Foreign, and for that reaſon ſcarce.
Concluding then with theſe Tenements, we are brought to view on
what Baſis their Government ſtands: For the Welfare and Support
of Cities, are the Obſervation of their Laws;

                     <q>

By ſome is is called <hi>Charaſan;</hi> by the Inhabitants, <hi>Airoon;</hi> it lies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

<hi>North,</hi> and Eighty ſix of Longitude <hi>Eaſt;</hi> the Days differ Three
Hours in the Courſe of the Year: Nor are the Seaſons ſo calm and
ſedate, that they ſhould be eſteemed temperate, ſo as not to exceed
in either Extreme, where in Summer they muſt uſe Caves, Vaults,
and Grottoes, and in Winter Stoves and Hot-houſes.</p>
                  <p>The Air is very rare at <hi>Spahaun,</hi> and the Wind drying: The City has
no need of Walls, where ſo many Marble Mountains ſtand as a
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53433:188"/>
Guard, or Bulwark of Defence; it has indeed a Tower, but it is a
Mud one, rather ſerving as an Armory, than to be relied on as a
place of Strength; ſo that I ſhrewdly ſuſpect whether ever this were
the <hi>Hecatompylos</hi> of <hi>Ortellius,</hi> as is related by more than one. The
Circumference of the Body of the City I gueſs may meaſure Seven
Miles; but if the diſperſed Gardens and Seats of the Great Men,
with the Palace Royal be brought into that Computation, we muſt
allow it as many <hi>Pharſangs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Journy to it is difficult in Bands, Troops, or Companies,
by reaſon of the uneven Way encompaſſing every ſide for many
Miles together; therefore to attempt coming to it with an Army
or Warlike Force, muſt not be aſcribed to Prudence of Conduct or
Valour, unleſs there ſhould ariſe another <hi>Alexander</hi> (which muſt
be imputed to his good Fortune, rather than Proweſs or Virtue)
hairbrain'dly reſolute to undergo no Repulſe, tho the Exterprize ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
all human Probability: For it muſt unavoidably fare with him
literally, as it did hyperbolically only with <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Hoſt, who
are reported to have been ſo numerous as to drink whole Rivers dry
as they paſſed; what then would Ciſterns of Rain-water do, or now
and then a ſmall Brook, to quench the Thirſt even of an ordinary
Detachment, not likely to put ſo Populous a City in the leaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation?
But to find Food in ſuch Bye and Deſolate Paths for any
conſiderable Force, would be paſt poſſibility, unleſs at the Expence
of a Miracle. By theſe Bars, whereby the Paſſes are eaſily ſecured

could they have conquered theſe Obſtacles, whereby they would at
the ſame time have carried the Empire too.</p>
                  <p>The ſmall Attendance we carried up to <hi>Spahaun,</hi> was demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
enough of this Truth; for though we fared well, yet it was
tireſome, and few elſe meet with the like Conveniences, they being
aſſured that we would more than reward their readineſs to provide

open to us; deriving its Annual Nutriment from a clear River, which
it beſtows plentifully from its hollow Womb: But that which it

theſe are formed the Thunderbolts of the Almighty <hi>Jove,</hi> whereby
he both makes the whole <hi>Olympus</hi> ſhake, and preſerves the Laws of

things by a Natural Tendency move from the Circumference to the
Centre, ſo from the Confluence of all Nations of the World hither,
it becomes the Chief Empory, as well as an Exemplar of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
although it hath declined much ſince the <hi>Europeans</hi> have
diſcovered the way by Sea to <hi>India:</hi> For long before that it was the
Storehouſe and general Market for <hi>Indian</hi> Wares as well as its own;
and by conſequence, as it was the Staple of the Univerſe, it was the
common Receptacle of all the Money ebbing and flowing from all
Parts: But this <hi>Boſphorus</hi> being ſtopped, from a Sea it became a
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53433:190"/>
Lake, in which Riches do now ſtagnate, not circulate, or at leaſt not
with that Force they did before.</p>
                  <p>However, as long as the buſy Merchant from the uttermoſt Coaſts,
gapes after its Commodities to advance his Pelf, and for his ſake the
Publick Buzzars are kept in better Repair than leſs-frequented Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
it muſt be allowed it is ſo far from a Total Decay of Trade,
that few Cities in the World ſurpaſs it for Wealth, and none come
near it for thoſe ſtately Buildings; which for that reaſon are kept
entire, while others made of Lime and Slate, belonging to private
Perſons, hardly laſt their Founders Lives, for want of timely Care.</p>
                  <p>For the Citizens rather chuſe to dwell in a tottering Houſe,<note place="margin">The Citizens humbled.</note> than
appear laviſh in Coſtly Building or Apparel, for fear their Governors
ſhould ſuſpect they have too much Riches, when they are ſure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be at reſt till they have dived into the bottom of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries;
which Extortion is returned by the King upon their Rulers,
whereby the Emperor's Treaſure grows exuberantly great: Which
is the cauſe the Citizens ſo often lay up their Talents in Napkins,
ſince it is a Crime to expoſe their Wealth by ſpecious or luxurious
Shews, according to the accuſtomed Pride of Wealthieſt Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

                  <p>Whence it proceeds that only Courtiers and Soldiers in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,<note place="margin">Courtiers and Soldiers live great.</note>
who are maintained by Annual Penſions, are permitted to live
gallantly; whoſe regard of the Publick Utility is rarely ſo much
conſidered, as to ſpare any thing from their manner of enjoying
themſelves, either to adorn or benefit the Cities in which they reſide:
On which ground it is, that their beſt Cities ſeldom have ſplendid
Edifices to commend them, from mean or private Hands; though in
the Suburbs of their Capital City <hi>Spahaun,</hi> there are many by the
Rivers ſide, both of the Nobles and the Emperors ſtately Palaces.</p>
                  <p>But what celebrates it moſt, are the covered Buzzars, or Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places,
continued through the whole City; and the Inns of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
occupying them in the time of their Buſineſs; their Baths,
Temples, and Convents, which have Stipends to ſupport them
from being an Eyeſore and Blemiſh in their principal Places; all
which deſerve a particular Deſcription.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I ſhall begin with their Inns,<note place="margin">Their Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans.</note> or <hi>Caravan Ser Raws,</hi>
which are divided into Three Species, both in reſpect of their Site
and Form, as well as Matter, through the whole Empire. Thoſe
near the Sea-ſhore for Seven Days Journey or thereabouts, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
of this Figure; they are reared of unpoliſhed Stones, on an
Area Three Foot high, to keep out the Horſes, and leave an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Space for Servants to lye on, whereon are erected Four Pillars,
which ſupport Four bowed Roofs, ſurrounding an Hemiſpherical
Arch in the middle, where at each ſide over head are large open
Windows (or Doors rather) to receive the Air, and at every Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Square, Forms within a ſeparate Apartment for their Men
of Note, which are in open Cloyſters; and without, Four more,
cloſe, for thoſe that connot endure the Air, or for their Women;
every Quarter has a wide Entrance or open Gate to add to its Airy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
to which Inns are no Stables or ſhady Places for the Beaſts of
Burthen, unleſs there happen to be Trees, which is a great chance in
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53433:190"/>
ſuch Sandy, Wild, and Deſert Places. To the moſt famous of
theſe now and then happens to be an Hoſt provided with Neceſſaries
for Travellers, ſlenderly provided to furniſh them at eaſy Rates with
Cheeſe and Fruit, Bread and Barley, the firſt whereof the Poor
make their Meals on, and their Beaſts on the latter: But they muſt
dreſs both their Victuals and their Beaſts themſelves, for he affords
neither Cook nor any other to the beſt that come, no more than
to the loweſt; offering at no more than to ſell Mans-Meat and Horſe-Meat.</p>

Merchants, together with an hideous Confuſion of People
within, and the Noiſe of Beaſts, Packers, and Servants.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding which, if a Foreign Ambaſſador with a great
Retinue arrive, or any of their Nobles (whom they only reſpect as
Men among them) pitch his Tent, or take up his Quarters with
them, theſe will remove, and proffer him Room, ſeeking Lodgings
on the Outward Lodge, or Advance-Border of the <hi>Caravan Ser Raw</hi>
for themſelves; but then this muſt be eſteemed a great Mark of
their Compliance, and indeed almoſt forced, they uſually ſtomaching
ſuch a Diſturbance with frowning Countenances, and ſometimes open
Revilings.</p>
                  <p>This Form, after Seven Days travelling, is from an huddled Stack of
Buildings expatiated into a large Square in the middle of the Area,
where in the Summer-time both the Cattel and Packs are ſhut in by
Doors lock'd a-nights, and open'd early in the Morn, to keep in the

ſhould be ſtollen: In the heart of this Square is raiſed a place as large

where conſigned, and often becomes ſubject himſelf to Baſtinadoes

the Loftineſs of the Porch within, though that riſes higher into an
aſpiring ſquare Tower, with lightſome Summer-Chambers aloft,
which makes a Magnificent Entry; and thence the Covering of the
Caravan runs on a plain Terras, convenient for the whole Number of
Gueſts to ſpread their Carpets, Matraſſes, Plads, or Beds, for lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Night time.</p>
                  <p>Since the Architecture to theſe in View and Variety (by their
alternate Chambers and Cloyſters,<note place="margin">They may make Forts of their Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans.</note> which by diſtinct Arches keep
their due Order) is no deformed ſight, it yields beſides a double
Utility, for the defence of Strangers againſt both the Injuries of
Heat and Cold: And thoſe of them that are built of Stone or Brick,
have not once only ſtood it out in the nature of ſtrong Forts againſt

Viſion, <hi>Pull off thy ſhooes, for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy
Ground.</hi> As ſoon as they have waſhed themſelves in the Porch, where
always is a Baptiſtery, or Tank for that purpoſe, they pluck off
their upper Garments, eſpecially if they be Cloth of Gold, for Gold
alſo is to them <hi>Nigeſs, i. e.</hi> unclean; wherefore they caſt from them
Gold Rings, or whatever is ſet in Gold, not being ſuffered either to
ſleep or pray with them upon them; but at the ſame time they open
their Silver Phylacteries and Roſaries, wherein in Aggat are engraven
ſome Scraps of their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and uncovering their Heads they enter
their Churches, and fall down on the Ground, and as they recite
their Prayers, often kiſs the ſame, always bowing towards the riſing
and ſetting of the Sun, and agree with the <hi>Indian Moors</hi> in ſaluting
their <hi>Genii,</hi> and then they depart; unleſs on their Sabbath-day,
which is <hi>Friday</hi> every Week, the <hi>Mullah</hi> detain them by a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

on the <hi>South</hi>-ſide they have appropriated a Pulpit raiſed on Steps, if it
may be ſaid to be one without any Desk or Rails, on which he ſits,
not ſtands, it being placed in an Oratory apart.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes they paſs about by little Portals to the Door of the
Temple, ſuch an Oſtle being left open, as we ſee in great Gates of
Noblemens Houſes, that he who is about to go in, muſt firſt take
heed leſt he break his Shins, before he ſtoop to make his Entrance:
This Place carries ſomething ſolemn about it; when it is ſhut up,
the Pulpit receives a ſmall Light through Grates inſtead of Windows.</p>
                  <p>The Colleges in <hi>Spahaun</hi> are moſtly founded and endowed by
Royal Donation,<note place="margin">Colleges.</note> partly by others.</p>
                  <p>There are Twenty or Thirty Fair Ones that have Incomes, and
many more whoſe Mannors are devolved by a tacit Preſcript into
Secular Hands. To every College there is a Preſident over the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
and another over the Fabrick, who lets out the Chambers,
and receives the Rents, diſpoſing them as he pleaſes, and diſplacing
at pleaſure: Every Chamber has One, Two, Three, or more Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
where they ſit and lye; to this the ordinary Door ſtands for
a Window; there are no Forms or Benches, more than an old
Moth-eaten Carpet, not fit for a Gypſy's Mantle, for to uſe, either
for Repoſe or other purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Number of Scholars in each depends upon the Number of
Chambers, and the Conſtancy of the Revenues, there being in
ſome not above Forty, in others from an Hundred to an Hundred
and fifty: He who is elected into theſe, lives ſparingly and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
not eating in common Halls, having no more allowed than
two or three <hi>Gosbeeks</hi> a Day, which is about ſo many <hi>Stivers</hi> or Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
from the Preſident; if theſe are not enough, then he aſſigns
the Tranſcription of ſuch and ſuch Books to his Aid, for which
they are paid. There are alſo three, four, or more Servants in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Salary from the College, which any Student may of Right
command to buy Fruit for their Food, and fetch them other Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries;
who ſometimes, Illiterate as they are, go away with ſome
of the College Revenues, and are reckoned among the Students;
being fitter to ſhooe Horſes, or drive a Wain with <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioteer,

                  <p>Their <hi>Balneos</hi> or Hummums are the moſt ſumptuous,<note place="margin">Hummums, or <hi>Balneos.</hi>
                     </note> which are
in all their Cities, always hot; and it is lawful for every one of both
Sexes, on ſtated times of the Day to bath for a ſmall Price: The
Prepoſitor of each Houſe gives Notice to all Comers by blowing
an Horn, when the Houſes are ready to attend them; of which
there are innumerable deſtined to theſe uſes, each ſtriving to outſhine
the other; inſomuch that no time either of Day or Night paſſes, but
you ſhall hear perpetual Noiſes of Horns to invite you to them; for
no ſooner is the Fire kindled under them, but they let every one
know by thoſe loud Inſtruments.</p>
                  <p>In which Places the Treatment is alike to all; for as before was
ſaid in the Church and Inns, ſo in the Hot-Houſes all things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

Rout, he muſt hire an Houſe for a whole Day; which may be
done, if he pay the uſual Expence and Income of that Day, which
Chriſtians are always obliged to, where they have not <hi>Balneos</hi> of
their own to reſort to; for the <hi>Perſians</hi> preſume too Phariſaically on
theſe Baths, judging thereby all their Offences to be waſhed away;
according to that of <hi>Lactantius, Flagitiis omnibus inquinati veniunt,
&amp; ſemet ſacrificaſſe opinantur, ſi cutem laverint; tanquam libidines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra

come polluted with the heinouſeſt Sins, and think when they have
waſhed they have attoned by a ſufficient Sacrifice; as if any River or
Sea could purify their Luſts included in their Hearts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Houſes are beneath the Earth, only ſome little round Globes
embelliſh'd with Painted Glaſs peep out above the Ground to give
Light, and are well clos'd, leſt the ambient Air ſhould offend by too
forcible a Ventilation through any neglected Creviſe: They are built
with divers diſtinct Cells one from another, in which Men ſit, are
rubbed, and cleanſed: Immediately within the Porch is the greateſt
Cell, or rather a large Room, where they d'off their Cloaths, and
being undreſſed leave their Garments; in the middle of this Place
is a Cyſtern of cold Water coming into it by ſeveral Pipes: All the
other Cells are ſo conveniently framed, that every one may breathe
a different Air as to the degrees of Heat, ſuch as may ſuit with the
divers Temperaments of ſeveral Bodies, ſince every Conſtitution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
not the ſame Bath: For as <hi>Galen</hi> has left it written <hi>in lib.</hi> 7.
<hi>Morb. Med.</hi> Some want an Hot, others a Tepid, and others a Cold
Bath, as Hectical Habits declare.</p>
                  <p>The Pavements are all Marble, on which, the more Hot Water is
thrown, the more it increaſes the Heat, although at the ſame time
the Subterranean Fire be as Hot as it can be: On theſe Marble Floors
they at laſt extend themſelves, when they think they have tarried in
long enough, that the Barbers, whoſe buſineſs it is, ſhould wind
and turn every Limb and Joint of the Body, before, behind, and on
every ſide, with that Dexterity and Slight, that it is admirable to
behold them perform it; whereby they leave no Muſcle, Nerve, or
ſuperficial Joint, either unmov'd, or not rubb'd: Then with a courſe
Hair-cloth and Hot Water they ſcrape off all the Filth and Sweat;
and laſt of all by a Depilatory they take clean away all manner of
Hairs growing either in Secret Parts, or any Emunctuary to cauſe
either naſty Smells, or troubleſome chaſing.</p>
                  <p>When they retire to put on their Cloaths, (this is to be only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of Great Men) there waits them a Collation of Fruit,
Sweetmeats, and variety of Perfumes, as Roſewater, Rackbeet, and
the like, with all befitting Attendants, beſides the uſual Servitors, to
adminiſter either Coho, Tea, Tobacco, or Brandy, if faint. When
they are dreſs'd, they emplaiſter their Feet and Hands with a Red
Paſte, which wonderfully helps ſweaty and moiſt Palms, as alſo
ſtinking Feet.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being premiſed, the Benefits coming from the uſe of
theſe are, when the Body is inflamed and dried by immoderate Heat,
it is finely refreſhed by ſweet Water, and the Pores become moiſten'd;
the farther proſecution of which Advantages having been ſpoken of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:53433:192"/>
before, I refer you thither, and proceed to the other Houſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,

thoſe that are covetous of News, as well as Barterers of Goods;
where not only Fame and common Rumour is promulged, but Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

                  <p>They are modell'd after the Nature of our Theatres, that every

Canes, faſten'd to Chryſtal Bottles, like the Recipients or Bolt-heads
of the Chymiſts, with a narrow Neck, where the Bole or Head of the
Pipe is inſerted, a ſhorter Cane reaching to the bottom, where the
long Pipe meets it, the Veſſel being filled with Water: After this
ſort they are mightily pleaſed; for putting fragrant and delightful
Flowers into the Water, upon every attempt to draw Tobacco, the
Water bubbles, and makes them dance in various Figures, which
both qualifies the Heat of the Smoke, and creates together a pretty
Sight.</p>
                  <p>At Night here are abundance of Lamps lighted, and let down
in Glaſſes from the Concave Part of the Roof, by Wires or Ropes,
hanging in a Circle.</p>
                  <p>The Buzzars having been mentioned before, I ſhall only add,
That however Great all their other Buildings are, yet theſe carry
away the Glory from them all; as much as the Halls of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
of <hi>London</hi> exceed Noblemens Houſes about the City, being the
Work and Buſineſs of Joint-Stocks; and their Shews and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are as Pompous as Princes, however ſparingly they live at
their own Homes: For theſe being the joint Advantage both of the
Emperor and his Subjects, he encourages their forwardneſs in adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe, though he ſuppreſſes all their Extravagancy of Garb, or
Exorbitancy in Building, if it bears not with it the becoming Deſign
of giving him the greateſt Share of Honour in the Foundation.</p>
                  <p>Their Bridges are made either of Brick or Stone, and want neither
for Skill or Ornament in their Contrivance; and are chiefly built for
Oſtentation, or to preſerve their Memories, as their other great
Buildings are: They are of more Uſe to join divided Rocks for Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
than to lay over Rivers; the former of which are more
frequent in the Road to the Port than the other.</p>

Such is the fatal neceſſity of Tyrants, that leaſt can credit thoſe that

is ſomewhat extenuated by exoculating them only at this Court;

For though they claim Nobility of Race, yet they are not of

which thoſe of an Equal Order would oppoſe, as having as

                  <p>The Emperor often rewards theſe with great Offices and high

being ingrafted in their Souls, to conform themſelves to their
Maſter's Wills, that they are always found obſequious; which if
it be not altogether to be attributed to their Virtue, muſt admit of
the Dread the Anger of their Emperor impreſſes (being like the
Roaring of a Lion), which frights the trembling Herds among the

therefore is grounded more on Hierarchy than bare Monarchy. For
as of old the <hi>Perſians</hi> adored the Sun as a Deity, and celebrated his
riſing with Morning Hymns, and were daily employed in Sacred An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems

ſtill eſpouſe the Divine Right as well as Lineage of their Sovereigns:
From which fond Belief, the Potenteſt General at the Head of a

Legions of Soldiers, upon the Arrival of a ſingle <hi>Chuper</hi> (that is,

being one of the King's Creatures, and he pronouncing Death from

an entire Reſignation to their Maſter's Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And what is yet more ungrateful to men of their Jealouſy,<note place="margin">They refuſe the Emperor nothing he commands.</note> (it
being ſo baſe and diſhoneſt, that no Reparation can be made among

by the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs, an Hundred and Fourſcore Days every
Year) to bring their own proper Wives to Court, to remain there
all that time proſtitute to his Luſt; this ſo hated a thing they are ſo

Immortal God.</p>
                  <p>From which piece of Service, no Man that is known to have an
Handſome Woman to his Wife, is exempted; for after his Pimps

Commanded by Captain <hi>Joſeph Wedal,</hi> when <hi>England</hi> was at Wars

with the Spoils before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mariners were ſatisfied; (which

                  <p>Secondly, That <hi>Bunder Abaſſee,</hi> now <hi>Gombroon,</hi> ſhould Yearly

Horſes, of which Number Two might be Mares, Yearly.</p>
                  <p>Provided Firſt, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould keep Two Men of War

                  <p>The Articles being Ratified on either ſide, the Enterpriſe is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken;
though of it ſelf it was too great an Action for one Ship to

and gaining leave to Careen their Ship under their Guns,
whilſt the <hi>Portugals</hi> dreamt nothing leſs, they poured in Men (the
<hi>Perſians</hi> being hid under Deck) at unawares, that they were put
into a Conſternation before they could think of their Defence;
whereby they became Maſters preſently of the Caſtle, ſtrengthned
both by Sea and Land, by this unexpected Attempt Vanquiſhed,
which otherwiſe was Invincible; being poſſeſſed whereof by this
Rape, the reſt of the Iſland ſoon fell proſtrate to the Luſt of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſers;
and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having got their Booty, left the Chriſtians
(Oh Impiety)! to be ſpoiled by the Infidels.</p>
                  <p>Which thing,<note place="margin">Vengeance perſues the Enterpriſers.</note> as it gained us Eſteem among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> was the
utter Ruin of the <hi>Luſitanian</hi> Greatneſs, it ever ſince declining, and
is almoſt at its fatal Cataſtrophe; for immediately upon this, their
Fleet before <hi>Muſchat</hi> is Defeated, and they were driven out of all
their ſtrong Places in the Gulf, ſo that the Loſs was greater than if
they had loſt <hi>Moſambique,</hi> from whence they have their Gold;
becauſe all the Trade of the World centred here, all Merchandize
both going and coming paid them Tribute; that the Wealth of this

(where private Avarice and Pelf is preferred before Virtue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,
and a due Reſpect to the only Supreme Deity) overtakes
thoſe Wretches who were the cauſe of their Overthrow. How it
fell out with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who ſeemed to have the juſter Cauſe, I
cannot tell; but ſome of Thoſe People now alive, who were the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers
of Theſe, are as Miſerable, and it may be more, than
thoſe they made ſo; the Captain's Children having been known to
go anights to the Brew-houſe for Grains for their Subſiſtence, and the
reſt of them who are ſtill ſurviving are the unhappy ſcorn of all that
know them; whereas they thought by this deed to have purchaſed a
laſting Fame, and lived to have enjoyed their Ill-got Goods; which
how it did thrive at home, thoſe from whoſe Information I take this,
have been, in part, Eye-witneſſes; but here I am ſure, at this time
both <hi>Perſians, Arabs,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> fare the better for it, while they
have divided among themſelves what was entirely the <hi>Portugals;</hi>
the <hi>Perſians</hi> in the mean while doing what they pleaſe with us, ſo
that at this preſent, all things conſidered, they allow us little more
than a Name; but even here the truth muſt be confeſſed, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we have no Ships to guard the Gulf; which if done, and the
<hi>Perſians</hi> could be made to ſtand to their firſt Terms, in my Opinion
muſt turn to a good account, and be a thing of greater concern than
can be well managed by leſs than a Royal Company; though as things
now ſtand they have free recourſe to <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> this Sea

And ſince their Pretence reaches no higher than a Superſtitious
Affinity, or Adoption rather, the Throne is ſo far out of danger by
them, that they are the Chief Pillars that ſupport it; they being
allowed to brag both of their being of the Blood of their Emperor

of Children and Subjects.</p>
                  <p>The countenancing of this Sect,<note place="margin">Erected to check the <hi>Siads.</hi>

Argument, more than to put a Check to the growing Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the <hi>Siads,</hi> boaſting their Original from <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf, and
to be more immediately ſprung from his Houſe and Lineage: Theſe
are ſo bold as to infringe the Royal Prerogatives, and to let the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
know, That whenever he girts his Sword about him, he ought
to draw it only in their Defence, and at their Commands; not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotically
to rule according to his own Dictates, but patiently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to their Inſtructions: This Order is uneaſy under Monarchy,
nor are they for any Government where they are not uppermoſt. A
Doctrine unpleaſant to the Abſoluteneſs of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Emperors;
and had not the Sword of the one the prevalency of the others Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it were no ways to be redreſſed; for as the one keeps them in
Awe, ſo the Reverence paid the other on account of their Religion,
makes them preſume to inveigh, and often raiſe Factions againſt their
Princes.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Foreſight of their Auguſt Anceſtry is commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in providing another Church-Militant Tribe to ſuppreſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the Inſolencies of the <hi>Siads;</hi> for out of reſpect to their own
Laws, which are ſtill unalterable, as well as to withhold their Hands
from violating what the People repute as Sacred, they rather ſought by
one Nail to drive out another, than openly to denounce War againſt
them: Wherefore when they find themſelves perplexed with the
ſame Dilemma, they ſeek not to abrogate any former Decree of their
Emperors by a direct Contradiction, but ſtudy to impugn it ſome
other ways: As for Example; In <hi>Shaw Abas</hi> the Great's time, on
the days of their Feaſts and Jubilees, Gladiators were approved and
licenſed; but feeling afterwards the Evils that attended that Liberty,
which was chiefly uſed in their <hi>Hoſſy Goſſy,</hi> any private Grudge being
then openly revenged; it never was forbid, but it paſſed into an
Edict by the following King, That it ſhould be lawful to kill any
found with Naked Swords in that Solemnity. And on theſe ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53433:199"/>
grounds this new Order enjoys not only the Name of <hi>Suffees,</hi>
but the Emperor himſelf will be their Captain, and ſuffers none elſe
to head them, and thence takes on him the ſpecious Name and Title
of <hi>Grand Suffee;</hi> and to perpetuate their Memory, has given it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delibly
to <hi>Spahaun,</hi> for this reaſon joined with the former, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Cap, plaited at top like a Cap of Maintenance; whence on a
Wooden Creſt they fix a little Braſs Ball, tied on with three wreathen
Chains, which they bring down ſtrait to the fore-part of the Bonnet,
whoſe lower Brim is bound about with a White Saſh, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Plume of one Feather is ſet up with the Creſt, much after the
ſame Faſhion the Noble Senators wear in the King's Preſence: Beſides
which they have a Surcoat of Scarlet Cloth, as it were in defiance

that in <hi>Turky,</hi> if any other wear it, he pays dearly for his Folly:
The <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Standard is alſo of that Colour, being called

taken from their Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>Nor are they ſo wholly devoted to compaſſionate others Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

Weapons of War, as well as a fit Badge of their Office.</p>
                  <p>Their preſcribed Number cannot enlarge its ſelf to all of their
Sect; wherefore they are interſperſed among the common People,
ſome following Trades and Husbandry, and others other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
retaining always their Habit, which none of the Vulgar
dare affront or ſtrike, however provoked; but taking off their <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fean</hi>
Cap firſt, and kiſſing it, laying it down reverently, they will not
then be afraid to cuff them, or drub them to purpoſe; being careful

In their Theology, after the Contemplation of One Eternal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
after its Unity and Attributes, which they maintain to be

and ſuch a Treatiſe of the Soul and Paſſions, with the other preciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Intellect, which is no where to be found in Metaphyſicks.
In theſe, as in their other Speculations, they cleave ſo pertinaciouſly

                  <p>They fancy to themſelves a Chimerical Creation of the World by

therefore God framed the firſt Intelligence, and that mediating the

                  <p>They acknowledge Four kinds of Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Material, Formal,

each Pipe is a Window by which they enlighten the World; but
when God is angry at the Inhabitants thereof for their Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he bids an Angel clap to the Window, and turn the Lights
towards Heaven from the Earth; then the Light is taken away from
the unworthy Miſcreants, and an Eclipſe is made; for which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he has left them Forms of Prayers to be uſed by the <hi>Mahometans,</hi>
that God would be pleaſed to avert his Judgments and reſtore Light

that to drive away the ill Influences the Eclipſe Preſaged, they
would ſmite with all their force on ſuch Inſtruments; whereby the
King being perfectly awaked, he lift up both his Hands and his Eyes
in Aſtoniſhment, and admired the Skill of his Aſtrologer, for which
he was well Rewarded. But this is but a Story, however poſitive
they are, ſince it was a Cuſtom all the World over long before.</p>
                  <p>Their Thick-ſcull'd Prophet has ſet another Angel at work for
Earthquakes, who is to hold ſo many Ropes tied to every Quarter of
the Globe; and at God's Command, he is to pull and ſo ſhakes that
part of the Globe; and if a City, Mountain, or Tower, be to be
overturned, then he tuggs harder at the Pulley, till the Rivers dance
and the Valleys are filled with Rubbiſh, and the Water ſwallowed
up in the Precipices. Such Stuff as this he has abundance of; and
the moſt impartial Interpreter of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as the <hi>Mahometans</hi>
themſelves confeſs, can afford no better: But for all that they hold
that it contains profound meanings; for it has ſeveral degrees of
Senſes, the ſecond of which it is hardly poſſible for the greateſt
Doctor to apprehend; wherein are couched Words of ſuch efficacy,
which if they were pronounced by Unpolluted Lips, and whoever
ſhould underſtand them and Pray, might both Raiſe the Dead and
work Miracles; and that of an unqueſtioned truth this Book came
from God, as both the Foecundity of Stile, and admirable Eloquence
doth teſtify. For they are not afraid prophanely to ſay, That God
accommodated his Miſſions to Place, Age, and the exigency of
Times; in the Days of Chriſt there were excellent Phyſicians,
<hi>Irlenus,</hi> i. e. <hi>Galen, Pichagor, Pockate, Afflaton,</hi> (prodigious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilers
of Time!) all theſe Healed Diſeaſes by their Plants and
Herbs; but God to outdo theſe, gave Chriſt Power to Raiſe thoſe
from the Dead who had been Buried; acknowledging withal, that
this Prophet exceeded the degree of meer Man.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> lived, many Magicians and Cunning Men were
entertained by <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> God therefore gave <hi>Moſes</hi> a more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Art, that his Serpent ſhould devour theirs, whereby they were
compelled to own him ſent from God.</p>
                  <p>And now to nick <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when he had the Impudence to ſet
up for a Prophet, Oratory was in its full perfection; wherefore <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi>
by the Miniſtration of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> brought forth the
Chapters of his <hi>Alcoran;</hi> which when he had propoſed to the Wiſeſt
Men of that Age to pronounce but Three or Four thereof, and
they not being able, were forced to confeſs, that That Work muſt
be certainly of God, ſince they knew <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be Illiterate;
which he relates in his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and takes thence an opportunity to
boaſt, undervaluing the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> in the mean while (which
are <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms</hi>) becauſe they know not with what Figures of
Words and Sentences they are Illuminated, nor with what vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
they incite a Devout Soul; that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Interpreter,
could he expreſs the Numbers and Elegancies of Speech contained
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53433:203"/>
in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> would leave off to admire the Nonſenſe of the
<hi>Alcoran,</hi> and look upon the miſtake with deteſtation: Nor would

came into <hi>Arabia,</hi> where the falſe Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> obliged him by his
Friendſhip, and by him learn'd to corrupt the Holy Scriptures, ſo as
to frame a New Religion, which was neither Chriſtian, nor altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Jewiſh, but a Compoſition of both, obliterating what was not
to their purpoſe; whereupon the <hi>Hagareens</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> held <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
not only as their King, but alſo as a Prophet Divinely Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and follow him in all his Abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>He denied the Trinity, affirming it to be ridiculous to believe
Chriſt to be God; wherefore with <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Eumenius,</hi> he allowed
him to be only a Creature, but with <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> an Holy Prophet.
He held with <hi>Cedren,</hi> that it was a thing impoſſible that God ſhould
Beget a Son who never had a Wife.</p>
                  <p>With the <hi>Manachites</hi> he would not have Chriſt Crucified, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>About Eighteen Years ago, it being famous, and no longer ſince,
remains freſh in memory, and is made uſe of to make ſport with the
Aſtrologers: The <hi>Coſſaks</hi> on the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> came thence over the
<hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and made a Deſcent into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and carried off a great
Booty, loading their ſmall Ships without any oppoſition: The
Emperor of <hi>Perſia</hi> incenſed with this Affront, and Depredation made
on his Subjects, arms ſuch a Fleet as he thought ſufficient to correct
their Inſolence with his Soldiers, and bad them take the Sea at the
preciſe time the Aſtrologers ſhould direct, that the Heavens alſo
conſpiring, they ſhould effectually chaſtiſe their Enemies; which
being without doubt carefully ſtudied, ſhould as infallibly come to
paſs to that upon their invading them, not one of them ſhould eſcape:
And for the better obtaining their end, adviſed'em to faſten their Ships
together by ſtrong Chains, that ſo they ſhould keep their Body intire,
leſt the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> ſhould ſet upon any ſingle Veſſel, and at the ſame
time ſhould encloſe the Pirates ſo, that they ſhould by no means
get out of their hands: But the cunning <hi>Coſſacks</hi> being uſed to Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems,
foreſeeing their Deſign, fell upon the firſt Ship with their
Guns, which ſo bored her Sides, that ſhe ſunk, and by her weight
occaſioned the reſt to ſink one after another, ſo that 500 Men, and
Twelve Ships were ſent to the bottom in a well-choſen hour, and
the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> by this Exploit left Maſters of the Sea, and the Borders
thereon liable to their continual Incurſions.</p>

                     <p>A certain <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Woman, born at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (by theſe People

days provoked by the heat of her Luſt, ran from her Husband
with her Paramour; with whom enjoying her beaſtly pleaſure
for ſome time, at length ſhe was carried into a Wood, where ſhe
lived five years without remembring how ſhe came there, or what
befel her in that ſpace; but that time being ſpent, ſhe perceived her
ſelf poſſeſſed with the Deviliſh Spirit of Prophecy, and ſo returned
to the City from whence ſhe had fled a Strumpet, a <hi>Pythoniſſa;</hi>
which being noiſed abroad, and coming to the Grand <hi>Seignior</hi>'s Ears,
he cauſed her to be baniſhed as a Portentous Evil out of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople:</hi>
Who thence wandering here and there, found ſmall encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
till ſhe came to <hi>Suffahaun,</hi> where being arrived, and
the News brought to Court, without imprecation of the Gods to
avert the miſchief, ſhe is the daily diverſion of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch,
and he delights to diſcourſe her often.</p>
                     <p>She calls every one by their proper Name, though never ſeen
before: She gives an account of actions paſt, both ridiculous and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
which though it be the Emperor's ſport to hear, the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
are ſhy of her Company, becauſe of reaping up their old Sins;
and being proved in this point to anſwer expectation, it is granted
that ſhe can Divine future Contingencies; toward which the Genius
of this Nation being diſpoſed, ſhe is eſteemed not only by the King,
but by all People as a Prodigy.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe is ſeized with a Fit of Prophecy, the firſt inſult begins,
(where the Devil firſt entred,) at her Belly, which works ſtrangely;
and at ſuch times there may be heard as it were the noiſe of Three
or Four Kitlins, ſucking and crying when ſhe falls into an Extaſy. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, the Spirit ſeems to anſwer from the bottom of her Belly
to all queſtions propounded; and being in this tranſport, gives this
account of her ſelf: <q>I (ſays ſhe) am a Daemon, whether of an
airy, fiery, or either ſubſtance compounded, I know not; nor of
what Principles I am made, either heavenly or human; but that
we are many and divided into Three Tribes or Orders; in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of which we have learned and wiſe, fooliſh and illiterate among
us; the ſame Religions and Opinions prevail as are upon Earth;
ſome profeſſing Chriſtianity, others Mahometiſm; and again others
are Pagans and Idolaters, and there are ſome few Atheiſts among
us: As for my ſhare, I follow the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sect of <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> and
confeſs my ſelf an Ideot, underſtanding no other Language than
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> (where under a Cloven Foot may be diſcerned conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Foreign Religion,</q> though skilled in no other Language but
her Native; a pretty Wheedle to inſinuate into the <hi>Suffee</hi>'s favour)
<q>if therefore any thing be asked beyond my reach, that needs an
Expoſitor, I betake my ſelf to ſome OEdipus of our Order, who
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53433:207"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>This being a new Doctrine to the <hi>Suffee,</hi> he commanded her to
give him ſome Demonſtration of the truth of what ſhe had told;
and therefore put her upon diſcovering how he might believe the
airy Region to be peopled after this rate; ſhe conſented to convince
him, and ordered all the Nobles attending the Emperor, to retire
with him into one part of the Room, and leave her to work their
Conviction, which ſhe did after this manner:</p>
                     <p>Falling into her uſual Trance, ſhe at that inſtant wrought their
Fancies to be perſuaded of the confuſed Articulation of Multitudes
met as in a Fair, converſing and making a chattering, to the amazing
of them all.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Raphiel</hi> the <hi>Capuchin,</hi> who gave me this account, was ſet
upon by the Emperor to encounter her; but he prudently enough
avoided it, leſt he might be brought into ſome Praemunire about
Diſputes of their Religion, in which he found the crafty Slut would
involve him; but beſides his ſingle Teſtimony of this Affair, here are
many <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Merchants in Town who all declare the ſame as to her
being poſſeſſed, having known her many Years ago at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>

In the matter of their Phyſick, Extracts, or Eſſences of Plants,

Athletick Temper, and conſtant being on Horſeback; as has been
obſerved not only by <hi>Sennertus,</hi> but <hi>Platerus, Fernelius,</hi> and others:
Nor does it ſeldom fall out, from their aptneſs to Venery, and prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

brings on them a white Leproſy, not incommoding the Body with
Illneſs, but diſgracing it with Spots in the Face, Arms, Thighs,

Scald Heads, which makes them keep cloſe ſhav'd.</p>
                     <p>The Plague has not been known among them this Eighty Years

are never looſed more, for they never awake from the Lethargy it
intrances them in: So that they begin gradually, and then arrive
to great Quantities; as from a Grain to half an Ounce, without any
Harm, beſides a frolickſome ſort of Drunkenneſs; by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

great Travels and Hardſhips: But having once begun, they muſt
continue it, or elſe they dye; whereby it becomes ſo neceſſary, that
if they miſ-time themſelves, as in their <hi>Ramzan,</hi> or on a Journey,
they often expire for want of it: Yet thoſe that live at this rate
are always as lean as Skeletons, and ſeldom themſelves; but ſuch is
their love towards it, that they give themſelves up to the ſtudy of
infatuating themſelves by all the ways they can, never ſmoaking a
Pipe without the Leafs of the intoxicating <hi>Bang,</hi> and Flowers of the

her Alimony, and maintain her at his own Charges while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe

may come together without the <hi>Cadi</hi>'s revoking his Interdict for the

cannot come together without abominable Sin; yet ſuch is the
Heat of Luſt in theſe Countries, that the Women cannot abſtain

wherefore, beſides the uſual Exactions, to wit, to load the Rich

could not bring that to account to all, he deviſed a more ſure and

and their very Smocks, and give him an account; nor dare they be
deficient in their part: At the next Aſſembly, where every one ſtrives
to the utmoſt of his Gravity to behave himſelf, he puts on a ſober

at which the Good Man, to whom he directs his Diſcourſe, afflicted

whereat the other inflamed, thinking the Miſcarriage aimed at him,
greedily ſwallows the Bait; and whilſt he endeavours to clear the

he declares, to his great grief, he took his Wife in Adultery with a
Scoundrel, on whom, according to the Law, he inflicted ſudden
Death, as he deſerved; but for the Reſpect born to him, he permitted

extorted this Confeſſion; nor ſhould he have known it, even at this

                  <p>The <hi>Perſians,</hi>

outdo the Senſuality of the hotteſt Beaſts, who never attempt
on other than the Females of their own Species; but theſe, oh
ſhame! covet Boys as much as Women; and to ſpeak an horrid
Truth, are too guilty of Buggering other Creatures; theſe poor

                  <p>So wholly bent on Pleaſures are theſe People,<note place="margin">Addicted to Pleaſures.</note> that to grow
Rich, be ſaluted with Honour, appear magnificently, be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Noble and ſpeciouſly Great, to Play, to Ride on Horſeback with

will venture on any Evil Enterprize, and ſell themſelves to any
Miſchief, well knowing without Money they can arrive at none
of theſe, ſo that they are intent to get it right or wrong: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neither in Court, Camp, or in Judicature, is there catching
any thing without a Golden Hook; no one ſues in <hi>forma pauperis,</hi>
Juſtice is not to be had without a Bribe; and if you Appeal to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
he is deaf, if you knock not at the Door with the Showre that opened
the way to <hi>Danae</hi>'s cloſe Confiners.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, commit any Wickedneſs, caſt but a Golden

Falſities with Truth.</p>

whereupon the Crowd is ſent away no better ſatisfied than it came;
which cauſes ill Blood, a perpetual Reproach to the King, and if they

them, or the innate Fidelity and Paſſive Obedience on the formerly
mentioned grounds, I ſhall not determine: Since at this time they ſeem
to be more provoked by the Supineſs of the Emperor, and the Ill
Management of the Government, and the general out-cry of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile;
but yet, even in this Confuſion I do not perceive a Propenſity
to Rebellion, though they refrain not from open Curſes, eſpecially
the Womenkind, who are ſet on by the Men to bellow their Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,

when they dare not ſpeak their own Grievances, it being not held
manly to fight with a Woman.</p>
                  <p>And hence it comes to paſs that the Law loſes its Authority,<note place="margin">The <hi>Perſian</hi> places Felicity in Proſperity.</note> and
the Subject becomes a Prey to the Avarice and Violence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate;
and while the one grows exorbitantly Rich, the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
miſerably Poor, through an unproportionable diſtribution;
and by theſe Exactions is verified the Proverb, <hi>Homo homini Lupus;</hi>
One Man devours another more cruelly than a Wolf. Nor is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for one that is Poor ever to riſe without a Miracle, there being
no Mean between extreme Poverty and the height of Wealth or
Honour, which makes the Great ones truly Great, while the deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Wretches have no other Sanctuary than to appear under the ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Mighty; and to be reckoned of their Retinue is all the
Favour to be expected in recompenſe for the moſt notorious Injury;
which would augment the Affliction of a Generous Spirit, to follow
on Foot the exalted Extortioner that has undone him, who climbed
over others Ruin to be eminently Rich, and is ſtill upheld by their
Downfall. And this muſt ever be the ſtate of thoſe Kingdoms where
Goodneſs is baniſhed, and Virtue muſt give place to Vice; and this
unavoidably happens where ever the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion takes

we excommunicate Self-Praiſe, <hi>Philautia,</hi> from their Pious Acts, we
might diſcern ſome noble Deeds for which they merit to be extolled,
as the Building of Temples, Publick Hoſpitals for Travellers, (not
for Sick or Wounded) which are the <hi>Caravan Seraws,</hi> Colleges,
Bridges, Fountains, plaining Mountains, and raiſing Vallies, for to
facilitate the Way for long and troubleſome Journies.</p>
                  <p>The Colleges that are not of Royal Foundations, are Adjuncts to
the Prophets Tombs, or Built in Commemoration of ſome Noble
Warrior; to be Buried near which, is the deſire of theſe <hi>Martis A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumni,</hi>
as much as for Catholicks to be Buried in St. <hi>Francis</hi> his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit;
which Sepulchres are, as it were, Triumphant Arches, after
the Figures of their Moſques, in the middle whereof is depoſited the
Corps in a Stone Tomb, like a Cheſt, or Coffin, with Four Golden
or Silver Apples, at each Corner One, commonly covered with a
Purple wrought Pall, with curious Artifice; over head hang Stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Banners, and it is Railed with Iron Rails, in which are
Lamps always Burning; nor do any enter with their Shoes on,
the Floor being Matted, or ſpread with Carpets; and if a <hi>Mullah</hi>
attends, he goes to Prayers for the Quiet of the deceaſed Soul.
They never Bury in the Church, and ſeldom in the City; they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Repreſentations of Lions or Tigers, on Grave-Stones, as has been
ſaid, to expreſs a Man taken away in the prime of his Age; have
Inſcriptions and Places for Incenſe; they always lay the Body <hi>North</hi>

                  <p>To this Magnificence and Civility of Temper, we may add a
Third Virtue, their Fidelity to their Princes.</p>
                  <p>For which Excellencies they ſeem to be beholden to the pureneſs

that the Body ſuffers from the Affections of the Mind;
they ſaying, That they depend not on the Texture of the Body,
but are Conjoined with it; yet Experience teaches, That as often as
the Mind is Troubled, the Spirits are variouſly Agitated, which
move the Blood and put it on a Fret, whereby the Heart is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed,
and many times the whole Frame of the Body is put out of
Order.</p>
                  <p>And therefore is it neceſſary,<note place="margin">Their Diet.</note> that to the excellency of the Air,
and diſpoſition of the Body, a requiſite Diet, as well for Meat as
Drink, ſhould correſpond with both; and indeed Nature ſeems to
have provided them with both, for thoſe they deſire are theſe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cabob</hi> is Roſtmeat on Skewers,<note place="margin">Cabob.</note> cut in little round pieces no bigger
than a Sixpence, and Ginger and Garlick put between each. Thus
ſparingly do they feed on Fleſh alone, ordered after this manner; and
if at any time they intend a Meal thereon, they have it well Boiled,
Baked, Fried, or Stewed, or made into <hi>Pullow;</hi> which is a general
Meſs, as frequent with them as a good ſubſtantial piece of Beef is
with us, and reckoned their ſtanding Diſh; which is made either of
Fleſh, Fiſh, or Fowl, as the <hi>Indian Moors</hi> do; but the beſt is made
of the fatteſt Meat, for which the pondrous Tails of Suet (which
their Sheep bear) is moſt coveted, in regard it ſaves Butter.</p>
                  <p>To make <hi>Pullow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pullow.</note> the Meat is firſt Boiled to Rags, and the Broth or
Liquor being ſtrained, it is left to drain, while they Boil the Rice in the
ſame; which being tender, and the aqueous parts evaporating, the
Juice and Gravy incorporates with the Rice, which is Boiled almoſt
dry; then they put in the Meat again with Spice, and at laſt as
much Butter as is neceſſary, ſo that it becomes not too Greeſy or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive,
either to the Sight or Taſte; and it is then Boiled enough
when it is fit to be made into Gobbets, not ſlabby, but each Corn of
Rice is ſwelled and filled, not burſt into Pulp; and then with <hi>Mango</hi>
or other <hi>Achar,</hi> they will devour whole Handfuls (for Spoons are
not in uſe, unleſs to drink <hi>Sherbet</hi> with, they mixing their Pottage
with dry Rice, and cramming themſelves with their Fingers) and
never Surfeit; always taking this for a Rule, never to Drink till they
are ſatisfied, it cauſing them otherwiſe to ſwell too ſoon; and then
they will Eat as much at a Meal, as an Horſe or Mule can of Barly.</p>
                  <p>Baked Meat they call <hi>Dumpoke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dumpoke.</note> which is dreſſed with ſweet

Gourds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they mingle Rice with.</p>
                  <p>But the bulk of their Diet conſiſts of the Fruits of the Teeming
Earth, ſowre Milk, with ſoft Cheeſe, Grapes and Wheaten Bread.</p>
                  <p>They have a kind of Cooling Muſilage of Seeds, like <hi>Pſyllium;</hi>
in the Maritime parts they uſe Dates inſtead of Bread, or Bread

wherefore Sugar is a good Commodity from <hi>India,</hi> for <hi>Perſia</hi>
produces none of its own; they are not ſuch Confectioners, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
as might be expected from ſo conſtant a deſire and
practice; the chief reaſon I can impute it to is Cuſtom, which in
every thing they are very tenacious of.</p>
                  <p>They mightily covet cool things to the Palat, wherefore they
mix Snow, or diſſolve Ice in their Water, Wine, or Sherbets.</p>
                  <p>Out of Taylets of Willows they make a compound Cool-Water,
very ſweet ſmelling and refreſhing.</p>
                  <p>Sherbets are made of almoſt all Tart pleaſing Fruits as the Juice
of Pomegranets, Lemmons, Citrons, Oranges, Prunella's, which
are to be bought in the Markets. Thus by Diet, as well as Air,
they procure not only a firmneſs of Conſtitution, but Properneſs
and Tallneſs of Body, for none excel them either for Beauty or
Stature.</p>
                  <p>But before we part with this Subject, ſince they are not ſo ſtarch'd
and preciſely bent as the more rigorous <hi>Mahometans,</hi> we may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with their conſtant courſe of Eating, and lie down with
them at Meals, and receive a good Welcome.</p>
                  <p>Their Breakfaſt is begun with Melons, Cucumbers, Gourds,
Grapes, or other Fruits, as Peaches, Apricots, Cherries, or the
like, with ſoft Cheeſe or Butter-Milk; which is about Ten in the
Morning, from which time they abſtain from all manner of Food
(I mean when they obſerve their ſet Meals till near Sun-ſet) when
they feed heartily on Fleſh, or any other hot Meats, and enlarge
ſometimes till Midnight.</p>
                  <p>They obſerve the ſame uſage for going to Stool as the other
<hi>Eaſterns,</hi> waſhing away the Filth with the Left hand, for no other
cauſe than that they feed themſelves with the Right.</p>
                  <p>They ſit down to make Water, but whether that way empties
the Bladder better I leave to conjecture; though their continual ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
within doors with their Legs up to their Bellies helps digeſtion,
is a thing beyond diſpute.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Perſians</hi> never Spit,<note place="margin">The <hi>Perſians</hi> Spit as much as other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> I cannot allow to be true, ſince

that I find them to indulge both; nor are they aſhamed to Carouſe
or Eat luſtily, but on the contrary Gormandize to exceſs; there is
therefore nothing but the Thinneſs of the Air, expreſſing their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
Humours can beſpeak this Virtue; nor indeed do I find them

Account of Weight and Meaſure after their own form.</p>
                  <p>All things in <hi>Perſia</hi> are put into Balance, but Silk woven and

               <p>MY laſt I had thought to have preſented you with my own

farther Trouble.</p>
               <p>Forty Courſe <hi>Northward</hi> of <hi>Surat</hi> lies <hi>Broach;</hi> it therefore being
eſteemed in relation to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as a Branch of this Factory, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any one of our Merchants being ill, they can eaſily and ſuddenly
ſend a Meſſenger for Aſſiſtance; which gave me opportunity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that City, ſoon after I had returned with the Preſident to <hi>Surat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Way thither is twofold, either by Sea or Land; the firſt,
from <hi>Swally-hole,</hi>

Arm of the Sea, to <hi>Broach</hi> River's Mouth, into which the River
empties its ſelf: The latter is meaſured over a ſpacious Plain, and is
travelled either by Coach or on Horſeback, both which I had for my
Conveyance, together with the Attendance of a good Guard of the
Company's <hi>Peons,</hi> becauſe of frequent Robberies hereabouts. Going
out by <hi>Broach</hi>-Gate, we fell into a notable beaten Way;
<q>Hoc iter manifeſta rotae veſtigia cernes.</q>
Contrary to whatever we found in any Place of <hi>Perſia,</hi>

where are neither Carts, Coaches, or Wains: There we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

are peſter'd with Caphalaes of Oxen, Camels, and Bufolaes, with

Thickets:<note place="margin">Letter VI.</note> There they journey at all Seaſons, ſecure from Weather
or Aſſaults; here they muſt obſerve the ſet times, and move with a
good Force, both to defend them from their own Armies, and the
Inſults of Outlaws: Here are no Caravans or Inns to ſhut them
in a-nights, for then is their time of travelling; and when they
reſt, if they have no Tents, they muſt ſhelter themſelves under
ſhady Trees, or ſometimes great Tombs in the Highways, unleſs
they happen on a <hi>Chowkre, i. e.</hi> a Shed, where the Cuſtomer keeps a
Watch to take Cuſtom: Yet good Rivers are more often found here
than there; and where they are deficient, they want not great Tanks
or Ponds of Rain-Water moſtly uncover'd and open to the Heavens,
or elſe deep Wells many Fathom under Ground, with ſtately Stone
Stairs, Cool Apartments, and Grottoes, whence Oxen (as has been
ſaid) draw Water, with huge Leathern Buckets or Pots around a
Wheel, to water their Gardens: But one thing you are more ſure of
here than there, and that is, Proviſions of all ſorts, in almoſt every
Village, which ſtand thick hereabouts.</p>
               <p>The Coaches (unleſs thoſe called the Preſident's) and Carts are
much alike,<note place="margin">Their Chariots for travelling.</note> the laſt being only ſtronger built with main Timber for
ſtrength. But it being no unpleaſant ſpectacle to ſee one of theſe
Chariots equipped, I cannot forbear giving it you; though I am
ſenſible it cannot be ſo well expreſs'd in writing, as the Sight is now
comically repreſented unto me: Two large Milk-white Oxen are
putting in to draw it, with circling Horns as black as a Coal, each
Point tipped with Braſs, from whence come Braſs Chains acroſs to
the Headſtall, which is all of Scarlet, and a Scarlet Collar to each,
of Braſs Bells, about their Necks, their flapping Ears ſnipped with
Art, and from their Noſtrils Bridles covered with Scarlet: The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
it ſelf is not ſwinging like ours, but faſten'd to the main Axle
by neat Arches, which ſupport a Fourſquare Seat, which is inlaid
with Ivory, or enriched as they pleaſe; at every Corner are turn'd
Pillars, which make (by twiſted Silk or Cotton Cords) the Sides,
and ſupport the Roof, covered with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scarlet Cloth, and lin'd
with Silk, with Party-colour'd Borders; in theſe they ſpread Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
and lay Bolſters to ride croſs-legg'd, ſometimes three or four
in one: It is born on two Wheels only, ſuch little ones as our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheels
are, and pinn'd on with a Wooden Arch, which ſerves to
mount them: The Charioteer rides afore, a-ſtraddle on the Beam
that makes the Yoke for the Oxen, which is covered with Scarlet,
and finely carved underneath; he carries a Goad inſtead of a Whip:
In Winter (when they rarely ſtir) they have a <hi>Mumjuma,</hi> or Wax-Cloth
to throw over it. Thoſe for Journeying are ſomething ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than thoſe for the Merchants to ride about the City, or to take
the Air on; which with their nimble Oxen they will, when they
meet in the Fields, run Races on, and contend for the Garland as
much as for an Olympick Prize; which is a Diverſion, <hi>To ſee a Cow
gallop,</hi> as we ſay in ſcorn; but theſe not only pluck up their Heels
apace, but are taught to amble, they often riding on them.</p>
               <p>Four-wheel'd Coaches, and to ſit with the Legs hanging down,
here are none, unleſs ſome few the <hi>Europe</hi> Merchants have, covered
with Scarlet, and ill hung, being much like thoſe ſold at <hi>London</hi> to

pleaſe little Children with, only larger, and lin'd with Velvet; they
having no Horſes managed for the Coach, or any skill'd to drive
them, ſo that theſe alſo are drawn by Oxen.</p>
               <p>Setting out about Sun riſe,<note place="margin">Bereaw.</note> we paſſed by pleaſant Incloſures ſpread
far from the City, and flouriſhing Fields of Corn, and Plantations of
Tobacco; we came Three Courſe, and then ferried over the River to
<hi>Bereaw,</hi> a Village on the Bank of the other ſide; and at <hi>Perſaw,</hi> two
Courſe more, we broke our Faſt; when it growing hot, we went
but a Courſe and a half over another ſmall River, before we baited
under a Grove of Palms, or Toddy-Trees.</p>
               <p>When the Crows came hither to rooſt (which they did in great
Flocks) we departed,<note place="margin">Uncliſeer.</note> and at Midnight arrived at <hi>Vncliſeer,</hi> the
moſt <hi>Northern</hi> Extent of the Province of <hi>Guzerat</hi> (after the old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count)
where Cuſtom is exacted, a Bar of Thorns being ſtuck into an
high Gate, oppoſing ſuch as are to pay at each end of the Town.
Here we ſlept at our Broker's Houſe, and at Sun-riſe proceeded over
delicate Medows to <hi>Broach</hi>-River, where round about it is all Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign;
betwixt where, we met more than Five hundred Oxen laden
with Salt for the Inland Countries; and betwixt Nine and Ten paſſed
<hi>Broach</hi> River in a Boat; which is a broad, ſwift, and deep River,
but choaked up with drifts of Sand, by reaſon of Rains forced into
the very Channel, ſo that good Pilots are required, to ſteer clear of
them; by whoſe directions good luſty Veſſels are brought up to the
City-Walls, where they are laden with Salt and Corn, to be carried
to thoſe Parts that are not ſo well furniſhed; here being excellent
Wheat and good Cottons, of the Growth of this Country.</p>

<q>
                     <hi>Sahab, (i. e.</hi>) Sir, why will you do more than the Creator ever
meant? You ſee hardly two Faces bear exactly the ſame Features:
Look farther into the World, and behold the variety of Creatures!
God has made Elephants, Tygres, Horſes, Camels, Sheep, and Oxen,
of different Figures, and Man of a more exalted Compoſure than
the reſt; whereas had the All-wiſe Diſpoſer of Things thought it
convenient, he might have reſted contented in one only Form;
but every one of theſe in their ſeveral Species glorifies their Maker:
And ſo it has pleaſed God to permit Variety of Religions, by which
Men worſhip and call upon him; nor can they go on in any one
againſt his Will, to which whatever is contrary cannot continue;
and till he make Men to be of one mind, in vain does any go about
to compel what he has ingrafted in their hearts.</q> This rational
Diſcourſe kept the <hi>Brachmin</hi> in his Office, but could not quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
his conceived Prejudice againſt their Superſtitions.</p>
               <p>Which he made appear, by giving Order to demoliſh all the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

did unadviſedly dare, when ſhe was impotent, to maintain the
Challenge; or, which is worſe, ſhe fooliſhly applied her ſell to the
