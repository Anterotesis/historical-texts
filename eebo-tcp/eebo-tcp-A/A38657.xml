            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He two Houses of Parliament have received Information, That because the Committee at <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> caused thirteen Irish Rebels taken in Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity against the Parliament to suffer death, according to an Ordinance of Parliament herewith sent; therefore by your expresse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thirteen English Protestants, who had Quarter given them by your Officers that took them Prisoners, were notwithstanding murthered upon coole blood; and that you have resolved to proceed in the same manner for the future; A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Resolution so strange, that the truth thereof might justly be suspected, were it not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Letters from that Committee of the 24. of <hi>March</hi> last, to the Speaker of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and by a letter of the 23. of <hi>March</hi> sent to the same Committee by your direction, and subscribed by one <hi>Ralph Goodwin</hi> your Secretary (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) which doth own and avow the fact. And therefore the two Houses of Parliament being deeply affected with such cruell Massacres com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44174:3"/>
upon their Protestant Bretheren, whose lives they value as their own, have commanded me to acquaint your Highnesse, That it is evident by undoubted proof, that the Rebels of <hi>Ireland</hi> (what ever they pretended to some on this side the Sea) did really intend by that odious Rebellion, to wrest that Kingdom, for ever, from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> to the utter deshereson of the King, and His Posterity, and to extirpate the English Nation, and Protestant Religion. And for that purpose have sollicited, by their Agents, the bringing over of powerfull Aids from Forraign parts, to assist them in this their intended Conquest; and have set up the Spanish Colours publiquely, both at <hi>Wexford</hi> and <hi>Galloway;</hi> have caused their Captains, Officers, and others, to make Oath before their ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Clergy, That they shall not suffer any English, or Protestant to live in that Kingdom, That they prosecuted this horrid designe by murthering, hanging, drowning, burning alive, and sterving, within few Moneths in one Province, one hundred fifty four thousand of harmlesse Brittish Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, Men, Women, and Children, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Age, or Sex, without any provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given, but living securely by them, in a full and setled Peace. That the King first by Proclamation attested by His own Royall Signiture and privie Signet, hath proclaimed them Traytors, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44174:3"/>
and since that time, both King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by four severall Acts of Parliament, have declared and stiled them in the same manner. And further, His Majesty, by Act of Parliament, hath consented, That all Pardons granted to them, or any of them before attainder, shall be void. Now that such bloody barbarous Miscreants, so odious both to God and Men, so obnoxious to Law and Justice (even by the judgement of both sides) coming out of <hi>Ireland</hi> (where they neither did give nor receive Quarter) to burn and lay waste this Kingdom, as they have done that, should after all this be admitted to receive Quarter here, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently be made equall in Exchange with the English Nation, and Protestants: The Lords and Commons of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> cannot with Religion, Honour, or Justice, in any sort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto it: And have commanded me to let your Highnesse, and all other Commanders on that side know, That if hereafter, upon executing the Irish Rebels, in pursuance of that just Ordinance, any unjust pretext shall be made, to murther, in coole blood, any Officer, Souldier, or Seaman in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Parliament, That the two Houses have resolved, and do hereby declare, That for every Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, Souldier, or Seaman so causelesly massacred, they shall, and must (though with deep sorrow and reluctancy) cause so many of the Prisoners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44174:4"/>
in their power to be put to death in the same manner. And therefore do earnestly desire your Highnesse, and all other your inferiour Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, to forbear by such prodigious Cruelty, to embase the value of the English Nation, which they are confident will be recented with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even by those English Protestants, who are for the present deceived into Arms against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, and the Parliament of <hi>England:</hi> To whom they shall be ready to allow Quarter, and equall exchange as before, and for whom they daily pray, That Almighty God would open their eyes, and reduce them into the right way. Sir, this being all I have in command, I take my leave, and remain</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Received your Lordships Letter of the 4. of this Moneth on the 11. and cannot but wonder, that it should seem strange to the two Houses, that I should cause those Prisoners which were taken in Arms against His Majesty to be used in the same manner, and by the same measure, as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties good Subjects taken Prisoners in the Act of their duty, are used by those that take them. Those Souldiers of mine, which were barbarously murthered, in cold blood, after Quarter given to them, at <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> were those who during the time they were in <hi>Ireland</hi> served His Majesty stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, constantly, and faithfully against the Rebels of that Kingdom, and after the Cessation there, were by His Majesties Command transported to serve him in this, where they honestly performed the duty of Souldiers; and therefore I were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Command I hold under His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44174:5"/>
if upon so high a provocation, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of an Act of injustice, as the putting those poor honest men to death, I had not let the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of that Massacre know, that their own men must pay the price of such Acts of Inhumanity, and be used as they use their Brethren: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I caused the like number (to whom Quarter was no otherwise given then to the former) to be put to death in the same manner as had been done at <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi> How the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> began, and with what circumstances of blood and cruelty it hath been carryed on, (the odiousnesse whereof, and of all other Rebellions is apparent, and all good men must abhorre) is not applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this Argument; (I wish the temper of this Kingdom had been, or yet were such as might be applyed to the composure of that) Your Lordship hath in that Army many Souldiers, who served His Majesty in that Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet to those Souldiers when taken Prisoners, Quarter is given, and observed on this side, the like must be expected from you; And if it should be otherwise, and that Quarter should be denyed to all those who have been Proclaimed Traytors and Rebels, or who by Act of Parliament are such, this War will be much more mercilesse and bloody then it hath been, or then any good man, or true Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman can desire to see it: I am sure such rigour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44174:6"/>
shall be prevented by all the interest and power I have. Neither can that threat and menace in your Lordships Letter, of the resolution to use such Prisoners as shall be taken of His Majesties Army for the future, make any other impression in me, then of grief and sadnesse of heart to see such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice and Inhumanity, a proceeding contrary to the Laws of Nature and Nations, contrary to the Rules and Customs of Warre in any part of the Christian World, so deliberately and solemnly resolved, declared, and published. If there should be an Ordinanc<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> made that there should be no Quarter given to any Souldiers under my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and an expectation that those under yours should receive Quarter, would your Lordship ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I submit to such an Ordinance, This is the case. I have taken Prisoners of those who have taken Arms against His Majesty of all Nations, English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Walloons, of all Religions &amp; Oppinions that are avowed by Christians, and have always allowed them Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and equall Exchange, (how unequall soever the quarrell &amp; contention is, &amp; what judgement soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Law hath determined upon such Persons) and shall do so still, hoping that Almighty God will open the eyes of those who have been strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived into Arms against, and to the scandall and destruction of the Protestant Religion, (in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44174:6"/>
which all men know I have bin born, &amp; for which they have reason enough to believe I will dye) and the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> assembled by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Command, and of which His Majesty is the head, and will recover and reduce those, who out of ambition or malice have made those paths, in which the other have trod, to their Piety towards their Maker, and their Allegiance towards their Soveraign: But if the contrary course shall be held, and any Prisoners under my Command shall be taken, executed, and murthered in cold blood, under what senselesse and unjust pretence soever, for every Officer and Souldier so causelesly and barbarously murthered, I will cause so many of the Prisoners remaining in my Power to be put to death in the same manner, and I doubt not but the blood of those miserable men, who shall so suffer by my Order, as well as of those who shall be butcher'd by that Ordinance your Lordship mentions, shall be required at their hands, who by their cruell examples impose a necessity upon other men to observe the Rules they lay down. And I cannot but expresse a great sense to your Lordship, that since His Majesties gracious offers and importunity for Peace will not be hearkned unto, by these prodigious resolutions expressed in your Lordships Letter, the Warre is like to be so managed, that the English Nation is in danger
