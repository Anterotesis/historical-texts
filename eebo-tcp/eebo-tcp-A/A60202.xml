            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A DISCOVRSE Concerning thoſe that are born DEAF and DUMB, And of their KNOWLEDGE.</head>
            <p n="1">1. SUch is the calamity of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in this ſtate of miſery, that they are invaded on all ſides not only when they are born, by a vaſt army of Diſeaſes, but are alſo troubled with many diſtempers whilſt the Womb is their Lodging; there we often meet with the precur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory meſſengers of Death even in the very beginning of Life; and whilſt the formative faculty is framing this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin of our immortal Souls, ſome deformity, ſome irregularity in the ſtructure, or other preternatural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29642:4"/>
obſtructing the exerciſe of the parts immediately intermixeth it ſelf with our birth. Which enormity of the parts, or conſtitution repugnant to the Lawes of Nature, prejudicing the operations, and contracted at our Birth, ſome have been ſo ſcrupulous as to think that it ought not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of a Diſeaſe, but of a Defect, reſerving the name of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe for the defects of that which was once perfect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as this kind of defect is found to be in many members of man's body; ſo it moſt frequently happens to the ſenſe of Hearing: Which was <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Obſervation long ago, who therefore in the firſt of his Problems, Sect. 11. moves this very queſtion; Why the Hearing, of all Senſes ſhould be moſt prejudiced from our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity? And ſubmits it to Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether this may not be the reaſon or cauſe of it, becauſe the Hearing and Voice ſeem to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the ſame principle: For
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29642:4"/>
Speech (ſaith he) which is a kind of Voice, may eaſily be depraved, and not without great difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to its perfection; a ſign where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that we continue mute for ſome time after we are born (for in our Infancy we cannot ſpeak at all) then at length we begin to ſtammer; ſince therefore Speech may be eaſily perverted, and that the principle of Hearing and Speaking is the ſame (for, ſaith he, 'tis the Voice that is the <hi>primordium</hi> of Hearing) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows conſequently, that, that Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of all the Senſes is ſooneſt corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it were <hi>per accidens,</hi> not <hi>per ſe.</hi> We may (ſaith he) lay this down as au Argument taken even from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, that the principle of Speech may be eaſily deſtroyed; for no other Creature can ſpeak; but Man ſolely is endued with this facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet he (as is premention'd) is a long while, before he begins to ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We will propoſe to our ſelves
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29642:5"/>
three things to be throughly weigh'd in reference to this conſideration of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle.</hi> Firſt, the reaſon it ſelf, by which he maintains, that the Senſe of Hearing may be eaſily injured from the very Birth above all the reſt of the Senſes; becauſe, the principle of Speaking or of articulate ſpeech may be eaſily prejudiced, the principle of Hearing being the ſame; and therefore Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be injured from the Birth not <hi>per ſe,</hi> but as it were <hi>per accidens. viz:</hi> by reaſon the common principle of Speech and Hearing may be hurt. Secondly, we will take into our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that which follows by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from that very reaſon; to wit, that the Hearing is never dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified from the Birth, unleſſe Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the articulate enunciation of the Voice be ſo likewiſe: becauſe there is a certain common principle belonging to the Speech, as well as Hearing, which being injured, it neceſſarily follows that both of them muſt be prejudiced. This conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29642:5"/>
was ſo certain in the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that in his fourth Book of the Hiſtory of <hi>Animals, chap.</hi> 9. he ingeniouſly pronounceth, That they who are born Deaf, are alſo Dumb; and for that reaſon they may make uſe of a Voice, but not of Speech. Thirdly, we will ſubjoyn and inquire into their Underſtanding that are born Deaf, as alſo the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Knowledge. Fourthly and laſtly, we will Contemplate a little upon the reaſon, and diſcourſe of brute Animals.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:29642:6"/>
               <head>SECTION I. Why is Hearing, of all Senſes ſooneſt prejudiced.</head>
               <p n="4">4. AS to the firſt, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> layes down a certain common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Hearing and Speech: But doth not ſufficiently declare what, or what kind of thing that is: Indeed he affirms that Voice is the principle of Hearing, as well as of Speaking, and withal ſaith, that the Hearing and Speaking ſeem to proceed from one and the ſame Principle. And truely the Voice is the material prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Speech, as far as the articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſpeech is framed by the Voice; as if the ſame Voice were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple by which the Hearing is ſtirred
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29642:6"/>
up to the act, or the Hearing had an actual being by means of the Voice, as <hi>Peter Apponenſis</hi> explains the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But this principle will not effect our Deſign, for this queſtion will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unſolv'd, why, where there is a Voice in Deaf men, yet there is no Hearing? and where thoſe that are mute can frame a Voice? or brute Animals themſelves, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak by virtue of that common Principle? And wherefore ſince In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants can hear, ſhould they not alſo be able to ſpeak by the aſſiſtance of that common Principle? For the particular cauſe, either of the obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Hearing, or impediment or depravation of Speaking, is on either hand to be ſought in the organs: the irregularity whereof, the vitiated conformation, or ſolution of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuum, or the convenient influx of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal ſpirits being impeded by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the organ: obſtructs the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. But we will ſee in our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29642:7"/>
Diſcourſe, whether there may not probably be ſome other principle found out, that depends upon the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conjunction of the nerves.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the reaſon why New-born Babes can hear, but not preſently ſpeak, or pronounce articulate words, is, becauſe there is more required to the framing of ſpeech, or ſpeaking, than to the reception of a ſound, or hearing. For, the Hearing is meerly paſſive, and the Sound arriving at the organ of Hearing (which is the very auditory Nerve, expanded to the internal parts of the windings of the <hi>Auditorium;</hi> preſuppoſſing a convenient diſpoſition of the outward, as well as inward parts of the Ear) a Sound is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately repreſented: but 'tis not the ſame when a Voice is uttered, the Speech is not immediately framed, or Diſcourſe raiſed, nor doth it meerly conſiſt in paſſion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Brute Animals that have Lungs and the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> are able to utter a Voice, otherwiſe than thoſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29642:7"/>
other Creatures, that onely make a Sound or noiſe; but yet they cannot therefore ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dolphin,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the 4<hi>th.</hi> Book of <hi>the Hiſtory of Animals c.</hi> 9. hath Lung and the Arterie, and therefore can utter ſomewhat of a Voice, but yet hath not a free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble Tongue, nor Lips by which it might frame any articulate voice; therefore it only makes a noiſe and muttering.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But thoſe that have Lips and a greater liberty of the Tongue, ſo as to be able to frame ſome one articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Word (as Sheep do the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Oxen and Cows <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.) yet they cannot frame their Voice to ſeveral articulate words; for all Brutes want that aptitude of the organs, by which articulate words are made and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; though there are ſome brute Animals that do imitate the words and voice of Man: Of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But Infants and Children, though
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29642:8"/>
they have that aptitude of organs naturally, by which an articulate Voice may be pronounced, yet the uſe of thoſe organs is not then made ſo familiar to them, as truely to frame words: for there muſt be exerciſe, and from thence a habit contracted to ſpeak eaſily and readily; juſt as when a man in time hath gained a habit, he ſweetly playes upon a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtrument</p>
               <p n="10">10. Beſides, the organs of Infants are then but infirm, and by degrees arrive to perfection. when Nature, or the innate heat by little and little conſumes the ſuperfluous moiſture. And ſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his laſt forequoted place is in the right, where he ſaith, that as Children cannot rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Limbs, ſo their firſt impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and imperfection appears in the Tongue, and 'tis long before they are freed from it; which is the reaſon that for the moſt part they ſtammer, and ſpeak with difficulty. And hence it is that Infants cannot properly be ſaid
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29642:8"/>
to be mute, becauſe there is no priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in a ſubject that is capable of the habit, yet they may properly be ſaid to be born Dumb, whoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans are ſo diſpos'd from their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, as that they have an ineptitude to ſpeech when grown in years.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But this property of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, as the Tongue, Palate, Lips, Teeth and Throat, is only beſtowed on Man to the end that he may get a habit of ſpeaking any thing. Though herein alſo is great variety by reaſon of the Countreys and Kingdoms, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that all men have not a ready pronunciation of all Letters in uſe with other Nations: Thus the gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Letters are appropriated to the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> people; and among them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, though no guttural letter cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Dad</hi> (which is pronounced like <hi>ddſh)</hi> is ſo peculiar to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that they can diſtinguiſh any forein Nation from their own, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation thereof; though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them never ſo long, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29642:9"/>
the <hi>Arabians</hi> are meant by thoſe that pronounce this Letter exactly, as when they ſay that <hi>Mahumed</hi> was the moſt Eloquent of all that pronounce the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Dad,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Arabians.</hi> The ſame is every where obvious in the <hi>European</hi> Tongues: for, it is a matter of difficulty for the <hi>French</hi> to pronounce the <hi>German G,</hi> which is pronounced like the pointed <hi>Kef</hi> of the <hi>Perſians</hi> or <hi>Turks;</hi> hence it is that they cannot without difficuty pronounce the <hi>German</hi> monoſyllable <hi>Tang:</hi> and ſo in the reft.</p>
               <p n="12">12. As to the reaſon or cauſe why the Hearing of all the Senſes is ſooneſt prejudic'd from the Birth, that cannot by any means be referred to any common principle of Hearing and Speaking; becauſe ſuch a principle cannot be judged a ſufficient principle of Hearing only, or it conferrs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes to the hearing then <hi>objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve;</hi> in regard that at leaſt it cannot poſſibly fall under the notion of the efficient cauſe, by which there is any
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29642:9"/>
perception of the Voice; therefore there muſt be ſome other reaſon or cauſe found out of the thing in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if we hold it ſimply true, that the Hearing is ſooneſt injured from the Nativity.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But the genuine reaſon of the thing muſt be found in the winding and truely labyrinthean ſtructure of the inward part of the Ear, which may be ſoon perverted or obſtructed; into which the more tender Nerve hath a <hi>maeandrous</hi> paſſage, which alſo is ſoon affected with the ſmalleſt thing and from the filth of thoſe humors which deſcend thither partly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily proceeding from the moiſture of the Brain.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Beſides the drum of the Ear may it ſelf be more groſſe from the Birth, than ordinary, or be overſpread with the ſinews of the Brain, or ſome other groſſe humour; or there may be ſome thick membrane that may cover the auditory <hi>maeanders;</hi> but they, to whom this happens, are onely trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29642:10"/>
with thickneſs of hearing, and do as it were receive the ſound by the Mouth, the reaſon whereof ſhall be given in our following Diſcourſe. And ſometimes there may be ſome peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar defect in the ſtructure of the Ear, extending it ſelf to the Jaws and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat of the Mouth, which is the reaſon that thoſe that are Deaf uſe to ſpeak thorough the noſe, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms in his ſecond and fourth <hi>Problem ſ.</hi> 11.</p>

               <head>SECT. II. Whether thoſe that are Born Deaf, are Dumb alſo?</head>
               <p>NOw we come to the examination of the ſecond point, which ſeems to be the conſequence of the former; and which is confirmed by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the 4. Book <hi>de Hiſt. Animal. c.</hi> 9. <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe that are born Deaf are alſo Dumb. And as this is didu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and laid down as a Propoſition by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> by reaſon of the former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, though againſt reaſon: ſo it is admitted by very many, and thoſe Phyſicians too, as an univerſal truth, without any further ſearch into the truth of the thing or diſquiſition of the difference. Hence they preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29642:11"/>
on all hands, as a thing beyond exception, That all thoſe that are born Deaf are likewiſe Dumb. (as <hi>Sanctor. comm.</hi> in <hi>Art. Medic.</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Part</hi> 2. <hi>Queſtion</hi> 41. are alſo of opinion) make an inquiſition after the cauſe only of the thing ſuppoſed, or incontrovertibly true: But we will more narrowly diſcuſſe the <hi>Theſis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we pry into the cauſe, why it often falls out to be ſo.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Indeed, if by thoſe that are Mute we underſtand ſuch whoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans have in themſelves an ineptitude to the framing of an articulate Voice, it is an abſolute miſtake to maintain that all that are born Deaf, are Dumb alſo: for the ineptitude of organs to the framing of Speech doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follow the want of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For where deafneſs depends not ſo much upon the defect which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Hearing and Speaking, (which we have allowed may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen) as upon the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction rather peculiar to the very <hi>adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:29642:11"/>
organ of Hearing (of which as there are many parts, ſo there may be many obſtructions, that may deſtroy the Hearing) it doth not follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there is an immediate inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>But why rather as the Hearing is ſometimes deſtroyed after the birth, the ſpeech remaining perfect, ſo alſo at the very birth, or immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may not ſuch a conſtitution of the Organs happen, whereby they may be adapted to the forming of ſpeech, and yet be incapable of Hearing?</p>
               <p n="17">17. Here we muſt conſult with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which teſtifies that thoſe that are born deaf, may learn to ſpeak. For ſo <hi>Valleſ. Philoſo. Sacr. cap.</hi> 3. reports, that one <hi>Peter Pontius</hi> a Monk of the Order of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> and his Friend, taught thoſe that were born deaf to ſpeak, by no other way, than inſtructing them firſt to write, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at thoſe things with his finger that were ſignified by thoſe Characters, and then putting them forward to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29642:12"/>
that motion of the Tongue, that did correſpond to the Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But if by thoſe that are dumb we underſtand, ſuch as have Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans fit for the forming of words, but yet underſtand no language, nor ever learn't ſuch words as expreſs the conceived ſenſe of the mind; it is undeniably true, that many that are born Deaf, are alſo Dumb, who never were inſtructed in any Tongue, or ſignicative words by the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned artifice, or ſome ſuch kind of means.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Therefore as to the cauſe, why thoſe that are born Deaf are alſo Dumb, (at leaſt for the generality) <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> in his 4. Book <hi>de Anim. Tract.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 2. ſaith, that thoſe that are Deaf from their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity are alſo Dumb, becauſe they could learn no <hi>Idiom</hi> by the ſenſe of Hearing, And <hi>Sanctor</hi> in Art <hi>Medic.</hi> approves of this opinion. <hi>Galen part.</hi> the 2. <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 4. as alſo <hi>Bartholinus</hi> in the 3.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29642:12"/>
book of his <hi>Anatomy c.</hi> 9. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the cauſe of deafneſs to the Drum of the Ear, who ſaith that thoſe who from their birth are thus affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are alſo for the moſt part Dumb, becauſe they can neither conceive in their mind, nor utter with their Tongue thoſe words, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But <hi>Laurentius</hi> contradicts this opinion in the 11th Book of his <hi>Anatomy</hi> and the 11th <hi>Queſtion</hi> where he ſaith, I do not allow of that vulgar conceit, that the reaſon why thoſe that are Deaf are mute, becauſe they can learn no language, and becauſe Hearing is the Senſe of Learning; for then ſaith he, if that be the only cauſe, why Deaf Men are Dumb;</p>
               <p>Firſt, Why do they breath out their ſighs and groans, which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall paſſions with ſo much difficulty?</p>
               <p>Sccondly, whether or no, might not thoſe that are Deaf frame words and ſpeches to expreſs the ſenſe and conceptions of the mind, if they could
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29642:13"/>
pronounce them, as well as thoſe, who were the firſt Inventors of them.</p>
               <p n="21">21. But in truth we may give this anſwer to <hi>Laurentius</hi> his firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is a fallacy, to ſay that Deaf Men groan and ſigh with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; becauſe original deafneſs, hath no manner of communication with the parts ſubſervient to reſpiration. But <hi>Laurentius</hi> his miſtake ſeems to be grounded upon what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writes in his 4th <hi>Problem. Section</hi> 11. That deaf Men breath not without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence; by which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth not mean a violent or difficult reſpiration which belongs to the Lungs and Breaſt, but a vehement ſpiration or breathing through the Noſtrils; whereupon he addes, that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils become more large by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Spirits, and thats the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they cannot ſpeak but through the Noſe. And ſo alſo in the ſecond <hi>Problem,</hi> (ſaith he) Thoſe that are deaf want but little of being dumb
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29642:13"/>
and thoſe that are dumb, ſpeak through the Noſe, for their Spirits are driven that way, becauſe they cannot ſpeak.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Now where there is a kind of ineptitude to ſpeech in deaf Men, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by ſome defect appertaining to the Palate, as well as the Organ of Hearing, they breath not without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; and becauſe their Spirits do bend their courſe more towards the Noſtrils, by reaſon of the wideneſs of their paſſage, beſides that, they breath out a kind of voice with their mouths, as <hi>Ariſttole</hi> ſpeaks concerning Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants in the 4. Book <hi>de Hiſt. Anim. c.</hi> 9. yet that ſound, they make with their Noſe, reſembles the hoarſeneſs of a Trumpet.</p>
               <p n="23">23. To <hi>Laurentius</hi> his ſecond ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument it may be replyed; although man by nature, though deaf, is arm'd with reaſon to make him fit for inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet as <hi>Plato</hi> teacheth, it is not the property of a vuigar Genius to impoſe names upon things, much leſs is it in the power of every perſon, to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29642:14"/>
invent an elegant ſpeech or peculiar Tongue, to make the conceptions of the mind intelligible.</p>
               <p n="24">24. He that firſt gave creatures their names, to wit, <hi>Adam,</hi> was in his integrity, and in the ſupernatural ſtate of innocency inſtructed with ſuch wiſdome, as tranſcends the capacity of prevaricated nature: The confuſion of various Tongues was afterwards ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally ſent by God at the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Tower of <hi>Babel;</hi> and then the variety of <hi>Idioms</hi> did gradually proceed from the commixture of Tongues, or had ſome other riſe by the common uſe and conſent of men.</p>
               <p>Yet thoſe that are mute, can find out a way whereby to explain the ſenſe of their mind to others, as well as if they had the faculty of ſpeaking, which is analagous to ſpeech, as ſhall be manifeſted in i'ts proper place.</p>
               <p n="25">25. But poſſibly ſome perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive that if deaf men had in them that aptitude of Organs whereby they might be capeable of ſpeaking, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29642:14"/>
they ſhould uſe ſome native Language, or ſpeech, which Nature their School-Miſtreſs ſhould inſtruct them: for ſince Sermocination is eſſential to man, as ſubordinate to reaſon, ſo it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that where the Organs are ſo adapted, there muſt be granted exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſpeech. To which we anſwer, that 'tis true the very faculty of ſermocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is ſubſervient to them in the declaring the ſenſe of their mind, by thoſe ſignifications that are ſet forth by words, whatſoever they be, is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to man; yet the names of things, and ſo conſequently the Languages themſelves, or the <hi>Idioms</hi> of ſpeech are not to be learn't by nature, but by inſtruction, exerciſe and cuſtome.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And really if any certain ſpeech did depend upon nature, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual perſon of mankind hath one and the ſame nature: ſo all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever would uſe one and the ſame Tongue. But the contrary is known experimentally. Therefore their opinion is altogether vain and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29642:15"/>
fooliſh, who, being ignorant of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> would needs oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others to this perſuaſion, that if a Child were taught no Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in his Infancy, but left to his own conduct, he would ſpeak <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that is, he would make uſe of this Language by the meer inſtinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is a conceit altogether inept and fooliſh.</p>
               <p n="27">27. <hi>Valleſius</hi> in the forequoted place makes a good objection to this phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical opinion; ſaying, If Speech were connatural to men, as many other things are; it would be ſo, though they learnt any other Language, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all men would underſtand two Tongues. For, if the Speech in which a man was firſt inſtructed doth not hinder his learning another; (ſince many men can ſpeak two, three, or four Languages) much leſſe can that which is natural, be impeded by that, which is acquiſititious.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Nay rather; if one Tongue were natural to man, they could not be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29642:15"/>
docible of all the reſt; becauſe that which is internal obſtructs the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Therefore as Nature made Man without Knowledge; that he might be capable of all Arts; it muſt neceſſarily follow, that ſhe Created him without any Language, that he might learn them all. We alſo find that many men are more apt to learn other Languages, than the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and that many <hi>Europaeans</hi> attain the true pronunciation of ſome <hi>Hebrew</hi> words with no ſmall difficulty; which could not be, if the <hi>Hebrew</hi> were our natural Language; for all things do voluntarily tend to that which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to them.</p>
               <p n="29">29. We conclude therefore, that they who are born abſolutely Deaf, though their organs are fit for the prolation of words, which frequently happens, yet they are for the major part, Dumb; that is, they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſignificative words, becauſe they could not learn any <hi>Idiom</hi> by the Ear: For it is very rarely known
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29642:16"/>
that they are taught to Speak by any ſuch particular art as <hi>Peter Pontius</hi> made uſe of, which out of <hi>Valleſius</hi> we have before mentioned.</p>
               <p n="30">30. But in the mean time we do no way contradict, but agree with <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius,</hi> when he aſcribes it to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, why all thoſe that are Deaf are generally Dumb, or at leaſt ſpeak with difficulty, taken from the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conjunction of the Nerves. For this we lay down, as another cauſe why Deaf men born, are Dumb, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dumb that they are altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of ſpeaking articulate Words. For that communion of the Nerves conſiſts not in this, that becauſe the Nerve of the fifth Conjugation which is the auditory Nerve, and the Nerves of the ſixth Conjugation, which are thoſe belonging to the Speech (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſeventh, for this is the Nerve of the Tongue) are mutually joyned together within themſelves, before they are diſperſed into their proper parts, as <hi>Peter Apponenſis</hi> in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29642:16"/>
in his Explanation of the <hi>propos'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem,</hi> is of opinion; or becauſe that the ſame Nerves are originally inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame Tunicle, which in the judgement of others, is no leſſe repugnant to it ſelf; for the Nerves of either of the prementioned Conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are found by a ſufficient and long interval originally diſtant; and it cannot be ſaid, that they have any other common Tunicle, than what all other Nerves are covered with, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pia Mennix</hi> from which far-fetcht communion of the Nerves we may alſo inferr, that thoſe that are Deaf, are Blind, and thoſe that are Blind, Dumb.</p>
               <p n="31">31. But that Conjugation of the Nerves is well demonſtrated by <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius</hi> (which is alſo mentioned by <hi>Bauhinus</hi> in the third Book of his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy c.</hi> 22. 60. and others,) that the Nerve of the fifth Conjugation (commonly called the auditory Nerve) hath ſeveral branches iſſuing from it, the larger whereof is expanded to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29642:17"/>
Ear and the membrane of that moſt exquiſite ſenſe, and carries all ſorts of Sounds to the Brain, the leſſer extends to the Tongue and <hi>Larynx,</hi> and is there embraced by the ſeventh Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p n="32">32. And from this Communion of the veſſels proceeds the ſympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ear, the Tongue, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx, and the very affection of thoſe parts, are eaſily communicated one with the other. Hence it is, that the pulling of the Membrane of the Ear, cauſeth a dry Cough in the party; which <hi>Avicen</hi> takes notice of: and that is the reaſon, moſt deaf Men, at at leaſt thoſe, whoſe deafneſs ariſeth from the ill-affection of the Nerves of the fifth pair, are Dumb, or elſe ſpeak with great difficulty; that is, are not capable of framing true words, or of articulate pronunciation, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the want of that convenient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the animal ſpirits; and for this cauſe alſo, it is that thoſe that are thick of Hearing, have a kind of hoarce ſpeech.</p>
               <p n="33">
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:29642:17"/>
33. In like manner, if there be any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil defect which uſually conſiſts in the inward ſtructure of the Ear and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat (which makes them ſpeak through the Noſe, as we have before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> there follows a deafneſs and withall an impediment of Speech, the organ of ſpeech, being vitiated, but not ſimply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Language cannot then be learn't by hearing. But contraily, if the only ſtructure of the Ear be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective or only that branch of the fifth pair, which is carried to the Ear be preternaturally affected; the Hearing may be hindred, or Deafneſs may ariſe; but the impediment is but by Accident; becauſe that when Words cannot be heard or received by the Ear, they cannot be learnt.</p>
               <p n="34">34. But if the Hearing be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd by the defect of the <hi>Tympanum,</hi> or by any particular Membrane that is over it, that is a peculiar Accident; for in this caſe there happens to be a thickneſs of Hearing, which is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29642:18"/>
of kin to Deafneſs, rather than an abſolute Deafneſs it ſelf. And in ſuch caſes, thoſe that are deafiſh uſe to hearken with their Mouth, or to ſuck in Words and Sounds with gaping, and ſo to pronounce without trouble thoſe very words, by the help of thoſe organs ſubſervient to Speech, which they learnt by Hearing; and ſuch are by no means to be call'd Dumb per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="35">35. But the Sound flows to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the Ear, or the very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of Hearing, by the help of the little <hi>Cartilagineous</hi> Pipe, which is conveyed from the ſecond paſſage of the Ear to the Mouth and Palat, being appointed to convey the Excrements of the Ear through the Mouth, like an <hi>Aquaeduct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the benefit of this Conduit-pipe it is, that we can exactly apprehend our own Words, when both our Ears are ſtopt; ſo alſo, if we hold a Stick in our Mouth, and therewith touch any muſical inſtrument, we hear the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29642:18"/>
ſound thereof more exactly; and if you are deſirous to know, whether there be any perſon approaching near you in the Night time, place one end of the Staff on the ground, and hold the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with your Teeth, you hear then far better, though at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p n="36">36. By the ſame Pipe, when we blow our Noſe, or hold our Breath, by ſtopping of the Ears and ſhutting the Mouth, we are ſenſible that the air finds a paſſage into the Ear, by which the Membrane of the <hi>tympanum</hi> is ſtruck with the outward ſound, and ſometimes prejudiced thereby, if it be very violent, and by this it is that Smoakers puffing up their Cheeks ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken in the fume of Tobacco, ſend it out at their Ears, ſo as that they ſeem to Breath at the Ears. Therefore the Opinion of <hi>Alcmaeon</hi> is not ridiculous who held that ſhe-Goats did Breath thorough their Ears, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath it in his firſt Book <hi>de Hiſt. Animal. c.</hi> 11. And
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29642:19"/>
to Phyſicians this conveyance doth inſinuate, that maſticatory Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are not to be ſlighted in the inward pains of the Ears.</p>

               <p n="39">39. Furthermore, if thoſe that are Born Deaf, are alſo Blind, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are depriv'd of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many things, which come within the compaſs of the Senſes, nor can arive at the knowledge of God by the outward Book of Nature, as the other, yet they may obtain the knowledge both of God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by thoſe notions that are graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their minds. And it is very probable, that thoſe whoſe Intellects
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29642:20"/>
are leſs diſturbed in Contemplation by the appearance of corporeal things; the implanted Seeds that are in them of the Knowledge of Divine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Beings, do eaſily break forth into action; as we our ſelves are more apt for the ſearch and Contemplation of Divine things, the leſs we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted by outward objects, and the fancies that reſult from them.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Certainly it is not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous to reaſon, that the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul, or Mind is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active in ſuch perſons, and lies as it were lurking in the lethargy of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numm'd ſecurity, or that they do not according to their capacity incline their minds to the Knowledge of the Deity, by virtue of that innate light that is in them, as well as the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Angels, and Divels; ſince the Soul is to be reckoned in the number of Intelligences (though perhaps pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the loweſt rank of Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) and in reality is not ſo deeply plunged in matter or matterial fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29642:21"/>
by reaſon of its defect of Sight and Hearing.</p>
               <p n="41">41. But what is to be thought of thoſe who are born Deaf, as to their Knowledge in things that concern the Myſtery of our Salvation?</p>
               <p>Theſe things as they are too ſublime, either for Univerſal, Humane, or Angelical knowledge, cannot be found out, or underſtood by thoſe notions implanted in the mind.

We will leave the diſquiſition of their Faith, or the manner thereof to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. Hath God therefore, who according to his Will hath elected ſome ont of all Mankind corrupted by the Fall, to be Veſſels of mercy, and others Veſſels of his wrath, ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regiſtred all thoſe that are born deaf in the number of thoſe that are Veſſels of wrath? Yet God's Promiſe and Covenant belongs to theſe, as much as to the children of the faithful.</p>
               <p n="43">43. The Holy Ghoſt in truth is the chiefeſt cauſe of Faith, who begets it in our hearts by the preaching of the Word, and conſequently by Hearing. This is the ordinary way of God which he commands us to follow; he that neglects this, is excluded from Faith by his own fault. Yet God is not wholly tied up to this one way of operation. He hath extraordinary ways which we are ignorant of, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29642:22"/>
he will not reveal to us. Yet God made uſe of peculiar means to bring St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the chriſtian Faith, and made him of a Perſecutor of the Church, become an Apoſtle, <hi>Acts.</hi> the 9. He proceeded after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the converſion (at leaſt in part) of the Eunuch of <hi>Candace</hi> the <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Queen. Acts the 9. viz. <hi>By the reading of the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="44">44. And ſhall we judge that no perſons can be ſaved, that live where there is no publike preaching of Gods Word, and ſo by conſequence where the mind gains no ſpiritual knowledge by Hearing? May we not affirm, that by diligent reading, and co-operation of the Holy Ghoſt, Faith may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in the Souls of the Godly? Now therefore if this means be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hearing, why may not God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt other ways, that ſo at leaſt his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration may not be confin'd to the hearing ſolely?</p>
               <p n="45">45. But let us examine whether there are not other means appointed by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29642:22"/>
God, by which thoſe that are original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deaf, may attain the knowledge of divine Myſteries ſufficient for ſalvation.</p>
               <p>There is no neceſſity, why ſpeech, which is uſually acquir'd by Hearing, ſhould precede writing; but ſpeech uſeth to be in the firſt place by reaſon of it's facility, for thoſe that have all their ſenſes perfect, are more apt to ſpeak, than write— But where there is a defect of Hearing, they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with writing, and ſo by writing come to ſpeaking, as is manifrſt by the fore-cited example out of <hi>Valleſius.</hi> Now external ſpeech is a kind Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or rather repreſentation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or of the intellect it ſelf.</p>
               <p>They therefore that are born Deaf may by writing inform their minds with the knowledge of thoſe things, which muſt be obtained by hearing in others, whoſe ſenſes are all perfect; and ſo they may make uſe of writing in leiu of ſpeaking, which is otherwayes attained by Learning; and they as <hi>Valleſius</hi> ſpeaks in his third chapter <hi>de</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:29642:23"/>
                  <hi>Phil. Sacr.</hi> Do gain the knowledge of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things by the ſight, which others do by hearing, which I my ſelf (ſaith he) can teſtify, in thoſe Scholars which my friend <hi>Peter Pontius</hi> undertook, who firſt taught them that were born Deaf to write, or to expreſs the conceptions of their mind by writing, and then to ſpeak.</p>
               <p n="46">46. The ſame reaſon there is for thoſe that are born Deaf, if Dumb al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; they may by writing underſtand things, although no external writing is ſubſequent to ſpeech; for the ſpeech in Man conduceth not to the gaining of knowledge to themſelves; but only to communicate the Conceptions of their own mind to others. This is clear by an example taken out of <hi>Pel. Platerus</hi> who in the firſt book of his Obſervations <hi>pag.</hi> 118. reports, that a certain perſon who was born Deaf and Dumb, could with Chalk draw out his mind in a Table-book, which he carried continually about him, and underſtand what others writ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p n="47">
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:29642:23"/>
47. But as writing, or the reading thereof, may ſerve in ſtead of ſpeech, by which the Conceptions of the mind are laid open to the ſight, as well as they are by ſpeech to the Ear; ſo there may be other ſigns made imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the outward ſpeech, and Succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous to hearing; as thoſe are which Mutes themſelves always make uſe one in lieu of ſpeech, and by which they conceive the Sentiments of other mens minds. For experience teacheth us, and there are alſo many obvious examples among us, that thoſe that are originally Dumb, and Deaf do by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain geſtures, and various motions of the body as readily and clearly declare their mind, to thoſe with whom they have been often converſant, as if they could ſpeak, and likewiſe by ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of other Perſons, they do abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely underſtand the intentions of their mind alſo.</p>
               <p n="48">48. The Emperour of the Turk maintains many ſuch Mutes in his Court; who do expreſs the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:29642:24"/>
Conceptions of their minds one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as it were interchange mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſcourſe, by geſticulations, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of external ſignifications, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways than we that have the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſignifying our own thoughts, and conceiving thoſe of other Perſons by outward Speech. Nay the Turkiſh Emperour himſelf, and his Courtiers, take great delight with this kind of Speech ſhadowed out by geſtures, and uſe to employ themſelves very much in the exerciſe hereof, to make them perfect in it.</p>
               <p n="49">49. <hi>Cornelius Haga</hi> Embaſſadour to the Emperour of the Turks ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the States of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces did once invite all thoſe Mutes to a Banquet (as I obſerved from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation given me by the moſt Noble and Worthy Dr. <hi>Brinkins</hi> Senator of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervick)</hi> where though there was not a ſyllable heard yet they did exchange ſeveral diſcourſes, as is uſual at other Treats, which the Embaſſadour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by an Interpreter on both ſides
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29642:24"/>
by whoſe aſſiſtance he himſelf did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the Mutes upon all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p n="50">50. But thoſe very ſignifications of things, which Mutes make uſe of, proceed not from nature, but from their own inſtitution no more, than our ſpeech; Therefore they attain unto them by Study and exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Although however moſt of them do ſhadow out ſome outward manner, of the things which they aim at. As when they cloſe one hand, and move it up towards the Noſtrils, thereby they ſignifie a Flower. Now the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of thoſe Mutes (which is as it were their Speech) are not like the Languages which vary among ſeveral Nations, nor are ſo abſolutely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p n="51">51. And as the Mutes do by their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures exactly and diſtinctly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand one another, and thoſe Perſons alſo that uſe ſuch a kind of analogous Speech among them; ſo they conceive many things by the geſtures, motion of the Lips, and ſuch like things in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29642:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoſe that really do ſpeak, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times underſtand a great part of their conceptions by ſuch outward things. So ſaith <hi>Platerus</hi> in the place above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned: that his Father told him, that that Deaf and Dumb man (whom we diſcourſt of a little before) when he very devoutly heard <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> Preaching, did apprehend many things from the motion of his Lips, and geſtures; and ſo from others.</p>
               <p n="52">52. And there is now at this very time in the City of <hi>Gronning,</hi> ſuch a one who being born Deaf and Dumb, conſtantly frequents publike Sermons, and doth as it were contemplate upon the Words of the Preacher with his eyes fixt upon him, ſo that he ſeems to receive them in at his Mouth as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do by the Ear. This perſon when he earneſtly deſires to receive the Holy Sacrament, I do not at all queſtion, but that he hath that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe Divine things, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his Salvation, inſomuch that he cannot be debarr'd from it without
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:29642:25"/>
ſome ſcruple of Conſcience. Although I am of opinion that he ought to be examined as to this his knowledge and Confeſſion, which may be done, by means of his Wife, or Servant, his Interpreters, whom he alwayes hath with him, and who diſcourſe with him very nimbly by ſigns, of any thing whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="53">53. We will ſubjoyn one example out of <hi>Phil. Camerarius,</hi> which is in <hi>Horae Subciſivae</hi> 1 <hi>Gent.</hi> 37- <q>We have now among us (ſaith he) a young Youth and a Maid born of the ſame Parents, and indeed of a Noble and honeſt Family, who have an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary acuteneſs of Wit: and though Nature brought them forth Deaf and Dumb, yet they can both of them Read diſtinctly, Write an excellent hand, and keep Merchants Accompts. And as he dextrouſly perceives by a Nod what you would have him to do, and ifhe wants a Pen, will expreſs himſelf by geſtures; and is very cunning at all Games
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29642:26"/>
that are uſually plaid among us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Dice, which cannot be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged without great ſubtilty; ſo ſhe very much exceeds all Maids at her Needle and curious Weaving. But among other their admirable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, which Nature hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them; this is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that they ſeem to underſtand what any one ſpeaks by the motion of the Lips; Wherefore they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at Church, hearing the Word Preacht. So that it will be no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity to ſay, that 'tis probable they take the Words in at their Eyes, they are ſo intent, which others uſe to do by the Ear. For they can at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure without any ſuggeſtion, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help write the Lords Prayer, and other pious Oraiſons. And can remember the Goſpells appointed to be read on Holy-days as well as others, and readily Write them. And if the Holy Name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> be mentioned in the Church, he, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the reſt, will in a poſture
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29642:26"/>
of Reverence uncover his head, and bow the knee. Thus Nature like an indulgent Mother was ſolicitous and ſtudious to recompenſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that ſhe might free her ſelf from the injurious accuſation of a cruel Step-mother.</q>

               <p>That the faculty of Speech (which preſuppoſeth reaſon) is only beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Man, and that no other Creature can Speak: <hi>Which we will take into our Conſideration.</hi>

Prodigious things are related of the <hi>Elephant</hi> by <hi>Pliny, Aelian, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> and others, which <hi>Lipſius</hi> hath Collected out of ſeveral Authors in his <hi>firſt Century ch.</hi> 50.

Arom. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 14. relates it alſo.</p>
               <p>There was an Elephant in the City of <hi>Cochin,</hi> who wanting his food at the preciſe accuſtomed hour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and bray'd. His Maſter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed it by ſhewing him that the Brazen Veſſel, which uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his food was leaky and run out, and that the occaſion of this delay was, becauſe, that it could no longer hold his Drench or Waſh: And therefore commands him, if he would eat, to carry it to the <hi>Braziers</hi> to be mended. He obeys, takes it upon his Trunk and brings it to the <hi>Brazier.</hi> Who either through negligence, or
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29642:30"/>
to make ſport with the Beaſt, did not mend it well, and ſtop up the Chinks. The Elephant brings it back again, his Maſter ſpying the fault, grew angry, and exclaimed both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and the Elephant; and in fine, bids him carry the Veſſel back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. He doth ſo, and with a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous tone throws it at the <hi>Brazier.</hi> He being a pleaſant fellow, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to put a Cheat upon him the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and makes, as if he did ſtop the holes, but did not: Yet he miſt his aim; for the Elephant was ſo cunning, as to carry the Cauldron to the River, and there puts it into the Water and fills it, to try whether it would hold, but he found that it did run out. He being hereupon highly incenſed, runs back to the <hi>Brazier,</hi> and bellowed out with a thundering voice, ſo that the Neighbours came about them, and among the reſt the King's <hi>Vice-roy.</hi> The <hi>Brazier</hi> paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Beaſt with fair words (and here ſaith <hi>Lipſius,</hi> I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29642:30"/>
I dare proceed any further) and at laſt he takes the Veſſel into his hands and mends it well and ſtrongly. But the Elephant being miſtruſtful, carries it again to the River and fills it with Water; when he ſaw that it would hold, he turns himſelf to the ſtanders by and ſhews it, calling them as witneſſes to the matter of fact; and ſo went home.</p>
               <p n="61">61. <hi>Garcias</hi> adds further, who travelled into thoſe parts, that there are ſome yet living, who affirm they ſaw it done. And he teſtifies, that Elephants do not only underſtand the Language of their own, but alſo thoſe of forein Countreys, if taught them. And a little after; In ſumme, there is nothing wanting in this Creature to make him appear rational, but only Speech: although this alſo (as the ſame <hi>Garcias</hi> witneſſeth) is by ſome attributed to it.

               <p n="75">75. Hither is to be referred that of <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> in the Life of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> in his 4.

               <p n="76">76. And ſince it is ſo, what muſt we think of the Reaſon of Brutes, and their <hi>Sermocination</hi> whatſoever it be? What is there wanting to make them rational Creatures, or make them accounted to be of Humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety? Are we not bound to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there is in Brutes a kind of analogical Reaſon or eſtimative facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that reſembles Reaſon, from whence their Ingenuity is derived, and by virtue whereof, they ſeem to be in ſome reſpects prudent.</p>
               <p n="77">77. And truely ſince we ſee that Brute Animals do ſometimes Rave, and Dote (for <hi>Apes</hi> when Drunk, have a kind of <hi>delirium; Dogs</hi> are troubled with the <hi>Hydrophobia</hi> or

               <p n="78">78. Yet this Reaſon of Brutes is abſolutely different from Humane Reaſon in its very eſſence, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is a kind of ſenſitive or material faculty of the Soul, to which, that which is vulgarly called Cogitative in man, or the eſtimative faculty it ſelf, illuſtrated with Reaſon, from the preſiding, and hypoſtatical union of the rational Soul with the ſenſitive,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29642:38"/>
Body, doth in ſome meaſure agree: and yet this very Cogitative faculty in Man, though it be material, it is far more noble and excellent, than the Reaſon in any ſpecies of Brutes can be; and doth by many degrees ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the Reaſon of <hi>Elephants;</hi> then this Reaſon is apprehended to tranſcend the Reaſon of <hi>Gallus Africanus,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that there is herein a kind of irradiation, or a repreſented Image in Man, flowing from the Immortal Soul, which alſo by its Native and Eſſential Reaſon is capacitated to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Coeleſtial Intelligencies; which bright light of Reaſon in Man communicates it ſelf to the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty, by reaſon of the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate connexion of the Rational Soul with the Senſitive Body, by which the whole <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> becomes Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>

               <p>For as it is ſenſitive, it perceives <hi>v. g.</hi> the Water, Fire, Fleſh, Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and the like; and forms an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of them (which is alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Brutes, as well as Men) but ſince Fleſh is one thing, and the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Fleſh another; Magnitude, is one thing, and the Eſſence of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, another; and ſo of the reſt; it doth by another part of it ſelf, or by it ſelf in another capacity <hi>(viz.</hi> not as it is ſenſitive, but cogitative, or as it partakes of Reaſon, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the rational Soul) diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Eſſence, from the things themſelves, which fall under our Senſes.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that which may be known of God (as our Verſion hath it) in the <hi>firſt</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> may be underſtood by the very <hi>Plebeians;</hi> ſo Philoſophers and ſuch as are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with more ſublime Speculations, or have learnt to free their minds from this terrene incarceration, attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of the Deity by the inward qualifications of their minds, without being obliged to the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Senſe.</p>
               <p>And really thoſe very ſeeds that are naturally planted in the minds of men, do ſometimes ſo powerfully exert themſelves into action, that they bind the very Conſciences of the moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſuch as deny the very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Senſes. And herein we may affirm with <hi>Calvin,</hi> in the firſt Book of his <hi>Inſtitutes, c.</hi> 3. §. 1. That beyond all Controverſy there is by a natural inſtinct, a kind of ſenſe of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:29642:42"/>
Divinity in the mind of Man, for God hoth endued all perſons with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of his Deity, that no man ſhould ſhelter himſelf under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of Ignorance, who by a conſtant recollection of his memory, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him with freſh inſtillations.</p>
               <p n="87">87. But as to the Reaſon of Brute Animals; being it depends upon the ſenſitive Soul, it is abſolutely mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and drowned in the Body, it is altogether inſeparable from it, and periſheth with the <hi>Individuum,</hi> and therefore is converſant with nothing but what is Corporeal and Mortal. The ſame faculty is in all the ſpecies of Brutes imployed about ſome certain and determinate object, to which all of them are hurried by a natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity; and not as it is in Man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to any thing. So Nature inſtructs <hi>Swallows</hi> to build their Neſts of Clay; Beaſts to get Coverts or Dens; <hi>Dogs</hi> hunt the <hi>Hare;</hi> and <hi>Cats</hi> watch for <hi>Mice;</hi> which neither the Reaſon of a <hi>Cow,</hi> nor an <hi>Aſs</hi> prompts
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29642:42"/>
them to; nor can they by Art be brought to it.</p>
               <p n="88">88. And although probably ſome ſpecies of theſe Brute Animals are more freely exerciſed, about various objects by raciocination, than others, as we find in <hi>Elephants, Apes, Monkies,</hi> the <hi>Cynocephali,</hi> and <hi>Dogs</hi> themſelves, and the like; yet they are apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the objects themſelves no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, than under the notion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars: For they perceive the Water, Fire, Fleſh, Magnitude and the like; and then frame ſome fantaſms of theſe very things; and theſe they, either compound or divide, and ſo judge or eſteem of the ſpecies ſo receiv'd: but Fleſh being one thing, and the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thereof, another; Magnitude, one thing, and the Eſſence thereof, another, &amp;c. as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks, they cannot diſcern the Eſſence of things from the things themſelves, nor can they abſtract individuals from univerſals. So that their univerſal Reaſon conſiſts in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and material things; and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29642:43"/>
therefore they are incapable of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is comprehended under certain Maxims and Rules.</p>
               <p n="89">89. Beſides if it could poſſibly be maintain'd, that ſome Brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals have a kind of Senſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity (it is reported that that Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Religion conſiſting in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> did proceed from <hi>Elephants)</hi> or that ſome faint image or ſhadow of Piety may be diſtill'd into them, yet by that they cannot conceive any thing of God, unleſſe it be by corporeal reaſon, and ſo have no Conception of God, nor can they ever be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute concerning God by the deduction of Cauſes, or by the ſucceſſive end, nor by concluſions drawn from the principles imprinted in their minds; but only by the ſingular commodity or uſe, or the more ſplendid appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the particular individual body, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon,</hi> and ſo they cannot apprehend the inviſible things of God, but can only frame a concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:29642:43"/>
or imagination of the corporeal <hi>Idea</hi> of thoſe things which proximate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly move the Senſes.</p>
               <p n="90">90. Undoubtedly that which is purely Incorporeal and Divine, or which is the true Eſſence of Divinity, which is only Religiouſly to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, cannot fall under the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a faculty meerly corporeal. But if there do appear in <hi>Elephants,</hi> as well the ſhadow of many Virtues, as a certain kind of imaginary <hi>Idea</hi> of Religion (as <hi>Lipſius</hi> hath heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether many Examples out of divers Authors to that purpoſe) what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it, that the Celeſtial Bodies ſtrike the Senſes with greateſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and yet are not exquiſitely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the Senſes, that that repreſentation of Religion whatſoever it be, ſhould be directly apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? And ſo they be believed by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> and <hi>Aelian,</hi> to Worſhip the <hi>Riſing Sun;</hi> and by <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Aelian,</hi> the <hi>New Moon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="91">91. Finally, the Wiſdom of Brutes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29642:44"/>
conſiſts only in that part wherein they alſo ſuffer a <hi>delirium;</hi> but Man's Wiſdom alſo conſiſts in the mind or active Intellect, in which they never dote, and herein they evidently differ from Beaſts, who have not this facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So that that paſſage of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Aphor.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. belongs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the paſſive Intellect, ſo far as it reſides in the ſenſitive faculty; where he ſaith, That thoſe who are troubled in any part of the Body, and are hardly ſenſible of the pain, their mind (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or as <hi>Galen</hi> interprets it in his Commentary <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, for they are deceived by a defect of the inward Senſes, which Brutes have in common with Men, and ſtand alwayes in need of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, whilſt tied to the fetters of the Body.</p>
               <p n="92">92. Therefore Men are truely ſaid to be diſtinguiſhed from Beaſts by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; becauſe Brute Animals have not any foot-ſteps of that Reaſon that is natural to the rational Soul, or the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29642:44"/>
active Intellect; but they only have ſome kind of ſhadow of that Reaſon which is communicated to the ſenſitive faculty, or of the paſſive Intellect; ſo that they are ſaid to have Reaſon Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically.</p>
               <p n="93">93. Now as to the Speech which is apprehended to be in ſome Brutes, that have organs fit for the emiſſion of an articulate Voice; what kind of Reaſon that may be, and how it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from Humane Speech, is the thing to be diſcuſſed: And as the ſpeech of <hi>Parrets, Crows,</hi> and other Birds, wo are taught by Art, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but a certain articulate Voice without any mental underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to which they are trained up by Cuſtome, not knowing for the moſt part what is ſignified by this or that word. So that <hi>Parret</hi> that rehearſed the Apoſtles Creed; did not at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the thing ſignified by thoſe words. And therefore this ſort of ſpeech, is not at all a repreſentation of the intrinſick reaſon, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29642:45"/>
no true ſpeech.</p>
               <p n="94">94. But if ſometimes it ſo fall out that they ſeem appoſitely to appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Names of things to the things themſelves, or retain the ſignification of them, that is the work of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, by which they do accommodate thoſe things which they by their doci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have gained to particular things, as they have been accuſtomed to them, and according to their often repeated appellations: But their ſpeech ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends no farther to other things, than Cuſtome hath directed them. And as that <hi>Parret</hi> which fell into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver call'd for help, and promis'd a Reward, it muſt neceſſarily be, that ſhe had by practice learnt thoſe words being oftentimes before in the like danger.</p>
               <p n="95">95. And ſince it is undeniable that not only <hi>Elephants,</hi> but ſome other Creatures, as <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Horſes</hi> (though theſe are not altogether ſo capable) do in ſome manner conceive the Speech of Man, to which they are accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29642:45"/>
or underſtand what is meant by ſuch and ſuch words, as they are taught (and as they by the motion or geſture of their Maſters, know what they would have) though ſome more exactly, than others. Is it a greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for theſe Brutes, if they have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans fit for Speech, to be able by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſions (as they have learnt by Cuſtom) to ſignify the ſingle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of their eſtimative faculty to others, which they frame within themſelves according to the common ſpeech they are accuſtomed to, than that they ſhould by the uſual geſtures of the Body, and other various ways (which is alſo the Speech of Mutes) be able to adumbrate their inward conceptions to others? Or what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it for a <hi>Parret, Pie, Crow,</hi> or <hi>Starling,</hi> to expreſs what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly conceive or deſire by an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Voice, or ſuch as they have learnt by cuſtom?</p>
               <p n="96">96. And thoſe Creatures that have been uſ'd to Speech can count num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29642:46"/>
and yet they have no formal conception of thoſe numbers; becauſe that cannot be done but by abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo conſequently by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material faculty. For in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of any thing propoſed, or the collecting a definite multitude out of unities, it is requiſitely neceſſary that the mind have an <hi>Idea</hi> of ſome num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be known, and that it appear, how the third differs from the fourth, and the fourth from the tenth, and ſo on; to the end, that the number may be rightly appropriated to any multitude propos'd, according as the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. But this does not at all come within the reach of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial faculty, with which Brutes are only endued.</p>
               <p n="97">97. Since therefore number is not properly form'd but by the Intellect, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, 4. <hi>Phyſ. t.</hi> 131. it muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the names of Number are only repeated by the Memory in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29642:46"/>
Brutes that name it, but the Eſſence of Number, or difference, of the fourth, and fifth, or twentieth, is not in them.</p>
               <p n="98">98. As to the Writing of Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Creatures, ſince that <hi>Elephants</hi> uſe the <hi>Proboſcis,</hi> as a Hand, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as readily as we do (for they will take the ſmalleſt peice of Money off from the ground, and ordinarily manage a Sword like a Fencer, handle a Gun, level it and diſcharge, as we our ſelves, that have been eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, can teſtify) it need not ſeem an impoſſibility for them to Write ſome Letters, whoſe figures they have been taught, either ſingly, or joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo reduced them into words, and perhaps by Writing to expreſs their conception of any particular thing according to cuſtom, as other Brutes uſe to notify their conceptions by geſtures, or other wayes ſuitable to their nature.</p>
               <p n="99">99. But it is ſufficiently apparent by what hath been ſaid, how infinitely
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29642:47"/>
the Speech of Inanimate Creatures, and the adumbration thereof by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, doth differ from Human Speech; whereas Man doth not appropriate this, or that word, to this, or that particular thing by cuſtom only; but can uſe his Tongue volubly, and can exerciſe it in the expreſſing of any thing whatſoever, upon all emergent occaſions, in a far different manner from that of Brutes: And as Mans Reaſon it ſelf, or the internal Speech, doth not only aim at particular and material, but univerſal, abſtracted, and immaterial things, which Brutes by their Reaſon cannot do, ſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Speech, which is the <hi>nuncius</hi> of the internal, is aſſiſted thereby, which indeed the Speech of Brutes cannot aſpire unto.</p>
               <p n="100">100. So that there is, as vaſt a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the Reaſon of Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Creatures and Humane Reaſon, and their Speech, or the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things which is deſigned by Speech, and the Speech of Man, as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:29642:47"/>
there is between the Material and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Faculty. And therefore we may truly conclude, that no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is endued with the faculty of real Speech, or true Reaſon, but Man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but the Speech of Brutes may be ſaid faintly to reſemble the true Speech of Man, as alſo their Reaſon, Human Reaſon, by ſome kind of Analogy.</p>
