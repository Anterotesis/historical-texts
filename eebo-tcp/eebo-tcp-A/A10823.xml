         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To the intent the whole Matter may
be the more cleare and euident, and
that a perfect Answere may be had to
the alledged Argument, these Heads in

               <item>1 Peter was neuer Head of the Church.</item>

            <p>First then, no man can denie, but if
<hi>Peter</hi> had beene constituted and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Head of the Church, the rest of
the Apostles would or should haue
knowne it: For it stood them greatly
<pb facs="tcp:28158:7"/>
vpon, to vnderstand to whom they
should haue recourse in dangers, as to
their Commaunder, and vnto whom
they should giue obedience: to whom
also they should render an account of al
their proceedings, least they should
wander, bestowing their endeuours (as
it would appeare) vnprofitably, not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
by any President, who should
either allow or disallow of their trauels
in their Apostle ship, &amp;c. But so it is, that
they neuer acknowledged <hi>Peter</hi> Head
of the Church, nor of any of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
much lesse of them all.</p>
            <p>Yea <hi>Christ,</hi> the wisdome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in whom the Godhead dwelleth
bodily,<note place="margin">Luke 11. 49.</note> and in whom are the treasures of
knowledge and vnderstanding, leaueth
no place to the vaine Curiosity and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
inuentions of man, a little before
his death, as it were taking his farewell
and good night of them: for then wee
attend the last will and wordes of our
friendes most, they take deepest impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in our mindes and memories, how
much the more aduisedly and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
they are spoken, as it were, by the
heart, with great waight, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:28158:7"/>
the time is short and imminent
certainty of death, (for Christ knew wel
his houre) but also for that men keepe
most eagerly that, whereof they haue
no long expectation of endurance and
continuance. Christ, I say, the night
before his death, after Supper, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
humility in his owne example
to his Apostles, not to be lookt on only,<note place="margin">Iohn 13. 15.</note>
but followed,<note place="margin">Ibid. 17.</note> did wash their feete: and
to signifie with due intimation, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in that whole action did come,
but of his prouident foresight &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
whereto he was priuy; yea, and
the Searcher of hearts did pry into the
Closet of <hi>Iudas</hi> Treason,<note place="margin">Ibid. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19.</note> which <hi>Peter,</hi>
when <hi>Iudas</hi> was taxed for it, did desire
to know by the meanes of <hi>Iohn,</hi> who
leaned on <hi>Iudas</hi> breast: If he had been
Head, it was more competent in his own
person to haue demaunded it.</p>
            <p>And for that they should be vnwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
vnto the world, hee armes them
with constancy and patience against the
ignominie and shame of their future
crosses,<note place="margin">Ibid. 31. 32.</note> with promises of sending the
Comforter and other some heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions:
yea it was so farre from <hi>Iesus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:28158:8"/>
mind &amp; intention, to ordaine <hi>Peter</hi> head
of his Church, or of the rest of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
that hee before them all and in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
owne presence perticularly foretells
his deniall,<note place="margin">Ibid. 37. 38</note> if this was that Champion
(not to derogate to the Saint of God)
that was to be placed in primacie aboue
the rest, iudge yee? For when could <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
haue more opportune time, or the
Disciples better or quieter occasion
to declare and heare a Superior ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
ouer them, then now, when
hee should fore-speake his defection
to him, and his Apostacie who so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogantly
relied vpon humane strength
and fortitude; beside that lately he had
beene rebuked in the highest degree, by
<hi>Christ</hi> in calling him Sathan, for appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
<hi>Christ</hi> might haue forborne and
tolerated the future head of the Church,
and more mildly and softly entreated
him, as in these and such like termes.
<hi>Peter</hi> thy lapse wil procure thee to bee
lowest of all, because it will bee the
greatest of all, yet I will after aduance
and promote thee to bee highest and
head of all.</p>
            <p>Now hee was checked for intruding
<pb facs="tcp:28158:8"/>
himself into the ciuil Magistrates office,
who if he had beene to bee surrogate in
<hi>Christs</hi> office might haue beene borne
with,<note place="margin">Ihon 18. 11.</note> in some degree, yet so much as in
him was, hee hindred the mistery of our
saluation; At all these times was good
opportunity to conciliate to <hi>Peter</hi> in
so open audience and famous places,
both of the disciples and men without,
authority and credit, if it had stood with
<hi>Christs</hi> purpose to haue exalted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<hi>Peter</hi> to the dignity of beeing
head ouer his people and Church.</p>
            <p>But which is of greater moment, it
may be, <hi>Iesus</hi> would conceale and keepe
secret to himselfe the dispensation of
that charge vntill after his passion, or
then keepe it in his own person, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to make any participant of the
same, vntill the time appointed in his
good pleasure thereafter: yet so it is, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
is heauily vpbraided after the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
as <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>In that reasoning,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 5 8.</note> that Christ had
with the Disciples, premonishing them
that he was going and departing from
them, and with <hi>Thomas,</hi> pretending his
<pb facs="tcp:28158:9"/>
ignorance of the way hee should take;
if any, or <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe should haue

it not now? When so familiarly hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
with <hi>Thomas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. 8. 9.</note> I will not say, but
euen then he did answere to farre har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

he should delay, and continue the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

not thinke you, once without ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

and manifestlie thereafter haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

            <p>Yea,<note place="margin">Ibid. 23. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Iudas Lebbeus</hi> receiued a perfect
resolution of his demaund, in the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy

mans Saluation, which was to some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested,
to others hid: but of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
excellencie there is neuer a
whisper, and no maruaile, for he was to
reserue that point to himselfe vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable,
not willing to diminish and
lessen the same, by diuoluing that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to another, or though he had bin
weary (if so I may say) to beare that
burthen himselfe, as not of sufficient
power and abilitie to discharge it, to
<pb facs="tcp:28158:9"/>
the will of all his mysticall members,
which did receiue spirituall Sappe and

            </p>
            <p>And we know it to be accustomably
vsed (for so did <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Iosuah</hi> at the
Lords owne direction, and <hi>Dauid</hi> to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,
&amp;c.</hi>) to establish the Successor in
the second roome, when one is eyther
to dimit, or giue signification of the
succedent, to preuent occasions of strife
and debate which might arise, and are
commonly bred for degrees of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but Christ remits and sends them
to no mans Soueraignty, but as it were,
manumits them, and of Seruants, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them his free friends, and as friends
haue most things common, cheefelie,
wils, councels and minds, so saith hee:
All that I haue heard from my Father, I
haue declared vnto you; but when said
he, either first or last, that <hi>Peter</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:28158:10"/>
Head, or should be head of the Church,
which Christ knew to be immortall, and
<hi>Peter</hi> then mortall, which Christ told
him thereafter, and the manner of his
violent death. And that a man, no not
all the men in the world can viuifie or
quicken themselues: it is then farre off
that one can viuifie another. But wee,
when wee were dead in trespasses and
sinnes, are quickned together, in, with,
and by Christ, by whose Grace wee are
saued: and surely neither <hi>Peter</hi> nor any
of the Apostles, can transfuse or deriue
any of the spirituall Graces one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in such sort as Christ by his Spirit,
saue onely, as all the disposers of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of God doe, by the liuely prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore if it had been Christs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
to haue vouchsafed that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> when that contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie
anent Superioritie did arise; sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he would not haue passed it without
Decision, he is not the God of Debate,
but will haue all things done in order,
for hee would haue this scrupple taken
out of the way, seeing them all as vpon
a stumbling block rush vpon it; A little
<pb facs="tcp:28158:10"/>
before in their gazing vpon the stately
building of the Temple and princely
Fabrick of that magnificent materiall
Church,<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> and as they did after the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
dreame of the restitution of the
Crowne and commonwealth from the
vnnaturall tyrannie of the Romanes to
whom they were Tributaries (for now
the Scepter had departed, and the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer
from betwixt Iuda his Feete) with
close mouth, neither than nor now did
he passe ouer, neither the matter &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it selfe, neither themselues vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued,<note place="margin">Mar 13.</note>
but forespake the ruine &amp; sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Towne of Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
taking occasion to Prophesie the
consummation of the whol world,<note place="margin">Luc. 21.</note> with
the diuers Incidents at that period of
time, when it should happen, as in that
his Sermon most euidently shewes it
selfe. But in that so high a Question, so
earnestly tossed among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing, the
world and Ierusalem both shall perish,
and they shall wax old as doth a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and as a vesture shall they bee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
vp, and in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (as was then
foretold) is not a stone left vpon a stone,
but the Church endureth for euer, and
<pb facs="tcp:28158:11"/>
such an euerlasting and eternall head
should it haue, which <hi>Peter</hi> in no wise
could bee. This was I say the meetest
time for remouing of the doubs, yet our
Sauiour did not command to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<hi>Peter</hi> for head, which without all
contradiction he would haue done if he
had appointed him chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
ouer the rest, if so it had beene
his intention, that the other Apostles
should haue acknowledged <hi>Peter</hi> for
their Lord and Master. Yet so it is that
flat contrarily he deliuers and giues his
Decree and Sentence, that there should
be no principalitie nor primacie among
them, but the greatest as the smallest,
&amp;c. For so saith he, <hi>the Kings of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
doe raigne, &amp;c.</hi> but so it shall not
be among you. In the which words he
doth not onely recall them from such
gouernment and regencie as is amongst
the Gentils or Nations, but also hee
disswades and dehorts them from all
manner of Primacie; for Christ answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to no other interrogation heere, but
such as they propounded; but they did
not enquire of the gouernment and
Lordsh., of the kings of nations, for what
<pb facs="tcp:28158:11"/>
was that forme of Regiment appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to them, out of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
which euery one of them affected
among themselues, and vnto the which
they would haue climbed, for they did
chide among themselues, and were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided,
as it is said there: And forsooth
if any might haue looked for a high
place and promotion,<note place="margin">Mat. 20, 20.</note> the sonnes of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedeus,
Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 10. 35.</note> (Christs Cozens
concerning the flesh) wherevpon they
did ground their petition by appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
But there is no acceptation of
persons with God. Their mother as
meaning to finde greatest fauour both
in regard of her kindred with the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<hi>Mary</hi> Christs Mother, as also for
her Sexe and humble behauiour, but all
their suites were cast ouer barre, and
they simply denied for the causes there
alledged, which are not necessary here
to repeat, and besides those reasons
there set downe, they should haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that Christ before had closed
their mouth from such a subiect,<note place="margin">Mar. 9. 33.</note> and
therefore taught them,<note place="margin">Iuc. 9. 46.</note> that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
proceeded from ignorance and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:28158:12"/>
But it would seem <hi>Peter</hi> should haue
his ordination, if not immediatly from
Christ, in the daies of his Flesh, yet by
the authoritie of the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
who had receiued the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
on the Pentecost in great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
but they neuer acknowledged
such place in <hi>Peter,</hi> whose prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
(if any had been) they would not
haue neglected;<note place="margin">Act. 8. 14.</note> yet so it is they tooke
vpon them boldnes to send both <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>Iohn</hi> from Ierusalem to the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,
whom they heard to haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the word of God, for whom also the
rest did pray and giue imposition of
hands. Now he who sends and directs
another is aboue him that is sent, else
how dare he vsurpe that title and right
as to command, either how can he look
for obedience, or perfecting any point
of dutie at the hands of him who is
sent if hee be not subiect to the senders
command &amp; will, for it is not said the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
requested, or entreated, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
<hi>Peter,</hi> but that they sent the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apostles, hauing, from their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and present assembly enioined to
<hi>Peter</hi> and his Colleague <hi>Iohn,</hi> equall
<pb facs="tcp:28158:12"/>
with him in that charge, to vndertake
that iourney, for the benefit of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marirans.
If euer at any time, surely
heere, <hi>Peter</hi> might haue stood vpon his
estimation, and might haue reiected
their ordinance as arrogant and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
in extending their power
too much, if he had beene head of the
Church.</p>
            <p>It may be that <hi>Peter</hi> as hee was euer
very willing and prone to vndertake,
so heere hee would yeeld to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
desire, but who can excuse the
Apostles; yea and the other Brethren
which were of Iudea, which could not
haue a like place and authoritie with
the Disciples of Christ, in many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
respects, which are not here to be
reckoned,<note place="margin">Act. 11. 1. 2. 3.</note> to haue accused and caused
<hi>Peter</hi> to giue a reason of his conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Doctrine among the vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized,
in that he had entered vnto them
and eater with them after the receipt
of the word of God, if hee had been
constituted head of the Church, either
in Christs time here vpon earth, or yet
after his resurrection, by Christ or his
Apostles or by any other means whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb facs="tcp:28158:13"/>
remarkeable, who can say, but
that the Apostles haue done greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
in challenging their Superior and
not rendring that simple and humble
submission as in such matters is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
and suppose it were tollerable in
the Apostles, who were in like rank and
estate with him; yet if <hi>Peter</hi> had been
mounted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to that degree, he could not
haue comported to heare himselfe so
disgraced as it were,<note place="margin">ibid. 2.</note> and contended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
by those farre inferiour to the
Apostles, and adacted to giue in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie,
clearely expounding and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the whol matter vnto them with
all the circumstances thereof. <hi>Peter,</hi>
if hee had been their Master and head,
might haue put them to silence for their
sudden strife with him, or else haue said,
I haue done no wrong, I haue reason
for my actions; and that may suffice that
I haue commandement by Reuelation
from aboue, wherevnto I am priuie my
selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> yet might haue deliuered in
defence of his proceedings to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
and Brethren of Iudea offended
at him, for <hi>Peters</hi> primacie had not
<pb facs="tcp:28158:13"/>
been divulged and made manifest to
the Church (if any had) or for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
and iniurie of the time it was
suppressed and holden vnder vntill more
conuenient time, while it should break
vp, either (truely) in Antioch, or at
Rome. But it is exceeding maruellous
that <hi>Paul</hi> should not many yeares after
haue got intelligence of the same see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was such a necessary Head in the
Church as tending to calme &amp; tranquill
all controuersies when refuge and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
should be made to him as vnto an
Oracle) for whom God sendeth in his
worke whatsoeuer, him hee furnisheth
fit and meet for the discharge thereof)
and being aduanced to bee head, his
graces should haue surpassed the other
Apostles, especially <hi>Paul,</hi> who cals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
an abortiue issue and borne out of
time,<note place="margin">Gal. 2, 2, 6.</note> and it is credible that <hi>Paul</hi> would
not take that arrogancy vppon him, by
sundry arguments to contend, himselfe
no wise inferior to <hi>Peter,</hi> if <hi>Peter</hi> was
head of the church, &amp; that hee receiued
no point of doctrine from him, or any
other of the brethren at Ierusalem, to
which hee did ascend by reuelation to
<pb facs="tcp:28158:14"/>
know his conformity with them.<note place="margin">Ibid 9.</note> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
in recompting certaine disciples as
<hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> he placeth not <hi>Peter</hi> in
the first order and roome: this is farre
from his accustomed manner: who was
so meeke as a nurse to her children, and
who requireth his Galathians to bee as
he was,<note place="margin">1. Thes. 2. 7. 8.</note> for he was as they were, and to
giue to all men their duty,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 12.</note> scare to whom
feare and honor to whom wee owe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 12.</note> but in Gods cause when hee did see
<hi>Peter,</hi> that he went not the right way
to the truth of the Ghospell, hee did
withstand him to his face before all men,
because hee was to bee rebuked, what
can bee more euident? We know when
<hi>Paul</hi> was rauished in the third heauen
and receiued vasions and reuelations,
fourteene yeares before hee manifested
the same, and heard words vnutterable:
but of this preferment of <hi>Peter,</hi> there is
not one siyllable, yea <hi>Paul</hi> was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictor
in this place, where, hee brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
his warrant, for in that matter and
combate with <hi>Peter</hi> hee did nothing
without expresse command, as not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
one foot in that voyage without
speciall reuelation; yea and if the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
<pb facs="tcp:28158:14"/>
and date bee true,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 2.</note> hee wrote
the same Epistle to the Galathians from
Rome.</p>
            <p>Now in many other placees he comes

the condition of the world and the state
of the Church vnder <hi>Antichrist,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 1.</note> but of

thereof, euer deferring that honor to

rankes them) among the Iewes should
discharge their Apostleship; now it must
be of necessity that if <hi>Peter</hi> was head of
the Church, then hee was constituted
head both ouer Iew and Gentile, (vnles
they would say, that hee was but halfe
a head) but <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes and that by
their owne motiue and voluntary will,
that the Ghospell of the Gentiles was
committed to him and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and not
vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> how can we say then that he
was, or apoynted to bee, head of the
Church, seeing he was bound and tyed
by his owne faithfull promise, beside his
Commission, not to meddle with the
Gentiles in his Ministery, or was not
that an vnfirme head of the Church (if

Againe if <hi>Christ</hi> would haue <hi>Peter</hi> to

most dificult part, and of greater confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
because both that the benefit of
calling was not generally offered before

as also for the multitude and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there was farre
more Gentiles then Iewes, whom the

such as might make inexcusable, and
for this cause <hi>Peter</hi> not vnmindfull of
his charge, hee had contracted himselfe
vnto, as hee taught, with great liberty
and feruency among the Iewes, for
wheresoeuer he might haue occasion, as
<pb facs="tcp:28158:16"/>
wee see aboundantly in the Acts of the
Apostles, so likewise by writing an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
hee taught the Iewes,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 1.</note> Strangers
which dwelt heere and there through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,
and Bythinia, contayning himselfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
within the limits and bounds of

of the wordes of the prophesies

therefore cals it, the exalting and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

by the holy Spirit,<note place="margin">Act. 13. 46. 47.</note> not but that
it behooueth the word of God to bee

            <p>And to whom I pray you can we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and others,<note place="margin">Mar. 14. 66. 67. 68.</note> when hee is precisely chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
by <hi>Paul.</hi> Now would hee not
haue hid his Talent in the earth, but
that which was spoken to him in the

wee giue him more then either Christ

he requests them to feede the Lordes
flocke which is amongst them, taking
diligent heede thereunto, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
but willingly; not for filthy lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre,
but of a readie mind, not as though

affected Primacy in the Church, which
was farre from the mind of this Saint of

            <p>Likewise who will not esteeme it a

of the faithfull to be <hi>Peters</hi> mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and all things that appertaine and
<pb facs="tcp:28158:18"/>
belong to a spirituall body, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
by him to them, which must
be graunted, and that of most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
consequence followeth, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discend
<hi>Peter</hi> to be head of the church:
but this of <hi>Paul</hi> onely, in place of all
that might be brought in, is plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
who doth esteeme himselfe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
inferior to the highest Apostles,
here is no exception of <hi>Peter,</hi> or Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 16</note>
which <hi>Paul</hi> (such is his modestie)
wold haue don if <hi>Peter</hi> had bin superior.</p>
            <p>And who would not contend <hi>Paule</hi>
to be Head of the Church of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
rather then <hi>Peter:</hi> because it is
proued already he is appointed both by
Christ, as also with consent of those
which were thought to bee Pillars of
the Church, and in price had conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to be the Apostle of the Gentiles.
Now it is certaine, wee are not of the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> but of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> if there should
bee any of the Apostles Head of our
Church, it must therefore be <hi>Paul,</hi> who
did correct <hi>Peters</hi> error in <hi>Antiochia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 11.</note>

doth make <hi>Paul</hi> equal, but not superior.</p>
            <p>Besides this,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> was sent to Rome
by God, that he should testifie of Iesus
Christ, as he had done already in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
whom the Lord did encourage
to that effect: the which also by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
of God, sent to him by night, was
reiterate, saying; Feare not <hi>Paul,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth
thee to be presented to <hi>Caesar:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 27. 23. 24.</note>
And further,<note place="margin">Act. 28. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> was at Rome and
taught there two yeares, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
did thereby come to that perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 8.</note> that their Faith at that
time was spoken of in all the world.
Here is a speciall designation of <hi>Paul</hi> to
goe thither, whither we heare of none
to be formerly sent, appointed thereto
by two seuerall Mandates, tending to
one Scope, who did enter into Rome,
exercised the Office from morning till
euening, expounding the Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,<note place="margin">Act. 28. 31. 32. &amp;c.</note>
testifying and perswading of
the kingdome of God in Iesus Christ,
and made his aboad there during the
space aforesaid in a house hired for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb facs="tcp:28158:19"/>
and receiued all that came vnto
him, teaching with all boldnesse of
speech without let, what can bee more
craued in a good Bishop, then which we
find in <hi>Paul</hi> at Rome, but in all this time
there is no mention made neither by
<hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> neither Salutation sent
to him in any of all the Epistle <hi>Paule</hi>
sent to Rome, neither yet any remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
had of <hi>Peter</hi> in any of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
he sent from Rome; as that to the
<hi>Galathians, Ephesians, Philippians, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians,</hi>
the second to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to
<hi>Philemon,</hi> vnlesse their subscriptions be
faulty: No remembrance I say, neither
any word of Salutation which <hi>Paul</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not to omit, and that very largelie,
yea, and not to forget euen the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
men and women, so they be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of whatsoeuer degree. Now I pray
you, whether <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> hath best
right to claim the Superiority, or which
of these two shall wee adiudge to bee
Head of our Church (if either of them
be.) And by the way (Gentle Reader)
take a view, whether or not, <hi>Peter</hi> was
euer at Rome, at the least neuer in <hi>Pauls</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:28158:19"/>
daies, and if not then, hee neuer saw
Rome with his eyes, as shall be proued
(God willing) in our second Discourse.</p>
            <p>For the which cause <hi>Anthonius Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis
Legatus</hi> did say, it was not lawfull
for men to reade <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles: for I
know (saith he) by reading of them, men
may become <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and therefore
<hi>Ioh. Siluanus Atheseus.</hi> Pastor <hi>Herbipolis</hi>
confesseth, that the Papists doctrine was
false and Antichristian, and that he had
learned that out of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles: which
moueth <hi>Rhegius Gallicus Aristarchus,</hi>
when he had burnt 9. in Lyons for <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theranisme,</hi>
publikely to proclaim, That if
the holy Church had not receiued <hi>Pauls</hi>
Epistles, &amp; accounted them Canonique,
he would not repute them better or of
more credit then the Fables of <hi>Aesope.</hi>
And therfore are they named by them,

               <note place="margin">Alue. exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi. Part. 1. Chap. 1.</note>

in <hi>Forcham,</hi> a Citie in the Bishoprick of
<hi>Lamberg,</hi> in his Sermon, alledged <hi>Paul</hi>
to haue erred, and that the Sacrament
of the Supper should be receiued vnder
one kind only: And if it be not so, that
<pb facs="tcp:28158:20"/>
Sathan should take him away aliue from
out of his Pulpet, and so it happened to
the great feare of all the whole Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse;
as the History written by the said
<hi>Fincelius</hi> at length reports.</p>
            <p>And wee know the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is giuen by inspiration of God; and
is profitable, &amp;c. that the man of God
may bee perfectly instructed vnto euery
good worke. And that <hi>Timothy</hi> from
his childhood hath knowne the Holy
Scripture, which might make him wise
to Saluation: Now since they conteine
all things necessarie to bee beleeued,
and that to beleeue the holy Church v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall
is one point of our Faith,<note place="margin">Ephes. 22. &amp; 4, 15.</note> and
for that the militant Church here is one

heere by vs, and seeing the holy
Scripture directeth vs to no other head
then Iesus Christ, wherefore is it that
wee would bee wise aboue that which
is reuealed, yea rather foolishly enquire
for that which the Word of God hath
been silent in. And pursue after that
which cannot in any case become meet
to supply and minister the vertues and
<pb facs="tcp:28158:20"/>
duties requisite in him who should be
Head of the Church, and those neuer
were nor can happen in the person of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mortall. Yea <hi>Paul</hi> takes vpon him
to institute <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and prescribes vnto them,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> their
particular and seuerall duties,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note> yet hee
sends vs alwaies to another head, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Christ, and that which hee doth it is
not of any power he receiued of <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 1, 1.</note>
for this he markes purposely as neither
did <hi>Titus</hi> create Bishops in <hi>Creta</hi> by
any ordinance deriued from <hi>Peter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tim. 1. 1.</note> I
ioine hereto that <hi>Paul</hi> accompanied
with <hi>Barnabas</hi> passed through all the
Churches of Asia,<note place="margin">li. 7. 1. 11.</note> in which they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and there,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 23.</note> by the Suffrages of the
same,<note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> choosed Bishops and elected
them, and in a word <hi>Paul</hi> in that most

rendred to the Bishops of Asia, neuer
enioined them to submit themselues
neither to <hi>Peter</hi> nor any other whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
earthly wight head of the church.
And would hee obscure the same if it
had been commaunded him, or any
waies profitable vnto Saluation or quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:28158:21"/>
the estate of the Church, for hee
declared vnto them all the counsels of
God,<note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> yea and foretels them that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his departure there would gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
wolues rush in amongst them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
the flockes and that euen of
themselues should men arise speaking
peruerse things to draw Disciples after
them, as hereticks doe at all times, but
he neuer remembred <hi>Peter</hi> vnto them,
who should put order to this proud at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and hainous tyrannie in the
Church. If hee had been made Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to asswage the Furie and rage of
Tumults and Schismes: <hi>Paul</hi> would not
haue buried the same in the beds of

the order of Melchizedech leauing

To the which Priesthood in the New

<pb facs="tcp:28158:21"/>
hee was that was Author of the

of this matter at length, is mention
made any to succeed the same, for hee
had neither beginning nor ending of

Priest-hood to passe from man
to man, in <hi>Leui</hi> his posterity to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Messias who hath by his<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 11.</note>
owne blood entered in once into the

But his Kingdome and Regiment is not
of this world, for Christ tooke not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him to iudge and distribute of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and transitorie affaires, but hee by
his word and Sacraments, which are
the ordinary meanes to breed Faith,
and by the operation of his Holy
Spirit from aboue, doth effect the
whole purpose of mans Saluation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling
in mortall soules the immortall

seed of the Gospell of the Lord, by
whose power wee are kept through
Faith vnto Saluation, which is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to bee shewed in the last time.
And this is that precious Balme farre
aboue that of Gilead,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 4.</note> whereby Christ
the Head of his Church doth annoint
the hearts and cheere the mindes of
his own Elect with vnspeakable peace

            <p>It is now conuenient we heare what

Church was builded, hee must be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
and Head thereof: for so sayth
our Sauiour, Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note> and vpon
this Rocke will I build my Church.

               <hi>Answere.</hi> Albeit there might be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a Sillogisme in moode and figure,
as there cannot be, because there bee
foure tearmes (after the Schoole-men)
which cannot enter in a right Sillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme
(besides the construction in the
Greeke and Latine Tongues, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ouerthrowes the Argument

for there is not meant <hi>Peter,</hi> on
whome the Church should bee buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but vpon Christ (as with manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
auncient Doctors, <hi>August. Iohn,
Tract.</hi> 124.) Which Christ was that
Rocke which he confessed immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before to be the sonne of the liuing
God. So <hi>Lyranus in Gloss: marginali su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

<pb facs="tcp:28158:23"/>
these, <hi>Paule</hi> satisfieth vs when he sayth,
<hi>No man can lay any other foundation but
that which is layd, Iesus Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 11.</note> Then
<hi>Peter</hi> is not the ground: Which if it had
beene otherwise, beleeue we, that <hi>Paule</hi>
would be ignorant of it, or of purpose
denie so serious and earnest a matter.
Moreouer, if the Church was builded
vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> how was it, it did not fall
when <hi>Peter,</hi> at the voice of a Maid,
yea, and a long time thereafter, was
relapsed and reproued by <hi>Paule,</hi> as is
aforesaid, and whome Christ did vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
with the most vile name of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.
Will the Building stand firme and
stable after the Ground is sunke or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len?
or rather, is it not the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that vpholds and sustaines the whole
Fabrick? But that Church which Christ
promised to build vpon this Rocke,
could not fall: for so saith hee, The
Gates of Hell shall not preuaile against
her: She cannot therefore be founded
vpon such a tottering Mould as <hi>Peter</hi>
was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paule</hi> boasts of himselfe (and that
truely) that as a skilfull Master-Builder<note place="margin">1. Cor.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:28158:24"/>
he had layed the Foundation: and shall
wee thinke, that Christ, the Wisdome
of God,<note place="margin">Luc. 11. 49.</note> would build vpon the Sand
where the Winds beat and Waters rise,
and made it fall, and not vpon that
Stone, hewen out of the Mountaine
without hands: And shall the Masons
of <hi>Salomons</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 5. 17.</note> Church bee commended
for their Wisdome, that they should
haue brought-great Stones and costly
Stones to make the Foundation of that
materiall House, euen hewed Stones,
(which was figuratiue of Christ and
the Temple of his Bodie) and shall
wee not say, Loe heere is a greater
one then <hi>Salomon.</hi> The Fathers all
dranke of the Rocke that followed
them,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 4.</note> and the Rocke (saith <hi>Paule</hi>) is
Christ.</p>
            <p>And certainely no man,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 4, 5, 6</note> yea the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
cannot denie, but that there is one
Bodie, and one Spirit, one Lord, one
Faith one Baptisme, one Hope of our
Vocation, one God and Father of all;
and that this Church began in the
Creation with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> and
continued euer since in one Place or
<pb facs="tcp:28158:24"/>
other, Familie or Kingdome, sometimes
longer, sometimes shorter, sometimes
larger, sometimes narrower, and had
but one Ground, which now also, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospell, as by the Prophets
long since hath beene fore-told, the
Gentiles are ioyned thereto. But where
was this Foundation then? What was
the Ground that this Building leaned
to? For shame wee shall not say <hi>Peter</hi>
was borne then, vnlesse wee-should
make him as old as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi>
or then (I tremble to speake it) elder
then them both; for the Ground of the
House must be first layd before Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
be made. Surely, if wee will trust
<hi>Paule,</hi> he will explaine the matter, That
neither Iewes nor Gentiles, beleeuers,
are anie more Strangers and Forrainers,
but Citizens with the Saints,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 20.</note> and of
the Household of God, and are buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon the Foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apostles, Iesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
being that chiefe Corner Stone in
whome all the Building, coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
groweth vnto a holie Temple vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, in whome yee also (saith
<pb facs="tcp:28158:25"/>
hee to them of Ephesus) are built toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to be the habitation of God by
the Spirit. If any point of all this can
bee attributed iustly to <hi>Peter,</hi> hee is
blind that cannot see. I know the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
of the Truth will trust <hi>Peter</hi>
at least, who sends the Iewes disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vnto the consideration of another
Foundation. If hee had beene that
Ground that the Church should bee
built vpon, would hee not haue clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it himselfe? If so be (sayth hee)
you haue tasted how bountifull the
Lord is,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2, 4, 5, 6.</note> to whom you come as vnto a
liuing Stone, disallowed of men, but
chosen of God, and precious, and yee
as liuely Stones bee made a Spirituall
House, and a holy Priesthood, to offer
vp Spirituall Sacrifices, acceptable to
God by Iesus Christ. Wherefore it is
contained in the Scripture, Behold I
put in Sion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church, a chiefe
Corner stone, elect and precious, and
he that beleeueth therein, shall not be
ashamed. Vnto you therefore which
beleeue it is precious, but vnto them
which be disobedient, the stone which
<pb facs="tcp:28158:25"/>
the Builders disallowed, the same is
made the Head of the Corner, and a
Stone to stumble at, and a Rocke of
Offence, euen to them which stumble
at the Word, being disobedient: where
liuely, as it were in orient Colours,
hee paints out that Romane Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
and Antichrist. For seeing they
stumble in disobedience at the Word
of God both in Doctrine and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
dispensing with it, and substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
in place thereof Councels, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
Ceremonies. For this cause
they forge to themselues another then
the true Head of the Church, and
would haue a pretended Entrie and
Passage thereto by <hi>Peter,</hi> without any
Warrant or Approbation in the Word
of God, as shall bee at length, in his
owne place (God willing) euidently
proued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But (say they) to whom the Keyes of
the Kingdome of Heauen was giuen,
him had CHRIST appointed Head
of the Church:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 16. 19</note>

Secondly, it is answered, Christ

            <p>But to shut vp this matter, well

the Keyes withall. And what

            <p>And seeing Iesus our Sauiour did
commit the feeding,<note place="margin">Iohn 21. 15.</note> that is, the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of his sheepe and Lambes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> would hee not
<pb facs="tcp:28158:27"/>
haue him had one degree or other
of preferment among the Apostles and
aboue the people of the world for
such direction was not giuen to the
rest of the Disciples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answere.</hi> Hee that doth feede
the Lambes is not Lord but a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
for so hee saith, Feede my
Sheepe and not thine owne,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 5. 3.</note> yea and
<hi>Peter</hi> makes an opposition betwixt
<hi>Dominare in Clerum,</hi> to haue Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
ouer the Lords Inheritance,
and <hi>Pascere Oues,</hi> to Feed the sheepe.
<hi>Answere.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Peter</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to feede the Flocke, not that
hee should presume aboue the other
Fellow Apostles, <hi>sed vt Apostolico
muneri redderetur, vnde per fidei elapsum
&amp; Christi abnegationem excidit,</hi> saith
<hi>Augustine:</hi> Thirdly, it is answered,
for that hee specially directeth his
speech to <hi>Peter,</hi> if hee loued him,
and that three seuerall times, by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
ibidem. Christus rogauit Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum

<pb facs="tcp:28158:28"/>
linguae amore quam timore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiret.</hi>
For it was hee onely, among
the Apostles that so openly and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
denied his Master, as it was
foretold him, for the which cause
no demand was directed to the rest
of their loue towards CHRIST, &amp;c.
Fourthly it is answered to feed in the
Scripture by vsuall forme of speach, is
to teach and preach, &amp;c. As also <hi>Lyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
ibid.</hi> and <hi>Arias montanus</hi> do testifie,
with innumerabe others, and were not
the rest commanded to goe and teach
all Nations baptizing them? &amp;c. Or is
it because <hi>Peter</hi> was commanded to
feede, were the rest enioined to bee
idle, remisse and negligent? Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did not their sound passe through
the world, and as they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
were witnesses vnto Christ both
in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and in all <hi>Iudea,</hi> and in
<hi>Samaria,</hi> and vnto the vttermost parts
of the earth. Yea, did they not direct
their wholesome and sound Doctrine
both to Sheepe and Lambes. First,
both yong and old, Master and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
<pb facs="tcp:28158:28"/>
Husband and Wife as it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
aboundantly in their writings
and Epistles, yea both to Iew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils,
to those who are within, and
those who are without. And shall we
say therefore, that all they that did
feede were heads of the Church. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi>
of whom the Poets Fable had
not so many heads, but the Church
shall haue many more which is most
absurd, for they are all enioined to
passe about the Lords businesse, yea
and <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes that the cure of all
the Churches did hang vpon him. To
this effect saith <hi>Cyprianus, Lib. de Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate
Eccles. Pastores, sunt omnes sed
Grex vnus ostenditur, qui ab Apostolis
omnibus vnanimi consensu pascitur;</hi>
Wherefore if all the Apostles were
enioined to feede the Flock of Christ,
then was not <hi>Peter</hi> onely. And if hee
were commanded for the causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
specified so to doe, shall wee not
thinke, that Christ ascended on high
and led captiuitie captiue. And gaue
guifts vnto men, some to bee Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
<pb facs="tcp:28158:29"/>
and some Prophets,<note place="margin">Ephes.</note> and some
Euangelists, and some Pastors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
for the gathering together of
the Saints for the worke of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
and for the edification of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of Christ till wee all meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the vnitie of Faith, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Sonne of God vnto a
perfect man, and vnto the measure
of the age of the fulnesse of Christ,
Which charge the Holy Scripture eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
where, and Histories of all times
doe report. And suppose it were so that
to feede the flocke would import him
to bee Head of the Church, then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
I thus, <hi>Peter</hi> was appointed Head
of them whom hee was commanded
to feede, but no man will say, hee
was commanded to feede the rest of
the Apostles, <hi>(viz.)</hi> preach and teach
them their Gospell wherevnto they
were put a part and receiued by the
liuely voice of Iesus Christ, for vnto
them it was giuen to know the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of the Kingdome of Heauen. It
must needs follow therefore that hee
<pb facs="tcp:28158:29"/>
was not, at the least, head of the rest
of the Apostles, and so consequently
not head of the whole Church whereof
the Apostles were members. Yet say
they if <hi>Paul</hi> ascended to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to
<hi>Peter</hi> to conferre his Gospell with him,
and from him receiue authority for the
confirmation of his Apostleship,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 2. 3. 4. 5.</note> that he
should not tunne in vaine. Then it must
needs bee that <hi>Paul</hi> did acknowledge
<hi>Peter</hi> head of the Church. Answere,
<hi>Paul</hi> did not conferre with <hi>Peter</hi> onely,
but with <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> also which
were esteemed of price, and pillers of
the Church Second answere, <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
denyeth that he did receiue ought
of them, neither was inferior to them,
and truly if he had receiued confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his calling from them in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
he had beene inferior: And that
which is of more importance, if <hi>Paule</hi>
had acknowledged <hi>Peter</hi> for his Lord,
and Head of the Church, How was he
so bold I pray you, to withstand him to
his face; and so publiquely, in presence
both of Iewes and Gentiles vpbraid his
<pb facs="tcp:28158:30"/>
dissimulation,<note place="margin">Ibid. 11.</note> alleadging him to bee a
Rocke of offence to others, who were
brought into the like dissimulation. But
thou wilt demaund what mooued <hi>Paul</hi>
from <hi>Siria</hi> aud <hi>Silicia,</hi> and other farre
distant bouilds, wherein he had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Gospell amongst the Gentiles,
to take the second paines and trauaile
vppon him to passe to Ierusalem, if it
were not for the cause aforesaid. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.
Paul</hi> expresseth the cause him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
of his ascending to Ierusalem, was
to remooue and cut off that false ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
which was spread abroad by false
Apostles,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 4.</note> that hee taught otherwise
then the rest of the Apostles did: for
these false Brethren did conioyne <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and Leuiticall Ceremonies of the
Law, new Moones, Saboaths, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
&amp;c. with IESVS CHRIST and
Euangelicall Doctrine, as simply and
absolutely necessary vnto Saluation,
which <hi>Paul</hi> reiected to be done; yea,
taught,<note place="margin">Cal. 5. 2. 4.</note> that whosoeuer was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
was fallen from Grace, and that
by the workes of the Law, no flesh
<pb facs="tcp:28158:30"/>
should bee iustified, but by the Faith of
Iesus Christ, and not by the workes of
the Law.</p>
            <p>Thus then I reason, if <hi>Paul</hi> at that
time did ascend to receiue authoritie,
and confirmation to preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
then wee must graunt, that the
foureteene yeares proceeding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee had trauelled in the Euangell,
hee had openlie taught without any
warrant, which is manifest absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>And last of all, if <hi>Paul</hi> receiued any
authoritie of <hi>Peter</hi> to publish the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
how is it that <hi>Paul</hi> declares, he
was an Apostle not of men, neither
by man, but by Iesus Christ, and God
the Father which had raised him from
the dead. It rests therefore, that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was neuer ordained Head of the
Church: and that whatsoeuer the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
of the troth alledge for the
establishing of his Primacie and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie,
is friuolous, and cannot abide
the ballance of the Sanctuary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are too light. Wherefore,
<pb facs="tcp:28158:31"/>
also in that third time Christ acquaints
his Disciples with his Resurrection,
most liuelie speaking and inuiting <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
with the rest, to eate after his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
labour all the night,<note place="margin">Iohn 21. 3. 4.</note> he did
not euen then, as it were, lastly designe
him to such a Supreame place. And
also he left vnto him a Propheticall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
what death hee should dye,<note place="margin">Ibid. 18. 19.</note>
and would he not haue signified vnto
him of this his great Stile in the
Church. And this did <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe
very well remember, and prepares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
for such a departure; recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
