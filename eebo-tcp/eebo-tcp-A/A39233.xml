            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>He was too cunning for my shallow brain,</l>
            <l>I know not how, or where he laid his train,</l>

            <l>One night, and 'tis most true, night's still the Baud</l>

            <l>Fearless Heav'n knows, and when I came he had,</l>
            <l>For he is curious too, a Table clad</l>
            <l>With Linen white, as is the Mountain Snow,</l>
            <l>So clean as I complain'd they foul'd it so;</l>
            <l>For Fowl of every sort on this same cloth</l>

            <l>Some dabled in such sauces, as might make</l>
            <l>The heavyest Fowler swim such Fowl to take,</l>
            <l>And rather venture drowning in that Flood</l>
            <l>Then lose the Fowl that was so fat and good.</l>
            <l>There wanted not <hi>Anchovies</hi> and grand saliets,</l>

            <l>But then, before my Ears he would take up,</l>
            <l>This subtill man calls for a swelling Cup</l>
            <l>Of unctious wine, wine proud of its own wealth,</l>

            <l>As you may at one flight much glory gain;</l>
            <l>And thence he rais'd up to a lofty strain,</l>

            <l>Swears that you are the Mistres of all hearts,</l>

            <head>An Elogie on the Death of Love.</head>
            <l>I Never yet wrote Love-lines: Now a few</l>
            <l>Upon the Death of Love, me thinks, are due</l>
            <l>From every Pen. And most unskilfull I</l>
            <l>That would be doing want Ability.</l>
            <l>No Muse can I invoke unto my aid,</l>
            <l>They are all dumb, or suddenly afraid</l>
            <l>To touch this Subject. They'll not have it read</l>
            <l>In Crimson Characters that Love is dead.</l>
            <l>No Muse? What then? Turne over Historie,</l>
            <l>Or search the Poets; Try if they can be</l>
            <l>Assistant by example: Learn to move</l>
            <l>In their high strains. <hi>Ovid</hi> wrote much of Love,</l>
            <l>But not his Death. His Art of Love was light,</l>
            <l>And in the Elogies that he did write</l>
            <l>He could not frame perfection of that Ruth,</l>
            <l>Which here is laid before us in a Truth.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:108564:51"/>Nor had <hi>Euripides</hi> in all his pack</l>
            <l>A Theam so' Tragick, or a Scean so black</l>
            <l>As is the Death of Love. Stay. Speak no more,</l>
            <l>Nor study for expressions to deplore</l>
            <l>The losse of him. The sense of these two words</l>
            <l>Love's dead enough of Argument affords</l>
            <l>To melt dry eyes to Tears; and hearts of stones</l>

            <l>Their heads are made of rush; their tongues be made of say,</l>
            <l>Their love is of silk changeable, that lasteth not a day:</l>
            <l>Their wit Mochado is, of durance is their hate,</l>
            <l>The food they feed on most is carp, their gaming is Check-mate;</l>
            <l>Of fustian their discourse, their zeal is made of freez,</l>
            <l>And they, that one their Favours wayt, do get most when they leez:</l>
            <l>Their glory comes from sattin, their vanity from feather;</l>
            <l>Their beauty is, stand farther of, their conscience is but leather:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:108564:61"/>Their humour watry chamlet, but canvas fits them best,</l>
            <l>Perpetuum is their folly, their earnest is but Jest:</l>
            <l>Their love is life in Idleness, their doings are their Pleasure,</l>
            <l>They lawless are, yet all they weare, they buy by standing measure.</l>
            <l>Their foreparts are of rue, their hinder parts of docks,</l>
            <l>Their heads of hardest brasse be made, their hearts be made of box;</l>
            <l>Or if in plainer terms they will with all be dealt,</l>

            <l>If still you look like one of us or no:</l>
            <l>Is not your former pleasing form off stript</l>
            <l>Since when your Worship was arch-deaconship't?</l>
            <l>Quakes not your head-piece with ingotten winde,</l>
            <l>Or swells and burst your night-caps all behind?</l>
            <l>Or are you to the Velvet day-caps come</l>
            <l>As fits Episcopabilissimum?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:108564:63"/>Rise not your browes in billows, apt to drowne</l>
            <l>Poor Tom beneath, with an impetuous frowne.</l>
            <l>Burn your disdainfull eys, or sweetly move</l>
            <l>(As earst) and gently shine on those you love?</l>
            <l>Is not your nose suspended or awrie,</l>
            <l>And since t'was archt, exalts it self on high?</l>
            <l>Blesse me! what daintie proper men of late</l>
            <l>By wealths convulsion, or a pang of state</l>
            <l>Have I seen chang'd (as once by Circe's cup.)</l>
            <l>And to a be astlie figure quite run up.</l>
            <l>Poor Cambridge Snakes that use to creep and lick</l>
            <l>The bubling spume of my then <hi>Rhetorique,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And cling in amarous folds my verse to hear,</l>
            <l>Verse that at once could please, and keep in fear;</l>
            <l>Now fierie flying dragon doctors are</l>
            <l>That warm'd with Prebends and fat steeples dare</l>
            <l>Both hisse and sting: For me, t'is state enough</l>
            <l>To hisse, or creep in their forgoten slough</l>
            <l>Practice and contemplations, I agree</l>
            <l>Should rise; let that a Banging <hi>B B</hi> be</l>
            <l>Whiles this shines West: yet may no crime attaint</l>
            <l>The first; but like the second, live a saint,</l>
            <l>Alas! the churches tayle is lost in drinke,</l>
            <l>While Pot and Pipe are made their pen, and ink,</l>
            <l>And if the Jowle in pride be pickled too</l>
            <l>What shall the sides, the bulk, the bodie do.</l>
            <l>Curates leave ale: leave Prelates ease and pride,</l>
            <l>Or learn'd and Lay the Clergie will deride.</l>
            <l>God knowes those blemishes on foot and face</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:108564:64"/>Do need the healthfull spirit of his grace.</l>
            <l>And you my Learned friend, though past the rore</l>

            <l>I am so press'd with Lords and Ladies both</l>
            <l>That I can do you now no further grace</l>
            <l>Then the reversion of the ninetenth place.</l>
            <l>Nine years I have expected, (and am loth</l>
            <l>To name him yet) a mounting <hi>B B S</hi> oath.</l>
            <l>But if I live to write his <hi>Epitaph</hi>

            <l>It shall so weep, that all that read, shall laugh.</l>
            <l>You cannot so decieve. Then onward march</l>
