            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OVR owne Anſwer to all that are ſingle-eyed, is a plaine evidence and manifeſtation againſt your ſelfe, for denying the reality, and making an Allegory of the Divine and Humane nature of the Meſſiah, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of all men, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the King of glory, and Lord of his people; and alſo in every other particular concerning his humiliation and exaltation, thereby deſtroying the truth both of the Doctrine of Regeneration &amp; Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the aſſured hope of his Saints at his appearance and Kingdome, under your dark and obſcure Expreſſions, never meant nor ſent from God, but form'd and fram'd by the ſpirit of deluſion, ſo that the children of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may condemn you by your own words: Yet leſt the purity of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſalvation, wiſdome, and counſell of God ſhould any way ſuffer through your ſophiſmes, or receive diſhonour by your cunning ſubtleties in behalfe of it, and the Lord thereof, I that am the meaneſt of all his ſervants, thus make my defence againſt you as followeth.</p>
            <p>And firſt for your cenſuring me for paſſionate reproaches, and bitter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions under the terms of fancies, conceits, falſe allegories, deluſions and olde Germane Errours, This you ſay is my language, which in ſaying ſo, if I ſpeak truly, then I am not to be blamed, but rather juſtified, being therein warranted both by precept and preſident in holy Scripture, which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to reprove ſuch ſharply. And alſo ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer ſinne upon thy brother, but thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke him,</hi> Luk. 19. 17. And all to this end, <hi>that they may be kept and found in the faith,</hi> Tit. 1. 13. <hi>And woe be to them that juſtifie the wicked, and condemn the righteous, that put darkneſſe for light, and light for darkneſſe, that call bitter ſweet, and ſweet bitter:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that wee ought to ſay (that thoſe that ſpeak not Gods Word unto the people) they ſpeak their owne fancies: And ſuch as are given up to ſtrong deluſions, ought to be called deluders, or lyers; and the bad, or evill Tree ought not to be called a good Tree, nor the Bramble the Vine; but the truth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165582:2"/>
ought to be ſpoken of all: And the expreſſions thereof ought not to be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſſion or bitterneſſe. And that I have ſpoke truly in what I have ſpoke againſt you, a briefe examination of the particulars will manifeſtly declare: And it will not ſerve your turne in the Tryall, to ſay, I am in a low Diſpenſation; but when I come higher, in the which you are in, then I ſhall be of your mind, wherefore I proceed not in the Letter alone, which is the corps of the Scriptures, but therewithall the meaning, the ſolue, the life, the light of truth, and power of the Spirit of God that doth accompany the Letter.</p>
            <p>And firſt, for thoſe faire words, and ſmooth expreſſions from your ſelfe, it is the way that Sathan hath, and will uſe to deceive with from the firſt that was made, to the laſt that ſhall be born. And the Apoſtles jealouſie of the faithfull makes him to ſay, <hi>I feare, leſt by any meanes, as the Serpent beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his ſubtlety, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 3. <hi>And this I ſay</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>leſt any man ſhould beguile you with enticing words,</hi> Col. 2. 4. <hi>For the preſumptuous and ſelfe-willed beguile unſtable ſoules,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 14. <hi>And there are ſome, that by good words and fair ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches deceive the hearts of the ſimple,</hi> Rom. 16. 19.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Page of your Paper you ſpeak of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme, &amp; Chriſts Baptiſme, and of the offices and gifts which <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt had received; and that you apprehend them all to be types and figures of that glory revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in us, which glory in us you make the eſtate of the Juſt and perfect man glorified here before the diſſolution of the body.</p>
            <p>Sir, I pray take notice how you expreſſe and declare your ſelfe ignorant of the Principles and Beginnings of Jeſus Chriſt; as alſo of the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perfection of a true Chriſtian indeed. Therefore be it known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme was not water in a literal, but in a ſpiritual ſenſe, the worke of repentance unto life was his baptiſme, and externall waſhing with materiall water was a ſigne of his adminiſtration of that heavenly grace of repentance. <hi>He ſhall come</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>in the ſpirit and power of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> Mal. 3. <hi>And he ſhall turn the hearts of the children to their Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The diſobedient to the wiſdome of the juſt.</hi> His baptiſme ſaith St. <hi>Luke,</hi> Chap. 3. is the baptiſme of repentance, as it is written in the Book of the words of <hi>Iſaias</hi> the Prophet; <hi>The voyce of one crying in the Wilderneſſe, prepare yee the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight;</hi> which Scriptures declare not only the name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his Baptiſme, but the heavenly nature, operation, and vertue thereof, even to turne, prepare, bruiſe, ſoften and break the hearts of ſinners.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe as our Lords Baptiſm is of a more higher and excellent degree of the work of Gods Spirit; the Scriptures alſo ſets it ſorth in ſuch tearms as expreſſeth the more excellent nature and operation thereof, as comforting exceeds mourning, healing brokenneſſe, liberty captivity, ſatisfaction want, and the truth of purity and holineſſe the preparation thereunto, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all riches that of ſpirituall poverty, and therefore it is that our Lord himſelf ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, And he hath anointed me to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell to the poore, which is, to heale the broken-hearted, to deliver the captivated, &amp; to give ſight to them that are ſpiritually blinde.</hi> And this word ſpeaking peace by Jeſus Chriſt began after the Baptiſme that <hi>Iohn</hi> preached, and there is great
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165582:2"/>
reaſon for it; for freedome and deliverance follows bondage and thraldome, as curing and healing doth the member that is wounded and broken.</p>
            <p>And by theſe two heavenly Baptiſmes and ſpirituall Operations, a ſinner is begotten to God, and made a Saint: And as by our fleſhly birth wee came to have a naturall being and ſubſiſtance; ſo by this heavenly birth of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiſſion of ſinnes, Gods children come to have a holy and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall being and ſubſiſtance, in which holy righteous children &amp; Saints God dwels by his Spirit, and endows them with gifts &amp; graces of the holy Ghoſt, which are not figures and ſhadows (as you term them) nor things to be done away, but are reall for ſubſtance, and durable for continuance: And as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> ſo are all theſe regenerate Prieſts of an endleſſe life, and the gifts and graces of Gods Spirit in them remain and continue to be Gods Witneſſes, teſtifying for God in the earth, as it is written, <hi>There are three that beare record in earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood,</hi> Joh. 5. 8. And thoſe that by theſe are ſpiritually born, begotten, and brought forth of God, are the little ones that Chriſt bleſſeth, the humble ones that Chriſt teacheth, the wiſe ones that only and truly underſtand; for unto thoſe onely it is given to know the ſecrets and myſteries of God.</p>
            <p>This new born man is the righteous and juſt man, the bleſſed &amp; holy man and becomes thus righteous &amp; juſt, not by any inherent righteouſneſs which is originally within him as you ſay, and is to be raiſed, for you affirm it dead in every man; And when riſen, then the fleſh is deſtroyed, and the new man quickned.</p>
            <p>But the righteouſneſſe of the truly righteous is by imputation of anothers righteouſneſſe from without him; <hi>For as by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one</hi> (mark what the truth ſaith, not of our ſelves) <hi>ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> And as <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full was not made righteous by his own righteouſneſs, but by the imputation of anothers righteouſneſſe: Now it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed if we believe on him, that is, <hi>on Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 4. 23. 24. And of the juſtified ones it is ſaid, <hi>their righteouſneſſe is of me ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 54. 17.</p>
            <p>Now obſerve, it is a meer tale or fable for any to ſay, that a man becomes a righteous man by having the righteouſneſſe within him as hee is borne into the world: And ſo although he liveth, yet that is dead, and to be quickned, aſleep, and to be awakened, and that Chriſt the anointing is in all men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concealed under the aſhes of corruption, or kindled into a flame of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion; this Doctrine is ſottiſhneſſe to heavenly wiſdome, and nonſence to true Divinity.</p>
            <p>For thus ſaith the Truth, <hi>That which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh, &amp; that which is born of the Syirit is Spirit:</hi> The ode birth is from below of the earth, earthly, the other is through the Lord from above, ſpiritually and heavenly, as it is written, <hi>Except a man be born again from above, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God.</hi> Now ſuch ſpirituall men were <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Nathanael,</hi> and all the faithfull A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Saints, to whom fleſh and blood was not their Teacher and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer, but Almighty God himſelfe, and theſe heavenly perls of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the gifts of the holy Ghoſt; their ſpirituall anointings were not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165582:3"/>
and ſhadows to ceaſe and paſſe away, but the very immortall Word, Councell, Spirit, and Covenant of God that abideth and continueth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, againſt which the gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile; contrary to which in <hi>Page</hi> 5. you affirm in theſe words, I do not mean that outward Ceremony of water, but alſo the baptiſme of the holy Ghoſt and gifts to be figurative and typicall. Yet in another place, <hi>Page</hi> the 2. you are pleaſed to ſay thus to me; but if you ſay that thoſe Offices and gifts which were given to the Apoſtles, continue ſtill, and were not figurative; Then ſhew me ſay you that power of viſible glory held forth in theſe that now doe diſpenſe, as in them heretofore.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, If I have manifeſtly declared and deſcribed the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous plant, the good Tree and the holy Temple, then they that are ſpirituall may diſcern the fruits, with the power, the light, and glory thereof; for this good Tree is not barren, but exceeding fruitfull, and this ſpirituall Houſe, Temple, &amp; Spouſe all glorious within: Now in the time of her Lords per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall abſence, who, when he comes to be perſonally preſent, ſhe with him, and he with her, ſhall be wonderfully revealed and manifeſted with power &amp; great glory, cloathed viſibly with it, even before all their enemies that will not now acknowledge it, but declare againſt it, as your ſelfe hath done, and many others, that have thanks for it of them that ſhould have reproved them, for was there ever ſuch blaſphemy witneſſed and teſtified too, as is under your own hand, in <hi>denying the Lord that bought you;</hi> For you boldly affirme in Page 6. though wofully and impudently, That the Incarnation of Chriſt, his death, reſurrection, and interceſſion, and what ever elſe is ſpoken of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that he was circumciſed, baptized, crucified, dead, &amp; bured, riſen, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended; All theſe expreſſions and removes ſay you, I looke upon to be no more but as types and figures, holding forth that whole myſtery of Truth which ſhall be made out and finiſhed in us by times and degrees, and in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meaſures; which when it is accompliſhed in us, will be the end of all things. And further you ſay, this is that generall Reſurrection and great day of the Lord, and the world to come, and this is all fulfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>led in us before this vaile of fleſh be laid down.</p>
            <p>Theſe are your own words, wherein you affirme nere as many blaſphemies as you have written words; for here you make Chriſt himſelfe to be a Type and Figure, as before you made the gifts of the Spirit which hee gave to his Apoſtles, for you deny Chriſt to be reall and perſonall, and affirm him to be a Quality, an Unction of your own deviſing; And that there is no reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body out of the earth; nor no day of judgment, nor no world to come, then what you have imagined and fancied in your own conceit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and contrary to Gods word. And becauſe you will not be tryed by that rule of Truth, you bluſh not to ſay in <hi>page</hi> 5. That the fountain of truth doth not fix or confine you ſo to any expreſſions, as that you ſhould not expreſs or declare any thing but what is according to Scriptures tying you to thoſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten words; no ſay you.</p>
            <p>Oh Sir, look and conſider how you exalt your ſelf above all that are called God, above Chriſt, above his Word, as I told you before in my Anſw. Your Doctor <hi>H.

of the world to this day; but it cannot be otherwiſe, becauſe you refuſe the counſell that teacheth the truth to the Law and to the Teſtimony: If this be not in you, it is becauſe there is no light in you; And that it may be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted there is no light in you, do but take a ſhort and briefe view of your own darkneſſe, ignorance, and groſſe contradictions in your Reply, as you call it. For in <hi>page</hi> 5. You affirm that I miſtake you in ſaying you make <hi>Elias</hi> and the Meſſenger of the Covenant one &amp; the ſame: And yet as with the ſame breath you preſently affirm, that the Meſſenger of the Covenant which was Chriſt, is that <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, even Chriſt that unction of Truth in us; ſee from your own mouth the effect of your owne darkneſſe in leaving and ſlighting of Gods Word, and the light thereof, which ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. That <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt was Elias that was to come.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> makes the Lord Chriſt to be the Meſſenger of the Covenant, and the Baptiſt to be the Lords Meſſenger, to prepare his way before him, by preaching repentance, as before is touched: And he tels you plainly himſelfe you ſpeak falſely of him, <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 1. 20. I am not the Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, meaning Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Covenant; and the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> his witneſſe is againſt you alſo, <hi>Iohn 1. 8. He was not that light, but was ſent to bear witneſſe of that light</hi> (ſaith he) Is it not now clear that that higher diſpenſation you ſpeake of is very groſſe dark ignorance and contradiction that you are fallen into.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Royle,</hi> as in this you have no weapon left for your defence, ſo your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe will alſo appear in the reſt that is to follow. I pray Sir why did you not reply particularly to the Scriptures I brought to prove the Reſurrection of the body; wherefore I entreat you again to conſider of one or two Texts more, in <hi>John</hi> 5. 28, 29. Our Lord affirms plainly, uſing no parrable or alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, <hi>That all that are in the graves ſhall heare his voyce, and ſhall come forth.</hi> Mark this expreſſion; It is not ſaid they ſhall be raiſed in us, but they ſhall come forth of their graves, <hi>they that have done good to the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evill, to the reſurrection of condemnation.</hi> Now but that you ſay that in your diſpenſation you are not bound to accord with the Scripture, this teſtimony would confute your Errour, for all the generall Reſurrection you ſpeak of in your Reply is this; Chriſt being raiſed in us, the miſtery of Truth finiſhed in us, <hi>page</hi> 6. before the putting off of this vaile of fleſh, when Gods word plainely makes the generall reſurrection to be the raiſing of all mens bodies out of their graves where they are buried, the good to ſalvation, the evill to damnation. Conſider, Mr. <hi>Royle,</hi> how you have declared and proved your ſelfe a faithleſſe &amp; hopefull man; for all that have hope towards God believe, and allow that there ſhall be a reſurrection from the dead both of the juſt and unjuſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 15. And here ſee and obſerve what a diſcord there is between your ſpirit and the Spirit of God in the Scriptures, even by your own words, teſtifying againſt you. And look again on your Paper how you reply to my Anſwer againſt your ignorant poſition, that the comming of Chriſt to judgement is his ſpirituall appearance in men.</p>
            <p>For this you affirme in <hi>Page</hi> 4. That it is clear that Chriſts comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine is fulfilled in ſending, giving, or powring out his Spirit into men.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165582:4"/>
See againe how you in your high Diſpenſation are directly oppoſite to Chriſt and the Apoſtles holy Doctrine; for all Scriptures are not ſpoken to the weakeneſſe of Creatures as you ſay, but to the comfort and joy of the Saints, that they through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. And the Scriptures doe not ſay he ſhall come in us as you ſay, but to us; I will come againe ſaith our Lord, that is, to be with his in bodily preſence, as he was with them before he went from them when he aſcended from his Apoſtles, he went not out from within them, but aſcended from their company, ſo doth the two men cloathed in white Apparel aſſure the Apoſtles, <hi>this ſame Jeſus</hi> (ſay they) <hi>which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as you have ſeen him goe into heaven.</hi> Now was not the manner a perſonall aſcention from amongſt them, and ſo ſhall the manner of his comming in the Clouds be againe perſonally into their company, ſo that it cannot be as you ſay in a figure of fleſhly appearance, but really in his glorified body. <hi>Behold he commeth with clouds</hi> (ſaith the Spirit) <hi>and every eye ſhall ſee him:</hi> That is, all men ſhall ſee the perſon of the Son of Man <hi>comming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</hi> Obſerve again, it is not ſaid he comes into men, but he comes from heaven unto men, in ſuch great eminent and perſonall glory that every eye ſhall behold: And his appearance ſhall be to to the looked for, and much deſired joy of his Saints, but to the ſhame and confuſion of his Enemies, and ſuch as be lye him: And take heed now you do not ſmother this clear light of Chriſts perſonall appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with the ſmoak of your expreſſion; <hi>You are skilfull in the letter,</hi> for let me tell you plainly, that whoſoever makes his ſpirituall ſenſe wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the letter of the Scriptures, renders himſelfe both truthleſſe and ſenſeleſſe for ſuch an one hath none to bear witneſſe with him: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever bears witneſſe of himſelfe, <hi>his witneſſe is not true.</hi>

            <p>Wherefore once againe I beeſeech you conſider further ſeriouſly what is written of this great and glorious truth in theſe 7. particulars. 1. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that commeth. 2. The time of his comming. 3. The manner of his comming. 4. The parties that pray for, and deſire his comming. 5. The company that attends him in his comming. 6. The end &amp; effect of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: and 7. The place to which he commeth; In every which particular, your conceit of his comming into men by ſpirituall appearances, will be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly confuted and overthrown.

               </gap>ſt for the perſon that commeth: And mark this, it is a perſon, &amp; not a quality, and ſuch a humane perſon as there was never the like, for he is the ſonne of a Virgin; And although ſhee his mother, a ſinfull woman of her ſelfe; yet he that tooke fleſh of her without ſinne, the ſon of ſinfull man, &amp; yet be no ſinner: <hi>Behold a wonder, yea a wonderfull perſon, yea ſuch a perſon as is the Captain of our ſalvation, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of our ſoules, the Apoſtle of our profeſſion:</hi> He is called the High Prieſt, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Mediator, yea the only Mediatour between God and man; the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the greateſt perſonage for Majeſtie that ever was, or ſhall be: And yet the ſame perſon in his power, glory, &amp; reign, as in his contempt and ſuffering only now glorified, and not before.</p>
            <p>2. His comming again ſhall not be till the end of this World, when there ſhall be an end of ſinning, an end of dying, an end of labouring, and an end
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:165582:4"/>
of the Curſe: an end of ſorrowing, ſuffering, weeping, and of hungring and thirſting, not in a feigned conceit, but really, as it was in the eſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency before any of theſe things had their being and beginning.</p>
            <p>3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The manner of his comming ſhall be glorious in a two fold reſpect, Amiable to his Saints and ſervants, but terrible to his Adverſaries and Enemies, as it is written; <hi>The Lord himſelfe ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voyce of the Arch-Angell, and with the Trump of God,</hi> to the joy, admiration, and ſalvation of his Saints: And on the contrary, his comming ſhall be terrible to the wicked and diſobedient; A day of wrath, indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, miſery and calamity, darkeneſſe and confuſion; his comming to ſuch ſhall be in flaming fire, rendring vengeance; Yet at the ſame time to his Saints a heeler, a deliverer, a reſtorer, yea amiable and glorious as the light, ſhining as the Sunne, and glittering as the perfection of all the precious and excellent things that can he thought or ſpoke of.</p>
            <p>4. The parties that pray for, and deſire his comming, declare it to be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and apparent, his own perſonall preſence, and not miſterious and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: The earneſt deſire of the Saints is, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> always prayed for, hoped for, longed for; to which time they have referred the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all their Wrongs, the clearing of all their Cauſes, the enjoyment of all their Comforts, to which time the Lord hath referred them. Then ſaith he, <hi>Lift up your heads, for your redemption draws nigh:</hi> and in which time the Apoſtle hath aſſured them deliverance, <hi>For he that ſhall come, will come, &amp; will not tarry:</hi> And it is their Saviour that ſaith, <hi>Behold I come quickly, and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. His company that attends him are beyond all compariſon for number and nature, for quantity and quality, all the holy Angels, all the holy Saints, their vertue and quality is holineſſe and gloriouſneſſe, their number innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, all, all, for Angels and Saints, thouſand-thouſands miniſter unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtand before him, even ſo many, as they are beyond all, and it is the company that attends this great and mighty Lord, a multitude ſaith the Spirit, <hi>which no man can number, of all Nations, &amp; Kindreds, and People, add Tongues;</hi> all the Iſrael &amp; choſen of God are then to attend him perſonally in their glorified bodies and ſouls.</p>
            <p>The 6 thing conſiderable is the end of his coming, and that is to affect &amp; accompliſh perfection, to reſtore all things to be glorified in his Saints, and with his Saints, to be admired of all that believe, and to be dreaded and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all his Enemies, ruling the one with a Scepter of gold, and the other with a rod of Iron; then ſhall he be crowned and enthroned for evermore, his Kingdome ſet up that ſhall have no end; his power ſo greatly declared, that all his Enemies ſhall be ſubdued: He will then make his, and the Saints Adverſaries to acknowledg and honour him and them for ever; For this Kingdome that the Lord of Heaven ſhall ſet up, ſhall break to pieces, and ſubdue all other Kingdomes: It ſhall thraſh the Nations, and beate downe the mountains, advancing the City and mountain of God over and above all Powers, Authorities, Dignities, and Eſtates whatſoever, as it is written; <hi>At the name of Jeſus ſhall every knee how, both of things in heaven, things on earth, and things under te earth;</hi> That is, to the power and authority of this King
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:165582:5"/>
King and Kingdom, which by name is ſignified; then ſhall all other Kings and Nations in the whole world be ſubjected, which will be more cleared in the next.</p>
            <p>The 7. and laſt particular, is the place whether he comes, and that is to the earth, he ſhall ſtand, or have rule and authority the laſt upon the earth, which ſhall be the pla<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of his Royalty and Dominion, even the everlaſting inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Saints. <hi>His dominion</hi> (ſaith the Spirit) <hi>ſhall be from Sea to Sea:</hi> And the meek (that is, the children of God, the bleſſed ones) they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the earth with him; For he hath redeemed them out of every Tongue, People, and Nation, <hi>and they ſhall reigne on the earth:</hi> But the Heavens and Earth that are now, ſhall be purged, &amp; made all new &amp; holy, where nothing ſhall dwell then but righteouſneſſe: And not only the Saints, but the whole Creation ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty of the Sonnes of God: Then ſhall Chriſt the Lord give the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to the Heirs apparent; for <hi>Abraham</hi> is not onely the heire of the world, but all the children of the Promiſe, that are of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are joynt-heirs with him. Now all their excellent honours and priviledges as they are in this life inward, and enjoyned by faith and hope, are the earneſt penny of the whole perfection: So then after the Reſurrection, the things that are now believed and hoped for, ſhall be then preſent in the enjoyment for ever, and then faith and hope ſhall ceaſe and come to an end: And this everlaſting ſalvation ſhall not onely be within them, in the perfection of them, but externally upon them alſo. For all the Righteous ſhall be cloathed with a glorious heavenly cloathing: They ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the Firmament, &amp; as the ſtars for ever &amp; ever, and the whole wicked world ſhall be judged by them, ſeeing, knowing, and acknowledging them honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God for ever, whom they in their life-time did ſcorn, perſecute, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and contemn: And they lifting up their heads, out of their pains and torments, ſhall fall down and worſhip them, and in honour of them lick the duſt of their ſeet, and ſhall ſay one to another <hi>Are not theſe they that wee fooles in our life-time, hated &amp; had in a proverb of reproach; but now how doe wee ſee them honoured, &amp; our ſelves juſtly condemned:</hi> In which condemnation they ſhal be for ever chained and tormented world without end. <hi>Now</hi> as Jannes <hi>and</hi> Jambres <hi>withſtood Moſes,</hi> ſo in your Writings you have withſtood Jeſus; <hi>but as their folly was manifeſted to all men, ſo ſhall alſo yours be:</hi> Wherefore Maſter <hi>Royle</hi> I pray you to repent, that you may eſcape this damnation to come, who am your Friend,</p>
