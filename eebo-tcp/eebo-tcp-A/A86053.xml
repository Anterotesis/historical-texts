         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E that miniſtred theſe enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes to us, did withall ſow his life; and in teſtimony thereof, when he had finiſhed this Miniſtration, took his leave of us, calling upon thee and me to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him: And if his life ſpring up in us, it will carry us whither he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually making, Even without the Camp.</p>
            <p>It was not the leaſt of his ſervices to dye for the flock, which he did daily, therein following the great ſhepherd.</p>
            <p>Now a Box of precious Oyntment is broken, Oh that the whole houſe of God on earth may be filled with the ſavor of it!</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118351:3"/>He was wont to ſay of every thing he ſaid or did, how good, righteous, and excellent ſoever, and refreſhing to others, <hi>This is but a vail upon the Lord:</hi> God conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and anſwered him in the deſire of his heart, and hath rent the vail for him.</p>
            <p>A witneſs is gone, but his Teſtimony remains, and ſhall remain, while the Sun and Moon endure. If theſe Records ſhould be deſtroyed, yet the truth therein ſhall be preſerved in the living Records of the breaſts of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, and ſhall there grow up and be purified, until the Lord come and bring this Author and all his Saints with him, <hi>Zach. 14. 5. Even ſo make haſte, and come Lord Jeſus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now let not any man think theſe Sermons were preached, or are now publiſhed to enrich the world with notions: They are to make us poor in ſpirit; to ſlay ye, to undo ye: he that loves his life, let him not come here: They are to pull down the fleſh, and abaſe the glory of man, but to lift up the Lord: If he be your life, here you may hear of him.</p>
            <p>There is in the world a great deal of light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, falſly ſo called. Men are very rich in their ſeveral Adminiſtrations: hence that unbrotherly walking one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, and yet they talk of peace and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but it is but talk: Ye will never meet with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for either, until ye dye.</p>
            <p>Come, and in the grave of Chriſt let us reaſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and be one. There is no parling with men, till the Cool of the day, till the Sun of their imaginary glory be declining.</p>
            <p>It is this grave makes all even: there rich and poor, maſter and ſervant lie down together, and are at reſt. There
<pb facs="tcp:118351:3"/>
the brother of low degree is exalted, and the rich is made low.</p>
            <p>They are enemies to peace, that are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt. Whoſoever ſets up any excellency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Chriſt himſelf, ſets up an Occaſion of ſtrife and enmity, a partition-wall. The Croſs of Chriſt took away that diſtance between the Jews and the Gentiles: and tis the preaching of the Croſs, and the knowing of Chriſt crucified experimentally, takes it away through all ages. And it is in vain to ſend Embaſſies of peace to men, while their ſtrength is firm in them: Why then are ye offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Preachers of the Croſs?</p>
            <p>But be it known to ye, ye that live, and will not dye, ye are dead while ye live. <hi>To be carnally minded is death;</hi> or which is worſe, your life is a continual torment to you.</p>
            <p>And be it known to you, there is ſtrength in the grave. The weakneſs of God is ſtronger then Men: if ye will build for continuance, ye muſt reſolve to lay your foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in confuſion. <hi>He layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters.</hi> That building that ſhall ſtand for ever, muſt riſe up wholly, purely, out of God himſelf and his Spirit.</p>
            <p>But to you that are dead with Chriſt, and whoſe life is buried under the foundations of this world, and its fleſhly frames, Behold I bring you glad tidings; all things are diſſolving, the heavens are paſſing away with a great noiſe (as it is ſaid they ſhould) the elements are melting with the fervent heat of the Day of the Spirit, and the earth with all the works of men are burning up by the ſame fire: Lift up your heads, your Redemption draws nigh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118351:4"/>Friends, I have not of a long time had any power to go forth in this kinde: I mean, to open any thing; Therefore accept the willingneſs of my minde to have done ſome thing by way of Preface: and do ye make the ſupply by being the Epiſtle of Chriſt, whereby ye ſhall ſhew the beſt reſpect to the labour and travel of him that is gone: And let all expreſſions that are here left dark and homely (through my deficiency to whom chiefly the inſpection of the Copies was committed) be corrected in the pure ſpringings up of the living Truth in your hearts.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is time for us to be looking out of this world which grows old, and is ready to vaniſh away; God is by the brightneſs of his own diſcoveries, burning up the works thereof, and ſtabliſhing that new heavens, &amp; new earth where righteouſneſs dwells; the creation hath ſent up ſtrong groans, and hath long lien under bondage; the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof now draws nigh.</p>
            <p>We are the children of the laſt times, and upon us are the ends of the world come; Propheſies, and Promiſes, which have been bid from ages and generations, are now enriching us by their revealing, and fulfilling in us: <hi>Ariſe and ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 50. 1.</note> 
               <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, the Mountain of the Lords houſe ſhal be ſet up above the Mountains, &amp; exalted above the hills.</hi> Now begins to be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, <hi>Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and</hi>

               <hi>he will dwell with them, and they ſhal be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them and be their God,</hi> Rev. 21. 3.</p>
            <p>The Church hath long lien among the pots: God is giving her the wings of a Dove covered with ſilver, and her feathers of yellow gold: ſhe hath been conformed to Chriſt in his death, and hath lain with him in the grave: ſhe that hath thus deſcended, muſt alſo aſcend: ſhe that hath ſuffered muſt reign; ſince the myſtery of iniquity began firſt to work, it hath wrought moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually and prevailed: men and their traditions have been the unqueſtioned authority; the light and teaching of the ſpirit in the Scriptures, hath been forgotten, and ſtood like a Sparrow upon the houſe top, deſolate and forſaken: we have ſaid of the Spirit, as once that murmuring people ſaid of <hi>Moſes, Up, make us Gods that may go before us; for as for this Moſes we know not what is become of him.</hi> And in this miſt of darkneſs, Satan hath conveyed himſelf in all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs, and made ſuch a deluge upon the face of the world, that till of
<pb facs="tcp:118351:5"/>
latter yeers, as it was in Elias his time, the true Church &amp; Saints of God were not diſcernable (though doubtleſs in the darkeſt times God reſerved a ſmall remnant to himſelf who bowed not the knee to the Idols of mens inventions, nor fell down before the Throne of the Beaſt.)</p>
            <p>The reign of Antichriſt hath been long, and ſo taking (being beautifyed by the excellency and glory of fleſh) that the whole world wondered after the Beaſt; whatever was prone and apt to deceive and bewitch the world, that hath he cloathed himſelf withal, not onely learning, wiſdom, greatneſs and power humane, but whatſoever the Goſpel afforded outward, that hath been given to him to carry captive into his own place, to that great City <hi>Babylon;</hi> there have Ordinances and the letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture been brought into cruel bondage, and made to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit, and a form of godlineſs to war againſt the power: what God hoth joyned, hath been there divorced, and put aſunder, and the abomination that maketh deſolate, ſet up; the whole world in their Religion, Worſhip, and Righteouſneſs, have lien in darkneſs, and are not aware of it; they liked not the Faith once given to the Saints, neither contended for it: they received not the truth in the love of it, and therefore were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to ſtrong deluſions to believe lyes, and by the ſigns, lying wonders, and cunning craftineſs of this man of ſin, whereby he lay in wait to deceive, have been led about and taken captive by him at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And think not this ſtrange, neither wonder at it. Art thou a ſtranger in Iſrael? Ought not theſe things ſo to have come to paſs? Ought not our Lord to be crucified in Sodom and Egypt, before he aſcend to his laſt and moſt glorious appearance in the world? is it not neceſſary the man of ſin ſhould firſt be revealed, before Chriſt can come in his brightneſs; and that the higheſt glory ſhould be born out of the womb of the deepeſt darkneſs? this was the Let kept Chriſt at a diſtance, ſeeing by this he was making way for a more glorious and admirable diſcovery of himſelf and the Goſpel, then the world yet ever knew. By this he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118351:10"/>
(judge you) ſhould this man be guided? by him that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed power, or them that talked? <hi>The Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power:</hi> they ask who this man was that bid him do ſo, for <hi>He is a Sabboth-breaker, and muſt be ſtoned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doct. 1. <hi>See how forms of Religion are ſet up againſt power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet here was nothing againſt form; for what was this carrying his bed, but <hi>preaching the love and power of God?</hi> Chriſt diſcovers himſelf to the man cured of his limbs, to a through cure of him, <hi>Sin no more.</hi> A cure indeed! the man tells the Jews who it was that cured him, whereupon Chriſt reaſoneth with the Jews, juſtifying what he had done, <hi>verſ. 17. My father works, and I work;</hi> as if he had ſaid, in charging me, you charge my Father; his power and preſence is manifeſted with me if you will ſee it: They ſtrove ſo much the more to kill him, in that he ſaid God was his Father.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are born after the fleſh, do not know what it is to be born after the Spirit. That which is the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religion, is to them <hi>blaſphemy;</hi> Chriſt is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, and tells them how the Father doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf by the Son, and onely by the Son. He had now manifeſted himſelf in a great work, and they would take no notice of it; they take notice onely of a <hi>Sabboth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaker,</hi> and a blaſphemer; there ſhall be ſuch a manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Father in the Son, as ſhall make you marvel; the Father hath given him power to raiſe the dead and judge the world; and as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo he hath given unto the Son to have life in himſelf, and he hath given him authority to execute judgement. Chriſt hath all that the Father hath, onely here is the difference:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118351:10"/>
He hath it as gift, it is given him. Now to prevent that which they might object and ſay, You take too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; Chriſt anſwers it in <hi>verſ. 30. I can of my own ſelf do nothing; as I hear I judge, and my judgement is juſt,</hi> &amp;c. I told you the ſon hath life in himſelf, and that he raiſeth the dead: and hath power of judgement. But I told you withal, it was given him, <hi>I can of my ſelf do nothing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>My deſign in preſenting you with this Text, is, to ſhew unto thoſe that do believe in Chriſt, what they have in Chriſt, and to ſhew them whence it is, and whence their witneſs and teſtimony is for that they have, whence it is they are owned in that power and <hi>Majeſty.</hi> The power of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and the power of judgement is <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and Chriſt witneſſeth that it is <hi>his</hi> from whom he received this power, <hi>I can of my own ſelf do nothing,</hi> and if I bear witneſs of my ſelf, my witneſs is not true; All that Religion and godlineſs that is not in <hi>power,</hi> and all that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that is <hi>earthly,</hi> and that teſtimony thereunto that is <hi>worldly,</hi> is worth nothing: Chriſt undertakes great things, he challengeth power to raiſe the dead, Authority of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and this is all given him from the Father, his <hi>Record is on high;</hi> his witneſs is the Father. Here are many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies named, but he looks above them all: here is <hi>his own</hi> witneſs. <hi>If I bear witneſs of my ſelf, my witneſs is not true;</hi> There is <hi>mans</hi> witneſs: <hi>I receive not witneſs from man;</hi> there is the witneſs of the <hi>eminent</hi> and excellent among men; but he lays them by, and looks above them all to God. Here is the witneſs of <hi>John, who was a burning and a ſhining light.</hi> In the 46. <hi>verſe,</hi> There is an other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Moſes: If you had believed Moſes, you would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved me, for he wrote of me.</hi> But there is another wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a greater then that of <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Moſes, ver. 36. The works which the Father hath given me to finiſh, bear witneſs of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118351:11"/>
me;</hi> Works are an excellent witneſs: but the <hi>works</hi> which <hi>the Father hath given me,</hi> they are excellent indeed, yet are laid by. Theſe are not ſufficient, for they muſt have a teſtimony themſelves, and therefore are laid by. Here is the Scripture, <hi>verſ. 39. Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which teſtifie of me:</hi> He lays by this witneſs too: <hi>ye will not come to me that you might have life.</hi> The Scripture holds forth me, and eternal life in me: but <hi>ye will not come to me:</hi> Thus here are ſeveral <hi>degrees</hi> of teſtimony; one above the other, but there is but <hi>one</hi> to be <hi>reſted</hi> in, and that is the teſtimony that <hi>enables</hi> all the other, the teſtimony of the <hi>Father,</hi> Ver. 32. <hi>There is another that beareth witneſs of me, and I know the witneſs that he witneſſeth of me is true.</hi> Who is that? Verſ. 37. <hi>The Father himſelf that hath ſent me, hath born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not the Fathers witneſs in the Scripture, and in Chriſts witneſs, and in <hi>Johns</hi> witneſs, and in the Works of Chriſt? It is: and as the Fathers witneſs is there, they are witneſſes that have validity; they make an end of the controverſie. The Father not appearing in them, they cannot ſettle the heart, nor decide the controverſie. It is the <hi>Father onely</hi> that is the <hi>ſufficient</hi> witneſs; the Father <hi>without</hi> theſe, the Father <hi>in theſe;</hi> but theſe without the Father are nothing. The <hi>truth</hi> of theſe is the <hi>Father;</hi> the life of theſe is the Father; <hi>And the world doth not know the Father,</hi> Verſ. 37. <hi>Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor ſeen his ſhape.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My deſign in this Scripture, is, to call you up to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> And this is the deſign of Chriſt, that he travels with, to bring us unto <hi>God: he ſuffered, the juſt for the unjuſt, to bring us unto God.</hi> Here is reſt, and nowhere on this ſide it; the Scripture in the Father, and the Father in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118351:11"/>
the Father in the Miniſtry of man, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of man in the Father; the Father in the works that are done, and the works done in the Father; we muſt know the Father, if we will know Chriſt. It is true, we may <hi>know</hi> the Father, and not <hi>know that we know</hi> the Father: <hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) let us look therefore for an <hi>expreſs</hi> manifeſtation of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe <hi>expreſs image</hi> the Son is, <hi>God in Chriſt.</hi> Now for the works here.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, touching Chriſts working and judging, <hi>verſ. 30. I can of my own ſelf do nothing; as I hear, ſo I judge, and my judgement is juſt, becauſe I ſeek not my own will, but the will of the Father which hath ſent me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, of the witneſs and teſtimony of Chriſt; <hi>If I bear witneſs of my ſelf, my witneſs is not true; I can do nothing of my own ſelf.</hi> The Scripture is <hi>pure contradiction</hi> unto a <hi>carnal</hi> man: and the ſpiritual man that ſpeaks according to it, is judged by the world to ſpeak contradiction. The world is tender to charge the Scripture with it; but is bold to charge them that ſpeak from the Scripture. I can do nothing of my own ſelf, and yet I can do all things: Chriſt hath <hi>Two</hi> ſelfs: and a Chriſtian hath Two ſelfs, the <hi>natural</hi> ſelf, and the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſelf; There is, <hi>my ſelf</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>my ſelf</hi> of <hi>God: I can do nothing of my ſelf, of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely</hi> ſelf, but <hi>of</hi> God, and <hi>in</hi> God, I can do all things. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 3. It is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall not judge after the ſight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears.</hi> There is himſelf of <hi>Adam,</hi> and himſelf of God; according to the former, he judges as he hears: according to the latter, he judges not by the hearing of the eare: <hi>The Spirit of the Lord makes him of quick underſtanding:</hi> The Lord is my ſtrength and righteouſneſs, and my ſelf in the Lord
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118351:12"/>
judges and doth things the world ſhall marvel at. I do of my ſelf, and I do not of my ſelf; I do my own will, and I do not my own will: Thus there are two ſelfs. <hi>It is not I, but Chriſt that lives in me,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; it is Chriſt that lives, and not I. <hi>I can do nothing of my ſelf.</hi> There is an eſtate in Chriſt, in which we neither can nor will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God. I can do nothing of my ſelf, I cannot do my own will, but the will of the Father; ſuch an eſtate there is in Chriſt, and we are all called to the ſtate of Chriſt; Chriſt in us, Chriſt formed in us, riſen in us, the glory of Chriſt, the glory of the body; Chriſt and his body are not ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; the ſame kingdom and glory is theirs; he hath called us into the fellowſhip of his kingdom and glory: God in Chriſt, and Chriſt in us; as God is in Chriſt, ſo Chriſt is in believers: <hi>That which eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath entred into the heart of man to conceive, hath God prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them that love him: becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> The Saints life, is the life of Chriſt: there is an eſtate in which we neither can nor will diſpleaſe the Father. It is the ſtate of <hi>God</hi> that <hi>cannot deny himſelf;</hi> this is that we are called to, the life of God, the life of God in Chriſt: This ſtate is not manifeſted, but it is <hi>manifeſting; we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the truth, but for the truth: we are kept by the power of God through Faith to ſalvation;</hi> God acting and governing the words that I ſpeak; I ſpeak not of my ſelf; Chriſt ſpake in God; and it ſhall be, that all we ſpeak, and all we do, we ſhall ſpeak in Chriſt, and do it all in Chriſt; as God is in Chriſt, ſo Chriſt is in us, <hi>Joh. 14. 10. The words that I ſpeak unto you, I ſpeak not of my ſelf, but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doth the works,</hi> And ſo Chriſt in us; and when Chriſt is <hi>grown up</hi> in us, and <hi>riſen</hi> in us, and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified</hi> in us, there ſhall none be ſeen nor heard but Chriſt: There is a ſtate in <hi>Adam,</hi> wherein we can <hi>will</hi> and <hi>do</hi> good
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118351:12"/>
or evil <hi>indifferently;</hi> there is a <hi>corrupt</hi> ſtate that <hi>neither</hi> can <hi>will</hi> nor <hi>do</hi> good: there is an eſtate in Chriſt, wherein we cannot, we will not diſpleaſe God. This is that we wait for, to have Chriſt thus brought forth in us, and we brought forth in him thus perfect: <hi>I can of my own ſelf do nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſee here how Chriſt lives out of himſelf in God the Father; and this is that which Chriſtians do as they are Chriſtians; they live out of themſelves, and they live in Chriſt. They neither do nor will, but Chriſt wills in them. Its ſaid Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf. He that doth all of himſelf, he doth all to pleaſe himſelf; he in whom God doth all, he doth all to pleaſe God: he doth all in the Lord, and to the Lord; <hi>not my will, but thy will be done;</hi> His natural will ſtood up ſometime and would be owned: but it was brought to ſubmit; <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> And here it appears, who ſpeaks of himſelf, and who ſpeaks not of himſelf: he that ſeeks himſelf, ſpeaks of himſelf: but he that ſeeks not his own glory, but the glory of him that ſent him, he ſpeaks not of himſelf. And take notice of this, that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo far forth appears in us, as we go out of our ſelves: as we lay by our own wills and judgements, ſo far forth we are righteous and juſt: <hi>My judgement is juſt, becauſe I ſeek not my own will, but the will of him that ſent me:</hi> we are ſo far righteous before God, whoſe judgement is according to truth, as we go out of our ſelves, and out of our own wills: <hi>My judgement is juſt, becauſe I ſeek not my own will:</hi> He that lays by himſelf, and ſeeks not his own honour, he that goes out of his own Reaſon, and his own will, he is a righteous man indeed: Chriſt is the power of God, and the wiſdom of God, and in his (even Gods) wiſdom and power he walks and acts; and ſo far forth as we walk in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118351:13"/>
Chriſt, who is the wiſdom and power of God, we are owned by God to be juſt and righteous, and no further: all our own wiſdom is <hi>folly</hi> to God, and all our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is wickedneſs to God. <hi>Of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption:</hi> So far forth are we righteous, in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as we lay by our own Reaſon, and our own Wills: Chriſt acts in the wiſdom and power of God; ſo far forth as we act in Chriſt, we act in the wiſdom and power of God: and ſo far we are true and juſt. There is no righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor wiſdom but the Lord: therefore ſo far forth as we are found in him, we are wiſe and righteous; <hi>that I may be found in him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) His own light led him, till God was pleaſed to reveal his ſon in him, and then he ſaw there was no wiſdom or righteouſneſs but in him: <hi>That I may be found in him, not having my own righteouſneſs which is of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That I may know the power of his death, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, if that by any means I might attain to the reſurrection of the dead;</hi> mans light is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his wiſdom is enmity. The great leſſon of the Goſpel is ſelf-denyal; the ſtate that the Goſpel calls us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is the ſtate of the Reſurrection: it is a going out of the fleſh into the ſpirit. The buſineſs of the Goſpel is, not to ſave our ſelves, but to loſe our ſelves: and in loſing our ſelves, we ſhall ſave our ſelves: This is a riddle and a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and they that know not a ſpiritual life, the life of God, know not what to make of it. <hi>I do not my own will, and I know my judgement is juſt, becauſe I do not my own will: but the will of him that ſent me:</hi> Let every one that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Goſpel, conſider whether he walks by this rule, whether he ſeeks righteouſneſs by going out of himſelf into Chriſt, or whether he ſeeks it in himſelf, whether he ſeeks it in a new creature, whether he looks for the new
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118351:13"/>
creature that is born of God, and brought forth in his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which is righteouſneſs and true holineſs, and not counterfeit: There is counterfeit holineſs, counterfeit righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; the righteouſneſs of man, the holineſs of man is abominable and filthy in the ſight of God: <hi>I beſeech you</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) that ye would not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.</hi> Rom. 12. <hi>He that will be my Diſciple, let him deny himſelf:</hi> You that ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you wait to <hi>purpoſe</hi> in the Goſpel: and you that have <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you have the Goſpel, which is the light and life and glory of God: Do not reſt in a bare profeſſion, nor in mans righteouſneſs: nor in ſome poor outward reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Do not reſt in repairing and beautifying old <hi>Adam:</hi> Chriſt came from God and we are going to God: Let us ſee our eſtate in Chriſt: For we are choſen in him, and we are of him: And he is made of God our wiſdom, &amp;c. It is a vain thing to go about the work of repairing, to build <hi>Jerico:</hi> to be patching and peicing an old garment, to put old wine into new bottels: You will but make rents and breaches: <hi>Adam</hi> was only a ſhadow and type of that which was to come: Look after the new man, who ſhall <hi>make ſtraight that which is crooked, and ſupply that which is wanting;</hi> give up your ſelves to the ſpiritual man: the ſecond man who is the Lord from heaven: Be making towards the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his ſufferings, and labor to attain the Reſurrection from the dead: Make to Chriſt as he is the Reſurrection: He is righteous indeed that is righteous before God; none ſhall be owned righteous but he; his name ſhall be called the Lord our Righteouſneſs. To walk in our own reaſon, and our own light, and wiſdom: to follow mans will, and conſult with fleſh and blood, may be applauded by man: but we ſhall have the portion of fools and wicked ones from the Lord: Were it not better to be a fool and a wonder, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118351:14"/>
a gazing ſtock to men, then to be abhorred of God? We muſt go forth without the gate, bearing our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach! How can it be otherwiſe but he that hath laid by his own Reaſon and Will, and profeſſeth he is born of God, and that God alone ſhall be his guide, ſhall be accounted a fool and a mad man, and out of his witts? It is very hard to be ſober to God, but we muſt be mad to men: I come to the witneſs, the teſtimony in <hi>ver. 31. If I bear witneſs of my ſelf, my witneſs is not true:</hi> Here is a witneſs that is received as inſufficient: There is no witneſs <hi>authentick</hi> but the <hi>Father:</hi> He doth not witneſs of himſelf, nor do of himſelf: and yet he doth do of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: he hath life in himſelf, and he witneſſeth of himſelf, and his witneſs is true. If this be a contradiction, it is a Scripture contradiction, See <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 14. Will you ſay its a Scripture contradiction? The Scripture is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and nonſenſe to thoſe that judge after the fleſh: You will not ſay it of the Scripture; but you will ſay it of them that preach Scripture, that they ſpeak contradiction. <hi>ver. 16. Yet if I judge, my judgement is true:</hi> Why? <hi>For I am not alone, but I and the Father that ſent me are one.</hi> If I were alone, my witneſs were not true, but the Father and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, without contradiction the judgement is true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But how can this be, that Chriſt witneſſing of himſelf, his witneſs ſhould not be true? without controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, man witneſſing of himſelf, his witneſs is not true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ſinfull: But Chriſt was pure, there was no guile found in his mouth.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer: Though he was a pure and a ſpotleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet he had weakneſs in him, and ignorance in him: It is ſaid <hi>he grew in ſtature and knowledge.</hi> Chriſt never witneſſed any thing but what was true, but he never
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118351:14"/>
brought forth the full truth: He was to bring forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his body: in a higher way, in greater power then he appeared in the fleſh. <hi>He that believes in me, greater works ſhall he do then I do, becauſe I go to the Father.</hi> There are two things required in a witneſs; <hi>faithfullneſs</hi> and <hi>knowledge:</hi> There wanted nothing of faithfulneſs; there wanted of knowledge in Chriſt: <hi>he grew in knowledge:</hi> Chriſt in us doth know all things: Therefore be not caſt down though thou doeſt not yet know all things. Upon this account it is that <hi>John</hi> takes off the new man, and the ſpiritual man from ſinking into ſorrow, upon the judgement he paſſeth on himſelf: <hi>He that is in thee, is greater then thy heart, and knows all things:</hi> Judge nothing before the time till the Lord come: and if Chriſt in that pure nature was not ripe to paſs a judgement, wonder not that we cannot do it in this corrupt nature: <hi>I bear not witneſs of my ſelf</hi> ſaith Chriſt: <hi>I judge not my own ſelf: he that judgeth me is the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul: If I bear witneſs of my ſelf, my witneſs is not truth: There is an other that bears witneſs, and I know his witneſs is true;</hi> And who is this other? It is the Father <hi>ver. 37. The Father himſelf that hath ſent me, he beareth witneſs of me;</hi> Chriſt lays by all teſtimony but this. The fathers and all teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony except the Father be in it, to give us ſettlement and aſſurance, fall ſhort: <hi>For none knows the Son but the Father: and he to whom the Father reveals him: Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God. Bleſſed art thou Simon: fleſh and blood hath not revealed this to thee, but my Father. He that eſtabliſheth you together with us is God: There are three witneſſes: and theſe are one: the Father and the Son and the Spirit.</hi> And there is nothing more concerns thoſe that profeſs to know Jeſus Chriſt, then to examine how they came to know him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have had this knowledge by the teaching of the Father. <hi>The baptiſm of Iohn, is it from heaven or from men?</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:118351:15"/>
So your knowledge, is it from God, or from men? have you received it from your good Miniſters, or from your own reaſon or light, or from the Spirit of the Father? It concerns us to conſider this: Let the world Jeer and Scoff, and cry Fancy and Whimſie, and what they will: There is no true knowledge of Chriſt, nor of the Scripture, but by revelation. It is that the Apoſtle prays for, <hi>That God would give unto you the Spirit rf revelation.</hi> All the learned in that only Church of the Jews were all blind, and did not receive Chriſt: Who were they that received him? they were born of God. If we ſpeak of Conſciences teſtimony, let us remember that it is <hi>my conſcience bearing me witneſs in the holyghoſt:</hi> This is the witneſs of the Father in your conſciences: then the voice of conſcience is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous voice: This is ſpeaking in Chriſt; <hi>I ſpeak the truth in Chriſt, I lye not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, my conſcience bearing me witneſs;</hi> he ſpeak in the Father: <hi>theſe three are one,</hi> and make up one witneſs that is <hi>true. When it pleaſed God to reveal his Son in me, &amp;c.</hi> Look now what your faith ſtands in: <hi>ſtands it in the wiſedom of men or the power of God?</hi> Let every one of us be looking after the power and life of the Father, and of Chriſt that we may <hi>ſee the Father: he that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Philip.</hi> Let us dwell no more in man, nor upon man, but let us look higher. It is written, <hi>all thy ſons ſhall be taught of God:</hi> You never come to peace, nor reſt, till you come to God, to the Father. As the Father appears more clearly to you in Chriſt: ſo you come to true peace, ſtability, and Settlement; and till ye come to him, ye are <hi>like children toſſed up and down with every wind of Doctrine;</hi> One Sect of men blows this way, another Sect blows an other way: and ſo we are toſſed up and down till we come to know the Father by the Spirit in Chriſt: We are weary of all Religion, and ſettle no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118351:15"/>
till we come to find the rock, to find God: till we come to hear him ſpeak that hath the words of eternal life, that ſpeaks power and life, and not as the Scribes. We never come to <hi>put off the old man till we come to hear Chriſt, and the truth as it is in him.</hi> Then we ſtand firm in all winds that blow and puff: This is to hear the Father: then <hi>we put off the old man:</hi> Silly women we are, weak and fooliſh crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures till then: <hi>He that eſtabliſheth you is God:</hi> when ſhall we ceaſe from man? <hi>There is another that bears witneſs of me, and his witneſs is true:</hi> And when we have his witneſs, it will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie: And we ſhall know that <hi>his witneſs is true,</hi> but the world doth not know him: This is ſatisfaction to Chriſt, that <hi>he knows the Father,</hi> and the Father knows him, though the world doth not know him: but they ſhall know him to <hi>their deſtruction</hi> and confuſion, when he comes forth to be revealed, and to be glorified in his Saints; <hi>I know his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is true:</hi> I mind not, I eſteem not the judgement of the world: Let the world ſay and think what they will; My witneſs is in Heaven, and my Record is on high: I mind not, I eſteem not the judgement of the world; <hi>I know my witneſs is true:</hi> There is the reſt of the Saints of God. Men call you before their judgement ſeats, and you cannot ſatisfie them: They cannot be ſatisfied: but your ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in God: And the world cannot ſee God: yet the Saints can pitty the world in their madneſs and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Now he comes to the teſtimony of <hi>Iohn: Ye ſent unto</hi> John, <hi>and he bare witneſs of me; but I received not teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt humbles himſelf very low to plead <hi>Johns</hi> witneſs: He alledges <hi>Johns</hi> teſtimony againſt them: They did not own him, but they did own <hi>John:</hi> They inquired of <hi>John</hi> whether he was the Chriſt: <hi>John</hi> told them plainly he was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118351:16"/>
not the Chriſt, but he pointed them unto Chriſt: yet they receive not <hi>Iohns</hi> teſtimony, and ſo Chriſt makes it a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt them: This is all that carnal Profeſſors get (that do not love the truth) by ſearching out the truth: they meet with a teſtimony againſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>See how low God hath put himſelf; into ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he needeth mans witneſs: He hath withdrawn <hi>himſelf,</hi> and ſet up the <hi>world;</hi> While God is in this low ſtate, the <hi>world</hi> ſits in judgement, and the Devil hath the power: But there will be a time when God will come forth without witneſs: And when he appears he will ſay, <hi>Bring forth your witneſſes and your ſtrong reaſons.</hi> We look what witneſs God hath among men. How few and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable were the witneſs that Chriſt had in reſpect of the world? He ſent to <hi>John</hi> a man that had nothing to commend him according to the fleſh: Ye have heard of old <hi>Simeon,</hi> he bare witneſs unto Chriſt: And of <hi>Hanna</hi> an old woman, ſhe bare witneſs alſo; But look among the Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the Scribes and Phariſees, Famed, Learned and godly men; and how few were there among them that bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto Chriſt? How ſhould we long that the witneſſes might <hi>finiſh their teſtimony,</hi> when the Lord <hi>himſelf</hi> will come forth, that <hi>every eye may ſee him,</hi> and all people own him!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt ſent unto Iohn, but received not teſtimony from man; but theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have I ſpoken unto you, that ye might be ſaved.</hi> Here is a people had nothing in their hearts but <hi>killing,</hi> and Chriſt had nothing in his heart towards them but <hi>ſaving;</hi> And upon this deſign did Chriſt travail all the while he was amongſt them: There was <hi>wheat</hi> among the chaff of the world; and all his dealing in the world was to gather the Wheat from the chaff.</p>
                  <p>There is no teſtimony worth any thing but where God
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118351:16"/>
appears. Chriſt teſtifies of <hi>Iohn</hi> that he was a burning and a ſhining light: The face of God ſhining is day: This day dawned in <hi>Iohn:</hi> ſuch witneſſes we expect, ſuch a Miniſtry we expect in whom we may ſee the light and purity of God conſuming ſin, burning up chaff: The Miniſtry of God in <hi>John,</hi> the light of God ſet up in <hi>Iohn,</hi> was that which made him a burning and ſhining light. Do we know ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry or no? It is this only that is to be deſired: The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> and <hi>fire:</hi> This is the Miniſtry we ſhould look after: We have too long dwelt in men, and languiſhed in mens gifts, and parts, Wiſdom and Elocution: Let us be looking after the light and life of <hi>God,</hi> after God in Chriſt manifeſted unto us, and <hi>in us,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>Chriſt had healed a Cripple, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him to carry his bed and walk; and had commanded him to do ſo, and he did ſo: The righteous men are offended at it; the <hi>litteral</hi> Jews cannot bear it: Chriſt is an offence to the religious Profeſſor that is born after the <hi>fleſh:</hi> they ſay he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and is worthy to be ſtoned: Chriſt juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his act, and tells them, that what he had done was a manifeſtation of the <hi>Father</hi> in him; then they ſay he is alſo a blaſphemer in ſaying that <hi>God was his father, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf equal with God:</hi> and ſeek the more to kill him.</p>

And if ye will know, in a word, what the Goſpel calls us unto; it is to be mad, to be <hi>beſides</hi> our own Reaſon and Will, this is-to be mad to <hi>men;</hi> but it is to be ſober to <hi>God.</hi> The Goſpel is nothing elſe but the bringing forth of Chriſt in us; it calls us from conformity to the <hi>world,</hi> and from walking as <hi>men,</hi> into the life of God.

that ſeek honor one of another, and ſeek not the honor that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from God alone?</hi> Concerning the teſtimony Chriſt gives of <hi>John ver.</hi> 35. he was a burning and a ſhining light, <hi>and ye were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce in his light;</hi> I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> bare witneſs unto Chriſt, and bare witneſs by poynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him out: <hi>John</hi> had a clearer manifeſtation of Chriſt in the fleſh then any that went before him: and ſo his witneſs was with more power: He was a <hi>burning and a ſhining light: John</hi> was (<hi>a</hi>) light, but he was not (<hi>the</hi>) light: <hi>Iohn 1. 8. The ſame came to bear witneſs of the light. He was not that light, but he was ſent to bear witneſs of the light.</hi> He was the light, and he was not: So far forth as he was a witneſs of it, he was not it: He was of the <hi>body</hi> of light, of which Chriſt was the <hi>head:</hi> He was not the light, in the <hi>clearneſs</hi> and <hi>fulneſs</hi> of it, but he was the light in a <hi>degree;</hi> It was the true light that ſhined in him, and in that light he ſaw and ſhewed forth, and witneſſed it unto others: <hi>There is no diſcovery or manifeſtation of Chriſt, but in Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt calleth his diſciples the light; <hi>Ye are the light of the world:</hi> So he calleth <hi>Iohn</hi> a light; but yet the leaſt in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>greater</hi> then <hi>Iohn;</hi> John <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was the <hi>concluſion</hi> of that adminiſtration that went before Chriſt in the fleſh: He was a light, a burning and a ſhining light: He did partake more of the Divine Nature then thoſe that went before him: He ſaw Chriſt at a nearer diſtance; he burnt, and ſhind more, and this burning and ſhining was nothing elſe but the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature:</hi> The truth is, there is no true Prophet, no true teſtimony given of Chriſt, but by <hi>thoſe that ſee him:</hi> And the nearer to him, the clearer ſight of him, the more clear and powerfull is the teſtimony that is given of him: That teſtimony that is given to him by thoſe that do not ſee him <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>come,</hi> is not indeed a teſtimony to Chriſt, but to

                     <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> He is ſuch a Prophet as <hi>Balaam</hi> was, that had nothing but <hi>Notion;</hi> He was a lying Prophet that compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the world for a reward: And whoſoever take upon them to be Prophets, and do complie with the World, are lying Prophets as he was: All true Prophets that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of Chriſt, <hi>ſaw him,</hi> and <hi>he was in them: Abraham ſaw my day</hi> (ſaith Chriſt;) and twas Chriſt himſelf that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> hath it: But <hi>Iohn</hi> was much above the Prophets, ſeeing Chriſt at a nearer diſtance then they did: <hi>A Prophet</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Yea, I ſay unto you, and more then a Prophet.

                  </p>
                  <p>He is come, and <hi>Iohn</hi> is come that bears witneſs of him: Who is <hi>Iohn</hi> that bears witneſs to him? He that calleth you from man to that <hi>one Maſter:</hi> He that is <hi>decreaſing</hi> before him, and rejoyceth in it: He that is dying into him, and ſeeking to riſe in him, that is ſending all Diſciples to him, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, and profeſſing that all were Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that went before him, that had drawn Diſciples after them.</p>

                  <p>This ſame <hi>Iohn</hi> came out of the <hi>wilderneſs:</hi> He came not in a fleſhly garbe. He came not in that which commends

him to man: He feared not man, nor his terror: He ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red neither for <hi>Herods</hi> glory, nor the Phariſees <hi>applauſe:</hi> He was leading men above the excellency of this creation, and bidding them look beyond it: He comes not into the Miniſtry upon the old account, by the way of <hi>Succeſsion</hi> or <hi>Election</hi> by mans <hi>laying on</hi> of hands, or call of <hi>Churches,</hi> but by the <hi>Spirit;</hi> He comes of the Prieſthood, but not in the ordayning way: When his parents were old, when their bodies were dead, when his Father was dumb, when mans Miniſtry had been tryed, then he comes forth, not in the wiſdom of man, but in the power of the Spirit; He comes out of the wilderneſs in Spirit: So Chriſt is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us in the Spirit: Theſe are the mighty witneſſes, and this is that which makes them mighty: <hi>Seeing of Chriſt:</hi> This is the Miniſtry we ſhould look after: Look after ſuch witneſſes, and look to be ſuch witneſſes: to be ſeers indeed, and not in a <hi>bare notion</hi> as <hi>Balaam</hi> was: to ſee him in us, and our ſelves in union with him: to hold him forth, to hold forth the truth, to hold forth righteouſneſs, and to be able to ſay, <hi>Here it is.</hi>

                  <p>The Miniſtry of thoſe that profeſs themſelves the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, and yet do not ſee Chriſt, the world takes hold on it, and runs into it, and ſo it comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>The Miniſtry of thoſe that ſee Chriſt by the power of Chriſt, doth ſtop the mouths of Mockers and Scoffers that ſay <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> Why, he is come, and he is coming: That is the true Miniſtry that ſees him; and this is that which will grow exceedingly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the world: This is ſuch a Miniſtry as the world is not able to ſtand before; As Chriſt comes nearer, ſo the Miniſtry of the Spirit will be more burning and ſhining; more dazling and tormenting to the world; and if any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

it, O what burning and tormenting then! Burning and ſhining is the <hi>demonſtration of the Spirit and Power:</hi> The Divine nature in us is that fire from the Altar that never goeth out: That fire that ſhall change our vile bodies, and make them like his glorious body: that fire that ſhal put out and darken the glory of the world: And that is the reaſon of the <hi>Ecclipſe</hi> of the Sun, which Naturaliſts cannot find out, the greater light coming: the Lord himſelf, the Sun of righteouſneſs appearing, the light of gifts, of parts, and of natural reaſon preſently diſappears and vaniſheth; They are but as the light of a glow-worm to the Sun.</p>
                  <p>There is a fire of paſſion kindled by the fire of Hell: The fire that <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes carried away in their tayls, as its ſaid: Wickedneſs burns like a fire: The fire of the Spirit putts out this fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A burning and a ſhining light:</hi> The manifeſtation of God in his ſervants is fire and light: its burning and ſhining; and the nearer God approaches, the hotter the fire, the more ſhining the light.</p>

                     <hi>Burning and ſhining;</hi> In burning there is great <hi>ſuffering,</hi> there's torment, there's ſlaying, and <hi>offering up,</hi> there's <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilating;</hi> In ſhining there's light, <hi>Quickning, Comforting, Directing;</hi> and there's <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and all the <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of the Lord comes forth at laſt in <hi>ſhining</hi> and Glory; There is no <hi>ſhining</hi> without <hi>burning: The day of the Lord burns like an Oven: And he ſhall ſit as a Refiner of Silver:</hi> The tryal of your faith is much more precious then Gold: The manifeſtation of God, the Miniſtry of the Spirit, is full of <hi>variety</hi> of operation; Killing, Saving, Tormenting, Refreſhing; We are the ſavour of <hi>death</hi> unto death to ſome, and the ſavour of <hi>life</hi> unto life, to others: We ſhould look what acquaintance we have with ſuch a Miniſtry: <hi>with bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſhining light;</hi> Whether we have dealt with fire,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118351:21"/>
with burning, and whether through that we have come to know what belongs to ſhining: There is the Divine nature to be brought forth bright and ſhining: The worlds part is to be burnt and dazled; the Chriſtians part is to have fleſh conſumed, and the Divine nature to come forth in glory; If any be in the fire, let them hope to ſhine: Have ye that in you that will endure the fire? <hi>When I am tried I ſhall come forth like gold;</hi> 'Tis the righteouſneſs of God only, not of man that will endure this tryal: 'Tis the <hi>Divine</hi> nature only that can ſtand before <hi>devouring fire,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;</hi> When this day breaks forth, all the righteous Phariſes and Formaliſts, will be found to be the <hi>ſinners</hi> in <hi>Sion</hi> that are <hi>affraid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This manifeſtation of God is terrible to the world: It is a <hi>marvelous light:</hi> He hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvelous light; It is not the light of this world; It is another Spirit then that of this world. The world marvails at it, and deſpiſes it, becauſe it is death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to them: For a while they Maſter it, but at laſt it prevails againſt them, and they ſee there is no ſtanding before it.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Low</hi> manfeſtations of God, the people of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as <hi>Incendiaries,</hi> and are ſo indeed. This <hi>old</hi> world is to be purified by fire, as the other was by <hi>water;</hi> How was <hi>Herod</hi> ſcorcht and dazled with this fire? The world pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails againſt it for a while, and beats it down, and then it riſeth higher and higher, till it prevail over the world: Chriſt appeared in fleſhly eyes there, and riſeth again in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and after a long apoſtacy is riſing again the ſecond time. If we be of God and have the Divine nature in us, we ſhall rejoyce not onely in the light but in the fire: <hi>They ſhall glorifie God in the fire.</hi>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118351:21"/>
us a little conſider of theſe words: Ye were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce in his light; the light did <hi>in part</hi> pleaſe you: there is ſome <hi>compliance</hi> and cloſing of carnal hearts and worſhipers, with the ſpiritual Miniſtry and true appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God. The world ſtrikes in for ſome time into the way of Chriſt, and the appearance of God; <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John</hi> gladly, and reformed many things; he liked the light well, but he could not endure the <hi>fire;</hi> there is that which is held forth in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that pleaſeth the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> man; ſalvation, and glory, and eternal joy; but when they hear of going into the <hi>fire,</hi> and what they muſt part withal, then with the <hi>young man,</hi> they <hi>go away ſorrowful:</hi> The ſtony ground ſets forth a ſort of people, that hear the word with joy, but becauſe they have not much root, they are ſcorcht and burnt up by the Sun of perſecution, and wither away; many take up the profeſſion of Chriſt, and when they hear of ſalvation and glory, its good news to them: but when they hear what it will coſt them, that all muſt come through ſufferings, and offering all to death, that they may receive all again by a Reſurrection, this they like not, and ſo fall away; for a little while they can bear God company, but ſo ſoon as they ſee the croſs in the way, they turn aſide.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome luſts and corruptions that ſome men are not enclined to; while the fire of God comes forth againſt theſe in others, they are well enough; while God comes forth againſt ſome ſort of men, they can bear well enough; while <hi>John</hi> came forth againſt the <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Phariſees, Herod</hi> liked it well: but when the fire of God breaks forth againſt <hi>their own</hi> luſts, as againſt <hi>Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brothers wife,</hi> they can bear no longer.</p>
                  <p>And there are luſts that fight one againſt another, for there is enmity in <hi>Hell;</hi> when the fire comes forth and fights
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118351:22"/>
againſt a luſt in another, we like it well, but when it ſtrikes at our own luſts, we cannot bear it.</p>
                  <p>And ſometimes we fall out with the world, and are <hi>tyred in the greatneſs of our way;</hi> and then we can entertain ſomething of Chriſt, and of truth.</p>
                  <p>Worldly men can go along with Chriſt for worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; but if their deſign be ſpoyled, no longer walking with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It concerns every one of us that have taken up a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that are complying with ſuch a Miniſtry as we look upon to be a Miniſtry of the ſpirit, to look inward, and to conſider whether we have the love of the truth in our hearts; whether we are able to bear the charge to the <hi>journeys end,</hi> and to hold out in <hi>all weathers.</hi> There are many builders that lay a foundation, but they are not able to go through with the charge of finiſhing. Theſe are fooliſh builders, that expoſe themſelves to laughter and ſcorn.</p>
                  <p>Ye were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce in his light, in the manifeſtation of God through <hi>John,</hi> but it was onely <hi>for a ſeaſon;</hi> here was not the love of the truth; here was not the divine nature; here was not that which will abide, therefore it was rejoycing in the light onely for a ſeaſon; how doth it concern us to look whether we have the love of the truth in us? whether we have the teſtimony of the Father, that we love the truth? There is a Jew that is one inwardly, and there is a Jew in the ſpirit: there was a Jew that was one outwardly in the fleſh: that which is for a <hi>ſeaſon</hi> onely, is becauſe it wanteth <hi>root:</hi> there is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an indeed, and a Chriſtian onely in <hi>appearance</hi> and ſhew; what a goodly ſhew doth the Corn on the <hi>ſtony</hi> ground make? but when the <hi>burning</hi> comes, it withers away; when the Sun of perſecution ariſeth, ſuch ſhall be diſcovered;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118351:22"/>
how hard it is to know a Chriſtian indeed, until the fire comes, until the ſalt comes, <hi>Every man ſhall be ſalted with fire, and every work ſhall be tryed by the fire;</hi> How doth it concern us to ſee that we have our foundation in <hi>God,</hi> that we may be able to ſtand in that day? We may be great and glorious in <hi>mans</hi> eye, and yet in the day of the Lord prove no better then <hi>chaffe</hi> or <hi>ſtubble,</hi> that the fire takes hold on and conſumes; what diſcoveries have we daily of rottenneſs in <hi>profeſſors;</hi> and as this day appears more, ſo there will be greater diſcoveries.</p>
                  <p>You have ſuch and ſuch marks and ſigns, but they are things that need a teſtimony to them; the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of that teſtimony, <hi>The love of the brethren:</hi> but it comes at length to this: <hi>We know that we dwell in him, and he in us, by the ſpirit that he hath given us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce,</hi> &amp;c. Willing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing; how like is this to the <hi>ſpirit?</hi> as if the day of <hi>Gods power</hi> had been amongſt them, to make them <hi>willing;</hi> but when that day comes, it will bring us to <hi>eternity;</hi> how many be there, that have been willing and rejoycing in Chriſt, but now their ſeaſon is <hi>gone?</hi> Conſider whether we are for a ſeaſon onely, or whether we are <hi>for ever?</hi> Whether we are not onely for the light, but for the fire? Chriſt is <hi>yeſterday, today, and the ſame for ever:</hi> It is a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to be onely for a ſeaſon: better not to be at all, and never to have known the way of righteouſneſs, then to be but blazing Stars and Comets, and at laſt fall to the earth: with what confuſion of face ſhall they be thrown down, that ſhall ſtand up at the laſt day, and ſay, Lord, have we not preached, and propheſyed, and caſt out devils in thy name? when he ſhall anſwer them, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not;</hi> he that is right in Religion indeed, is growing and <hi>increaſing;</hi> he is as a Tree planted by the Rivers

                  </p>
                  <p>If Chriſt be in us, he grows up in us, and we grow up in him; being rooted and grounded in love, we grow up into his fulneſs, till we be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</p>
                  <p>Ye were willing for a ſeaſon; ye were profeſſors for a ſeaſon, Chriſtians for a ſeaſon, the people of God for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſome for one ſeaſon, and ſome for another ſeaſon; now lifted up to Heaven, and by and by thrown down to Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is a miſerable caſe; better never to have known the way of righteouſneſs, better to have continued in our natural eſtate without making profeſſion at all, then to ſhine for a ſeaſon, and afterwards be caſt into outward dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>

                  <p>Many things might be obſerved from this firſt <hi>verſe;</hi> As that firſt of al, touching <hi>common fame: It is reported commonly.</hi>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That there is the ſame corruption, the ſame corrupt nature in a Saint as in others. It is true, As we are Saints we partake of the Divine nature: but there is the corrupt nature alſo. There is the <hi>fleſh</hi> as well as the Spirit. If the Spirit be <hi>aſleep,</hi> if God give Sathan <hi>Power,</hi> and ſay to him, as he did once, <hi>Go, and be a lying Spirit in the mouth of Ahabs Prophets.</hi> Go, and be an unclean Spirit in ſuch a ones heart: What miſchief may he not do?

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Further we might ſee here from that firſt <hi>verſe</hi> how there is a civil righteouſneſs among the Gentiles: Even Gentiles and Heathens, they do keep themſelves free from <hi>groſs</hi> carnal actings: they are free from groſs defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all the filthineſs lieth within: There it lieth hid till temptation draw it forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. And this alſo is to be taken notice of, that abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from outward, groſs, filthy actings, will make us no better then the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> If our righteouſneſs be only an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from outward groſs acts, it will be no better a righteouſneſs then the righteouſneſs of the Gentiles, and of the Heathen. There is all filthineſs within, but it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and comes not forth. Oh, How doth it concern us that we be not found <hi>worſe</hi> then the Gentiles! When that which is within <hi>breaks forth</hi> in all <hi>filthy,</hi> and <hi>beaſtly,</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable</hi> practice, this is to be worſe then the Gentiles. We are no better then the Gentiles if we outwardly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain; We are worſe then the Gentiles if we let theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions break forth. <hi>Such Fornication as is not once named among the Gentiles.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. And here we ſee how it lieth upon Saints to <hi>poſſeſs their veſſels in ſanctification and in honor.</hi> It lieth upon them, and there is a Law for <hi>them</hi> as well as for the <hi>World.</hi> The difference is, that the world hath a Law upon them <hi>from without,</hi> an <hi>impoſition:</hi> A Saint, if he be a Saint indeed,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118351:25"/>
hath the ſame Law within; the Law without only <hi>reſtrains;</hi> the Law of the Spirit of life within it <hi>crucifies,</hi> it morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, it kills the very root of ſin.</p>

                  <p>1. Some ſay ſo and diſcover the <hi>contrary;</hi> and ſome have ſaid ſo, and have had a diſcovery of the contrary in their own <hi>hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Again we ſay that we have no <hi>experience</hi> of any ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>3. We ſay that there is a Spirit that diſcovers and judges, and therefore let them that ſay ſo look to it: When this ſame Spirit ſhall come forth in us, we ſhall be able to <hi>judge:</hi> till then we are <hi>ſilent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I conceive there be two ſorts of <hi>Ranters</hi> in the world; one that comes forth in all fleſhly <hi>beaſtlineſs:</hi> another that comes forth in <hi>ſcorn,</hi> and <hi>diſdain,</hi> inſulting and lifting up themſelves upon that occaſion. Let us wait upon God to be delivered from both theſe. That for the firſt <hi>verſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is to be done, when boyles and blaines do break out, when ſuch corruption and filth is diſcovered? Lets conſider that. What ſhall we do? Shall we reproach? Shall we throw ſtones? Shall we inſult? Shall we deſpiſe? Shall we judge? <hi>He that hath the Spirit, let him judge.</hi> As concerning the outward <hi>acts,</hi> let the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> do his duty; but he that judgeth, let him ſee that the <hi>beam</hi> be firſt pulled out of his <hi>own</hi> eye: let him ſee that the whore be judged in his <hi>own</hi> heart and burnt <hi>there. He that is without ſin</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>let him throw the firſt ſtone.</hi> What then is to be done? the ſecond verſe of the Chapter ſhews us: and ſhews what theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> evilly did. <hi>They were puft up,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and have not rather mourned, that he that had done this deed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118351:26"/>

The ſin of this perſon was a <hi>ſadding</hi> thing, a ſad ſpectacle; Mourning and confeſſing the root of that evil in their own Spirits, all that baſeneſs and abominable filth in their own hearts, ſhould have been the fruit of this perſons fall. <hi>I know that in me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) that is in my fleſh dwells nothing that is good.</hi> This is that that is to be done, <hi>mourning</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out for the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> that this evil may be <hi>judged,</hi> and that there may be no more of this abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion committed amongſt them.</p>

After we have looked upon this ſame filthineſs that is broken out in one Saint: come and let us ſee ſin in the power of it, and ſeiſing upon the <hi>whole congregation</hi> or Church. There is the Devil among you, and you are proud, high, puft up. High conceits you have of your own excellency, of your good eſtate. We ſee how Saints may fall aſleep in carnal ſecurity, be lifted up in pride, blown up with vain puffs, and ſwell'd with wind, with conceits of goodneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that which is not; made drunk, and intoxicated with high high thoughts of their excellent condition, when as death and hell are among them in great power: Here is the filthineſs of hell among theſe Saints, and yet they are puft up; what a glorious congregation are they? in what an excellent ſtate are they? <hi>Ye are puft up.</hi> The Apoſtles is expreſſing the workings of their hearts in the Chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, 1 Cor. 4. 8. <hi>Now ye are Full, now ye are Rich; Ye have raigned as Kings without us: Ye are wiſe, ye are ſtrong, ye are honorable;</hi> as 'tis in <hi>ver.</hi> 10.

Thus you ſee Carnal ſecurity, and pride among Saints. There is a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſecurity in God: and there is a brave highth of mind, boaſting of God when tis in truth: But this ſame pride is when there is conceit of that that is not. <hi>My ſoul</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) ſhall make her boaſt of God, and the humble ſhall hear thereof and be glad.</hi> The <hi>new mans</hi> ſecurity, and the new mans glory! O that's excellent, that's ſweet. But here was <hi>fleſhly</hi> ſecurity: fleſh exalting it ſelf in conceits of the Spirit: The Devil transforming himſelf into an Angel of <hi>light:</hi> and in this ſtate and condition what wonder is it if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil work at his pleaſure. In ſuch <hi>Miſts,</hi> and Foggs as theſe, the Devil brings into our hearts, and Congregations, all manner of filth and baſeneſs that can be expreſt or thought of. <hi>Fornication not once named among the Gentiles,</hi> brought into a Chriſtian congregation.</p>

We may be all <hi>Overſeers,</hi> and all <hi>overſeen,</hi> al <hi>aſleep.

                     <hi>Be not high-minded</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall.</hi> There be many ſay we are Kings, and we raign!

There is a <hi>worldly</hi> and fleſhly walking in <hi>Church-fellowſhip;</hi> The Devil gets into <hi>that form,</hi> as he hath got into <hi>all others.</hi> We will be wiſe to the <hi>world,</hi> and yet we will be in a <hi>Church,</hi> as the Apoſtle hath it in <hi>ver.</hi> 10. of the foregoing Chapter; <hi>You are wiſe in Chriſt, ſtrong in Chriſt, you are honorable.</hi> This is that that is too too much ſeen in Churches and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. <hi>But we</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are fools for Chriſts ſake, we are weak, we are deſpiſed,</hi> and are content to be ſo: 'Tis Chriſts <hi>croſs</hi> that we bear, and we can rejoyce in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but in this, that we are <hi>fools,</hi> that we are <hi>weak,</hi> that we are <hi>deſpiſed;</hi> But we ſhall appear honorable. <hi>When Chriſt ſhall appear, we ſhall appear with him in glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saints may fall aſleep, fall into carnal ſecurity, be puft up with pride, and ſo be under a great power of the Devil, a great Snare. It may be any Saints caſe; it was a whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches caſe here, and a Church that was gathered by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: Is there not need that we ſhould watch? <hi>Watch and pray that you fall not into temptation.</hi> Is there not need that we ſhould <hi>watch</hi> one over another? Therefore it is that Churches and Congregations are gathered, that there may be <hi>watching;</hi> that ſome may be awake while others <hi>ſleep.</hi> But ſee here what watchmen are if the Lord do not keep the City. The Congregation of Saints are the City of God. Here are men, <hi>watchmen,</hi> and all the <hi>City</hi> aſleep, all intoxicated, all drunken, and lying in carnal ſecurity; the Devil and ſin and death are walking among them, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118351:27"/>
they are not ſenſible of it. 'Tis a ſad thing to think of, that there may be, and are Churches that are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that they may <hi>laze</hi> and <hi>drowſe</hi> together, that they may nouriſh one another in carnal ſecurity, ſtrengthen one another in the world, and in the fleſh: that thinks tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough there is <hi>a form of Godlineſs,</hi> that we are in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowſhip; and ſo lie down together and ſleep, and tis a ſad thing. <hi>I have no quarrel with Churches, or any form, but ſuch as have not the Spirit in them.</hi> Here all are aſleep, aſleep in death: <hi>You are puft up when you ſhould mourn:</hi> and here is <hi>Paul,</hi> he mournes ſo that he wakens them all, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the Spirit of God, comes forth to them in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> wakens them, and raiſeth them up in the Spirit, to take vengeance upon Sathan, upon this ſin, upon the fleſh in this inceſtuous perſon: <hi>Deliver him to Satan for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye are puft up, and have not rather mourned.</hi> Mark here how the Apoſtle charges the whole Church and judges them: and they being judged, he brings them to judge this inceſtuous perſon; And indeed there is no man fit to <hi>judge</hi> till he hath been <hi>under</hi> judgement <hi>himſelf. Ye are puft up.</hi> Firſt he <hi>arraigns</hi> them in the Spirit, judges them, brings them all to mourning, and then he takes them up with him into the Judgement Seat; and ſo they deal with this inceſtuous perſon; they deliver him <hi>from</hi> Sathan by deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him <hi>unto</hi> Sathan. <hi>They deliver him to Sathan for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another thing worthy our thoughts is this; That there may be a partnerſhip in ſin: We may be defiled by <hi>other mens</hi> ſins by partnerſhip, by a partaking. <hi>Partake not of other mens ſins,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy.</hi> There is a partaking of other mens ſins while we ſee them, and are <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> of them: We partake in them by any complyance or ſuting
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118351:28"/>
with them. <hi>You are puft up</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and have not rather mourned. (q. d.)</hi> There is ſuch a perſon among you thus defiled, and you are not aſhamed. Here is the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſin, and whole Churches ſin; as 'tis laid to the charge of the Princes of <hi>Judah, Jer.</hi> 36. 24. that when the King did cut the Roul that <hi>Baruch</hi> had written from the mouth of <hi>Jeremie</hi> (which was the Prophet of the Lord) the Princes they <hi>looked on, and none of them rent their garments;</hi> None of them were ſenſible of that contempt and rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> chap. 5. calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, <hi>not to have fellowſhip with the unfruitfull works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rather reprove them</hi> Mat. 18. 15. This is that which our Savour expreſſes when he ſpeaks of a brother offending.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt. If thy brother offend thee</hi> (ſaith he) whats the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a brothers offending? What is it? If he hath done thee any hurt, or wronged thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay, but this ſame offence by a brother is a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>ſin:</hi> And this doth appear plainly by that that Chriſt commands; If thou haſt told thy brother and reproved him, and ſo haſt wrought upon thy brothers conſcience that he is convinced, thou haſt gained thy brother. So that the ſin of a brother is an <hi>offence</hi> and a wounding unto <hi>all the brethren,</hi> if they be <hi>awakned,</hi> if they live (at that time) if they be not aſleep, as theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were: If they be not in carnal ſecurity, and intoxicated with pride, they ſhall feel a wound in his wound, they ſhall <hi>find a loſs in his loſs;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother.</hi> He doth not ſpeak of any outward wrong for which men go to Law to recover them Right: but when there is a ſenſe of the wound and ſuffering of him that ſins in thee, there is a ſword that pierces thy ſoul while it enters into his; and ſo when thou ſhalt in the Spirit of God go forth to recover
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118351:28"/>
him, and ſhalt be ſucceſsfull, thou haſt gained thy brother, and haſt taken off the offenſe from thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>This ſame offence by anothers ſin: this ſame ſenſe of anothers wounding himſelf, and hurting himſelf, is that the Law of love calls for. We are all <hi>one body,</hi> all the Saints live one life; and ſo while <hi>one</hi> is wounded, <hi>all</hi> are wounded, if life be not buried in us. If we do live indeed, we ſhall find our life hurt in anothers hurting <hi>himſelf.</hi> It is the life of <hi>God</hi> that is in the Saints, and when one ſuffers all ſuffer. There is a partnerſhip in others ſins by not taking notice of them, by a ſenſeleſſneſs. <hi>You are puft up</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and have not rather mourned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is that that concerns us to mind; We are for the moſt part narrowing ſin, making it as ſtrait and as little as we can, to reach as little way as may be; this is a way fleſh hath, to waſh it ſelf, to clear it ſelf, inſtead of fetching the blood of Chriſt to deſtroy it; But here we ſee our own ſin may lie upon us, and another mans ſin alſo; We may partake of ſin while that a brother ſins, and we are ſenſeleſs: while we are puft up, and do not mourn, while we are ſenſeleſs of a ſin committed by a brother, it is a ſin upon us. You ſee then whas it is to have our hearts lifted up in pride and inſulting, when we ſee a brother ſin. There is many a ones Religion is nothing elſe but inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon others faults. <hi>God, I thank thee I am not like other men, nor as this Publican.</hi> Many a man is a brave man when he ſees another man baſe and vile. <hi>We ſhould carry our ſelves in the fleſh as one with all fleſh. We ſhould carry our ſelves in the Spirit as one in the Spirit with all the Saints. Who is weak</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and I am not weak? who is offended and I burn not?</hi> Look upon Jeſus Chriſt, let him be our pattern. <hi>He bare our infirmities and took our ſickneſs.</hi> Therefore look if you can find Jeſus Chriſt in you, that compaſſionate high
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118351:29"/>
prieſt that will not go by the wounded traveller as that Prieſt did in the ſtory of the Goſpel. <hi>Look for Chriſt in you; Know ye not that Chriſt is in you? Prove your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith.</hi> Look for this love and this compaſſion; Look for the ſufferings of Chriſt to be made up in you. <hi>We muſt lay down our lives alſo for the brethren,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> hath it. <hi>All this I do for the Elects ſake,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Here is Chriſt in the Apoſtle; <hi>I fill up the ſufferings of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he to the <hi>Colloſsians) wherein I ſuffer trouble as an evil doer; Wherefore I endure all things for the Elects ſake.</hi> Be not partakers of other mens ſins: There are many ways, and this is one, while we ſee ſin break forth in our brethren, and do not take notice of it, are not affected with it, do not mourn; and ſo we neglect to gain our brother.</p>
                  <p>But there is a third thing that I would commend unto you at this time; and that is, That godly ſorrow and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation for ſin, is that by which ſpiritual perſons, waiting upon God, do receive power from God, to diſcharge their own hearts, and their Congregations ftom ſin and Sathan. <hi>You are puft up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be caſt out from among you.</hi> 'Tis mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that doth it. It is not ſtoutneſs or reſolution, any thing of man that doth it; But it is the power of God which comes into humble ſouls. Godly mourning and humiliation is that that doth bring forth power to reform our own hearts, and our congregations. The proof of this was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſeen among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as you ſhall ſee in the 2. and 7. chap. of the ſecond Epiſtle, where we ſhall read of the Apoſtles mourning upon this occaſion; how by him and his Miniſtry of the Spirit all the whole Church was brought into mourning; and how by this their mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Spirit of God came forth in them in power and light, and ſo they did rid themſelves of this evil that was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118351:29"/>
among them: This inceſtuous perſon was delivered unto Sathan, and there he left the fleſh behind him: he left ſin behind him: He left the Devil with the Devil: He was delivered unto Sathan, and ſo Sathan was deſtroyed in him. Sathan was ſent to Sathan; the Devil was ſent to Hell, and the Spirit came forth; <hi>and the Saint was ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The light and power of God was among them, and came up among them, which enabled them to renounce themſelves, their own ſtrength whereby to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves from that evil; And ſo God he owned them. And the Apoſtle writes to them in the ſecond <hi>chap.</hi> of the ſecond Epiſtle, <hi>that they would comfort that perſon they</hi> had delivered unto Sathan. <hi>You ought now to comfort him,</hi> you ought to reſtore him: For by this ſpiritual humiliation and mourning, they had power from God, both to deliver up the ſinner, and reſtore the Saint. <hi>You ought to comfort him, leaſt he be ſwallowed up of to much ſorrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſame godly ſorrow is the travail-ſorrow Chriſt ſpeaks of <hi>Ioh. 16. 20. You ſhall have ſorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but your ſorrow ſhall be turned into joy. A woman when her hour comes, is in ſorrow, but then ſhe forgets all, becauſe a man child is born.</hi> Thus the man child is born, the Spirit comes forth, and Chriſt comes forth in us by Godly ſorrow, by humiliation in the Spirit. We ſee the proof of this here. And this ſame ſorrow, this ſpiritual humiliation is nothing elſe but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of the holy ſeed in a Saint: 'Tis nothing elſe but the new mans quickning: nothing elſe but Chriſt quickning in us; who being quickned, and ſeeing himſelf to be cloathed and compaſſed with ſuch filth, he cannot bear it, he cannot endure it; He mournes, he cries under it, he will never be at reſt or quiet untill he be delivered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God is at hand to deliver him and to reſcue him. This ſame Godly mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is upon the quickning of the new man in us, of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118351:30"/>
Spirit in us, which will not ſuffer nor indure iniquity; <hi>it luſts againſt the fleſh, the Spirit luſts againſt the fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> You read of the Prodigal how it is ſaid, he came to himſelf. What was that, <hi>he came to himſelf?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This new man, this Divine nature, this holy ſeed, that was carried away in fleſh, in ſin, where 'twas dead (as it were) now is quickned: he comes to himſelf, he cannot endure to be in this ſtate any longer; he falls into a deep mourning, a deep ſenſe how ſad his condition is, that here he ſhould ſerve ſwine, ſerve luſts, that he ſhould be ſo far from God: He remembreth he hath a Father, conſiders that he hath bread enough at home, and here he is in drudgery, hunger and thirſt: have I not a father (ſaith he)? I'le go home to my Father. <hi>He came to himſelf.</hi> This is the quickn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and awaking of the Spiritual Seed, the new man, the new creature in us, that is born of God, knows God, and can never be at quiet as long as fleſh and ſin do raign; <hi>It luſts againſt the fleſh.</hi> This mourning brings in power from God whereby to diſcharge it ſelf from the evil that oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it. <hi>Godly ſorrow</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>works repentance unto Salvation, never to be repented of.</hi> In ſpiritual mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is a kind of dying of fleſh, and denying of fleſh, an owning and honouring of God. The man goes out of himſelf; <hi>I am undone.</hi> He goes out to God; Crying, <hi>My deſtruction is from my ſelf, but in thee is my help.</hi> I am not able to deal with theſe enemies, with Sin, Hell and Death: Now help me Lord. This is the travail of the Soul with Chriſt until he be formed in us. Spititual mourning, Godly mourning, it is the mourning of the Spirit in us, with ſighs and groans not to be expreſſed. There is worldly mourning, and there is Godly mourning. There is <hi>fleſhes</hi> mourning, and <hi>Spirits</hi> mourning: Fleſhes mourning is for Affliction, for trouble: <hi>Take away this plague</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pharoah</hi>)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118351:30"/>
The Spirits mourning is for ſin. <hi>I have done fooliſhly, take away my ſin,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> Fleſhes mourning is ſins mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it would be delivered, it would not be plagued: The Spirits mourning is <hi>againſt ſin:</hi> take away the plague of the heart: Spiritual mourning is, to lament after the Lord. 'Tis ſaid of the children of Iſrael, <hi>They mourned after the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 7. towards the end of the <hi>chap.</hi> This is what the new man doth, the Spiritual man, the heavenly man in us, the new creature when he is awakened, when he is quickned, which indeed is the converſion of a ſinner, the awakning the new man in him; and this new man being the ſeed of God, cannot endure to abide in filth, in the dark, but is making out, making from whence it came, making to his Father, making unto God in mourning, in a deep ſenſe of its wretched condition in darkneſs, in weakneſs, in the power of luſts. <hi>O miſerable man! who ſhall deliver me from this body of death? I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Here was a mighty proof of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> delivering their own hearts, and delivering this perſon, that the Devil had much power over. I had an intent to have enlarged this further, but I will rather break off, and may goe on at another time.</p>

but by faſting and prayer.</hi> By ſpiritual mourning, by earneſt contending with God, by the power of the ſpirit in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wraſtling with God as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, who had power with God, we ſhall obtain power againſt ſin. <hi>Hoſ. 12. He wept and he made ſupplication,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>You will never have power againſt ſin, unleſs you have power over God.</hi> You will never overcome the wicked one, unleſs you firſt overcome God; and God is overcome no way but by his own power, in mourning and ſupplication; 'tis his power made out, when fleſh is denyed, and he is owned. 'Tis by his own power his hands are bound. <hi>Let me go,</hi> ſaith God; <hi>I will not let thee go,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob, until thou bleſs me.</hi> He wept and he made ſupplication, as you may ſee in that fourth of <hi>Hoſea.</hi> This ſame mourning, out of which God comes forth in power againſt ſin, it is the ſpirits mourning, the ſpirit in the Saints, in Sighs and Groans. It is the reviving and quickning of the new man that lay dead in the fleſh; who ſeeing himſelf thus beſmeared, thus impriſoned, thus cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated with ſin and Satan, he is breaking out of it; he cannot have reſt in that ſtate, he ſees he is not at home. Whither am I carryed from my Fathers houſe? ſaith the Prodigal, when he came to himſelf. It is the travel of the ſpiritual man, as Chriſt expreſſes it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 20. in which the man-childe is brought forth, the ſpirit, as it was here in <hi>Paul</hi> and in the Saints, which being brought forth, was able to deal with Satan and with hell, to ſend Satan to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and hell to hell. What doth hell do in a Saint? What doth hell in a Church? Deliver him to Satan, let Satan go to deſtruction, it is his place, it is his portion.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſpiritual mourning, or the ſpirits mourning, is that which brings forth the ſpirits power, and this ſets the ſoul free, and ſets a Church free.</p>
                  <p>Now we ſhould look what we can finde of this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118351:32"/>
this mourning for ſin, this mourning after the Lord. This is not in fleſh and blood to do. All the mourning of fleſh and blood is, that ſin may be ſupplyed. All the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a natural man are, that his luſts may be furniſhed: all his mourning and complaint is, when ſin ſuffers; when godlineſs plays upon ſin, then he cries, then he mourns. The ſpiritual man mourns after the Lord, as 'tis ſaid of the children of <hi>Iſrael, they mourned after the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The natural man mourns for Corn, and Wine, and Oyl. The Lord ſpeaks in the Propheſie of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> of the howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people; <hi>Did you cry to me, when you howled for Corn, and Wine, and Oyle?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that which is the main thing to be obſerved here, is, that no power, or wiſdom of man, or any company of men, any Church, any Rulers, any Elders, can ſet a heart free from ſin, or can cleer their Congregations from ſin; 'tis God that muſt do it; and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Ye have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed, might be taken away from among you.</hi> When that evil is ſeen in your hearts, and in your Churches, what are you to do? know that you cannot deliver your ſelves, you are to mourn until it be done for you: you are to lament after the Lord. O that the Lord would come, that power would come, that he that is great, ſtronger then the ſtrong man, that he would come! We are to wait for the aſſiſtance of Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here the Apoſtle ſpeaks of mourning, You have not mourned as you ſhould do; you ſhould mourn after the Lord, that he would quit you of this ſin, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue you; in the fourth verſe it is plainly ſet forth, <hi>In the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when ye are gathered together, and my ſpirit, with the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is not your power, it is not mans power, that ſhall rid you of the wicked one among you, in your hearts, or in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118351:33"/>
but 'tis the Lord that muſt do it, and therefore you muſt mourn after the Lord. If you be of God, you will mourn after him; and you will never be quiet until his power do come down to reſcue you, and deliver you. This mourning that you may be eaſed of the wicked one, ſhews that it is not in your power. In the ninth of <hi>Mark,</hi> Chriſt went up into a mountain, where he was transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; he took up one or two of his Diſciples with him, and the reſt he left below, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. theſe Diſciples left below, were ſet upon by the Phariſees and that Sect, to tempt them and to try them, that if it might be, they might have a victory over them, a day of them, now their maſter was away: They bring to them, a Father with his child that was poſſeſſed with an evil ſpirit, that uſed him and handled him piteouſly, that threw him ſometimes into the fire, and ſometimes into the water; but the Diſciples were not able to caſt him out; here was great joy and rejoycing among the Phariſees; the Phariſees thought they had had the day; As they were exulting, and baffling the Diſciples, Chriſt he comes down from the Mountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he comes down, he is told what the buſineſs is, <hi>verſ. 17. O faithleſs generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>how low ſhall I be with you! bring him to me.</hi> and he caſt him out. In this ſtory we may ſee how ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous we ſhall make ourſelves, when we offer to ſet upon Satan, or deal with ſin, when we have not the Lord Jeſus with us: we make but ſport for the Devil, and ſport for the world. There is no going forth, but in the power of Chriſt. Doſt thou ſee ſin? Canſt thou go forth in the power of Chriſt againſt it? If thou canſt not, ſit down and mourn till that ſpirit come, till that power come.</p>
                  <p>Sin and Satan are too ſtrong for man, and if we deal with them without God, we do nothing but endeavour by ſin to caſt out ſin, and by Satan to caſt out Satan. To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118351:33"/>
any thing againſt ſin, and have not the Lord with us, is altogether in vain; therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs thou go forth with us, do not carry us out hence.</hi> To go forth in mans power, in the power of a letter of the Scripture only, it is not ſafe. God will not be offended with us, if we will not go forth without full aſſurance of his preſence with us. If he give us ſome aſſurance, we ſhould deſire to have better aſſurance. It is the power of God in which we muſt go out againſt ſin ſucceſsfully. We ſhall never have reſt from ſin and Satan, till we ceaſe from our own works. There is no going forth againſt ſin, but in the power of Chriſt. <hi>You ought rather to have mourned, that he which hath done this deed, might be taken away from among you.</hi> Look upon hearts, look upon Churches, they are both the Temple of God, the Houſe of God; let God rule in his own houſe, he hath the power there. The Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own hearts, and of Churches, it is by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ſpirit of God. <hi>It is not in man to direct his ways.</hi> Man is weak, he is corrupt; man and Satan in this reſpect are one.</p>
                  <p>Now the queſtion will be, If there be no going forth againſt ſin, but in the power of the ſpirit, where is this power that reforms Congregations? where is this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Spirit? where are theſe ſpiritual weapons mighty through God to caſt down high thoughts, and ſtrong imaginations?</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is, It is confeſſed that the power of the ſpirit of God hath been and is yet very little abroad; and therefore we ſee men go forth againſt ſin and Satan, and effect nothing; they make nothing but ſport. There is little ſavour of life, or ſavour of death to be ſeen in the Miniſtery of men: little binding, or looſing; little open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heaven, or ſhutting heaven; very little forgiving ſins,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118351:34"/>
or retaining ſins in mens Conſciences, we know very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle but a noiſe and a form in theſe things. Moſt men that take upon them to do this, they are put to it (becauſe of the weakneſs of their Miniſtery, whatever brags they make) to go to the civil Magiſtrate to back them. This ſame power of the Lord Jeſus, whereby ſin and Satan are thrown out of mens hearts, is now but in a very low mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation, and very rarely appears.</p>
                  <p>But what is to be done then?</p>
                  <p>Not that that is uſually done; we muſt not go out as vaunting that we have that which we have not, as pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpirit and the power of Chriſt with us, when there is no ſuch thing. We have done ſo a long time, and the people have been deceived; we have done it, and have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected nothing; but take heed of continuing this practiſe; Remember, when the Spirit was abroad, what befell them that uſed this practice. In the nineteenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> The Exorciſts took upon them to command the evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the name of Jeſus, <hi>We adjure you by Jeſus whom Paul preacheth; and the evil Spirit anſwered and ſaid, Jeſus we know, and Paul we know, but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil ſpirit was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leap'd on them and overcame them, and prevailed againſt them, ſo that they fled out of that houſe naked and wounded.</hi> God hath winked a great while, but he will not bear as he hath done. When he comes forth again, men ſhall not take his name in vain as they have done. That which concerns us to do, is to ſit down in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and mourn, as the Apoſtle hath it here; and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confeſs and acknowledge, that that power of the ſpirit that hath appeared, doth not appeare now. We do not finde that able Miniſtery of the New-Teſtament now, that hath been. We plainly ſee that Scripture, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. fullfilled of the Spirits drawing in, that the man of ſin
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118351:34"/>
might be revealed; and truly, the man of ſin hath been ſo much revealed, and the darkneſs hath been ſo great, as we have not ſeen the darkneſs; but now that the ſpirit is returning, we begin to ſee where we were; we begin to ſee what fools and mad mens parts we have acted; how we have gon forth in the name of ſpirit, and brought forth nothing; how we have made our ſelves ridiculous to thoſe that did obſerve and mark what the effect was: but now we ſee it is the time of the Apoſtaſie indeed, and ſhall look forth for that power of the ſpirit that hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the Primitive times, that ſhall return again, and not onely bridle and keep down Antichriſt, but deſtroy the man of ſin; till we ſhall ſee this power come forth, let us ſit down in ſilence; for in all our own acting and talking, we are but Sorcerers and Enchanters without this power. There is now a low adminiſtration of the ſpirit, and we wait when the ſpirit will be more manifeſt; we are looking after him when he will come: and this is that that concerns us to do, to ſit down in ſilence, and mourn. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> mourned after the Lord when the Ark was in the Philiſtines hands: it hath been ſo now for theſe fifteen hundred yeers. When we lament after the Lord, ſurely then the time is that the Lord is coming forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. When we acknowledge what man is, that we have no ſtrength, <hi>Out of weak we ſhall be made ſtrong, and the Lord whom we look for will ſuddainly come into his Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we were out of our pride, out of our puffe, out of our vaunting, and were come to lie in the duſt, to put our mouths there, and ſay, we have no ſtrength, God hath left us, O Lord, when wilt thou return again to us? When we are thus mourning, ſurely then the time is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this power will come forth again, and that in a greater manifeſtation then ever it yet appeared. <hi>Out of weak we ſhall become ſtrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:118351:35"/>It is not in any mans wiſdom or ſtrength to caſt ſin out of his own heart, or out of any Church or Congregation. When we ſee we cannot do it, and ſit down and mourn that the Lord would come, and be preſent with us as he hath been formerly, ſurely he will come. This is that we ought to do, <hi>Ye ought rather to mourn.</hi> All our teaching, perſwading and exhorting, is to be in great humility; in a ſenſe of our own poorneſs and weakneſs, and of Gods long withdrawing, waiting for any appearance of his, though but a low appearance. God hath been working, and acting all this time of Antichriſt, but in great obſcurity and under ground, and now we are looking when he will come forth again: for the brightneſs of his coming is that which will deſtroy that man of ſin, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You ought rather to have mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</hi> 'Tis the Lords work, and not mans. And let's compare this rule with our practice particularly. Men when they ſee the devil got into their hearts, and would be rid of him, what do they do? They faſt and pray, and go forth in the ſtrength of this duty and the other duty. But what is to be done? Why wait until power come; wait till the Lord come; wait that the evil one may be caſt out, and do not think you can caſt him out your ſelves. And in Churches, what is done? We look that the Officers and Elders ſhould rid us of the wicked one, and that the major part of the Church and Aſſembly, their Vote ſhould do it; and what the major part of the Church concludes, that we look upon as the work of the ſpirit; and ſo there is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſt; but where is the power? Nay, going a long with the ſentence, oftentimes you caſt out Chriſt, and caſt out the truth, and ſo come to another kinde of Popery, a new kinde of Popery: while you ſet up in the place of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118351:35"/>
the ſpirit, any man, or any Aſſembly of men, what ever they be, you ſet up a Pope. Our work is to mourn if the ſpirit be not preſent; if he be preſent, to go forth in his power, and in his might. And then the effect will be, the devil will flee, and ſin will flee. O how glorious things are Churches that hold out the power of the Lord Jeſus! O what priſons are Churches where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but forms, nothing but luſt and Satan, and the world and fleſh, that act and rule under them! O how glorious things are Churches in whom Chriſt hath a Throne, and where we ſee ſpiritual power! But where do we ſee it now? Churches that are the light of the world, and the ſalt of the earth, where ſhall we finde them? It is not by any power or wiſdom of man, whereby ſin is caſt out of any particular heart, or out of a Church or Congregation. <hi>You ought rather to have mourned. Paul</hi> he had mourned, and he profeſſes elſewhere in what deep ſorrow he wrote unto them, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 2. In deep ſorrow and abundance of tears he wrote unto them, being ſenſible of this condition in which they were; and the ſpirit of power came forth in his mourning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to awaken them, to ſet them a mourning, and to cauſe them to come forth in power to ſave the ſpirit of this defiled perſon, by the deſtroying of the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>That which is <hi>Pauls</hi> part follows in the next words, <hi>v. 3. For I verily as abſent in body, but preſent in ſpirit, have judged already as though I were preſent, concerning him that hath ſo done this deed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle judges, and he judges being abſent. Firſt, What had the Apoſtle to do to judge? He was neither Officer nor member of that Congregation. To this we have to ſay, that the Apoſtles were members and Officers of every Congregation, in every Church. The Apoſtle
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118351:36"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> was the Miniſter of the Gentiles, the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, of the Gentile Church: the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> went forth in the ſpirit, and the ſpirit hath power in every Church, in every Congregation. The Apoſtle went forth in the power of Chriſt, and every Church ſhall bow to him: he is their King, he is their Lord; and all the Churches if they be true Churches, they are one body, and that Church or Congregation gathered, that doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Chriſt, and ſhut up it ſelf from other Saints, and from the General Aſſembly, is ſo far forth an Antichriſtian Church; That particular Aſſembly, that doth not own the univerſal Aſſembly, and <hi>the general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> (the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.) is ſo far forth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian. That Church which is nothing but form, that hath no power of God in it (manifeſted in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs) that Church which doth not own all Saints under any form, that Church ſo far forth is not of Chriſt: the Church of Chriſt owns all forms, and all Saints. The Apoſtle had to do here, for the ſpirit hath to do every where: the ſpirit is free; he comes forth in the ſpirit; to whomſoever he comes forth, he ſhall be owned; he comes forth in power, he comes forth either to life or to death; he comes not forth in vain. This for the Apoſtles right, if any ſay, What had he to do here?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Apoſtle is abſent, how could he judge? he hears a report, <hi>'Tis commonly reported;</hi> but common report is a horrible lyer; the devil is the Prince of the Ayre, and he is in it. Every man makes his report according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; it gathers ſtill, is changed ſtill, is transformed ſtill. We have experience hereof dayly; how then could the Apoſtle judge? <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have judged already.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Why he gives an account of that in theſe words, <hi>abſent in body, but preſent in ſpirit.</hi> When we are more in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118351:36"/>
the ſpirit, we ſhall be better able to underſtand and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what this preſence in ſpirit is. When we are not ſo much in the body as we are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the body is not ſo much our home, but we are more in the Lord, and the Lord is more our home, we ſhall be able to pronounce what this is, to be preſent in ſpirit. But a little now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that we have received, preſent and abſent, <hi>abſent in body, preſent in ſpirit.</hi> We have the ſame ſpeech, 2 <hi>Col. 5. Abſent in body, preſent in ſpirit, joying and beholding your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> &amp;c. Well, what is it to be preſent in ſpirit? A natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man will interpret it according to his meaſure and his line, and will not ſuffer it to be extended further then this, <hi>he thought of them,</hi> or he was with them in thought; he knows no other preſence of ſpirit then this, and will allow no more. And ſo we interpret all the matters of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our comprehenſion; we make that our ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard. But the ſpiritual man goes further. <hi>He that is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord is one ſpirit.</hi> The Apoſtle was preſent with the Lord, who is everywhere.</p>
                  <p>In communion with the Lord he was there and did ſee, and ſo did judge. As in that place <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaith to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Gehazi, 2 King. 5. 26. Went not my ſpirit with thee, when the man turned back again to thee?</hi> He that is joyned to the Lord is one ſpirit. <hi>Eliſha</hi> he ſaw in the Lord: it was not onely his thoughts went with <hi>Gehazi,</hi> but he was preſent with him in ſpirit, and ſaw what he did, and told him what he did. <hi>Went not my heart with thee, when the man turned to meet thee?</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is it a time to receive mony, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive garments, and Olive-yards, and Vineyards? I in them, and they in me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt in <hi>John 17. that they may be perfect in One.</hi> God takes up his Saints into his own om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſciencie, and clouds himſelf in his peoples weakneſs and ignorance. There is a Union between God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118351:37"/>
God in them, and they in him; through this Union they ſee as God doth, and through this Union God he ſees as they do. Here <hi>Paul</hi> ſees as <hi>Eliſha</hi> doth, that which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from his body; his body is abſent, but he is preſent in ſpirit. There is the ſpirit that ſees all, knows all; <hi>Yet as to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion which he is in with us, he is ignorant, and he hears and hearkens, and liſps, and ſpeaks as he is taught.</hi> Joh. 16. 13. <hi>When the ſpirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth, for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf.</hi> He that is of himſelf, <hi>ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf;</hi> the eternal truth, the everlaſting God, that is of himſelf, ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf; <hi>Whatever he ſhall hear, that he ſhall ſpeak.</hi> He that teacheth you, ſhall hearken in you, learn in you, be as you. Here is the condiſcending of the ſpirit of truth, ſo that Scripture is not to be interpreted or explained but by that myſtery of union, which is a myſtery the world doth not know, cannot underſtand. He that knows all things, ſo condeſcends, that in that union with us he knows nothing, and learns with us; and by that union with him, we are lifted up into his Omniſciency; We in his light are preſent in ſpirit, when we are abſent in body. Thus God is in Chriſt, and is made ſin for us, that we may be made the righteouſneſs of God in him: we in his ſtrength, he in our weakneſs. Reject this and reject Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. The Apoſtle here, he ſees and he judges in the Lord; he is abſent and yet he judges. Doth the Apoſtle go upon common fame? He is but a fool that does ſo; there is no wiſe man would do it. <hi>But he is preſent in ſpirit,</hi> and through that ſpirit, by which he was preſent, he had a capacity to judge. <hi>Being preſent in ſpirit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have ſeen and judged alread.</hi> God comes down into our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and he lifts us up into his enlargement. And take notice of it, here are ſome hints of it here in one that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118351:37"/>
had the firſt fruits of the ſpirit; how that God will bring forth his Omniſciency, his wiſdom and his power in his Saints and people. <hi>God hath choſen his people to his own kingdom and glory. The glory thou haſt given me, I have given them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt in the ſeventeenth of <hi>John.</hi> God will bring forth his Omniſciency and his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in his people; in believers. The Apoſtle deſcribes his coming, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. viz. <hi>to be glorified [in] his Saints, and to be admired [in all] them that do believe.</hi> Where do you look for him? You look up, that he ſhould come in the clouds. He comes in the clouds indeed; he comes in the fleſh of his Saints, a deſpiſed people, a reproached people; he is covered in their weakneſs, but he will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up their weakneſs in his glory; and here he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his Omniſciency; here he will exerciſe his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. <hi>Do you not know that the Saints ſhall judge the world?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2. Reject this, and reject Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as I ſaid before: By this union between God and the Saints, and Gods manifeſting himſelf in his Saints, exerciſing his kingdom, exerciſing his univerſal Judicature in them, <hi>the Saints ſhall judge the world; Do ye not know that ye ſhall judge the world and judge Angels?</hi> There is no right judge but the Lord; and there is no man that is fit to judge till the Lord be riſen in him. <hi>The ſpiritual man judgeth all things;</hi> ſo far forth as he is ſpiritual, he judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things; ſo far forth as he is carnal, he is not fit to judge any thing. The carnal judgement condemns the Spirit, paſſes judgement upon God, rejects God. The Saints are growing up into the Omniſciency, and Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of God. God is now deſpiſed in them, but God ſhall be glorified in them. God bears their weakneſs, but they ſhall be cloathed upon with his power. Chriſt is in every Saint, and the Father hath committed all judgement
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118351:38"/>
unto him, who doth not judge by the ſight of the eye, or the hearing of the ear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 4. So <hi>Paul</hi> did not judge now by the ſight of the eye, or hearing of the ear that is bodily; he neither went by common fame, neither did his bodily preſence help him to diſcern the buſineſs; but he was preſent in ſpirit, and in the light of God, in the wiſdom of God, in the power of God he did ſee and did judge. <hi>I already have judged, though abſent in body, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in ſpirit.</hi> There is no true judgement that paſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens Conſciences but by the ſpirit. Men that can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge by the outward appearance, can never judge righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgement; you cannot judge righteous judgement till you are led within the vail, till you ſee principles, till you not onely ſee what is done, but ſee upon what grounds it is done, till you ſee <hi>the root of the matter.</hi> The Apoſtle cares not for mans judgement; <hi>He that judgeth me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the people of God, they are Princes, they are Kings: <hi>God hath called us to his own kingdom, and to his own glory,</hi> as the Apoſtle hath it; And therefore <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 12. it is ſaid, <hi>I will write upon them the Name of my God, and the name of the City of my God, and I will write upon them my new name;</hi> ſo God will bring forth his glory in his people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſing what he hath done, he calls unto the whole Church to joyn with him, and aſſures them they ſhal have his aſſiſtance; his aſſiſtance and the power of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>When you are gathered together, and my ſpirit with the power of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Do you judge as I have done. The power of the Lord Jeſus will lead you to it, and you ſhall come forth in that power actually to deliver him to Satan. You ſee by the effects, this was not bare words, this was not a bug-bear. But that is it we ſee in Churches
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118351:38"/>
and Congregations among us, that take upon them this; it hath no effect, no power. And therefore if they have to deal with a Saint, he pities them, is ſorry for them, wiſhes they had more light; if with one that is not a Saint, he jeers them, he ſcorns them.</p>
                  <p>But here is reality; this Inceſtuous perſon felt hell in his Conſcience, ſaw he was in the power of the devil; he was even ſwallowed up with ſorrow. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls upon them to relieve him, and this is to ſave him (<hi>q d.</hi>) look now if the fleſh be deſtroyed, then bring out the ſpirit and comfort him, <hi>you ought to relieve him.</hi> Here you ſee the power of the Lord Jeſus, he commands hell and death; he commands Satan, Take that that is thine, and then give up that thou haſt nothing to do withal. Deſtroy the fleſh, deliver up the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>This makes ſport for wicked men to come out with thundring and lightning in the abſence of power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This ſhould ſet us to mourn for the ſpirit. How little is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the ſpirit in our own Conſciences? How much leſs can we manifeſt it to others? It is then time for us to mourn after the Lord. And if we were come to mourn after him, we ſhould ſoon come to rejoyce with him, and make our boaſt of him.</p>

But before we come to that, I ſhall obſerve two or three things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, There is no dealing in the Conſciences of men, neither our own nor others, againſt ſin and Satan, when they ſhew their power there, in the power and wiſdom of man; unleſs we go forth in the power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it is to no purpoſe; Tis only the power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that delivers the Conſciences and Hearts of men fron ſin and Satan: therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Iudge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before the time till the Lord come. Saul</hi> was not to fight with the Philiſtims till <hi>Samuel</hi> came. To go forth againſt ſin, when the Lord is not with us, it hath this iſſue, nothing but foiling, nothing but ſcorning, nothing but reproach and ſhame. <hi>With the power of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> To mention the name of the Lord Jeſus, and not to have the power of the Lord Jeſus, is nothing but prophaning
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118351:40"/>
that name, taking it in vain: 'Tis nothing but a bug-bear. All mans power, it is on the body, it is not on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. It is impoſſible man ſhould deliver himſelf or his brother from one error, from one ſin: all that he can do, is, to reſtrain and lock up ſin; all that man can do in matter of error and ſin, is, to bring forth Hypocriſie: It is Gods prerogative to faſhion hearts, and to know hearts. <hi>Pſal. 13. He faſhioneth their hearts alike, and underſtandeth all their thoughts.</hi> And this is that God will make all the Churches to know, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. the latter end. <hi>All the Churches ſhall know that I the Lord ſearch the heart and try the reines.</hi> If the Churches go forth with Carnal weapons, to deal with the Devil and ſin in their own power, they ſhall know that this is the Lords prerogative; It is only he that ſearches hearts, and tries reines; They ſhall find they have done nothing, whatever they have ſeemed to themſelves to have done; They ſhall find they have confirmed and ſettled the Devil in his habitation, while they have ſeemed to throw him out. <hi>I have the keyes</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>of Hell and of death:</hi> The keys are the power, the power of man is not able to conflict with Sathan and Hell: Chriſt hath received all power in Heaven and Earth: And Chriſt manifeſted in us, we ſhall go forth againſt principalities and powers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Rulers of the darkneſs of this world: <hi>with the power of the Lord Jeſus. The weapons of our warfare are not carnal</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but mighty through God.</hi> The new Teſtament is the Miniſtry of the Spirit, and ſo tis an able Miniſtry. <hi>God hath made us able Miniſters of the new Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit.</hi> Letter and man, and noiſe of words could never yet ſcare the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
                  <p>This we ſpake of before, taking occaſion from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calling the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to mourn, which doth tell us
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118351:40"/>
they had no power of themſelves. 'Tis a profeſſing they had no power. We cannot rid our Conſciences or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of ſin: But if we wait, power will come in; And when we once come out of this deluſion of the Devil, to ſee we have no power, to ſee how the Spirit of power hath withdrawn from us, and hath been abſent a long while, we ſhall begin to mourn after him, and he will vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit us, and then we ſhall know what power is again. We ſhall know what the Kingdom of God is, that is not in word but in power; We have hitherto known little of any Kingdom but in word. When once we are ſenſible of this want of power, and of this withdrawing of God, that the man of ſin might be revealed, we ſhall mourn after him, till he turn to us again. 'Tis by the power of the Lord Jeſus only: This is allowed and granted everywhere as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; but how little do we act according to our Principles? The Spirit of God only can throw out error and ſin; this is granted; But the will of man, and the actings of man, this ſhall be called the Spirit of God. The pride of man comes forth which is nothing but the Devil; the name of the Lord Jeſus that is put upon it. To walk and act according to that Principle, the Spirit of God; Not we but the grace of God: We live not, but Chriſt in us; 'Tis looked upon as that which tends to confuſion: as that which lays by all mans gifts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 'Tis ſaid then, what, will ye throw off your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, your Teachers?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, We have but one Maſter, but one teacher, that is Chriſt, that is the Spirit. <hi>Ye have the annointing that teaches you all things, and need not any mans teaching.</hi> 'Tis not mans teaching we look after now, if we underſtand ourſelves, but we look if we can find the name
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118351:41"/>
of God, the power of God, in the ſpeakings of men. God holds forth his anointing in man, gives us a proof of Chriſt in man; But take mans Miniſtry, and all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if the Spirit be not there, if the anointing be not there, they are of man, they are nothing: So you ſee it is the power of the Lord Jeſus only that rids Conſciences and Congregations from ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the name of the Lord Ieſus, when you are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with my ſpirit and the power of the Lord Ieſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place take notice of this, That the Lord Jeſus and his power is in all Saints as well as in Miniſters. The Apoſtles Spirit joynes with them when they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together. The whole Church, men and women, the ſimpleſt as well as the wiſeſt, the weakeſt as well as the ſtrongeſt, with the power of the Lord Jeſus. The power of the Lord Jeſus goes with you if you cenſure him, and therefore my Spirit ſhall be with you. <hi>In the name, &amp;c.</hi> So the power of the Lord Jeſus is in every Saint, acts there and manifeſts it ſelf there, at the pleaſure of the Lord Jeſus. It is the Spirit that makes Miniſters: and thoſe Miniſters that are made by the Spirit, do miniſter the Spirit. And that is miniſtring the Goſpel when we Miniſter the Spirit. But if we have only the Letter of the Goſpel, we have that that is no better then the Law. If we be able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, it is in the Spirit. I am a Miniſter of the New Teſtament ſo far as the Spirit ſpeaks in me, and by me: and I would not be owned any further; And all my work is to prove if the Spirit of God will go forth into any heart while I ſpeak. I know that <hi>Paul</hi> is nothing, and <hi>Apollo</hi> is nothing. If we be a ſweet Savour of Chriſt, then we are ſomething. In whomſoever the ſpirit ſtands up and ſpeaks, that perſon for that time is a Miniſter, a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118351:41"/>
The Spirit doth not regard Sexes, the Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not Age, Learned or unlearned: 'Tis not Age, nor Sex, nor any Major part can Miniſter Spirit; but whom the Spirit pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> The Spirit will not teach by a woman. For it is ſaid let not a woman ſpeak in the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Where the Spirit doth not teach, 'tis but a womans teaching. So far as we ſpeak, and ſpeak not by the Spirit, the woman ſpeaks, who is commanded ſilence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And my Spirit, with the power of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The Apoſtles Spirit would own the meaneſt of the Saints, and the power of the Lord Jeſus in them. There are, in whom the Spirit acts and Miniſters more conſtantly: and there are, in whom he doth Miniſter occaſionally; there are whom the Spirit of God hath made Overſeers. <hi>Acts 20. Look to the flock over which the Holyghoſt hath made you Overſeers.</hi> Every one of that flock muſt judge what he hears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now there is no judging but by the Spirit. <hi>Iudge ye what I ſay.</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. God makes all his people Prophets; and pours his Spirit in ſome degree upon them. Every one that is a Chriſtian is annointed: his name Chriſtian imports ſo much; Do not give the name and deny the thing. <hi>He hath made us Kings and Prieſts by his blood.</hi> When <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> did Propheſie in the Camp, the Devil ſtarts up in a good mans heart and ſaith, <hi>My Lord Moſes, forbid them.</hi> But what anſwers <hi>Moſes? I would to God all the Lords people were Prophets.</hi> There is a further manifeſtation of the Spirit deſired, where there is any manifeſtation already. I would they were all Prophets, and that God would pour out his Spirit upon them. We have the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt too too much with reſpect of perſons. The power of the Lord Jeſus goes forth with all his Saints, the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118351:42"/>
meaneſt of them, and out of the mouth of Babes and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings he ordains ſtrength. Gods people are his Temple, they are his houſe, they are all living ſtones. And its ſaid, <hi>Gods train did fill the temple,</hi> in that viſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. Gods people are his body; Now as tis in the natural body, there is not one member, not the leaſt in which the Soul doth not act: ſo in this ſpiritual body, there is not one, not the meaneſt in which the life of the Spirit is not, more or leſs: Though there be ſome more Principal parts (as in the natural body) yet God is in all: the life and power of the Lord Jeſus is in all: They live becauſe he lives. And therefore the Apoſtle in Church meetings (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.) would have them ſpeak one by one; and in the Jews Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agogue the cuſtome was to give liberty if any had a word of Exhortation to ſpeak, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. But now there is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and quenching the Spirit by many; They cry loe here and loe there, here are Ancient men, learned men, wiſe men, the major part of the company, here are the Elders. But let's hear the Spirit, let's hear the Lord: What ſaith the Lord? the power of the Lord Jeſus is in the meaneſt of Saints. The world doth not know the Spirit; and ſince the Spirit hath drawn in from open appearance, are there not Chriſtians that do not know whether there be a Holy Ghoſt or no? In this time of the withdrawing of the Spirit, the manner hath been to ſet up ſuch and ſuch men, and upon theſe to fix the Spirit: to ſet up gifts, parts; to ſet up men ſo trained up, ſo taught at the feet of <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel;</hi> as the Scribes and Phariſees they challenged the truth, that they had it, and none elſe. When God annoints <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> &amp; ſends him to preach among the People, what ſay the Prieſts there? <hi>Come, let's deviſe devices againſt Ieremie; the Law ſhall not periſh from the Prieſts, and words from the wiſe.</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:118351:42"/>
So we heap up teachers to our ſelves, ſo qualified, ſo garbed, and here we fix the Spirit: Here are <hi>the lips that muſt preſerve knowledge;</hi> here we muſt ſeek the Law. So when Chriſt came, the Phariſees they oppoſed him, and ſaid of his Diſciples, <hi>This people that know not the Law are accurſed.</hi> We have even forgot the teaching of the Spirit, which is the only gift, and we know nothing but mans teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>For a little while there was the Spirits appearance after Chriſts aſcention; and when he began to withdraw, then the world ſet up a Pope; and this Pope (forſooth) hath the Spirit, and is infallible, and he is the viſible Judge, his determinations they muſt ſtand. After the world was weary of this Idol, and ſaw what a thing a Pope was, then one ſets up one thing, another ſets up another: When <hi>Moſes</hi> is gone into the mount, they muſt make ſome Calfe or other to worſhip. One ſets up this Miniſter, another ſets up that Miniſter: another ſets up an Aſſembly of Miniſters; and that which moſt men look at for guidance and direction in matter of Conſcience, is, ſuch men, ſuch a line, ſuch a ſucceſſion of men in Orders, train'd up at the Vniverſity, not looking after the power of the Lord Jeſus. Where is there a ſpirit that joyns with mean and ſimple people, that know the Lord Jeſus, and that look for him? Moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, they fetch their Religion from the Miniſter that they affect; O he is a godly man. Thus did Profeſſors among the Jews, they ſtuck to the Prieſts, to the Phariſees and Scribes, and ſtumbled at Chriſt. So 'tis now; the world, they fetch their Religion from the State; what the State eſtabliſhes, that they bow down to; that is the way with the generality of people, and hath been for this long while; we ſet up Maſters and Teachers, and this is nothing elſe but ſetting up Antichriſt. Hath not this been the main
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118351:43"/>
buſineſs of Miniſters generally to draw Diſciples after them; to bring people into their form, into their cut and garb. O but where, where is the Spirit? The world doth not know the Spirit. Chriſt, the Carpenter; and <hi>Amos</hi> the gatherer of wild <hi>Siccamores;</hi> and the Apoſtles, fiſhermen that came forth in the power of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, were not owned in their time: no more are thoſe own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in whom God comes forth now. But Chriſt rejoyces in ſpirit that thoſe things are hid from the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and revealed to babes. Churches and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they are Lorded over by their Miniſters: and how few Miniſters be there that are examples to the flock; but ſet themſelves as <hi>Lords over Gods heritage.</hi> And that which we would have (however we deny it in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet we contend for in the practiſe) is, that our voice and judgement ſhould be the Key that ſhould open and ſhut: that ſhould determine and reſolve: the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit, who looks after that?</p>
                  <p>The devil he changes forms continually; and therefore can deceive men, let them take what form they pleaſe, let them have a Pope, or a Miniſter, or an Aſſembly of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, what they will; if they do not like one Pope, let them take another: this is nothing but ſetting up Antichriſt that man of ſin in the Temple of God, in our hearts and Conſciences; that man of ſin that is to be deſtroyed; <hi>whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the brightneſs of his coming. He that defiles the Temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy,</hi> 2 Cor 3. where the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of their admiring of men, <hi>One ſaith, I am of Paul; another ſaith I am of Apollo; a third ſaith, I am of Cephas. Who is Paul?</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and who is Apollo? Are ye not the Temple of God? and he that defiles the Temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy.</hi> He that ſets up any man, any parts, any gifts in the place of God, this is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file

the Temple of God: This is the ſecond point.</p>
                  <p>There is a third.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>When ye are gathered together, and my ſpirit, with the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whereſoever the power of the Lord Jeſus goes, let it be with babes and ſucklings, there ſhall the Apoſtles Spirit go; let their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance be what it will in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the power of our Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The power of the Lord Jeſus it is, or it ſhall be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted among his people in their communion, and in their gatherings together.</p>
                  <p>The power of the Lord Jeſus it is, but O how dark is it yet! It ſhall be gloriouſly manifeſted in the Aſſemblies of his Saints, in their gatherings together. <hi>When ye are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together:</hi> The people ſhall ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

When the ſpirit came down upon the Diſciples after Chriſts Aſcenſion, it was in their convening, when they were aſſembled together; for Chriſt charged them there to wait, and they ſhould receive power.</p>
                  <p>When they are together, they are a body of living ſtones, built up an holy Temple: they are members apart: altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the body and the fulneſs of Chriſt: and all the Saints have one life and one ſoul; every joynt ſupplieth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the effectual working of the meaſure of every part: as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The main is in the ſpirit; <hi>with my ſpirit,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus, when ye are gathered together and my ſpirit.</hi> The gathering together of ſpirits; I do not ſay without bodies; but this is the main; the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is that which is born of God, that which God acts, [<hi>whom I ſerve in my ſpirit</hi>] 'tis the new man: fleſh the devil acts, and corrupt principles the devil acts: there are gatherings together in that, there are gatherings together where the power of Satan is; it is a pittiful thing to get into a Church gathering, and there ſit down; now I may be at reſt and eaſe; but this is a gathering in ſpirit; in the unity of the ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is a gathering in him and to him: and in this gathering a waiting for him; no man ſhall be heard, no man ſhall be Lord; there is but one Maſter, one Lord, one King, one guide, and here we are together wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he will ſay; it is no matter what this man ſays or that man ſaith: Doth Chriſt ſpeak in him?</p>
                  <p>We look for the demonſtration of the ſpirit: 'tis no matter what this man ſaith, or the other man ſaith. We wait for power and evidence for God to go before us in a pillar of ſmoak, and in a pillar of fire. 'Tis a ſpirit-gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where the power of the Lord Jeſus is. There is a fleſh-gathering, a formal-gathering, which is nothing but a cover of Satan, a cover of the devil. When ye are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and my ſpirit with the power of the Lord Jeſus; a gathering together in the unity of the ſpirit; and this unity of the ſpirit doth not regard form; it joyns with all Saints whatſoever in ſpirit, under what form ſoever; and this is a particular Aſſembly in reference to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly. God is their Judge; it is a gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe that have made a Covenant by ſacrifice, as it is in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50. They have given up themſelves to the Lord, &amp; they will be only guided by him. They know what man

is; here goeth the power of the Lord Jeſus with ſuch ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings; O that we could finde ſuch and ſee ſuch, we ſhould ſoon ſee the power of the Lord Ieſus; If we have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip one with another, the blood of Chriſt cleanſes us. It is this fellowſhip that hath power in it, cleanſing in it; ſuch gatherings as are in the power of God, and ſuch gatherings as wait for the power of God; ſuch gatherings where man lays himſelf down; we wait what the Lord will ſay; we will not ſtir without the ſpirit; It is not a letter ſhall guide us, nor a man ſhall guide us, but the Lord.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is the Apoſtles direction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a gathered Church, how to quit themſelves of one that had done a foul fact, of the evil one among them, to deliver themſelves from that evil, and to ſave the perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when ye are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and my ſpirit, with the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver ſuch a one,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>1. 'Tis onely in the power of the Lord Jeſus, that any Churches or Conſciences are delivered from guilt; it is not in the power and wiſdom of man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:118351:45"/>2. And this power Chriſt will manifeſt in all believers, in all his people, in all his Saints; he comes with all his Saints as well as Miniſters. The Apoſtles ſpirit joyns with them: <hi>and my ſpirit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the power of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. And the power of the Lord Jeſus whenever it ſhall be manifeſted, will be eſpecially made out in the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Saints, when they are gathered in ſpirit. A fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathering is when we have the power of the devil with us.</p>
                  <p>But to theſe words in <hi>ver.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To deliver ſuch a one unto Satan for the deſtruction of the fleſh.</hi> To deſtroy the evil principle, and to ſave the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; here's a way which the world doth not know; when the world ſees ſin, it thinks of the deſtroying the perſon; therefore it goes forth in the evil principle againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Here's a way now to deſtroy the evil, and ſave the perſon; the ſpirit of God onely can teach us this, <hi>tis the power of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is the means that is to be uſed, <hi>delivering unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;</hi> and the end of that means, <hi>that the fleſh may be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſpirit ſaved.</hi> And here is that that <hi>doth deſtroy fleſh and ſave the ſpirit, and that is the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The manifeſtation of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>in the day of his power; by the power of the Lord Jeſus deliver ſuch a one to Satan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Satan is the enemy of God; he dwells in wrath, he dwells in fire; Deliver him unto him; Into that wrath, and into that fire; caſt him into thoſe flames; there let him fry. Where Satan is deſtroying, there let Satan be deſtroyed that is in him, and let the Saint come forth.</p>
                  <p>Deliver him unto Satan <hi>for the deſtruction of the fleſh.</hi> Here is a piece of Diſcipline that is the priviledge of a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118351:46"/>
Saint, it looks terribly, but it is for ſalvation, <hi>that the ſpirit may be ſaved.</hi> Here is deſtruction in it, but deſtruction is for ſalvation. There are that are Satans; let them be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him; there they abide, they return no more; there is that that returns again, that <hi>the ſpirit may be ſaved.</hi> The devil takes his own, meddles with nothing elſe; the fleſh deſtroyed, the ſpirit ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Deliver him to Satan; how is that? that is, let him ſee that he is in Satans hands: that he is drudging in his work: that he is a vaſſal of his in this inceſt that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; let him ſee this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> Why but he was in Satans hands, under Satans power in the commiſſion of this evil; what then is this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering to Satan?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let him ſee it, and let him feel it; let him feel hell, and feel wrath; let him finde the flames about him. And ſo I look upon that Scripture in <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8. to be the interpretation of this Scripture. <hi>The Spirit ſhall convince of ſin, and of righteouſneſs, and of judgement.</hi> Here is the power of the Lord Jeſus, the ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>v.</hi> 4. by this there is a Delivery unto Satan, a conviction of ſin, that the fleſh may be deſtroyed, and the ſpirit may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that righteouſneſs and judgement may come forth. This is convincing of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Deliver him to Satan, tie him faſt by a ſpirit of bondage, fill his ſoul with fear and trembling. Deliver him for the deſtruction of the fleſh. The deſtruction of the fleſh, that's the deſtruction of Satan: Satans kingdom is in the fleſh: Gods rule is in the ſpirit; deliver him to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that Satan may be deſtroyed. Let him ſee that he is in the hands of Satan, that the Spirit may make out of his hands: the fleſh is nothing but enmity to God. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is the enemy of God, ſo is fleſh; and if enemy be too
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118351:46"/>
little, 'tis ſaid to be enmity, Rom. 8. 7. <hi>the wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity to God.</hi> The wiſdom of the fleſh, the moſt glorious piece of fleſh, is enmity to God; <hi>the fleſh luſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh.</hi> Deliver him unto Satan, for the deſtruction of the fleſh; deliver him to Satan that Satan may be deſtroyed; <hi>they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the ſpirit may be ſaved:</hi> There is in a Saint two natures, fleſh and ſpirit; the law of the members, and the law of the minde; there is I and ſin: I and Chriſt, as the Apoſtle expreſſes it. There is fleſh, in which Satan rules and acts; there is ſpirit, that is the Divine nature that Saints do partake of; and this ſame divine ſeed lieth buried in fleſh, in weakneſs, in darkneſs, under a law of ſin and death, till it be quickned, and when quickned, it ſtands up for its liberty, and after quickned it may fall into a ſwound, and be as it were dead again, as this <hi>Corinthian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſ. <hi>That the Spirit may be ſaved:</hi> The deſtruction of fleſh is the ſaving of Spirit; and 'tis <hi>the day of the Lord</hi> that ſaves the ſpirit, and burns up fleſh. The Lords appearance is like fire, that goes through the Bryars and Thorns, and burns them together: the manifeſtation of the Lord, againſt whatſoever is againſt him, conſumes it, deſtroys it. <hi>If any will ſet the bryars and thorns againſt me in battail, I will go through them and burn them together.</hi> The day of fleſh is night and darkneſs unto the ſpirit, to that that is born of God. The day of the Lord is the night of the fleſh, and the night of Satan; <hi>'tis darkneſs and not light:</hi> and here the ſpirit comes forth; that that is of God comes forth, and the fleſh is deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have a ſhort view of the meaning of the words, and do you judge what I ſay.</p>
                  <p>That which is to be obſerved here, may be branched out into divers particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:118351:47"/>1. Firſt this, That there is mercy, kindneſs, pity, life, ſalvation, conveyed unto Saints by ſuch ways and means where there is nothing viſible but evil, and death, hell, and deſtruction. <hi>Deliver him to Satan,</hi> &amp;c. ſend him to hell that he may be delivered from hell; <hi>by terrible things doſt thou anſwer us, O God of our ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Another thing to be obſerved here is this, That Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and hell and death in all the powers thereof, is under the power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Saints: <hi>When ye are gathered together with the power of the Lord Jeſus, deliver ſuch a one unto Satan.</hi> Deliver him for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved. Satan is under the power of the Lord Jeſus, in his Saints, in his people, and he is diſpoſed by them; to take ſuch a one, to deſtroy his own power in him, and to ſend him forth pure: to ſend back that that is of God. <hi>Deliver him to Satan for the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved.</hi> The power of the Lord Jeſus ſhall be manifeſted in the Saints, to command and diſpoſe of Satan and the power of hell. This inceſtuous perſon was delivered unto Satan; for what end? That Satan ſhould deſtroy himſelf in him: now by the ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus in the Church, he is reſtored and received again. In the ſecond Epiſtle, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter, <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye ought to comfort him,</hi> ye ought to relieve him; ſufficient to ſuch a man is that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>take heed he be not ſwallowed up of too much ſorrow:</hi> let him not lie too long in hell: <hi>for we are not ignorant of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans devices.</hi> So he is put into Satans hands, and taken out, by the power of the Lord Jeſus in his people. This is that power that <hi>Paul</hi> did act in, when he ſpeaks of ſome that he had delivered unto Satan, that they might learn not to blaſpheme, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 20. Whom I have delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Satan, that they may learn not to blaſpheme.</hi> Strange,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:118351:47"/>
that Satan ſhould teach men not to blaſpheme; this is the power of the Lord Jeſus in the Saints. We know little of it, or ſcarce any thing at all in this time of the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and of revealing of the man of ſin: but we look for the coming forth of this power in a more glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then ever it was abroad yet when ſhall that be? when by the brightneſs of his coming he ſhall conſume that man of ſin. The power of the Lord Jeſus in his people doth command devils and hell. <hi>Do you not know,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>that the Saints ſhall judge the world? Do you not know that we ſhall judge Angels?</hi> So it follows in the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2, 3. Whoſe is the power of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world and Angels? is it not the Sons? That which is the Sons, is the Saints. <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he ſame glory thou haſt given me, I have given them. All power</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is given me both in heaven and in earth.</hi> The Father comes forth in Chriſt, and Chriſt comes forth in the Saints. Chriſt comes forth in the fleſh, lower then the Angels. He makes him <hi>lower then the Angels: he comes forth as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: while the ſon is under age, he is kept as a ſervant; he is made of a woman, made under the Law;</hi> at laſt the Father comes to own him as his ſon: and Chriſt owns him as his Father. When the time appointed of the Father comes, <hi>he ſends his ſpirit into our hearts,</hi> ſaying, <hi>'Tis your Fathers pleaſure to give you a kingdom.</hi> Chriſt hath the keys of hell and death, and he exerciſes theſe keys in his Saints. We at preſent do not know how he exerciſes theſe, but we ſhall know how, when we feel the want of them, when we ſee our weakneſs and darkneſs, and mourn after the Lord. God hath ſuffered the devil, hell, and ſin, to be a kinde of Cloak and covering upon himſelf: but when he pleaſeth he will come forth and command them. The Saints need not the worlds power and force: to go to the world for power, is to go to the devil for power. The Saints have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118351:48"/>
power with God; and therefore muſt needs have power over Satan. And this power the Saints obtain by mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the Apoſtle hath it in the ſecond verſe, <hi>Ye ought rather to have mourned. Iacob</hi> wept and made ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wraſtled with God and ſo prevailed. The Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they are great perſons; but few there are that know themſelves. <hi>We are the ſons of God, but the world doth not know us.</hi> God hath brought forth himſelf, and brought forth Chriſt in his Saints and people; but that was but a firſt fruits, to ſhew what he will do fully. <hi>He ſhall come to be glorified [in] his Saints, and to be admired [in] them that believe.</hi> The ſpirit of God was withdrawn, that the man of ſin might appear. This is that believers ſhould do; they ſhould be looking after this power, the power of the Lord Jeſus. What a poor thing it is to ſpend our time in an outward powerleſs profeſſion onely! If we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and of Ieſus Chriſt, we cannot do ſo: <hi>The kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</hi> Do we profeſs Chriſt? Where is the power of the Lord Ieſus? Why do luſts and corruptions reign in our hearts? Why have Satan and the world ſuch power over us? Where is the power of the Lord Jeſus? <hi>Where is the ſpirit of Eliah?</hi> as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid when he had ſeen his maſter taken up into heaven, and had received his mantle, and had a promiſe of a doubling of that ſpirit. Chriſt is taken up into Heaven. He hath told us, greater works then he did in that fleſh, ſhould we do in his Spirit. Where is that ſpirit? Where is that power by which devils were made to tremble and ſubmit to him? 'Tis time we ſhould begin to know our ſelves; that we are of God, that we are the Temple of God, the body of the Lord: that we are the fulneſs of Chriſt, and that in us he will manifeſt himſelf, and 'tis that we ſhould look for. We ſhould be weary of a formal outward lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118351:48"/>
profeſſion; and ſo bringing forth the Lord Jeſus, we ſhall make his name known. <hi>O that thou wouldſt bow the Heavens, that thou would'ſt come down, and make thy name known;</hi> that Hell, and Death, and Satan, and all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darkneſs might melt before thee. <hi>Reſiſt the devil</hi> (ſaith <hi>James) and he will flie from you.</hi> What is that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by which the devil is reſiſted? 'Tis the power of Chriſt; the power of the Lord Jeſus is with his people, though not yet manifeſted: we ſhould wait for it, and not reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the name, but look after power to command hell and death, thoſe that have commanded us.</p>
                  <p>We are comforting our ſelves that Chriſt hath done this for us. 'Tis true he hath done this for us; he will do it in us. The Apoſtle bids us ſtand to it, in <hi>Eph. 6. You wraſtle not with fleſh and blood, but with principalities and powers; therefore put on the whole armour of God.</hi> If you be true <hi>Iſrael,</hi> you are able to deal with God; and then the devil and the world are not able to ſtand againſt you. Do you believe this? Then wait for it.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I ſhall commend unto you is this, That we muſt be delivered to Satan, before we can be delivered from Satan. <hi>For the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord.</hi> And if this ſtick in your ſtomacks, and will not go down, let me offer it to you in an old expreſſion of Divinity, as they call it, that is, <hi>That God leads his people to Heaven by Hell.</hi> We muſt be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to Satan, if ever we will be delivered from Satan: Satan hath carryed all the ſeed of God captive, in the fleſh; 'Tis under the law of ſin; ſin and death hath cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated the whole ſeed of God; here this ſeed lieth as it were dead, in a ſwound; and in this ſtate we dream of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but life and happineſs, great enjoyments, when we are captives to Satan at his pleaſure: God he quickens this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118351:49"/>
ſame ſeed, this divine nature; and then they ſee where they are, ſee how they were deceived, what a fools Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe they were in, then they have no reſt till they be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. This is to be delivered from Satan, to ſee that we are in Satans power. So it comes to this, That there muſt be a diſcovery of our ſtate under the power of darkneſs, before we be delivered from it. Deliver him unto Satan, deſtroy him, that he may be delivered; deſtroy him that he may be ſaved; kill him that he may be made alive; convince him of ſin, then of righteouſneſs: Deliver him unto Satan, is, quicken him, and enlighten him, that he may ſee where he is, in Satans power.</p>
                  <p>And whereas before there was peace, when the ſtrong man kept the houſe, it was becauſe he did not ſee Satan; but now he ſees him, there is nothing but trouble, there is no reſt till he be delivered. This is nothing but what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>you hath he quickened that were dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins. Dead in treſpaſſes and ſins;</hi> here is the ſeed of God under the power of Satan. The ſpirit quickned, ſees whereabouts it is: ſees that it is in hell, among devils, luſts, death, and flames, and it cannot abide here. The Prodigal came to himſelf; that was the quickning of this divine ſeed; he was well enough before, at the ſwine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trough, till he comes to himſelf; O then he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, he cannot live here any longer! We muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Satan, before we can be delivered from Satan.</p>
                  <p>And the ground and reaſon of this lieth thus:</p>
                  <p>God hath let all his ſeed fall under the hands and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death, and Satan: and he would never ſuffer this ſtate, unleſs he meant they ſhould be ſenſible of it, unleſs he did intend it ſhould be diſcovered unto them. God he is pleaſed that the devil and death ſhould poſſeſs our life
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118351:49"/>
and carry it away; and there is no recovering of it but by going into death, and into Hell; God he goes in there, bindes the ſtrong man in his houſe, and recovers his goods. There is no delivery from Satan, but by being delivered to Satan, and this delivery to Satan is conviction of the Spirit; a cleer ſenſible diſcovery that we have been in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans power.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore the uſe of it is this, to call upon us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain convictions of the ſpirit, that diſcover ſin, and hell, and death within us. It concerns us to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe, for here is our life, our ſalvation. We muſt be delivered to theſe, before we can be delivered from them. <hi>Be not afraid to go into Egypt</hi> (ſaith God by <hi>Jeremy) and ſerve the King of Babylon, for God hath delivered all-into his hands.</hi> God hath delivered all fleſh into Satans hand; 'tis in vain ſtanding out in thy knowledge, in thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; thou muſt let all go: thou muſt be content (ſeeing 'tis the will of God) to be Satans and Hells vaſſal, to bear thy burthen, to endure thy captivity, and hence the Lord will bring thee forth. I do not ſpeak that any ſoul ſhould entertain Sin and Satan, and Hel, as the world doth with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure: for 'tis death to him ſo to do. Hell is Hell to him, the devil is the devil to him: but yet he ſees there is no withſtanding of it; He muſt come under his power, and feel he is under his power, and then he ſhall have deliverance. Therefore, <hi>agree with thine adverſary quickly while thou art in the way.</hi> If God hath delivered thee unto Satan, into his power, 'tis but while thou art in the way. Tell the devil and ſin, 'tis your hour, I am your captive, but I ſhall have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and this diſcovery that I am your captive, is the way of my deliverance; This is the way for me to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of your hands. Do not ſtand againſt convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſpirit; do not ſtand againſt God when he convinces you that you are ſinful; for you will never
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118351:50"/>
make your ſelves righteous. This it teacheth us firſt:</p>
                  <p>2. In the next place, This is that ſhould quiet and ſtill the ſoul in ſuch diſcoveries; God diſcovers Hell, and death, and ſin, and the power thereof to our ſoul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> Alas! What ſhall I do? I ſhall be damned, the pit will ſhut her mouth upon me.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: God is now ſaving, when thou thinkeſt he is deſtroying; <hi>Pſal. 18. 16. David</hi> there tells his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and how God had delivered him out of hell. <hi>He ſent from above he took me and drew me out of many waters, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered me from my ſtrong enemy, and from them which hated me, for they were too ſtrong for me.</hi> But ſee through what a condition <hi>David</hi> was brought unto this ſalvation, <hi>ver. 4. The ſorrows of death compaſſed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid: the ſorrows of hell compaſſed me about, the ſnares of death prevented me,</hi> &amp;c. to the 16 ver. 'Tis a deſcription of thoſe terrible workings in the ſpirits and ſouls of Gods people, which do uſher in ſalvation and life; He diſcovers the foundations of the earth, diſcovers hell there. There is <hi>the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (that laſt book of the new Teſtament) and that Revelation of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt makes all thoſe terrible diſcoveries there we read of. The riſing up of Ieſus Chriſt in the ſoul, this diſcovers fleſh, and hell, and ſin, and ſo deſtroys them. This ſhould lift up our heads when darkneſs comes; when we think that God is deſtroying his Saints, he is ſaving them.</p>
                  <p>3. And thirdly, it ſhould put us upon this, to conſider whether we have ever been delivered to Satan or no: what diſcoveries have we had of Satans power, of ſins power, hells power? it concerns us to look to this. For the way to be delivered from him, is to be delivered to him. We know the old way of Miniſters, that this diſcovery muſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118351:50"/>
be to ſuch a meaſure, and for ſuch a time, we have done with that; God he works how he pleaſes: he makes deep humiliation to be the foundation of glorious ſalvation. From the greateſt diſcoveries of hell and death, he brings forth the moſt abundant glory. The moſt dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the ſoul is to be in a dead Palſie; The phyſitian coming to one thats taken with a dead Palſie, he puts him into a Feaver to cure him: This way the ſpirit of God takes with him that lieth dead, God puts him into a feaver, ſends fire into his bones, to ſecure his life, his ſoul: <hi>for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's another thing to be taken notice of, that ſin, hell and death are deſtroyed by a diſcovery. He was delivered unto Satan, was in his power when he committed that ſin; now let him ſee where he is, for the deſtruction of the fleſh: for the deſtruction of Satan, whoſe kingdom is in the fleſh. Satan, Hell, and Death, are deſtroyed in the Saints by a diſcovery. And the reaſon why the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſtroys them, is, becauſe it is ſuch a diſcovery as 'tis; 'tis a diſcovery by quickning. <hi>You hath he quickned that were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> This holy ſeed which is of God cannot endure ſin, which is death to it: A diſcovery by the ſpirit is not a notional diſcovery, as when a man or a letter ſhall come and tell us: but ſuch a diſcovery of ſin and hell as makes us feel it. The ſpirit once awakened in a Saint, ſin can have no entertainment there.</p>
                  <p>The power of the Lord Ieſus delivering us to Satan, that diſcovery deſtroys Satan. Hell, and ſin, cannot be entertained but in his own place; and the ſpirit once awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened in the Saints, cannot agree with hell: light and darkneſs, Chriſt and Belial cannot agree.</p>
                  <p>And that is it that concerns every one of us that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118351:51"/>
minde life, and peace, and ſalvation in good earneſt, to make after light, after knowledge; not head-knowledge, but heart-knowledge, the light of the ſpirit: ſtand up from the dead and Chriſt ſhall give you light. <hi>Wait to be renewed in the ſpirit of your minds, to grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us not ſtint our ſelves to any meaſure or degree of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Take heed of refuſing knowledge becauſe 'tis new and ſtrange, but examine it. Entertain ſtrangers kindly, for by it ſome have entertained Angels unawares: <hi>Wait for the Revelation of the Spirit,</hi> the teaching of the Spirit. And take another thing here, That there is no diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that deſtroys fleſh, and ſaves ſpirit, but that which is made by the power of the Lord Ieſus. 'Tis not mans diſcovery, nor the diſcovery that our own Reaſon makes, 'tis not a letter diſcovery, but a a diſcovery of light and power by the Lord Ieſus, that makes an end of fleſh: And it muſt needs be this, and nothing elſe: becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Saint while he lives in the fleſh is bewitched. 'Tis the Scriprure expreſſion, <hi>O fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you?</hi> It is a being born again, you cannot ſee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, except you be born again.</p>
                  <p>I conclude with this: See how it concerns us to wait for the Miniſtery of the ſpirit: and that is it we ſhould look for in all theſe meetings and Aſſemblies: Look to meet with the power of the Lord Ieſus; Satan would deceive us by the knowledge of the letter of the creature: we may have a great deal of knowledge, and be puffed up with pride, and be delivered up to Satan when we have done: We ſhould admit of that diſtinction, Letter, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118351:51"/>
Spirit: Man, and God: not that we divide between theſe: but in Man, and in Letter, look for the Spirit and God: The life was manifeſted, we ſaw it, our eyes looked upon it, and our hands handled it. The diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Hell is the deſtruction of Death and Hell: by the power of the Lord Ieſus deliver ſuch a one to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>

The <hi>new man born of God,</hi> in which God doth act: This ſpirit lieth dead and is aſleep, further then God doth quicken and act it. This ſpirit is the ſeat and Temple of God, where God moves; the devils buſineſs is in the fleſh; there he works his work: the ſpirit is entire unto God, here God appears ſometimes, and ſometimes he does not. We cannot do any handſome work in the Goſpel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſtirring in ſpirit; we cannot ſail without a gale; we cannot ſtir in a calm. He was ſtirred in ſpirit. It is the ſpirit of God that ſtirs the ſpirit of his people. Sometimes there is a diſcovery of Idolatry, &amp; the ſpirit of the Saints is not ſtird. Sometimes God ſaith, as of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> He followeth Idols, let him alone. Here was a whole City in Idolatry, and <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit is ſtirred to deal with them if it may be, to help ſome of them out of it; the ſpirit of God will ſtrive with ſome, and it will not ſtrive with others: 'twill give over ſtriving: my ſpirit ſhall no longer ſtrive with man, as 'tis in <hi>Geneſis:</hi> Here the Lord was pleaſed to appeare to ſome of them.

This is the repute that all thoſe have that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the ſpirit, and that they muſt look for that will hold forth onely the learning of the ſpirit: among the wiſe of the world a ſpiritual man muſt reckon to be looked upon as a fool, a trifler, a babler.

               <p>Jeſus and the Reſurrection. Mark how theſe are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. I am the Reſurrection and the Life, ſaith Chriſt. So far as any man doth know Jeſus, he lives in

the Reſurrection. All the knowledge of Jeſus that is ſaving, is above the world, above the natural man. It is life eternal to know Jeſus, and this is the Reſurrection. And this Reſurrection is above the reach of all the learned and wiſe men of <hi>Athens.</hi> The natural man comes not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, it lieth within a veil: therefore he that preaches Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus indeed, muſt needs be a <hi>Barbarian</hi> and a babler to a meer natural man.

Verſe, <hi>For the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, &amp;c.</hi> He is the ſin-offering: <hi>He is made a curſe for us, he became ſin for us, and whoſoever is ſanctified by him, he is carried forth by him without the camp, and is content to take up his reproach. True Sanctification unto God, is to go out of the glory, and reſt, and eaſe of the fleſh into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the world,</hi> where Chriſt is, and whither he calls us, and through that willcarry us into ſpiritual glory, into eternal honor and reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us go forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> This is to be ſanctified by Ieſus Chriſt, this is to be made peculiar unto the Lord, to leave all and follow the Lord, to take up his Croſs, to deny our ſelves, to dye and to ſuffer with Chriſt, then we ſhall live and raign with him. The exchanging life, riches, honors, is that we are called to by Chriſt, who that he might ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the people, ſuffered without the gate: he was made a curſe; and thoſe whom he ſanctifies, he makes willing to be made a curſe: we come into the bleſſing of God, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contented to be made a curſe unto the world: thoſe whom Chriſt ſanctifies, he makes a willing offering.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us go forth unto him without the Camp:</hi> He lives in them, he carries them forth; and there appears the ſame minde in them that was in Chriſt Ieſus: This is true San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: <hi>Let the ſame minde be in you that was in Chriſt Jeſus: No man takes my life from me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reproach of Chriſt is the way to the glory of Chriſt. <hi>Moſes eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118351:62"/>
then the treaſures of Egypt. Let us go forth to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But this is a hard ſaying, and who can bear it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tis no hard ſaying, for <hi>we part with nothing but what will away; For we have here no abiding City, we look for one to come.</hi> We are going to a heavenly City and Countrey, whiles we are parting with this, ſo tis no hard ſaying: Till we be convinced by the Spirit, of the paſſing away of this preſent form of things, and ſee a durable ſtate coming, an inheritance immortal and undefiled, we ſhall never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to go out of the City, out of the Camp, and to bear Chriſts reproach: But this is that that is ſaid, every one ſeems convinced, <hi>that here we have no abiding City,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one profeſſes, <hi>he looks for one to come:</hi> if then we <hi>refuſe to go forth without the Camp, and to bear Chriſts reproach;</hi> if we mock and ſcorn thoſe that do, we have that within us will riſe up in judgement againſt us; and our Religion comes all to this, <hi>we profeſs we know God, but in works we deny him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By him therefore let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually:</hi> Mark how thoſe two come together, <hi>Let us go forth, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>By him let us offer, &amp;c.</hi> There is joy and glory in the reproach of Chriſt: <hi>When ye are reproached for the name of Chriſt, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory reſts upon you.</hi> There is <hi>meat</hi> in this <hi>Eater,</hi> according to <hi>Sampſons</hi> Riddle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſacrifice of praiſe continually:</hi> Take notice here, that the ſervice and the worſhip which God expects of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>thankſgiving: Thou wouldſt not have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, elſe would I give it thee: Offer to God thankſgiving,</hi> as tis in <hi>Pſal. 50. 12, 13. Who ſo offers praiſe, honors me.</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was but an outward ſign of praiſe and thanksgiving. God hath made his people for his praiſe, <hi>Iſa. 43. 21. This people I have formed for my ſelf, they ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe:</hi> God hath but this only deſign <hi>to manifeſt himſelf,</hi> to ſhew forth his glory; he will bring forth his glory in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118351:62"/>
the ſalvation of his people: he makes a people of thoſe that were no people, that they ſhould <hi>ſhew forth his vertues and his praiſes;</hi> this is the buſineſs that a Chriſtian is called to, to hold forth God: The effect of the Spirit which is poured forth, is nothing elſe but praiſe and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving: <hi>Making melodie in your hearts, ſinging Pſalms, and Hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs,</hi> as tis in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> God will manifeſt himſelf to his glory, in his people, in all bleſſings in ſpiritual things. God will be the ſong and the praiſe of his people; then we are right Worſhippers, Goſpel-Worſhippers, when God is our praiſe, when God is our ſong: <hi>let us by him therefore offer up unto God the ſacrifice of praiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if: this be the worſhip that God requires of us, then let every one of us be looking how far we are lead into it, or whether we are at leaſt coming toward it. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing acceptable to God but this: mourning and prayer is only acceptable as it makes to this: God is emptying us, and humbling us, that he may fill us, and his filling us is praiſe and thankſgiving: Therefore <hi>David</hi> when he is mourning ſaith, <hi>he ſhall yet give him thanks.</hi> In prayer and mourning, he is but travelling for praiſe and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving: praiſe is coming forth, tis breeding: <hi>I ſhall yet give him thanks,</hi> ſaith he. So much as we have attained in praiſe, ſo much we have attained in true and ſpiritual Religion: ſo much as we go forth in praiſe, ſo much we go forth by Chriſt: <hi>Let us by him therefore offer the ſacrifice of praiſe.</hi> The worſhip and ſervice of God is a joyful thing, tis a chearful thing: we do not know the ſervice of God in truth, until we know joy in the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>The Kingdom of God is righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> It is refreſhing, it is chearing, it is meat and drink: <hi>In the keeping of thy Commandments there is great reward.</hi> Do
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118351:63"/>
not reckon that we are true Worſhippers of God, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers in Spirit and Truth, until we come into the joy of God, until we can offer the ſacrifice of praiſe: We may be tending to it, and making to it, we may be travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with it, in ſorrow and in ſighs, but when we are brought forth in it, it is in praiſe. <hi>By him therefore let us offer, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It alſo ſets an end, and determines that controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law of Works and the Law of Faith; between the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Law of Chriſt; between mans Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Righteouſneſs of God; between Iuſtification by works, and Iuſtification by faith: It is praiſe that God looks for; mans Righteouſneſs, mans Works, they praiſe man, and ſet up man: What is that that throws down boaſting? The Law of Faith: that ſets up God. Why doſt thou boaſt? <hi>Thou haſt nothing but what thou haſt received?</hi> This makes us praiſe.</p>
                  <p>And it may help us, by way of direction, how to know what is truth, and ſo keep us from being carried about by divers and ſtrange Doctrines. What is it that leads us to praiſe? what is it that brings us into reſt and joy, the joy of the Lord? what is it that exalts God? God hath nothing to do, nothing to ſeek, but his own exaltation, his own praiſe; that that is from him, that leads to him; that that ſets him up only, ſhall be exalted in that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> praiſe is the ſum of that which God requires of us: When we can praiſe, then we can worſhip. <hi>By him let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is this praiſe then? tis worth the knowing what it is to praiſe him.</p>
                  <p>Conſider here, what a Title the Text gives it, it is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. <hi>By him therefore let us offer the Sacrifice of praiſe.</hi> In a Sacrifice there is offering up, there is an Altar, there is Fire, there is a Prieſt, there is ſomewhat to to be carried
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:118351:63"/>
forth, there is ſomewhat to eat, there is ſomewhat for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment. So tis here in praiſe; true acceptable praiſe is a ſacrifice, tis <hi>the fruit of our lips,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it here. <hi>By him therefore let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God continually,</hi> that is the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name. The fruit of our lips, is this all? no, this is but a part, it is the calves of our lips, as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> calls it. By the lips the heart comes forth, and the abundance of it, but the ſacrifice is our ſelves; praiſe is the offering up our ſelves. <hi>I beſeech you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom. 12.) that you offer up your bodies</hi> (not your lips only, but your bodies) <hi>a living and acceptable ſacrifice;</hi> every member a weapon and inſtrument of righteouſneſs: this is praiſe. Your bodies and your ſpirits they are the Lords. To praiſe him, is to offer up both unto him. In this ſacrifice here is ſomewhat to be killed; that is, luſt, fleſhly luſts, worldly luſts; and here is ſomewhat that is to live, ſomewhat that is to be offered up a living ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: here is ſomewhat that is to be devoured in the fire; and ſomewhat that lives in the fire, that glorifies God in the fire: there is that that lives in God, who is a devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire, and everlaſting burnings: all that is ſpiritual, all that is the new creature, that is it is offered up a living ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; there it hath its life: it comes from God, and it lives in God: ſo it is a ſacrifice of praiſe. It is the giving up, the reſigning up of our ſelves to be diſpoſed of by the Lord. The offering up of the Gentiles that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 16. ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt. To offer the ſacrifice of praiſe, is to make our ſelves an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering unto God, as Jeſus Chriſt did: <hi>Here I am to do thy will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou wouldſt not have ſacrifice:</hi> Here I am, diſpoſe of me: <hi>Tis written that I ſhould do thy will,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am no more my own, but thine: This is to offer the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118351:64"/>
ſacrifice of praiſe, this is to give thanks to his name. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains us:</hi> we muſt no more live unto our ſelves, but unto him: This is the ſacrifice of praiſe; here is thankſgiving indeed, praiſe indeed, which is that that is held forth in <hi>Pſal. 116. Thou haſt delivered my ſoul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. Ile walk before the Lord in the land of the living.</hi> Here is the ſacrifice of praiſe, <hi>Ile walk before the Lord:</hi> Ile walk in the Spirit, and no more in the fleſh. In the 12 Verſe it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me? I will take the cup of ſalvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.</hi> Here is the ſacrifice of praiſe: here is dying, dying to the world, dying to the fleſh: <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints. O Lord, truly I am thy ſervant, and the ſon of thy handmaid, thou haſt looſed my bonds: I will offer to thee the ſacrifice of thankſgiving. What ſhall I render unto God?</hi> Tis ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah, that he rendred not unto the Lord according to the benefits he received from him:</hi> This is that God enables his people to do; to render to him according to what they have received: God enables his people even to recompence him, to requite him. Do you thus requite the Lord? The Lord enables his people to requite him, and to requite him fully: for as he is our fulneſs, ſo we are his fulneſs; as he gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us, ſo he enables us to give our ſelves to him, and ſo we return himſelf unto himſelf: <hi>Of thy own we have given thee:</hi> Thus only a Saint can praiſe that hath the Spirit, that hath received God; for nothing is acceptable to God, but himſelf: Nothing comes to God, but what comes from God. There is no ſacrifice indeed but Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>By him let us offer up the ſacrifice of praiſe unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The people of God do make a Covenant with God by
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118351:64"/>
ſacrifice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. There is a ſacrifice of praiſe (praiſe is a ſacrifice) and a ſacrifice of our ſelves: tis Chriſt that is the ſacrifice, and tis by Chriſt that we become a ſacrifice acceptable, a ſacrifice of a ſweet ſavour unto God: <hi>For I do not live</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but Chriſt lives in me:</hi> And as by him we are a ſacrifice, ſo by him we are <hi>Prieſts, a holy prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifice acceptable to God:</hi> as tis in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. There is the fire of this ſacrifice, the Eternal Spirit: <hi>Through the Eternal Spirit he offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without ſpot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and that that is our praiſe, is the meat and drink upon this Altar, the refreſhing and the wine: <hi>In keeping of them</hi> (of thy Commandments, ſaith <hi>David) there is great reward.</hi> There is ſomewhat to be carried forth in this ſacrifice, and that is iniquity and ſin, that cleaves unto our holy things. Praiſe and thankſgiving is the ſum of the Worſhip of God and Jeſus Chriſt: and this praiſe and thankſgiving is a ſacrifice, and ſuch a ſacrifice as you have heard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> This may make a diſcovery unto us, that praiſe and thanksgiving is little known among us, we are very little acquainted with it: we have heard of the name, but know not the thing. The common praiſe and thankſgiving ſtands in ſome expreſſion of words; ſometimes there is a day ſet apart, ſometimes good words ſpoken of God; at ſuch a time there are ſome Ceremonies uſed, and it may be a great deal of ſacrifice done to the fleſh; there is a ſeeming offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat to God, but none of the beſt; <hi>And curſed is the deceiver, that hath in his flock a male, and offers to God a corrupt thing:</hi> The true praiſing and acceptable thankſgiving is, offering up of our ſelves, our ſelves ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified (that <hi>the offering up of the Gentiles might be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Holy Ghoſt</hi>) and our ſelves a living ſacrifice: <hi>There is no man can glorifie God, but he that is glorified of God;</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:118351:65"/>
according to that prayer of Chriſt in <hi>Joh. 17. Father, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thy Son, that thy Son may glorifie thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this that hath been ſaid in this point, cauſe us to look into our hearts and conſider what we have done, and how we have been in this ſervice of praiſe, it is that I intended in it. When we ſhall look into the nature of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, and ſhall look with a right eye, we ſhall ſee that there hath been nothing, or little elſe beſides the name of Praiſe amongſt us: it hath been but a form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, having in it ſcarce any thing of the power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By him therefore let us offer the Sacrifice of praiſe to God continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By him let us do it. That is the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered here, That by Jeſus Chriſt, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, in the power, in the light, in the love, in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus Chriſt muſt our praiſe go up to God; and all that is acceptable doth go up ſo. <hi>By him let us offer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>All that comes to God, that is acceptable ſacrifice, it comes by him; it comes in his name, it goes up in his grace, it goes up in his love, in his light, in his power: this is by Jeſus Chriſt. There is no Sacrifice acceptable, but that which is ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, as in <hi>Rom. 15. 16. That the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable to God, ſanctified by the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> There is nothing that comes acceptable unto God, that God owns, that he receives, or where he ſmells a ſavour of reſt, but that which comes up in the ſpirit of Chriſt, by Chriſt, by him, in his name. There is nothing holy, but what is by the Holy-Ghoſt. It is he that ſanctifies the people by his blood, as it is ſaid here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Let us go forth to him, and by him let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe.</p>
                  <p>He is the Mediator between God and man; he is our peace, our wiſdom, our righteouſneſs, our ſanctification.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118351:65"/>
If he be our ſanctification, God will own us; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that God can own, but what comes <hi>by him.</hi> We are all an unclean thing; there is nothing comes from us but pollution, but onely as we come forth by Chriſt and in Chriſt. Elſe all our ſacrifices of praiſe and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving are nothing but a form, a ſhew of holineſs. It is a fair ſhew toward God, but tends only to the fleſh, and to the world. Our minde and Conſcience is defiled till it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the Holy-Ghoſt, till Chriſt be brought forth in us. In Chriſt we come forth a <hi>new</hi> creation. All this ſame old creation is loſt and fallen into Satan; in the new Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Satan hath nothing to do, <hi>the prince of this world comes and hath nothing in me.</hi> By him. All acceptable ſervice goes to God by Chriſt: <hi>In him are all the promiſes, yea and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The promiſes</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>they are to the ſeed:</hi> he doth not ſay to Seeds, as to many, but as to one, and that is Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12. Coming, and not coming by Chriſt, we have no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> promiſe of acceptance: Chriſt is the heir of all: God hath given all to him; we can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by him: and in him we are coheirs, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath it in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. God hath choſen us in him, hath bleſſed us in him: by him let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe. Chriſt is Temple, he is Altar, he is Prieſt, he is all, the whole body of our ſacrifice: by him let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe. No acceptable ſacrifice but by him.</p>
                  <p>Every one then that deals by ſacrifice, that deals in praiſe and thankſgiving, or ſuppoſeth that he doth ſo, let him conſider by whom he comes. Do you come by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator or no? If you come by a Mediator, do you come by him that is gone without the gate, and ſits in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the world? if you come not by him, all that you do (whatever fair ſhew it hath to men) is but abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:118351:66"/>
in the ſight of God. There is nothing acceptable to God but in him. All the Incenſe you offer up, it ſtinks unleſs there be the ſweet odour of him. How is it then you bring your praiſe, you bring your thanks? by whom do you come? doth Chriſt lead you in? do you do it by him? We uſe his name, we come with words and letters, and ſyllables; we ſay, Lord, we come to thee by Jeſus Chriſt, we come in his name: when we ſay ſo, let's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Commiſſion we have. Remember what the evil ſpirit ſaid to them that conjured them in the name of Jeſus whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached, <hi>Jeſus we know, and Paul we know, but who are ye?</hi> and that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Why doſt thou take my name into thy mouth when thou hateſt to be Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?</hi> Is the name of Jeſus in thy mouth? Yes: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, is the love of Jeſus, and the Faith of Ieſus in thy heart? If we come by him, let us ſee that he is with us: let us look for his minde in us, for his ſpirit in us. Are we ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded or carnally minded? Are we his reproach? or is he precious unto us? he muſt needs be ſo if we come by him unto God, and know him the onely way and the truth, and the life. Are we let unto God by his ſpirit? To come by Ieſus, is to come in the light and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and grace, and life of Ieſus. To come in our own names, what can we expect? to come by our own works, by our own righteouſneſs, this is to make another Ieſus, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mediator. To uſe onely the name, what an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable mockery is this? and how hath Satan and ſin and all wickedneſs been brought forth under the Names and Titles of Ieſus Chriſt? The devil hath brought forth all ſacrifices to himſelf, under the name of Ieſus Chriſt, and under ſuch Titles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By him.</hi> Let every one of us look (if we be in praiſe and Thankſgiving unto God) whether we come by him.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118351:66"/>
To come by him is to come with him. <hi>Know ye not that Chriſt is in you? If any have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his.</hi> We are branches of his root, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, and ſo we are to grow up (if we be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the houſe of God) through the ſap and fatneſs that we have in him. We have great things to do, which cannot be done but by him. We have principalities and powers, death and hell to wraſtle withal; how ſhall we do it but by him? we have God himſelf to overcome, and how ſhall this be done but by his ſon? Conſider what a promiſe there is, <hi>whatſoever you ſhall ask in his name, it ſhall be given you.</hi> We have heaven to open and ſhut, we have Satan to binde and looſe, and how ſhall this be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him?</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, where is he that doth go forth by him? where is this power? where is this light? and where is this grace?</p>
                  <p>O 'twere well if all our hearts were ſtirred up to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, where it is? O that we were awakened to look for it: that we were rows'd up out of ſpiritual ſecurity and ſtumbling, out of that form of Religion we walk in, to look after power and life and ſpirit. Where is it? Surely when we begin to look after it, we ſhall finde it is not far from us. But the truth is, it hath been a long time abſent, a long time withdrawn, in reſpect of the manifeſtation of it. God hath been pleaſed that there ſhould be an hour of darkneſs, and a time of temptation: God is pleaſed there ſhould be a time of Apoſtacy, that the man of ſin ſhould be revealed; and that he himſelf during this time ſhould be hid. Chriſt himſelf did not always go forth manifeſtly in the name of God, for that thirty yeers from his birth; 'tis true, he did all by the Father, but how little manifeſtation was there of the Father in that time? his working by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

in the name of the Father, was manifeſted in him by degrees. And he tells his Diſciples, that they ſhould go forth mightier then ever he went forth himſelf, <hi>Joh. 14. He that believes in me, greater works ſhall he do then thoſe that I do.</hi> When Chriſt came to ſuffer, and to be a reproach, he went to it by the Father, he went to all by the Father, and we go to all by him: and the Father did not preſently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf, or lead him out to a willing and a joyful ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but comes to him by degrees; after begging and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, and earneſt Prayers, with ſtrong cries and tears, <hi>if it be poſsible, let this cup paſs away.</hi> The Father comes in at laſt, takes him by the hand, and then he goes on cheerfully, and <hi>for the joy that was ſet before him, he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi> The manifeſtation of Chriſt with his people, to lead them to God, hath been low and dark; but it ſhall be cleer, it ſhall be bright, it ſhall be powerful. We have been in an exceeding puzzel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed loſt condition, and ſtill are, that we ſcarce know when we go by Chriſt, and when we go alone: but he ſhall come forth cleerly and manifeſtly, to lead his people, and we ſhall ſee that he hath us by the right hand. He will come forth in his brightneſs to deſtroy the man of ſin, after the time that he is fully revealed; and by him the Saints ſhall go into greater glory then ever they have yet ſeen; we ſhall judge the world, and we ſhall judge Angels. How is it to be wiſhed that we were ſenſible of that confuſion and darkneſs that lieth upon us, that we have ſeen and do ſee very little of Chriſt our way? <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> When the time comes that Chriſt ſhall manifeſt himſelf unto his people, to lead them unto God, to be their light and their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and their life, he will make us ſenſible of our dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of our weakneſs, at what a loſs we have been, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118351:67"/>
we ſhall begin to cry as the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> did, when his Maſter was taken up, where is the ſpirit of <hi>Eliah?</hi> There is the promiſe of a double ſpirit, <hi>greater things ſhall they do that believe in me.</hi> Where is this double ſpirit? ſurely God is awaking us to be looking after it. We have heard of Chriſtians of a tall ſtature, that have been gyants to us, and we like Pygmies unto them: and we have precious promiſes that hold forth a more glorious manifeſtation of God, a full and everlaſting preſence of God: let us be looking out of our darkneſs and weakneſs unto this. Let us not be content that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens him, and we able to do nothing: Let it trouble us, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould not be under the power of any thing, and we under the power of ſo many things; let it ſtir us, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould triumph over principalities and powers, and ſee himſelf more then a Conqueror; and we lie groveling under a ſpirit of fear. When God hath once diſcovered to us how low his appearing is in us, and how little we go forth by him, we ſhall be ſtirred up to look for a higher appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and when we ſhall hear and read what the men of God have ſaid, The light was manifeſt, we have ſeen it, we have handled it with our hands, our eys have looked upon it; ſurely our hearts will burn within us, we ſhall have no reſt till he come forth in us. Our fouls will breath nothing elſe but this, O that thou wouldſt bow the Heavens and come down! O that thou wouldſt make thy way known to thy adverſaries! We ſhall be weary of walking in a weak dull Religion: we ſhall ſe what a reproach we are that bear the name of Chriſt, and can ſhew forth nothing of the power of Chriſt. Carnal profeſſion in Religion, ſeeks ways to make out it ſelf by helping Chriſt to worldly ſtrength, and worldly honour, and worldly wiſdom; but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:118351:68"/>
they that are Chriſts indeed, will take heed of this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Be ſenſible that Chriſt is a child in us, and weak in us, can hardly ſpeak in us, can hardly ſtir in us; that we lie in the duſt, till he be grown up in us; that we ſit in darkneſs till the Lord be our light. We know that there is a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery will come forth that will have no need of ſuch wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: therefore we will never ſeek to honour Chriſt and ſet up Chriſt, with the civil Magiſtrates ſword: we will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeek to put the civil ſword into his hand: we will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeek to dreſs him forth with mans wiſdom: we will lie in the duſt till he comes forth in us in his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and wiſdome and glory.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould then mourn after the Lord. When once the people did mourn after the Lord, the Lord was preſently with them. The Lord tells his people by <hi>Jeremy,</hi> that the time of their captivity ſhould be in <hi>Babylon</hi> ſeventy yeers, and then ſaith he, you ſhall praiſe me, then you ſhall ſeek my face. We have been in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and are in <hi>Babylon,</hi> mourning after the Lord, and begin to feel our captivity, and are ſenſible of our weakneſs: is not the man of ſin revealed? now let the Lord be revealed to conſume this man of ſin; to conſume him inwardly, to conſume him in all the world. Come and take thy kingdom, and take thy power. Where will God appear and ſet up his glory? is it not in his Saints, he will be glorious in his Saints, he will be admired in all them that believe. Awake and riſe up you that ſit in the duſt. Let's not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with forms and profeſſions, and names and Titles; let us look after power, let us go forth by Chriſt indeed; let us be looking where the power of Chriſt is, and where the grace of Chriſt is; Chriſt hath ſaid,

                     <hi>Whatever you ask in my name, it ſhall be given you.</hi> How many things do we ask, and they are not given us? how do we ask in the name of Chriſt then? If we conſider our ſelves in all we have yet attained, we ſhall ſcarce ſee any thing we can call Prayer; we never knew how to pray yet. When did we go forth by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? By him let us offer the ſacrifice of Praiſe to God, and by him we ſhall do it continually.</p>

who is gone before us out of all. To be a Chriſtian is (at leaſt) to be brought to this in full purpoſe of heart: <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was the father of the faithful, who becauſe he truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in God, forſook his Countrey, Kindred and Fathers houſe: <hi>He that will be my Diſciple</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>let him take up his croſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> elſe he is unworthy of me.</hi> This is to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto God, <hi>to be no more the worlds, nor the fleſhes, nor our own, but the Lords.</hi> You muſt be a curſe to the world, if you will be a bleſſing to God: We have not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Chriſts being made a curſe for us; we have thought we might be excuſed from the curſe, but we muſt be made a curſe with him: and by going into this curſe, we remove from that curſe we are under as unto God. <hi>Let us go forth unto him bearing his reproach:</hi> And you ſhall loſe nothing by it; <hi>You have here no continuing City,</hi> you are making unto a continuing City through reproach: <hi>You muſt go out of the Camp,</hi> out of the City, if you will finde a continuing City: you ſhall not go out in haſte, or in fear, you ſhall not go out ſorrowing, or mourning: you ſhall not go forth looking back, O what a City have I left? what goods, what name have I left? If Chriſt lead you forth, you ſhall go forth with praiſe and thanksgiving. When Chriſt went forth, he had joy ſet before him, and for that he endured the croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame. <hi>Let us by him offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God.</hi> The Altar of God (which is Jeſus Chriſt) unto the true Worſhippers, gives them the fat, it gives them the ſweet, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce before the Lord, they bleſs the Lord, they are filled with his loving kindeneſs, they are filled with his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they eat and drink that meat the world doth not know, they praiſe him.</p>
                  <p>And Chriſtian praiſe is not a word-buſineſs, <hi>God I thank thee, &amp;c.</hi> as the Phariſee ſaid: it is a giving up our

ſelves. <hi>I beſeech you, by the mercies of God, that ye offer up your bodies a living ſacrifice;</hi> A ſacrifice, wherein is ſomewhat killed, ſomewhat burnt and conſumed, and that is the world and luſt; and ſomewhat which is offered up to God, that lives in God, that lives in the fire; and that is the ſpiritual part, Chriſt in us. It is a ſacrifice, and it is offered up by the fire of the Spirit, ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>The world doth not know praiſe; yea, there may be many true Saints that yet do not know that which is their life; for this ſame life of the Divine Nature doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcover it ſelf: We grow up in this ſpiritual life by degrees, as we do in the natural life. Tis impoſſible to offer this ſacrifice but in the Spirit, but by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>By him therefore let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi> There is no man can praiſe God but by Jeſus Chriſt: To offer by Jeſus Chriſt, is to offer in the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, in the power of Jeſus Chriſt, in the life of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in the light of Jeſus Chriſt: and when we ſhall ſee and underſtand what it is to praiſe, that tis an offering up of our ſelves unto God, a freewil offering, then we ſhall eaſily grant that this cannot be but by Ieſus Chriſt. There is nothing in us but enmitie unto God; we have no ſacrifice but for the Devil and for hell. <hi>Tis by Jeſus Chriſt that we offer unto God:</hi> let us look whether our praiſe and thanksgiving do come by Ieſus Chriſt or no: if we cannot ſee Ieſus Chriſt with us, and his Spirit leading us, let us be ſenſible of it, and abhor our ſelves in all we do; and let us wait when he will come forth and lead us into the preſence of God, when his power ſhall be manifeſted in us, when we ſhall ſee and know that we walk in the light as God is in the light. Tis time to be looking after power and life: we have been long in a languiſhing Religion: the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118351:70"/>
workings of the heart, the prayers, the ſighs and groans of the Saints after Jeſus Chriſt, tell us he is at the door. Tis time we ſhould be weary of a profeſſion and of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which we cannot make forth to the world, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cannot make forth to our ſelves: Shall we not wait for the time when we may make it out that we are of God, and walk with God, by ſhewing forth the light of God, the life of God, the power of God, the praiſes of God, and the wonders of God? ſurely we are called to ſhew forth his praiſes. Now is Chriſt buried in us, he is covered in us, he walks in our rags and dirt, and filthy garments; how ſhould we wait till that voyce comes forth, <hi>Take away his filthy garments from him. By him let us offer up a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of praiſe to God continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that is the next thing we are to take notice of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually:</hi> God will bring his ſanctified ones by Jeſus Chriſt into a continual thanksgiving and praiſe to his name.</p>
                  <p>There is a continual offering up of the ſacrifice of praiſe and thanksgiving unto God by real Saints, by true born Chriſtians: It is a continual work, though they are not always ſenſible of it; the new man is always in it, he is of God, and he is only for God. Every true Saint ſhall do it manifeſtly, ſhall do it ſenſibly. Continual praiſe and thanksgiving unto God, this is that that we are ſanctified unto by Jeſus Chriſt; he hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God, Prieſts to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifice. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and offerings in the Temple were continual; the Prieſts did ſtand and watch by night in the houſe of the Lord: <hi>you that by night ſtand in the houſe of the Lord. By him let us offer to God the ſacrifice of praiſe continually. There is nothing is called for in the new Teſtament, but it is done;</hi> all his <hi>Commandments</hi> are <hi>Promiſes:</hi> It is the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, this is the new Teſtament.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118351:71"/>
The higher and greater the commands are, the better it is, for it tells us what God hath done for us, and what he will bring forth in us. There is that in us, in a ſeed, which he is calling up. Tis a pitiful thing for a ſpiritual man to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the height and weight of any Commandment; for God enjoyns us nothing but what he will bring us up to, for he ſhall work all our works in us, and ſo ordain peace for us. All the Commandments and Exhortations of the Goſpel are the Saints glory, for God will bring us up to every one of them. <hi>By him therefore let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God continually:</hi> Fleſh and Blood will ſay, a heavy task, a hard ſaying: the Spiritual man he ſaith, <hi>Let us go up at once,</hi> God will do it, as <hi>Caleb</hi> ſaith. <hi>Thou haſt the words of eternal life,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter, whither ſhall we go?</hi> Thou wilt bring forth all in us. <hi>Let us offer up the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of praiſe continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Saints work is continual offering up himſelf to God. It is the work of the new man, of the ſpiritual man: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I am thy ſervant:</hi> it is the work of Chriſt in us, the breathing of his ſoul to God: <hi>It is written in the volumn of the book, Lo I come to do thy will:</hi> Sanctification by Jeſus Chriſt, is that we ſhould be holy, and alway the Lords: This is the ſacrifice of praiſe, continual ſelf-denial, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual dependance upon God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> continual readineſs to ſuffer and do his will, continual acknowledgement of his love, continual ſetting forth his praiſe and glory, continual hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his vertues and his praiſes. A true Saint, a true born Chriſtian, is a houſe of prayer: <hi>You alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpiritual houſe, an holy prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifice acceptable to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.</p>
                  <p>Now ſome weak Chriſtians that do not know their own eſtate, that do not know that ſeed that is in them, will be making objections againſt this, <hi>How can this be,</hi> as <hi>Nicodemus</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:118351:71"/>
ſaid, when Chriſt told him of a mans being born again: So in like manner, when they are called upon to be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual thanksgiving and praiſe; as here its ſaid, <hi>By him let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe continually:</hi> How can this be? ſaith a worldly man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how can this be? ſaith a weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who is in great part worldly and carnal: What, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual praiſing? and what, in all eſtates? in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? and what, ſhall I never pray? muſt I always praiſe? when ſhall I pray? Why, he that bids thee praiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, bids thee alſo pray continually. The Apoſtle decides this Controverſie in the fourth of the <hi>Philippians, Let your requeſts be made known unto God with thanksgiving: pray continually, and praiſe continually.</hi> What ſhall we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read? ſhall we never hear? ſhall we never work, ſleep, eat, drink? yes, but all with thanksgiving: <hi>Whether you eat, or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God:</hi> If you know not how this can be the Spirit teaches thoſe that are born of him, how it can and may be: They that are born of him, if they do not underſtand, they ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, God will reveal the ſame to them.</p>
                  <p>When God is <hi>all in all</hi> to us, and we ſee God in all, his love in all, his power in all, then we ſhall praiſe him in all, we ſhall give thanks in all, we ſhall do all we do to the Lord, we ſhall dye to the Lord, and live to the Lord; <hi>Whether we live or dye we are the Lords:</hi> we ſhall work to the Lord, we ſhall ſleep to the Lord, we ſhall awake to the Lord: <hi>Holineſs will be written upon the bells of the horſes,</hi> upon all our imployments; all will be a ſacrifice of praiſe, in all we ſhall give up our ſelves to the Lord. This is that the Apoſtle ſaith elſewhere, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 5. Rejoyce evermore, pray without ceaſing, in all things give thanks:</hi> In all things, what in affliction, in troubles, in ſufferings, in reproaches? why, what ſaith the Text, <hi>Let us go forth to him without the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:118351:72"/>
gate, bearing his reproach, and by him let us offer the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of praiſe to God continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Count it all joy</hi> (ſaith <hi>James) when you fall into divers temptations:</hi> but what will you make of us (you will ſay) ſhould we be ſtocks and ſtones? would not you have us ſenſible of afflictions and temptations, of burthens and reproaches that lie upon us? ſee what the Apoſtle ſaith to this, <hi>As ſorrowful, yet always rejoycing:</hi> The ſpiritual man hath a ſenſe of afflictions and reproaches, and a deep ſenſe too; he ſees all that is in the cup, but he ſees through it, he ſees joy ſurpaſſing all ſorrow. Chriſt he ſaw through the cup; he ſaw the ſhame, and was ſenſible of it; but there was joy that was ſet before him, there was that that ſwallowed up all, that that lifted him up above all; there was a cup of wine that made him forget his ſorrow: <hi>Give wine to him that is ſad in heart.</hi> When our hearts are full of ſorrow, God comes in with a cup of wine: God ſheds abroad his love in our hearts, and <hi>we joy in tribulation,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle: ſo here is the ſacrifice of praiſe in affliction, in trouble, in neceſſity, in reproaches; <hi>being perſecuted we ſuffer patiently, being defamed, we bleſs, and a ſpirit of glory reſts upon us:</hi> We ſee God in all, we ſee a good hand in all: <hi>God will do me good for his curſing,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> The fleſh cannot praiſe at all, no not in all peace, in all abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; all its ſacrifice is to its own net: but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit praiſes in the midſt of tribulation: <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſing in the Priſon; the Apoſtle commends to the <hi>Colloſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ians</hi> long-ſuffering with joyfulneſs, and he tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that as afflictions do abound for Chriſt, ſo conſolations do abound through Chriſt. God comes in to his people in the ſaddeſt afflictions, and tells them, theſe are yours, all is yours, things preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and things to come: life is yours, death is yours, afflictions are yours, they are all your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:118351:72"/>
he ſhews us that we are Lords, and Maſters, and Conquerors: he ſets us above theſe. Chriſt triumphed in the Croſs, as the Apoſtle ſaith; and here is the triumph of a Chriſtian over neceſſities, afflictions, reproaches, yea over death it ſelf, not to be delivered from death, but to be ſet above death, to be conquerours of death; <hi>We are more then Conquerors through him that loved us.</hi> Tis a poor expectation from Chriſt, to expect by Chriſt to be delivered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from reproach, from afflictions, from neceſſities, from ſufferings: Chriſt came to call us into theſe, to ſet us above theſe, and make us more then Conquerors over theſe: <hi>He that will be my diſciple</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let him take up his croſs and follow me. Let us go forth to him without the gate, and by him let us offer, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tis a ſtrange thing, this, to praiſe in afflictions, to be in continual praiſe; but this is <hi>by him.</hi> When we know the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, the vertue and power of his Reſurrection, this will be no ſtrange thing to us; and then we ſhall go forth willingly without the gate, we ſhall go to his reproach chearfully.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us by him, &amp;c.</hi> There is that in every Saint, that ſeed of God, that that is born of God, that ſame holy one, that is in continual praiſes. The noiſe of fleſh often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and for a long time drowns this voyce: but it ſhall be heard when fleſh ſhall be put to ſilence: <hi>When the Lord ariſes into his holy habitation,</hi> you that ſee him ſometimes, and feel him ſometimes, ſhall ſee and feel him always; and you ſhall ſay with the Apoſtle, the life was manifeſt, we have ſeen it, we have handled it, and our eyes have looked upon it. You that ſay you live becauſe he lives, muſt needs ſee you live for ever, for he never dies, and you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dye; you have a life that ſhall never be taken away: <hi>I am the Reſurrection, and the life, and he that believes in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:118351:73"/>
me ſhall never dye:</hi> and this life is nothing but praiſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but thankſgiving: he is all in all, doth all in us and for us, works all our works; and ſo far forth as we ſee him doing all (as we ſhall ſee him perfectly, when we walk in the light as he is in the light) then we ſhall praiſe him in all: tis his faith, his ſap, his vertue, his life, his power, to him be glory: when he acts us, and leads us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whither can we go from him? we muſt needs go to him, we muſt go to praiſe, we muſt go to glory: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the works of the Devil in us, he deſtroys all that goes forth to the world, to the creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at laſt he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all: there ſhall be no going forth but to him, nothing but praiſe; tis he that delivers us from other Lords: <hi>Other Lords have had rule over us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> we have been praiſing the creature, our own wiſdom, our own righteouſneſs; we have been offering up to our luſts: <hi>Other Lords have had dominion over us; now by thee only we will make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy name: you that mention the Lord, keep not ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God doth bring, and will manifeſtly bring all his true born people, his own begotten children in Jeſus Chriſt, I ſay, he will bring them into continual praiſe: Some of theſe it may be do not know yet what it means, the world ſhall never know it. It may be yet we know no other praiſe but an expreſſion of words; we ſhall know, that praiſe is giving up our ſelves to God: We do not know that we pray, but only when we ſet our ſelves apart, and make this Preface, <hi>Come let us pray,</hi> perhaps twice or thrice a day, &amp;c. Tis far from me to condemn any one that is in the uſe of theſe hours and forms; let them be in God in the Spirit, and he will be with them; but take notice that there is continual prayer; therefore thou that haſt thy times, and thy hours, and thy forms, begin to look

                     <hi>That is, the fruit of our lips,</hi> Here take notice, how the tongue and the lips, and the fruit thereof is ſanctified by Jeſus Chriſt, and conſecrated to God. And this, in all thoſe that are ſanctified by Jeſus Chriſt. The fruit of the lips is a ſacrifice acceptable by Chriſt. And therefore the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, Hoſ.</hi> 14. 2. Calls the fruit of the lips, <hi>the Calves of the lips.</hi> The fruit of our lips by the ſanctification of Jeſus Chriſt, is made a ſacrifice acceptable unto God, and not onely the fruit of our lips, but the fruit of our hands, the fruit of our feet, the fruit of all our members. The fruit of the earth, as 'tis ſaid in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 1, 2. (where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks of the manifeſtation of Chriſt in the ſpirit)
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:118351:74"/>
                     <hi>In that day ſhall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and the fruit of the earth ſhall be excellent and comely, for them that are eſcaped;</hi> That is, for the ſpiritual ſeed, the remnant that are taken out of the corruption of the world; when he ſhall come who is the deſire of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeven women ſhall lay hold of him; all ſhall make to him and own him, and be one with him; then the fruit of the earth ſhall be glorious; then we ſhall eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: we ſhall no more wear ſins, nor the devils robes: we ſhall not borrow of ſin, we ſhall no more eat of his bread, but of our own, that which is in our Fathers houſe, and that is Chriſt. And in that day the fruit of the earth, every part of us, the whole body, even the lips that have been full of poyſon; the tongue that hath had the fire of hell in it, ſhall be filled with the fire of Heaven: That that hath been darts and arrows, and ſwords and venome, and the ſting of Aſpes and Dragons, even that ſhall be healing: It ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and delighting: this is by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſhall come forth even in our tongues, and ſeaſon them with grace, and make them to be <hi>a tree of life;</hi> they ſhall miniſter Grace unto the hearers. Chriſt doth reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all that the devil hath carried away (as <hi>Abraham</hi> all that the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> caried away) He recovers it, he takes it out of pollution, and out of filth. There is a <hi>dumb</hi> Devil, a <hi>beaſtly</hi> Devil, a <hi>blaſphemous</hi> Devil, an <hi>accuſing</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, a <hi>pratling</hi> and <hi>buſie body</hi> Devil, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch. Why Chriſt ſhall caſt out every one of theſe Devils: all the fruit of the lips ſhall be a ſacrifice of praiſe: there ſhall be no more of theſe: no backbiting, no ſlandering, no going up and down to tell one anothers faults: nothing but love and Praiſe, and Thankſgiving. Every member ſhall be reſtored, and the tongue ſhall be reſtored. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118351:74"/>
you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as you have yeilded your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſervants of iniquity unto iniquity, ſo yeeld them ſervants of righteouſneſs unto holineſs.</hi> This is by Chriſt, and this is the effect of the ſpirit when he is poured forth, making melody in your hearts; which breaths forth nothing to God but love, nothing to man but love, nothing but praiſe, nothing but joy. Chriſt is a thorow Redeemer, a thorow Reſtorer; and therefore body and ſoul, and every member of the body ſhall be Redeemed. <hi>The ſpirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, ſhall quicken your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bodies.</hi> Chriſt gains the heart to God, and out of the abundance of that the mouth ſpeaks. He makes the heart a treaſury of good things, and then comes forth nothing but good at the door of the lips.</p>
                  <p>The tongue and the lips are either the great inſtruments of the Devil or of God; of Heaven or of Hell; the fire of Heaven and the fire of hell is in the tongue. Acts of life and death are in the power of the tongue. Here is bleſſing and here is curſing. God promiſes in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of <hi>Zachary,</hi> to reſtore unto his people a pure lip or language: and what is this pure language but Praiſe and Thankſgiving? what is it but love, but grace, but edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>they ſhall call upon the Name of the Lord, and ſerve him with one conſent;</hi> a pure language is not in words and ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, but Chriſt fills the heart, thence the mouth is fill'd, as 'tis in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 30, 31. He ſpeaks there of the Righteous man, <hi>His mouth ſpeaks of wiſdom, and his tongue of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the Law of God is in his heart.</hi> This is that which is the New-Teſtament, the Law in our heart: and when the Law is in our heart, then it will be in our tongue. The old adminiſtration began in the tongue, <hi>thou ſhalt ſpeak of it at all times:</hi> the New-Teſtament begins at the heart, <hi>Thou ſhalt write it in the heart;</hi> and then the tongue will ſpeak nothing elſe.</p>

                     <hi>The fruit of our lips.</hi> There is a fruit of our lips that is ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing praiſe, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> coming not from the abundance of the heart, is the greateſt abomination unto God. <hi>A flattering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful tongue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord ſhall cut it out.</hi> There is more of the fire of hell in a tongue that ſpeaks to God, and not from the heart, then in a tongue openly blaſpheming. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> could not bear the devil, that cried, <hi>Theſe are the ſervants of the moſt high God, that ſhew unto us the way of ſalvation.</hi> But Chriſt in the heart, the fire of Heaven in the heart, the Altar in the heart, and there fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out at the mouth, O 'tis ſweet, here's a ſacrifice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>be fill'd with the ſpirit, ſinging and making melody in your hearts to the Lord.</hi> That ſame Praiſe and fruit of the lips that hath not a root in the heart, continues not; but what ſaith the Text, <hi>Let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God continually.</hi> There is a ſeed in the ſtony ground that comes up faſt. There are that ſpeak good words, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly words, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified, Your brethren that hate you, ſaid, let the Lord be glorified,</hi> yet no continual ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; this fruit will be quickly blaſted. He that is a Lyar wants a good Memory. Nothing that is violent is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. No worſhip of God continues, but that which is made natural to us. We may come forth and act parts, but there will be diſcovery of what is in the bottom; and though we hold forth God ſometimes to others, the devil will ſhew his head. <hi>James</hi> met with ſuch, <hi>Can a fountain ſend forth ſweet water and bitter? Can a fig-tree bear figs <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Every one that pretends to Chriſt, let them look what they have by Chriſt. <hi>By him let us offer,</hi> &amp;c. If you are ſanctified by him, you are made willing to go forth to him in his reproach. If you are made willing to go forth to him
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:118351:75"/>
in his reproach, you will be no reproachers. If you be made willing to bear the ſtrife of tongues, and filth of tongues, and dirt of tongues, you will keep your tongues from caſting dirt or filth on any. When the Grace of Chriſt is manifeſted to a ſoul, there is a diſcovery of all the filth it lay in, and out of which it is recovered. And there is a ſenſe of it goes along with it; ſuch a one was I, fooliſh, diſobedient. Now Ile ſpeak evil of no man.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing theſe times call for more, in way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, then that which concerns the tongue. <hi>Look to your tongues,</hi> they are ſlippery members in ſlippery places, and he is a perfect man that doth not offend in his tongue. If we will judge of our ſelves, there is as much evidence will come in by the tongue, as by any thing. <hi>By thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Look how we carry our tongues. If the Law of God be in our hearts, there will be wiſdom in our tongues. Nothing will bewray us and diſcover us like our ſpeech. There is nothing that we need to be warned of, and call'd out of, more then ſtrife of tongues. If our tongues were ſet to love, as they are to foment hatred and diviſion, we ſhould have more peace then we have. Who is it that looks upon himſelf as call'd to inherit a bleſſing? <hi>Refrain thy tongue from evil,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter.</hi> Therefore when you are reproached, reproach not again; when you are defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, do you bleſs: this is the Law of God. If you will profeſs Chriſt, hold forth the Law of Chriſt, and wait for this Law in the ſpirit of life. Wait for Chriſt to come forth in your tongues, to be the ſalt to ſeaſon your hearts, and ſo from your hearts to ſeaſon every part of you, to make your tongue the <hi>glory</hi> of God. To make it your Lute and Harp to ſet forth his praiſes. Look when God will reſtore a pure language: O that God would ſet our
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:118351:76"/>
hearts to learn a pure language! How ſhall we learn a pure language? Come into love, come into Chriſt, and be learning to bear evil language, whiſperings, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings, and ſurmiſings, and evil reports, and defamations, and take up all the dirt and filth that men will throw upon you, and do not thou throw any ſpot upon any, but bleſs and love, and overcome evil with good, and heap coales of fire upon their heads. This is the ſpirit of the Goſpel; And let us at laſt begin to live Goſpel. We have talked of Goſpel a long while; let us once ſee it, where is it? let us labour to bring it forth, to be as Chriſt: he made no noiſe, his voice was not heard, he went about doing good, ſaving, healing, with humble comforting words, <hi>Doing good.</hi> Let us learn this, let us wait for his ſpirit, the ſpirit of the Goſpel, and that is the ſpirit of light.</p>

               <p>In the words read you may ſee a Doctrine, and a Uſe.</p>
               <p>1 A Doctrine propounded, which holds forth the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtate of Believers: <hi>It is that which eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive what it is, but God hath revealed the ſame to us by his ſpirit.</hi> It is in the <hi>letter,</hi> and now our buſineſs is, that it may be <hi>revealed</hi> to us by the <hi>ſpirit:</hi> It may be <hi>the fathers good pleaſure,</hi> and his time now to bring forth the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to ſome that hear me this day, that hitherto have been kept <hi>under Tutors and Governours,</hi> little better then <hi>ſervants:</hi> This we are to try now, how God will be with us to take away the vail, and reveal our inheritance to us.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine begins at the 18 <hi>ver.</hi> and reacheth to the 25 <hi>ver.</hi> At the 25 <hi>ver.</hi> there begins the Uſe, the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is an exhortation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:118351:78"/>2. <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh,</hi> &amp;c. Do not <hi>turn away from him that ſpeaketh</hi> life and glory. Turn not away from him that calleth you to <hi>ſit down in heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle uſeth divers Arguments to enforce the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation; Firſt, He that <hi>ſpeaks,</hi> doth not <hi>ſpeak from earth,</hi> but <hi>from heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, from the danger of refuſing to hear; <hi>If they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſhews the effect of this voice, <hi>ver. 26. Whoſe voice then ſhook the earth, but now he hath promiſed, ſaying, yet once more I ſhake not onely the earth, but alſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And the evidence the Apoſtle brings for this, is from a Scripture taken out of the propheſie of <hi>Haggai, Hag.</hi> 1. 6, 7. The <hi>word</hi> that was <hi>ſpoken</hi> on <hi>earth ſhook the earth:</hi> The <hi>word that</hi> is <hi>ſpoken</hi> from <hi>heaven, ſhakes earth</hi> and <hi>heaven</hi> alſo: Then the Apoſtle interprets this word, <hi>yet once more,</hi> ver. 27. <hi>It ſignifieth the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken, as of things that are made, that thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may remain.</hi> In <hi>ver.</hi> 28. he further enforceth his exhortation, from the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that the Saints have by this change, <hi>Wherefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with reverence, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the former adminiſtration there was not <hi>grace</hi> to <hi>ſerve God acceptably</hi> in this there is; that was leading to <hi>bondage,</hi> this to a <hi>kingdom;</hi> The Apoſtle concludes with this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>For our God is a conſuming fire;</hi> of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak of theſe particulars as time ſhall give leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:118351:78"/>Here you ſee a Goſpel ſtate, what it is: it is a ſtrong ſtate, a glorious ſtate, a ſtate that <hi>cannot be moved, a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that cannot be ſhaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> it is ſtrong, and it is ſweet: There was a weak ſtate, and that was full of terrour: <hi>The Law was weak through the fleſh.</hi> It was a weak ſtate, a ſhaking <hi>Mountain, a Mountain not to be touched<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If ſo much as a beaſt touch the Mountain, it was to be ſtoned, or thruſt through with a dart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> was weak and terrible; but ye are come to <hi>that</hi> which is ſtrong and gracious; <hi>Ye are come to Mount-Sion, to the City of the living God.</hi> The glorious ſtate of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers is held forth here from the 18 verſe to the 25.</p>
               <p>Our buſineſs will be to run over the particulars, with ſome ſhort explication, and to ſet before you one or two parallel Scriptures that hold forth the ſame things, though not ſo fully and particularly.</p>
               <p>The firſt Scripture is <hi>Eph. 2. 5, 6. But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickened us together with Chriſt (by grace ye are ſaved) and hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ver. 17, and 18. of that chapter, <hi>And came and preached peace to you which were afar of, and to them that were nigh,</hi> ver. 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Now therefore ye are no more ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and forreigners, but fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God: And are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ye that are Believers, are come to <hi>Mount-Sion,</hi> and ye are <hi>built up a ſpiritual houſe, fitly framed together, an holy Temple in the Lord: In whom ye alſo are builded together for an habitation of God through the ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Scripture is 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 7. For God hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us a ſpirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a ſound
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:118351:79"/>
mind. We are not come to the Mount that might not be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to blackneſs and darkneſs.</hi> No, God hath poured out another ſpirit upon us, of <hi>power,</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>a ſound mind. Ye are come to the City of the living God, to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeruſalem, and to God the judge of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us briefly run over the words, as they lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye are not come to the Mount that might not be touched:</hi> It might be <hi>touched,</hi> and it might not be <hi>touched.</hi> It might be <hi>touched,</hi> but not without danger of death; It might not be <hi>touched;</hi> There was ſuch a terrible manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, that there was no coming to it. It was an admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of diſtance from God. It had a <hi>ſpirit of fear that gendred unto bondage.</hi> There was a terrible manifeſtation; <hi>There was blackneſs, and darkneſs, and tempeſt, the ſound of a trumpet, and the voice of a word.</hi> Nothing but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward command, a word that could not be obeyed: and when the people undertook to obey it, the Lord pittied them, <hi>O that there were ſuch an heart in this people, that they would obey me!</hi> It was a manifeſtation to diſcover ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and weakneſs, death and the curſe; and ſo to uſher in a manifeſtation of life and power.</p>
               <p>But now ye are come to the Goſpel ſtate, ye are <hi>come to Mount-Sion,</hi> ye are come where God dwells, ye are come into a comforting and chearing preſence: ye are come to the <hi>Mount</hi> that may be <hi>touched</hi> without fear or terror. It may be <hi>touched;</hi> There are ſpiritual ſenſes: as 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 1. That which we have heard, which we hame ſeen, which our hands have handled of the word of life; that declare we unto you, that you may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is with the father, and with his ſon Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and ſo its the Mount that may be touched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are come to the City of the living God.</hi> We are come
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:118351:79"/>
where God dwells, we are come to communion with God, and one with another in the ſpirit; we are come where God is in the midſt of his people: <hi>He hath quickned us who were dead in ſins, and ſet us down in heavenly places,</hi> in the <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem;</hi> If we are come to the <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> we are paſt the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> we are come to our <hi>reſt. There remaineth a reſt to the people of God,</hi> and that's the <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> of which the <hi>earthly Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and <hi>Canaan</hi> were but a Type: This <hi>heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem is the mother of us all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to an innumerable company of Angels:</hi> Not onely to be adminiſtred unto by Angels, as under the legal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation, but to adminiſter unto Angels; <hi>for to them is made known by the Church the manifold wiſdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to the general Aſſembly, and the Church of the firſt-born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are <hi>come to the General Aſſembly,</hi> we are above par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches: though we walk in them, yet we are not bound to them, nor bound in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are come to the Church of the firſt-born, who are written in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are come to thoſe that are <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>partake of the divine nature,</hi> in which God lives, and acts, and whom God fills, who are <hi>born of the ſpirit,</hi> who are <hi>ſons and heirs together with Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who are written in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a firſt-born written in earth in the letter, in fleſh; <hi>Let Iſrael my ſon go, for he is my firſt-born,</hi> ſaid God to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> but this was after the fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are come to God the Judge of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have boldneſs towards God.</hi> We are above the <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of men, yea, above the <hi>judgement</hi> of our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. <hi>It is a very ſmall thing to me</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians) to be judged by you, or of mans judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:118351:80"/>
yea, <hi>I judge not mine own ſelf,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 3. <hi>We are paſſed from death to life,</hi> and <hi>we are come to God the Judge of all,</hi> we can ſtand before God the <hi>Iudge of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are <hi>come to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are come to ſee and to acknowledge the ſpiritual and <hi>divine nature,</hi> whereof, through <hi>exceeding great and precious promiſes,</hi> we are made partakers; we are come to ſee, and to be the ſpiritual man, the <hi>new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs:</hi> we are come to the <hi>holy one,</hi> born of the Holy Ghoſt, to <hi>Chriſt formed in us,</hi> who is not tainted with any pollution, <hi>who ſinneth not, nor can he commit ſin:</hi> Though he dwell among devils and death, yet he partakes not of their filth and guilt, but ſhall overcome and deſtroy them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to Ieſus the Mediator of the new Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are come <hi>to Ieſus, to the truth as it is in Ieſus,</hi> to the <hi>power and wiſdom of God, which is Ieſus, we have the Law written in our hearts. We are come to Ieſus inſtead of Moſes,</hi> who is the <hi>Mediator of a better Covenant.</hi> If we be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians indeed, we are not come to a Law that hath onely <hi>a ſound of words, written on ſtone,</hi> but we are come to a <hi>Law written in our hearts;</hi> we are <hi>come to Ieſus the Mediator of the new Covenant:</hi> We are come to the efficacy of his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to the blood of ſprinkling, that ſpeaketh better things then that of Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The blood of ſprinkling,</hi> It is an alluſion taken from thoſe <hi>ſprinklings under the Law,</hi> all which pointed to this. We are not come <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> corruptible <hi>blood,</hi> we are come to the <hi>blood of ſprinkling,</hi> that is incorruptible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſpeaks better things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ſpeaks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and what doth it ſay? It makes <hi>interceſsion</hi> for us; it makes <hi>interceſſion</hi> in us; and the Lord he is with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:118351:80"/>
us, by a word of power, ſpeaking and commanding ſin and death, Satan and Hell out of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>This is the Doctrine: The <hi>glorious ſtate,</hi> which is the true Goſpel ſtate, it is the ſtate of every true Believer, though it may be many do not know it; it is a ſtate in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and it is revealed by the <hi>ſpirit:</hi> This is the Goſpel ſtate; and therefore if you profeſs the Goſpel, do not ſit down below it: Let us all be making to it, let us not ſtay at <hi>Mount-Sinai,</hi> but let us paſs on to <hi>Mount Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let every one of us look whereabouts we are, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be under a <hi>ſpirit of fear;</hi> if we be, this is <hi>Mount-Sinai;</hi> or whether we be under a <hi>ſpirit of love, of power,</hi> and <hi>of a ſound minde;</hi> if we be, this is <hi>Mount-Sion;</hi> Are we <hi>in earthly, or in heavenly places?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take notice that there are three ſtates.</p>
               <p>1. One is in <hi>Egypt,</hi> under the bondage of ſin, Satan, death and hell.</p>
               <p>2. Another is leading out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> at <hi>Mount-Sinai,</hi> leading up to <hi>Adams</hi> perfection, to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in nature; but there is no reſting here: This is but a ſhadow: <hi>Chriſt in the fleſh, came</hi> in this natural perfection, but he dyed to it, and in it, and roſe again to the life of God.</p>
               <p>3. A third ſtate is, <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect;</hi> Here is <hi>reſt,</hi> and ſtability; Here is the <hi>kingdom of God;</hi> do not ſit down below this; for if you do, you <hi>ſit down</hi> at beſt in natural Reaſon, in a ſhadow, in a lye.</p>
               <p>Some ſit down in the filth of nature; but do not ye ſit down, no not in the excellency and perfection of nature; <hi>Look to the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> unto which ye are called.</p>
               <p>But I paſs over from the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and come to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> which the Apoſtle makes in <hi>ver.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:118351:81"/>
                  <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh; for if they eſcaped not; who refuſed him that ſpake on earth: much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God ſpeaks <hi>once,</hi> and <hi>twice,</hi> and we <hi>hear him not;</hi> God is continually ſpeaking. He ſpeaks in every creature, he ſpeaks in every providence, he ſpeaks in every adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do you know his voice? He ſpeaks on earth, and he ſpeaks from heaven; <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh; God ſpeaks from earth; if I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>how will ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</hi> There are higher, and there are lower adminiſtrations wherein God appears: Are we acquainted with them? Do we know them? God ſpeaks on earth from <hi>Mount-Sinai,</hi> and he ſpeaks from heaven at <hi>Mount-Sion;</hi> he ſpake from <hi>Mount-Sinai,</hi> and he was <hi>refuſed,</hi> yet there was a ſhew of entertaining; <hi>All that the Lord ſaith unto us, will we do;</hi> but <hi>O, ſaid the Lord, that there were ſuch an heart in this people, that they would obey my voice!</hi> They ſaid they would obey, but their <hi>hearts turned back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God <hi>ſpeaks on earth;</hi> and who doth hear? who doth not <hi>refuſe?</hi> he ſpeaks with a loud voice on earth: he manifeſts his glory, and every one ſeems to hear, ſeems to ſtoop and bow before him, but they are all <hi>lyars:</hi> God ſpeaks from heaven, he ſpeaks in the ſpirit, he ſpeaks in a <hi>low and ſtill voice,</hi> as it were afar off, in a far Country, and from this <hi>far Country</hi> he ſends to his Subjects to ſee if they will own him; but they ſay, <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us:</hi> God comes in a full manifeſtation of himſelf, and then every knee ſtoops and bows to him; ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, others feignedly and lyingly, as it is ſaid, <hi>Thine enemies ſhall be found lyars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When God ſhall make us <hi>Mount-Sion,</hi> when he ſhall
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:118351:81"/>
awaken the <hi>ſpiritual man,</hi> when he ſhall quicken the <hi>new man,</hi> that lieth (as it were) dead in us, then we ſhall hear, then we ſhall obey.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſo much concerns us, as to know the voyce of God, to hear him ſpeak, <hi>My ſheep hear my voyce, and the voyce of a ſtranger they will not hear,</hi> John 10.</p>
               <p>God ſpeaks, and God gives an <hi>ear</hi> to hear him <hi>ſpeak; He that hath an ear to hear let him hear: Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not deſire; mine ears haſt thou opened: then ſaid I, Lo I come, in the volumn of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will,</hi> Pſal. 40. 6, 7. God is ſpeaking, and the Devil is ſpeaking; happy are they whoſe ears God hath opened, that can diſtinguiſh, that know the voyce of God from the voyce of a ſtranger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaks:</hi> There is nothing in man but what <hi>refuſeth</hi> to hear God ſpeak, but what <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth</hi> God himſelf; whether he ſpeaks from earth, or from heaven. That man doth hear God <hi>ſpeak,</hi> that doth <hi>know the voyce</hi> of God, it is the <hi>ſpiritual man,</hi> the <hi>new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man</hi> that is <hi>born of the Spirit.</hi> The carnal man, the <hi>natural man</hi> cannot poſſibly hear God ſpeak, he <hi>refuſeth</hi> God; <hi>The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is in him, is enmity to God: He is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be:</hi> But they that <hi>will</hi> not know his voyce, they ſhall know it: They that <hi>will</hi> not yield to it, ſhall be broken by it; it is a terrible voyce: When he ſhall come, and ſpeak from heaven, thoſe whoſe hearts are not brought to a compliance with him, ſhall be deſtroyed by his preſence: <hi>He will come in flaming fire, to render ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to them that obey not the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next we may take notice of the effects of this voyce: <hi>whoſe voyce then ſhook the earth, but he hath promiſed ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Yet once more I ſhake not the earth only, but heaven alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:118351:82"/>When you meet with ſhakings, and violent motions, then know what the matter is; Why, the Lord is <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Heaven</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> are <hi>ſhaking</hi> at this time: Do we ſee the Lord, and hear the Lord? We are fallen into ſhaking times: <hi>His voyce once ſhook the earth,</hi> but now it <hi>ſhakes</hi> not only <hi>earth,</hi> but <hi>heaven.</hi> Haggai 2. This Scripture ſhews what is to be expected; the <hi>ſhaking</hi> of <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> and then <hi>the deſire of all nations:</hi> What is that? Why, it is Chriſt: he is called <hi>the deſire of all nations:</hi> All nations deſire him, though they do not know him; and when he is come, he ſhall fill Sion and Jeruſalem; he ſhall fill his Saints and people; the City and the houſe built of <hi>living ſtones,</hi> ſhall be <hi>filled with Glory: he will fill all things,</hi> Eph. 4. 10.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt came forth in fleſh, there were ſhakings in heaven and earth: When Chriſt came forth in Spirit upon the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians, what a ſhaking was there then of heaven and earth? What ſtrange workings were there in the hearts of men, through the light, and <hi>evidence,</hi> and <hi>demonſtration of ſpirit</hi> that went abroad? That was the beginning of this laſt ſhaking; after that God was pleaſed to draw in, and to retire, that the <hi>wicked one</hi> might return again to ſhew what he was, that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> might appear, and ſet up his trade under the name of the Spirit: and when the <hi>man of ſin is fully revealed,</hi> then the Lord will come forth again, and by the <hi>Spirit of his mouth,</hi> and the <hi>brightneſs of his coming,</hi> will he utterly <hi>deſtroy him,</hi> and that will be a terrible ſhaking indeed: <hi>Yet once more I ſhake not earth only, but heaven.</hi> This ſhaking is begun: Are we ſenſible of it? What <hi>wars and rumors of wars</hi> are there? What <hi>overturnings?</hi> Let us ſee whether we be not under the appearance of this ſhaking? ſhaking of earth, ſhaking of heaven, ſhaking of Forms, of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:118351:82"/>
of Churches: All that is earthly ſhall be ſhaken, that the earthlineſs being removed, the true body may be brought forth anew in the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How many in theſe times hove loſt their wiſdom, and their righteouſneſs that they looked upon as great gain? was ever ſuch confuſion as there is at this day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet once more I ſhake not the earth only, but heaven:</hi> It is certain we are come to it, but are we ſenſible of it? God is <hi>ſhaking</hi> us out of fleſhly and formal Religion, out of mans Religion, and mans Righteouſneſs; he is deſtroying <hi>the old man,</hi> and bringing forth <hi>the new man:</hi> he is deſtroying the old <hi>earth and heaven,</hi> and bringing forth a <hi>new earth and heaven,</hi> wherein righteouſneſs ſhall dwell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He hath promiſed, ſaying, yet once more:</hi> This terrible <hi>ſhaking</hi> cometh forth in a <hi>promiſe:</hi> It is a mercy, a bleſſing, a deliverance: It is the <hi>Redemption</hi> of the people of God: <hi>Lift up your heads, for your Redemption draweth nigh.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were in <hi>Priſon,</hi> and in the <hi>Stocks</hi> at <hi>Midnight,</hi> there was an <hi>earthquake that ſhook the foundations of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and that became their deliverance. How many of the Saints will lie in Priſon, and in the Stocks at midnight, till this earthquake come and ſhake them out? Then ſhall come <hi>the deſire of all nations; By terrible things in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wilt thou anſwer us, O God of our ſalvation:</hi> How will God anſwer us? Why, ſaith he, I muſt remove all this corruptible frame; I muſt <hi>create a new heaven and a new earth:</hi> I muſt ſhake the Civil Eſtate, and the Religious Eſtate: I muſt ſhake off old <hi>Adam,</hi> I muſt ſhake out <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt:</hi> Chriſt muſt go away in his appearance in <hi>fleſh,</hi> that he may return again in the <hi>Spirit:</hi> That which is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carnal muſt be ſhaken and removed, that that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which cannot be moved may remain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We wonder what God meaneth when he is pulling
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:118351:83"/>
down and deſtroying: Why, he meaneth to <hi>plant</hi> and to <hi>build:</hi> and when we ſee his deſign, we ſit down and are ſtill.</p>
               <p>It is a ſad thing to a childe to hear that the time ſhall come when all his Rattles ſhall be taken from him. What a ſad thing is it while we are childiſh Chriſtians, to have our Religion as it is of man ſhaken! It hath a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and glory in it, but it is to be ſhaken, that that which is excellent indeed may come in its place.</p>
               <p>To know the ſtate of <hi>Chriſt riſen from the dead,</hi> was that which <hi>Paul</hi> was making after: <hi>The Reſurrection of the dead.</hi> Before we can come to this, the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt</hi> muſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie all the glory of fleſh.</p>
               <p>And that is to be taken notice of, That the laſt ſhaking ſhall be the moſt terrible ſhaking. God will ſhake all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; no nation ſhall eſcape, nor man in it, ſhake them in their <hi>earth,</hi> ſhake them in their <hi>heaven:</hi> God need to ſhake but once, and ſhake all to pieces; certainly he will ſhake once more: and we may think after this ſhaking to ſettle again, but all that is ſhaken ſhall be done away; that which is <hi>natural</hi> ſhall be done away, that that which is <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> may take place. Are we ſenſible of theſe ſhakings? it is only the ſpiritual man that is ſenſible of it: the carnal and natural man <hi>eats and drinks till the flood comes and ſweeps all away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle expounds thoſe words, <hi>Yet once more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this word, yet once more, ſignifieth the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken, as of things that are made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All fleſhly forms of Religion, all mans Righteouſneſs, all this outward frame of things, are <hi>things that are made,</hi> and therefore muſt be <hi>done away,</hi> that thoſe things which <hi>cannot be ſhaken may remain.</hi> Tis true, the ſpiritual man is made, but as he is taken into God, and in union with God, he is not made, the <hi>new creature</hi> is not made.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:118351:83"/>
Tis one thing to make, another thing to create. Its ſaid, the Word was made fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us; that is, the Word was (for a while) vailed or covered with fleſh: he took fleſh upon him; <hi>Foraſmuch as the children were partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame,</hi> Heb. 2. 14. <hi>but the ſpiritual man in union with God,</hi> is taken into God, and carried into Mount <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtles inference or concluſion is, <hi>Wherefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Kingdom that cannot be moved: Let us have grace whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we come to the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that is ſpiritual, <hi>Let us have grace:</hi> We are come to <hi>grace,</hi> let us make uſe of it, to <hi>ſerve God with reverence and godly fear.</hi> Here is <hi>freewil,</hi> the right <hi>freewil, freewil</hi> in Chriſt and in the Spirit: This new man ſits at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and draws water out of the wells of Salvation; this new man hath <hi>freedom</hi> to work out his ſalvation; he hath <hi>grace to ſerve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:</hi> Do ye ſee what the <hi>Kingdom</hi> is that cannot be <hi>moved?</hi> Why, it is to <hi>ſerve God:</hi> Here is the Kingdom; a natural, free complying with God: When we ſhall <hi>have the minde of Chriſt,</hi> it ſhall be our joy and delight to <hi>ſerve God:</hi> and this <hi>ſervice</hi> ſhall be with <hi>reverence and godly fear.</hi> The nearer we come to God, the more awe, the more fear; but it is a fear with love and joy, <hi>with reverence and godly fear; For our God is a conſuming fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Saints do <hi>glorifie God in the fire,</hi> in the flames, which conſumes all fleſh: <hi>God is a conſuming fire,</hi> that conſumes death and hell to the new man, that is one with him, that knows him, and therefore rejoyceth in thoſe flames, <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies him in the fire:</hi> and when his bones are burnt, then

he <hi>walks with the ſon of God,</hi> as the <hi>three young men</hi> in the <hi>fiery furnace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are ſaved, yet ſo as by fire:</hi> God is dealing with the people that are his, burning up their <hi>hay and ſtubble, their droſs and tin,</hi> and changing them into his <hi>image</hi> daily. And if our God be a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> then here is ſafety in God; there need no carnal weapons to keep thoſe ſafe that dwell in God: <hi>For our God is a conſuming fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Scripture that hath been opened to you, is a <hi>Glaſs</hi> that God holds out to us, and ſets before us; Let us look there, and <hi>ſee our faces;</hi> and the Lord ſet upon our hearts thoſe diſcoveries that he makes of himſelf to us, that he makes of himſelf in us, that ſo they may abide, that we may not <hi>go away, and forget what manner of faces we have: That being doers of the Law,</hi> as well as hearers of it; that the <hi>Law being written in our hearts,</hi> and we dwelling in God, and God in us, <hi>may be changed into the ſame image, from Glory, to Glory, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Epiſtle is written to the <hi>ſcattered</hi> Jews, which had ſcattered their <hi>Religion:</hi> There is a <hi>carnal</hi> profeſſion of Religion, which after a while is ſcattered and comes to <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. James</hi> in this Epiſtle ſhews what luſts and evils did lift up their heads, and bear ſway among this ſcattered people, who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were under great preſſures, yet did not amend,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:118351:85"/>
nor take up as to thoſe evil courſes: But ſcattered and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted they were; therefore <hi>James</hi> begins to inſtruct them as touching Afflictions and Temptations; <hi>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations,</hi> in the ſecond Verſe of the firſt Chapter; then he comes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and reaſon againſt many evils which were found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, as you may ſee if you ſhall peruſe the Epiſtle from the beginning unto this fourth Chapter; here he tels them of their brawlings and quarrellings, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and fightings one with another. The Jews were in Affliction, and <hi>James</hi> he is diſcovering their ſin, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and brawling; that is one he mentions here; and he is turning their eyes to look into the ſpring of this; <hi>From whence comes wars?</hi> Ver. 1. Here's wars and fightings, braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and quarrellings; from whence comes theſe? he ſhews them whence, even from within, from your luſts; and then he diſcovers the pitiful condition that the power of theſe luſts puts them into; it makes them war, and fight, and kill, and yet they cannot be ſatisfied: <hi>Ye luſt,</hi> in the ſecond Verſe, <hi>and have not; ye kill and deſire to have, yet cannot obtain; ye fight and war, yet ye have not, becauſe ye ask not.</hi> And ſo here <hi>Luſt</hi> puts them upon tryal of every thing to ſatisfie it ſelf; it will try heaven, and try hell, it will pray, and it will fight, and it will kill, and gets as much by fighting and killing, as by praying, and as much by praying as by the other; for luſt ſhall never attain any thing by prayer. <hi>Ye ask and ye receive not,</hi> in the third verſe, <hi>becauſe ye ask amiſs, to conſume it upon your luſts;</hi> and then he ſhews what theſe luſts are in the fourth Verſe, World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, earneſt going forth after the creature: we muſt have this, and we muſt have that; <hi>Give me children</hi> (ſaith <hi>Rachel) or elſe I dye. Ye adulterers and adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God?</hi> where he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:118351:85"/>
what theſe luſts are, and what this luſt makes them, Enemies to God, <hi>Adulterers and Adultereſſes,</hi> pretending Religion and Friendſhip with God, yet look to the world, make after the things thereof: and then he mindes them of the Scripture that diſcovers theſe evils in all mens hearts, in the fifth verſe, <hi>Do you think that the Scripture ſaith in vain, The ſpirit that dwelleth in us luſteth to envy?</hi> All this raſhneſs comes from your luſts, and the Scripture hath told us that there is this evil in our hearts: when he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the evil, then he is giving direction what to do in the ſixth verſe, and ſo on: there's the power whereby to act, <hi>He gives more grace:</hi> the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit luſts to envy:</hi> we are all carried to envy: Then to what purpoſe is it to endeavor any thing that is good (might ſome ſay) Why, he gives more grace; and therefore what is to be done? ſubmit your ſelves to God, and leave luſting; leave deſiring, put your ſelves into the diſpoſe of God; ſay, <hi>Here we are, do with us what thou wilt,</hi> make us rich, or make us poor, teach us to be hungry, and teach us to be full. Do thou feed us with food convenient, we will not be our own carvers: <hi>Submit your ſelves to God;</hi> he will be careful of us, when we ſubmit our ſelves to him; <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee from you.</hi> The Devil is in Luſt, and ſo long as you ſerve luſt, you ſerve the Devil; ſubmit your ſelves to God, and then God will be for you, and you ſhall have power over the Devil: you ſhall be no more captives to him. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you:</hi> So long as luſt preys, and ſtrives for its own ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, here is no comfort to you, all that is the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of luſt; but draw near to God, bring clean hands and pure hearts. Now ye are double-eyed, you look to God, and you look to the world; you make a fair ſhew to God, but your hearts are ſet upon
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:118351:86"/>
the creature: purifie your hearts, and purifie your hands: this is <hi>Jame's</hi> plain dealing with his own kindred the Jews: We will run over ſome of theſe particulars as the time ſhall give leave, and as we ſhall conceive to be moſt profitable.</p>
               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>Wars, fightings, contentions, brawling, quarrelling:</hi> This was a piece of the evil that did work among the Jews: the Jews were ſcattered, afflicted, yet ſo many as lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, could not live in peace. All the world was againſt them, and their own hands were againſt one another; Their afflictions could not reconcile them one to another, nor make them friends; oft-times an enemy abroad makes peace at home; and we then fall to quarrels and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among our ſelves, when we are ſecured from abroad: But we ſee outward affliction doth nothing upon a man, but diſcover and bring forth what is within; even as a Tempeſt at ſea, it diſcovers what is at the bottom; there is mud and filth, and then the ſea foams it up. If there be good in the heart, affliction brings it up; if there be evil, it draws out that: afflictions and troubles in carnal hearts, work nothing but baſeneſs, and make diſcoveries of what evil is within, working murmuring, quarrelling in bitter ſpirits: When we are wroth and angry, then we fall one upon another, and he that is weakeſt, he ſhall bear moſt. This ſame people of the Jews were the people of Gods curſe; there was but a little remnant that ſhould be ſaved, but a remnant that were ſpiritual: The Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 15. thus deſcribes them; they neither pleaſed God, and they were contrary to all men: Tis <hi>James</hi> his work here, as it was <hi>Pauls,</hi> if it were poſſible, to ſave ſome of them, and to pull them out of the fire: wars and fightings, quarrellings among brethren, and that under ſtrangers and enemies oppreſſing them; and they profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſervants of God; and owning the royal Law of Love,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:118351:86"/>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, and thy neighbor as thy ſelf:</hi> this was very foul. The deſign of God in that people, chooſing them, and dealing with them, heaping bleſſings upon them, chaſtening them with afflictions, inſtructing them from heaven: his ſpecial deſign was (beſides gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his Elect from among them) to ſhew the nature of man, how ſtubborn, how rebellious, how incorrigible; his neck like an iron ſinew, his brow of braſs, altogether irreconcileable, carrying Leopards ſpots that will not be waſhed off; the Blackamoors tan, that will not be ſcour'd. God he ſuffered them till there was no remedy; as you ſee 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> latter end. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. he asks, <hi>What he ſhould do, or what he could do more to his vineyard, that he had not done?</hi> His deſign therefore was to diſcover unto us, what our nature is; to diſcover that evil ſpirit, that the Scripture ſays is in every man, that the Scripture may not ſay it in vain, as elſe it ſhould: And therefore let none of us boaſt againſt the branches, as the Apoſtle hath it: There is the ſame envy in us, the ſame evil, the ſame rebellion, though it may not be altogether ſo diſcovered: If there be any good in any of us, it comes from God. <hi>Every good and perfect gift is from above:</hi> that that is truly good, it comes by our being born of him, by partaking of the ſap, and the fatneſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wars and fightings:</hi> Quarrellings they do not become Saints, profeſt Saints; they do not become thoſe that own the Spirit of God: The Spirit is unity; <hi>The unity of the Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Eph. 3. 3. Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit. There is one Lord, one Faith,</hi> and this Spirit it keeps us in unity, though it trains us up in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Adminiſtrations; it keeps us in unity, by cauſing us to do that is ſet down in <hi>Epheſ. 2. 4. With all lowlineſs, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in love, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:118351:87"/>
one to another, bearing one with another, by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mindedneſs, &amp; meekneſs:</hi> Every one is for unity, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſtands that he would rule, and he would ſet down what ſhould be done; and he complains of diſſentions, and want of peace, becauſe all will not come unto him, when we ſhould condeſcend one to another, and ſubmit one to another with all lowlineſs of minde. Quarrellings and contentions they are very unbecoming Saints, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about outward things: <hi>Why do ye not ſuffer wrong?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Controverſies in matters of Religion, and Differences in Judgement, theſe differences ſhould be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly carried: there is but one Umpire, but one Judge, and thats the Spirit of God: So though thou and I differ, who ſhall reſolve? the Reſolution is the Lords, why therefore wait quietly till God reveal, and God will reveal the ſame to him, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil. 3. 16. Is there any that fear God? you ſhall all grow up to a perfect man;</hi> What God hath revealed to one, he will reveal to the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wars:</hi> Contentions, quarrellings, brawlings, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not Saints: <hi>If any ſeem to be contentious,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we have no ſuch Cuſtom;</hi> and they that live in the Spirit, will own no ſuch Cuſtom: All differences they are commended to the Spirit, commended to God: and ſo when we differ, we ſit down waiting until God ſhall teach us, till the Meſſiah come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From whence come Wars and contentions among you?</hi> Tis good to enquire and examine into the root of all manner of evil that is amongſt us: From whence comes this, and from whence comes that? here's this evil, here's the other evil: tis good to look into the root and ſpring whence every one comes. We ſhall have a better ſight of things, when we ſee their original, and when we ſee their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Tis the evil principle that makes a thing evil; tis a good
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:118351:87"/>
principle that makes a thing good; every thing is good and evil, as the principle is good or evil: God is the good principle, and Satan is the evil principle; as God hath a hand in all, all is good; <hi>and to the pure all things are pure;</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: to him that is defiled, nothing is pure, and we are not able to judge of any thing, whether it be good or evil, till we know the principle: The ſame thing that is good in one, is evil in another, becauſe it comes from a good principle in one, and from an evil principle in another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From whence come wars and contentions?</hi> It concerns us to look to the root and ſpring of evil, to ſee the evil, and from whence it comes. Again, we had need to have our eyes turn'd unto the root of evils, and to ſee that they have their root <hi>within us,</hi> and their cauſe within us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Come they not hence, even from our luſts?</hi> Becauſe we have a trick of ſhifting off things, tranſlating them, we can hide our ſins like <hi>Adam: The woman thou gaveſt me,</hi> ſaith he: <hi>The Serpent beguiled me,</hi> ſaith ſhe: We cry out, ſuch occaſions, ſuch company, ſuch evil times, Satan, nay God himſelf: <hi>But let no man when he is tempted, ſay, I am tempted of God, for God tempts no man to evil; every man when he is tempted is drawn aſide of his own luſt:</hi> Whence then comes evil? <hi>Whence comes wars and contentions? come they not hence, even from your luſts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They come from your luſts:</hi> Men do get children, and lay them at other mens doors; men binde heavy burthens, and lay them on other mens ſhoulders: the Apoſtle here would have every man take up his own burthen; and we ſhall never be eaſed of our own burthens, till we firſt take them on our own ſhoulders; and then Chriſt will ſay, <hi>Come to me ye that are weary and heavy laden, and Ile refreſh you, and eaſe you:</hi> he will firſt have us feel the weight of our
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:118351:88"/>
own burthens, and then he will eaſe us, and take them off. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> here ſhews the cauſe of all trouble that is in us: when we are in quarrels and contentions, we loſe our peace: <hi>And whence is this?</hi> thank your ſelves, ſaith he, <hi>it is your luſt:</hi> Do not ſay that ſuch a one is contentious, look into your own hearts: All the trouble that is upon us, we are the Authors of, it hath its root in us, we may thank our ſelves for it: <hi>Thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf,</hi> ſaith the Lord: God, though he doth appoint every thing, and order every thing, his providence is in every thing, yet that that man doth, he doth freely, and he is drawn aſide by his luſt, and therefore there's no ſhifting it of. When the Apoſtle is mentioning Gods taking whom he will, he brings in an Objecting, <hi>Then why doth he finde fault?</hi> Why, here is the reaſon why he findes fault; though he hardens <hi>Pharoahs</hi> heart, yet <hi>Pharoah</hi> doth harden his own heart, and is carried to do that he doth by his own luſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed: We muſt ſee in our ſelves the fountain of all evil, and then if we be of God, we ſhall alſo ſee in our ſelves the fountain of all good. There is that that is born of the fleſh, that hath all evil in it; there is this nature that comes of God, that hath all good, and no evil in it: <hi>From whence come wars and contentions? come they not hence, even from your luſts?</hi> Yea, hence they ſpring, and here's the root of all: <hi>Your luſts which war in your members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your luſts:</hi> Whats luſt? earneſt going forth of your hearts after the creature; and here's the work of luſt, which is to war, and here's the place where this warring is, <hi>In your members, your luſts which war in your members:</hi> What are theſe members in which luſt doth war? There is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body which hath members, and there is a ſpiritual body which hath alſo members: of theſe ſpiritual bodies there are two ſorts, Thère is a ſpiritual body, the body of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:118351:88"/>
Chriſt; there is a ſpiritual body, the body of Satan: there's the man Chriſt, and there's the man of ſin. Theſe ſame members in which luſts war, are the members of a ſpiritual body; which <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. he ſpeaks of the Law of his members, which did war againſt the Law of his minde; he complains in the next verſe of the body of death, of the body of ſin; <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin!</hi> for its a ſpiritual body, and theſe members are members of that body: And the Apoſtle mentions theſe in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> Col. 3. 5. <hi>Mortifie your earthly members, fornication, uncleanneſs, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs.</hi> The members of the natural body are theſe, hands, feet, eyes; the members of a ſpiritual body, the body of ſin, the body of death, Satans body, are forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, uncleanneſs, covetouſneſs; here luſt wars; and this is that body the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 37. when he ſays, <hi>I beat down my body, I keep it in ſubjection:</hi> Papiſts look upon him as intending this natural body, ſo they betake themſelves to faſting, whipping themſelves, ſuch bitter doings; but its the body of ſin, and the body of death where luſt doth war. War, againſt whom? Againſt the ſoul, ſaith <hi>Peter; I beſeech you abſtain from fleſhly luſts which war againſt the ſoul;</hi> war againſt the Spirit; <hi>the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit,</hi> Gal. 5. <hi>as the ſpirit luſts againſt the fleſh:</hi> They war againſt God, and the Spirit, and God againſt them; there is Satan, death and ſin in theſe luſts; the wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity to God, the friendſhip of the world is enmity to God, it wars againſt God. This is that <hi>James</hi> ſaith in Verſe 4. from this Text, <hi>Know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity to God, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe luſts do war againſt God, they are the bryars and thorns that are ſet in battel againſt God, as it is in <hi>Iſa. 27. 4. Who will ſet the bryars and thorns againſt me in battel? Ile go through
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:118351:89"/>
them; and burn them together.</hi> Luſts they war againſt God, God comes forth in his appearances, theſe oppoſe him; God appears in a Law; why Luſt ſtands up in a Law, I muſt have this, I muſt have that ſays Luſt: God he calls, he would have the heart, and he would have love, and he would have righteouſneſs: Luſt ſays, I muſt have it. It wars againſt God; and think you what Luſt ſhall get by this warfare againſt the great God.</p>
               <p>That you ſhall ſee here in the ſecond ver. <hi>Ye luſt and have not, ye kill and deſire to have, and cannot obtain; ye fight and war, yet ye have not.</hi> And ſo Luſt is miſerably diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Luſt wars and fights, and kills, and it does not onely war and fight and kill, but it preys too: Luſt will be Religious, Luſt will murther and devour, and commit all outrages, and it will be as civil and as Religious as any in the outward ſhew. Ye ask too, and yet ye have not; and ſo heres nothing but diſappointment in Luſt, in going out to the world: <hi>ye fight and war, and ye have not:</hi> Ye have not what ye would have, ye have not enough. Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in reſpect of Satisfaction and Reſt, that is the lot of Luſt, of all deſires going out from God, going out to the creature; go out to any thing but God, ye ſhall never have it. Ye ſhall have this thing, ye ſhall have the other thing, but ye ſhall never be happy: and the thing ye ſeek is happineſs; Every man ſeeks it. Luſt calls for this thing, and the other thing: ye may have the thing, but ye ſhall never be happy. He ſends leanneſs into your ſouls, he gave them their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and ſent leanneſs withal into their ſouls. There are two things that cauſe the diſappointment of worldly and fleſhly Luſt. The one is, that it wars with God, which is Omnipotent; Luſt crucifies him. The other is, becauſe it ſeeks ſatisfaction and reſt in thoſe things that cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:118351:89"/>
it, and ſo tis like the grave and hell, ſtill it cries, give, give. It deſires ſhadows, it claſps about them, it cannot deſire God. It deſires nothing but to kill him. It would kill him that is onely deſirable, that is onely life, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happineſs. How happy are they in whom God is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Luſt? How miſerable are they that are ſerving their Luſts? when will be an end of this drudgery? While ye are walking on in your Luſts, you'l ſet upon any thing. If you can't move heaven, you'l ſee if you can move hell. You'l try if you can get it by Prayer; if you cannot, you'l get it by fighting; but you ſhall have it neither way. You do but kill your ſelves all the while. You war againſt the ſoul, you war againſt God and man, and muſt needs war againſt your ſoul. While that Luſt lives, it brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but torment; Its a very hell unto a man; Its the very devil: therefore when <hi>James</hi> preſcribes the remedy, he ſays, <hi>Reſiſt the devil, and he will flie from you.</hi> Serving luſt is ſerving the devil: Its drudging in hell. You'l ever be poor, you'l never be rich, you'l be drudges while you live, or elſe be thieves and murtherers, you'l fight and war, ye kill and yet ye have not. God ſays that hee'l fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh all the Gods of the Heathen; this Luſt is the great God; famiſh this, and they are all famiſh'd; and God will famiſh this, and what will you be famiſh'd with it! O awake rather, that it may be ſlain; you will ſuffer continually while you live in it, whiles you are led by it; it will be with you as with a man that hath a dogs ſtomack, it will never be ſatisfied, like one who hath a wolf in his body, it will eat him and devour him, there is no ſatisfying him. Who is it that would live in peace, and not in torment? if you will live in peace, give up your luſts, ſubmit your ſelves to God, let him diſpoſe of you, as <hi>James</hi> expreſſes in that which follows, Turn to God, and deſire nothing but him;

all deſires and prayings, which are not after God, they are only ſtretchings out, and inlargings of heart, and there is nothing but filling with wind, nothing but emptying it ſelf. O that God would come in and deſtroy all theſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry dogs, and all theſe greedy hell-hounds, theſe ſame luſts and devils; <hi>You luſt and have not, you kill and deſire to have, and cannot obtain; ye war, and fight, and have not:</hi> Here's the progreſs of your luſt, it comes to fighting.

                  <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> came to preach Chriſt at <hi>Philippi:</hi> Luſt ſtands up, here are men come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (ſay they) will turn the world upſide down: The buſineſs was, they had caſt out a devil, and they heard they brought in great revenue to ſome of them.</p>

and ſo it is when it goes forth to praying, as if it did go to fighting, <hi>Iſa. 66. He that offers an Oxe, is as if he did kill a man: he that offers a ſheep, had as good cut off a dogs neck:</hi> Prayer we are for, but for right Prayer; not Luſts Prayer, but Faiths Prayer, Spirits Prayer, Chriſts Prayer, For you ask and receive not, becauſe you ask amiſs. Luſt cannot ask aright: and here firſt of all, take notice of this, that every truth hath its counterfeit; every thing both earthly and ſpiritual: there is a truth and the counterfeit: there is true Religion, and there is falſe Religion; there is right Prayer, and there is praying amiſs: there is right hearing, and hearing amiſs: take heed how you hear; there is hearing mixt with Faith, and hearing that is not mixt with Faith: There is drawing neer to God with the lips, when the heart is far from him; there is <hi>Jezabels</hi> faſt, and there is <hi>Iehoſaphats</hi> faſt; there is nothing the Saints do, but the world will counterfeit; there is nothing that <hi>Moſes</hi> did, but the Magicians did likewiſe: the devils Miniſters are transformed into the Miniſters of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: good and evil, it lies within, it lies in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as I ſhew'd before. Man thinks to mock God; indeed he may mock himſelf, and deceive himſelf, and that he does: true worſhip, is onely where the truth is: God is a Spirit, and he will be worſhip'd in ſpirit and truth: That's truth that is in the ſpirit, the ſpirit is truth: what we do in God is rightly done, prayer in God, reading in God, giving in God: he that come to the light, he comes to it becauſe his works are wrought in God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 21. There is asking amiſs, and hearing amiſs: and let us take notice of this, if any among us onely look that this and the other thing be done, and never conſider how it is done, it is to no purpoſe what we do. Why doſt thou take my name into thy mouth, when thou hateſt to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:118351:92"/>
be reformed? ſays he: Taking Gods name in vain, is in ſwearing; tis alſo in praying; tis taken notice of in ſwearing, but not in praying: but it is in the one as well as the other. <hi>You ask amiſs:</hi> there be many amiſſes in Prayer, in asking many amiſſes: when we onely uſe gifts and parts, thats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, either our own or other mens: ſome uſe other mens, this is amiſs: again, when we do not ask in Faith: but we will look to that in the Text: <hi>You ask amiſs:</hi> what's that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs? That you might conſume it upon your Luſts. And here take notice of two things, the firſt is this, That not asking, and asking amiſs, have the ſame ſucceſs. As good do nothing, as not do it well, or as it ſhould be; You ask not, and therefore ye have not; you ask amiſs, and therefore have it not; as good not ask, as ask amiſs. Another thing is this, That the main amiſneſs in Prayer, is, when our Luſts are regarded, when we ask to gratifie our Luſts.</p>
               <p>This is a thing of ſpecial conſideration, and will come neer to every one of us: 'tis a great abuſe of God to go to him, and deſire this or that of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to conſume it upon our Luſts: what is our Luſt? it is an enemy to him, it is a ſtrange God, it is an Idol, it is another Lover: we go to God, and would have more love, that he would thus and thus furniſh us to commit Adultery, that the Lord would give us to ſerve his enemies: we go to God to ſerve us in the creature, we have a burning Luſt after this, after the other, he muſt ſatisfie us: that's to ſerve his enemies, that's to maintain us in oppoſing him, in ſcorning him: and mark where God is ſet when I ſue to him for ſuch a thing, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my Luſt: where is God put? under my Luſt, and he is made uſe of to ſerve my Luſts: if my luſt be ſerved, I care not a ruſh for him; I would never ſeek him, but for my luſts; I want this and the other thing, therefore I pray, I do not want him, I care not at all for him: God makes
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:118351:92"/>
his very enemies ſtoop to him, and acknowledge him: Luſt and the devil can do nothing, unleſs he give to them: you ask for your devil and luſt: you ask of God that you may play the whore; you Adulterers and Adultereſſes, ſays <hi>Iames,</hi> a ſtrange word! and yet in ſuch praying we think we have perform'd excellent worſhip and ſervice to God, when we do put God in the very place of the verieſt drudge and ſcullion: there is not a worſer place we can put him in, then to ſeek of him to ſerve our Luſts. This is a drudging to his enemies, 'tis a main amiſs in Prayer: and ſo he reckons it, and therefore he ſays, <hi>Ye did not cry to me, when ye howled on your beds for corn and wine and oyl.</hi> To ask to ſatisfie your Luſts, is to go to the devil: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we are to conſider what we do, ſo we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how we do it: and as in every thing elſe, ſo in Prayer: and as we are to look into many amiſſes and miſcarriages, and faults there, ſo eſpecially to this; this is a main one, to ask to conſume upon our Luſts; why it may be you will ſay, we do not know for what end to ask elſe; why it is good to be ingenuous, it may be you do not: but I hope better things of you: but I know a carnal heart can have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, a carnal heart cannot ſeek God: and this is the right asking, this is the asking is not amiſs, when we ask God, give me thy ſelf, and when in asking for other things we ſubmit to God, as the Apoſtle hath it here: Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to God, put all into his hands, let him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, be you ſatisfied with his love: do you deſire that he would ſhew himſelf; ſhew us the Father, and it ſufficeth; and for other things, commend them to him with ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he pleaſes; he knows what's good, what's conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: <hi>Father,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>if it be poſsible, let this cup paſs from me, but thy will be done:</hi> this is the right asking, to ask God, let God be the boon you ask, <hi>Labour not for the meat
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:118351:93"/>
which periſheth, but labour for that bread which endureth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life, Joh.</hi> 6. 26. What's the bread endures to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life? It is God manifeſting himſelf; communion with God; ſeek this, ask this, and all things will come in with this; <hi>Seek the Kingdom of God, and other things ſhall be added unto you:</hi> put your ſelves into Gods hand and diſpoſe, he is all your exceeding great reward. You ask amiſs when you ask any thing but God: <hi>Let this cup paſs away,</hi> but <hi>if it be poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> but <hi>Father,</hi> ſays he, <hi>glorifie thy Name: Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and who is there on earth but thee?</hi> I have none to look at beſides thee; glorifie thy ſelf: this is right asking, and this is an asking that fleſh can never attain to, this is beyond fleſh and blood: who is there can beg this of God, but God himſelf? fleſh and blood hath not taught thee, but my Father, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter:</hi> If you ſeek any thing, and do not ſeek God, you make uſe of God to ſerve your Luſts, and you ſubject God to the devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there is as much ſetting up the devil, and vilifying God in that that's call'd Prayer, and worſhip, as in any thing whatſoever. You ask amiſs, becauſe you ask to conſume it upon your Luſts.</p>
               <p>And now it follows in the fourth verſe, what kinde of Luſts theſe are: what are theſe Luſts? they are luſtings after the creature, they are no worſe. <hi>You Adulterers and Adultereſſes, know ye not that the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the world is enmity unto God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The friendſhip of the world.</hi> We love the world, we run after the creature with violence, you muſt have it; cannot get it, pray for it; cannot get it, fight for it, kill for it. Here is Murder and Adultery in going forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> here reproves in the ſpirit, and he is bold, <hi>Ye Adulterers and Adultereſſes,</hi> and he takes in both Sexes, men and women, and he would let them know,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:118351:93"/>
he deals with them upon a known principle, <hi>do ye not know the friendſhip of the world is enmity to God?</hi> It is written in every one of your hearts, that to go out unto the creature, is to go from God; and if you do not know it, it ſhall be made appear to you that you do it. You do know it, and your Conſciences will tell you when its awakened: <hi>Know ye not that the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the world is enmity to God?</hi> And then he makes this concluſion, Whoſoever is a friend of the world, is an enemy to God. I'le point at two or three things. Obſerve here firſt, that according to the tenure of the Scripture, to embrace the world, to go out after the creature, is to commit Adultery; to go out in earneſt deſire after the creature, to make the creature a chief or a main thing that our hearts go out after, is Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. <hi>Ye Adulterers and Adultereſſes:</hi> I had not known ſin, ſays the Apoſtle, unleſs the Law had ſaid thou ſhalt not Luſt: <hi>Whoſoever looks upon a woman to luſt after her,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>he hath committed Adultery in his heart:</hi> whoſoever looks after any creature to luſt after it, he hath committed Adultery too: our Miniſters it may be do not teach ſo: but we ſee what the Scripture holds forth: <hi>you have heard how it hath been ſaid of old,</hi> ſayes Chriſt; <hi>but I ſay unto you;</hi> we count it not evil after mans reckoning, but it is accounted ſo with God: 'tis heart-Adultery to go out after any creature: to go out after any creature but in God, is Adultery; and if this be Adultery, every one, if we ſhould look into our own hearts, will be careful, and afraid to throw ſtones at an Adultereſs; you know the ſtory in the Goſpel; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he be that fears God, he hates and deteſts all evil, yet he ſees it in his heart: and though he be free
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:118351:94"/>
from groſs acts, yet he will be far from inſulting over any that are left to defile themſelves with groſs acts. The deſire of any creature, it is Adultery. Fleſh can do nothing but commit Adultery. All Fleſh hath corrupted their way; but it doth not break out alike, but all are alike in the root; to make out after any creature is Adultery. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>The friendſhip of the world is enmity unto God. Know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity to God? and he that is a friend to the world, is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God:</hi> This is that other Scriptures hold forth, The love of mony is the root of all evil: <hi>Love not the world nor the things thereof; whoſoever loves the world, the love of God is not in him, 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 15. They are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, that mind earthly things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. about the end; <hi>enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt:</hi> what is the buſineſs of the Croſs of Chriſt? to crucifie us to the world, and the world to us: you admire outward things, and love out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, you have friendſhip with them, you are enemies to the croſs of Chriſt; and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly luſts are joyned together, <hi>Tit. 2. The grace of God that brings ſalvation unto all men, hath appeared, teaching us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> &amp;c. We cannot ſerve God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: <hi>friendſhip of the world is enmity to God:</hi> and therefore let every one conſider what his heart moſt ayms at: and what his Prudence, and Wiſdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Providence is: what that is that the world does ſo admire and extol: Is it friendſhip with the world or no? So long as thou doſt well to thy ſelf, men will ſpeak well of thee: but thou doſt well: to thy
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:118351:94"/>
ſelf indeed, when thou ſeekeſt after the Lord, thirſteſt after him, and luſteſt after him, and deſireſt him; and in all deſires in which thou art carryed out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any thing but him, thou expreſſeſt enmity to him, thou loveſt not him. There is no going from God but to the creature: thou art the creatures, if thou have left God: he that is a friend to the world, is an enemy unto God. What is friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the world? when that we ſeek the creature for it ſelf, we are in love with it; we do not ſeek God, but ſeek it, when we put our reſt in it, cannot be without it, muſt have it, put it in Gods place; we muſt have ſuch a thing, and the other thing, we cannot be without it; A piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to live in enmity to God. O when God comes forth, how ſhall we be devoured and deſtroyed before him? But there are that will be friends with God and the world too: let them look to it how they make it out; <hi>the friendſhip of the world is enmity to God.</hi> And now the Apoſtle is ſhewing here how the Scripture diſcovers this ſame evil that is in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Do you think the Scripture ſaies in vain, The ſpirit that dwelleth in us luſteth to envy.</hi> Does the Scripture ſay in vain? the Scripture ſays nothing in vain: but the Scripture ſpeaks much in vain to us, while that we do not mark it, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it. We all ſpeak for the Scripture, how the Scripture is of God, the Scripture is Truth, and the Word of Truth: we ſpeak well of it, but the Scripture doth not ſpeak well of you: It ſays, <hi>The ſpirit that is in you luſts to envy.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:118351:95"/>
but evil in our hearts. We ſhall never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Scripture, till that we underſtand it in our own hearts. <hi>Do you think that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays in vain, The ſpirit in you luſteth to envy.</hi> Where does the Scripture ſay this? It ſays, <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought of mans heart is onely evil, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually:</hi> The Scripture; it tells you the evil is in your hearts: and there is no good in your fleſh; and let it not be in vain the Scripture tells you: if it be in vain now, and you do not entertain it, and hear, God will come, and you will finde it ſo. How many carry the Scripture a witneſs and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt them? Does the Scripture ſay in vain there is evil in you: and the ſpirit in you luſts to envy? The devill is in your hearts, and he reigns there.</p>
               <p>Does the Scripture ſay this in vain? You will not hear it now to heed it, and believe it; you ſhall feel it one day, that the Scripture does not ſpeak in vain. The greateſt contenders for the Scripture, and the Authority thereof, are the greateſt deſpiſers of the Scriptures, for they make the Scriptures ſpeak as <hi>Ahab</hi> would make <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiah</hi> ſpeak well of him: ſpeak nothing but good, and will not obſerve that the Scripture ſpeaks in diſcovery of our evil: but this is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Scripture, to catch here and there a piece to ſerve our turn, and abuſe them, and wreſt them as the devil did; ſo the devil in us does; <hi>Do you think the Scripture ſaies in vain, The ſpirit that dwelleth in us luſteth to envy.</hi> But the Scriptue tells
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:118351:95"/>
us not ſo: I but the Spirit of God tells us in the Scripture. In the Scripture there is a cleer diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of evil in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>But he gives more grace.</hi> To finiſh in a word: What is the meaning of that? Why I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is to prevent an Objection which might ariſe from the foregoing words. For if the ſpirit that be in us luſt to envy, and if that be to ſerve the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and that is all in our wars, contendings and fightings, what ſhall we do? it is in vain to ſpeak; Nay, for <hi>he gives more grace.</hi> There is more grace then there is ſin. And where ſin hath aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Grace ſhall abound much more: there is one greater in you, then he that is in the world; <hi>He gives more grace.</hi> Why, God he comes forth in his people, and he makes them able to deny themſelves, and this wicked one that luſts to envy. <hi>He gives more grace.</hi> Wherefore he ſays, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is Pride ſeen in contention and war; and when we ſubmit to God and depend upon him, we are well. <hi>Submit your ſelves therefore to God. He gives more grace to the humble.</hi> And he gives thee grace to be humble. If any man be humble, it is his Grace: and what is that Humility and Grace? <hi>Submit your ſelves to God,</hi> be at his diſpoſe, let him meaſure out that he knows convenient for you, and do not you luſt after this thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but let God come out to you: <hi>Feed me with food convenient;</hi> give me that is good for
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:118351:96"/>
me; do thou diſpoſe of me: Seek nothing but God, <hi>Submit your ſelves to him. And reſiſt the devil:</hi> The devil is in Luſt; we look for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil without us, and look for Chriſt without us; whoſoever hath Chriſt, he hath him within; and the devil is within: he is the God of this world, he is ſerved in the luſts of the world; he is the enemy of God; and you cannot be a friend to the world, and not an enemy to God; therefore <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the devil,</hi> ſet againſt theſe Luſts. How ſhall we ſet againſt them? <hi>He gives more Grace.</hi> It is the natural bent of my ſpirit to go another courſe, The ſpirit in me luſts this way. <hi>He gives more grace.</hi> God is ſtronger then the Devil. Wait on him, and ſubmit to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he will flee from you.</hi> You have fled from him it may be: He ſhall flee from you. When we know Grace, and know God, we ſhall make the Devil flie. That which we call flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Devil, is for the moſt part flying from God, and flying from Grace; we know Grace is to reſiſt the Devill. <hi>And he will flee from you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>And draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>You ask and you have not, becauſe you ask amiſs,</hi> to conſume on your Luſts.

                     <p>Come my People, enter thou into thy Chambers, and ſhut thy doors about thee; hide thy ſelf as it were for a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, untill the indignation be overpaſt.</p>
                     <p>For behold the Lord cometh out of his place, to puniſh the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth alſo ſhall diſcloſe her blood, and ſhall no more cover her ſlain.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Verſes before the Text, the People of God are complaining how they have in ſad diſtreſs waited upon God for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and been as a woman with child, and have brought forth nothing but wind, in the 17 and 18 Verſes: they have a word of comfort in the 19 Verſe, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live: awake and ſing ye that dwel in the duſt.</hi> The queſtion then that the Saints may put, is, When ſhall this be? What ſhall we do in the mean time? Here is an anſwer to this in the words read; <hi>Come my people, enter thou into thy Chambers:</hi> here is a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118351:98"/>
hiding place for you in them: <hi>Enter thou into thy Chambers, and ſhut thy doors about thee, and hide thy ſelf as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpaſt. For behold the Lord cometh out of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth alſo ſhall diſcloſe her blood, and ſhall no more cover her ſlain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how the words lie. I ſhall endeavour to preſent you with the ſubſtance of theſe words in ſundry particulars which I ſhall offer to you.</p>
               <q>

               <p>The firſt thing that offers it ſelf to us, is, That God hath a People, a peculiar People, as it is in <hi>Titus</hi> 2. A Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are born of him. All are his People; but there is a peculiar People that are born of him, that partake of his Divine nature, as <hi>Peter</hi> hath it. A People which were not a People; that is, not manifeſted a People: There is the ſeed of God lyeth in fleſh, and in fleſh here rules Satan, and here the ſeed lyeth dead a long time: <hi>You hath he quickned</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> Epheſ. 2. And that is converſion, the quickning of a dead ſeed that lies in fleſh, that lies in the world: and ſo, you are a People that were no People; but you are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, in whom nothing was to be ſeen of God; but yet there was a ſeed in you: <hi>You are a people to ſhew forth his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and his praiſes:</hi> as it is in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. This is that God doth in his People, he makes this uſe of them, he appears in them, to ſhew forth his Vertues and his Praiſes; they are the Throne of his glory, and here will he come forth in all his excellencies: Bleſſed is this People. The world is divided into two ſorts, the ſeed of the Serpent, and the ſeed of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118351:98"/>
                  <hi>Come my people, enter into thy Chambers, ſhut thy doors about thee, hide thy ſelf as it were for a little moment, until the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation be overpaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God hath a People that are born of him, dear to him, and yet this People are under indignation; <hi>till the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be overpaſt.</hi> They feel wrath, they feel anger, they feel indignation; their complaints of it are full in the Regiſter of the Scripture. <hi>All thy waves and ſtorms are gone over me. Gods fire is in Zion, and his furnace is in Jeruſalem. Iudgement begins at the houſe of God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) And it is no wonder, when we look into the grounds of it: when that this People of God is a ſeed of his, that lyeth a long time dead and buried in fleſh and world, here is that that oppoſes God; now when this ſame ſeed is quickned, this wrath and indignation it is upon fleſh, this corruption in which it lyeth, in which it is impriſoned; this wrath and indignation, it is the deliverer and ſetter free of that that is of God, that ſame holy one. But the wrath is not upon that that is born of God. <hi>He that is born of God ſins not,</hi> and there is no wrath upon him; but his preſent ſtate being in fleſh, where there is oppoſition unto God, here is wrath; <hi>The manifeſtation of God is fire:</hi> the manifeſtation of God, it is fire to all that doth oppoſe it: <hi>Furie is not in me</hi> (ſaith God) in the next Chapter to the Text, Chap. 27. 4. <hi>Furie is not in me:</hi> Fury is not in God, there is nothing but Reſt, and Peace, and quiet in God: What is this Fury, and this Wrath and Indignation then, that is ſo complained of; thy Fury, and thy Wrath, and thy Indignation? It is nothing but the manifeſtation of God upon fleſh. <hi>Our God is a conſuming fire,</hi> and here are Bryars and Thorns ſet againſt him in battle; as it is in that Verſe, <hi>Fury is not in me; who would ſet the Bryars and Thorns againſt me in battle? I would go through them, and burn them together.</hi> The mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118351:99"/>
of God is wrath and indignation, ſo long as there is any thing to oppoſe it; and this is that the Saints ſhall rejoyce in, when they come to know and underſtand themſelves, that our God is a conſuming fire, and by this wrath, and this indignation are we ſaved. <hi>We ſhall be ſaved</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but ſo as by fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this, it cannot but be ſome eaſe and refreſhment unto thoſe that have their preſent ſtate in wrath, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; they have their hearts making out to God, and they cannot think of him but they are troubled. <hi>I thought of God and was troubled.</hi> Saints have their purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, their droſs is burnt off here in this fire; and when that is burnt, the Bryars and Thorns when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, no more indignation. <hi>Hide thy ſelf till the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be overpaſt.</hi> So God hath a People of his Love, and this People they feel indignation and wrath: <hi>Whom he loves he chaſtens, and he corrects every Son whom he receives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, take notice here, how that God doth expreſs himſelf moſt kindly and lovingly unto his People in the times of their ſufferings; Times of indignation and wrath, they uſher in the ſweeteſt diſcoveries of love and grace. <hi>Come my People:</hi> What a ſweet entertainment is here? <hi>Come my people, enter into thy Chambers, enter into thy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:</hi> My beloved is one, and all the People of God are one, they have one life; <hi>Come my people, enter into thy Chambers:</hi> Indignation and wrath to ſouls that love God and thirſt after him, they do uſher in the ſweeteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſon?</hi> ſaith God in Jer. 31. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſon?</hi> In what a condition was <hi>Ephraim</hi> when the Lord ſpeaks this? he was in deep affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Jer. 31. 18. <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf, Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock unaccuſtomed to the yoke: turn me and I ſhall be turned:</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118351:99"/>
Then in ver. 20. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſon? is he a pleaſant child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill, therefore my bowels are troubled for him.</hi> The Church here is complaining, we have been with child, and in pain, and have brought forth nothing but wind; why come my people (ſaith God) lift up the weak hands and the feeble knees. Ile take her into the wilderneſs, and there Ile ſpeak to her heart: The Apoſtle he ſpeaks of his afflictions, as the ſeaſon of his conſolations, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. Come my people:</hi> This ſhould ſomewhat reconcile us unto afflictions, to wait till meat comes out of the eater. It ſhould ſettle our hearts while we hear thunder, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and fire, and feel earthquakes; there will a ſtill voyce come at laſt: after a while that you have ſuffered, comfort will come in; you ſhall find a Chamber and a Bed: <hi>Come my people, enter into thy Chamber.</hi> A Chamber and a Bed, and a Knee and a Boſom. God doth all in love; even afflictions they are in love; and this love it ſhall be manifeſted, it ſhall break out and be diſcovered the more ſweetly, the longer it is hid. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> will take off his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, and cry, <hi>I am Ioſeph your brother.</hi> God who was looked upon as an enemy, will come forth with this, <hi>Come my people, enter into thy Chambers.</hi> That's a 3. particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enter thou into thy Chambers.</hi> The People of God, they have a retiring place, a reſting place, a hiding place in trouble and affliction. A Chamber, it is a retiring place, a reſting place, a hiding place. And what is this ſame Chamber of the People of God, but God? <hi>Return to thy reſt O my ſoul, for God hath been good unto thee:</hi> 'tis the 116 Pſal. ver. 11. <hi>The Lord hath been good unto thee:</hi> This is the Chamber. Elſwhere God is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Rock, a Caſtle, <hi>Thou haſt been the dwelling place of thy people from one generation to another:</hi> as it is in the Pſalms.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118351:100"/>
                  <hi>Thou wilt keep them in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtaid on thee;</hi> as it is in ver. 3. of this Chapter. The People of God have a Refuge, a Reſt, a Shelter in all troubles: Trouble and diſtreſs is the portion of the wicked; but the Saints have a retiring place, and afterwards deliverance: this is that that the world cannot find. God is the retiring and hiding place of his People; and he cannot forſake his People, he cannot but tend them; in their greateſt ſufferings he will ſee they ſhall ſuffer no more then they are able to bear, and he will give them a good iſſue.</p>
               <p>Let us ask our ſouls whether we know trouble, and whether we know reſt in trouble, and whether we know this reſt a better reſt then this world. And this anſwers that objection the world makes againſt the Saints waiting upon God. We call the proud happy (ſay they) and they that tempt God are delivered: here is nothing but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affliction. No? nothing elſe? Surely here is reſt too. Here is reſt in trouble, and then there is deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hide thy ſelf for a little moment, untill the indignation be overpaſt: enter into thy Chambers, and ſhut thy doors about thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is this alſo to be obſerved: How that in time of eaſe and reſt in the fleſh, in the world, the People of God are very apt to be ſtragling abroad, to be running out into the luſts of the world and fleſh, running out of their reſt: And when we run into the world, and into the fleſh, and into theſe luſts, we go out of our reſt, out of our peace. This is implyed here; when there is a call to come in, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation is abroad, come in, enter into thy Chamber. It is going out from God that brings us into trouble; now return, come in again. When there is peace and quiet in the fleſh, the fleſh it is carryed forth, there are baits and temptations, it ſees its Lovers, and it makes after them, then God ſets up a hedge of Thorns, as it is in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 8.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118351:100"/>
                  <hi>I will hedge up thy way with thorns, ſhe ſhall not find her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will return to my firſt husband, for then it was better with me then now.</hi> And this is that God cals to here, <hi>Come my people, enter into thy Chambers;</hi> thou haſt lain abroad, and been at forrage in the world, where thou haſt left thy life behind thee, now ſeek it here: <hi>Enter into thy Chambers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Chambers which are the reſt of the Saints, are a priſon unto the fleſh; and a Saint being fleſh as well as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the ſpirit is aſleep ſometimes, and the fleſh is awake and alive, and that goes after its Lovers; and then trouble comes, and diſtreſs comes, and there is no getting out but by making in again; making in unto God. <hi>Enter into thy Chambers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, ſee here is Gods call, <hi>Come my people, enter in:</hi> And there is no coming into the reſt of God, but for thoſe whom the Lord cals: and when he cals too, it is not when we will, tis not when man will, tis not when the Miniſter will, but it is when the Spirit will; <hi>Come my people:</hi> The voyce of God in our hearts, is that that gives his beloved reſt. <hi>So he gives his beloved reſt:</hi> How? He cals by his Spirit, <hi>Come my people, enter into thy Chambers.</hi> There is indignation everywhere but in God. <hi>Furie is not in me</hi> (ſaith God) And God manifeſted, this indignation will appear and be felt. There is no reſt but in the Lord; and there is no entertainment in the Lord, but to thoſe whom he cals in; to whom he opens the gate, the everlaſting ganes: <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into the Hill of the Lord? And who ſhall ſtand in his holy place?</hi> Who ſhall lie down in that Chamber? And who ſhall meet with that repoſe that is in him? He whom he cals in by his Spirit. It was death to enter in before <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> unleſs he held forth his golden Scepter: There is nothing but indignation from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118351:101"/>
of God upon every ſoul, but that ſoul that is called in by God. <hi>Come my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a People that look to enter into reſt, and the Goſpel is preached to them, and reſt is preached unto them; but the Apoſtle tels us in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. at the beginning, <hi>They entred not in becauſe of unbelief.</hi> What is this unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? God was not in their hearts, they had not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward call, there was not the life of God within them, nor the reſt of God within them; Gods voyce is not known without, unleſs he dwell within: <hi>They entred not in becauſe of unbelief.</hi> Chriſt is entertained nowhere, in no ſoul, where-ever he comes and knocks, he is received nowhere but where he himſelf dwels, and opens the door. It is the voyce of God in our Spirits, the Spirit ſaying to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Ye are the children of God, the People of God, God is your reſt. Come, enter in, ſit ye down.</p>
               <p>There are dreams of Reſt, and when we awake there is nothing but trouble: There are that cry Lord, Lord; and when he comes, he ſaith, <hi>I know you not, depart from me ye workers of iniquity.</hi> We muſt look for a better call then a Letter call, or a Miniſters call: We muſt look for the call of God in our hearts, and a particular call: As they ſaid to the blind man, be of good comfort, he ſpeaks to thee, he calleth thee. Say to my ſoul (ſaith <hi>David) I am thy ſalvation.</hi> All your reſt is fancy, unleſs God hath led you into it: So far forth as you ſee him, you ſee truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Come my people.</hi> To call our ſelves the People of God, unleſs God cals us ſo, what a poor thing is this? To fancy our ſelves in the Chamber and Reſt of God, alas, how ſadly ſhall we awake!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Come my people, enter into thy Chambers, and ſhut thy doors about thee:</hi> ſhut thy ſelf in cloſe. When we are ſhut into God from the world, and are at home in the Lord, taken
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118351:101"/>
up in him, ſo far forth we are ſafe; there is no trouble, no indignation, no fury, <hi>Fury is not in me.</hi> We ſtand in God, and have our enjoyments in him, are only taken up with him: but while we ſtand there, and are gazing upon the world, our eyes and hearts are drawn forth after this, and after the other, then comes trouble. We do not ſee enough in God; if we did, he would be a covering to our eyes, and a husband to us indeed; as he ſaid, <hi>He ſhall be a covering to thine eyes.</hi> When we look after any thing but him, we look after trouble; wrath will come in; therefore ſhut the doors upon you: <hi>Enter into thy Chambers, and ſhut the doors upon thee, and hide thy ſelf.</hi> God is our reſt from trouble, God is our peace, God is our life; do but look from him, you look into death, you look into trouble. You that dwel in God, ſhut up your ſelves in him, ſhut the doors upon you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And hide thy ſelf.</hi> Hide thy ſelf; there is no hiding from God, but in God. Hide thy ſelf in Gods Reſt, in Gods Love, in Gods Power: this is a myſterie and riddle unto the world. Old <hi>Adam</hi> flies from God, the preſence of God is indignation. Old <hi>Adam</hi> is Bryars and Thorns ſet in battle againſt him, Gods appearance makes him run: <hi>But whither ſhall we go from thy preſence?</hi> There is no hiding from God, but in God. <hi>While I hid my ſins</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) my bones conſumed away, through my daily complaint; thy hand was heavie upon me.</hi> He had no reſt till he made back again unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enter into thy Chambers, and hide thy ſelf.</hi> Hide thy ſelf; and that is the Saints condition here in this world, to be hidden ones. <hi>The world doth not know us,</hi> ſaith <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. at the beginning; <hi>We are the ſons of God, but the world doth not know us. You are dead</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Col.</hi> 3. at the beginning) <hi>and your life is hid. Hide thy ſelf.</hi> Where
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118351:102"/>
are they hid? Why they are hid in God. <hi>Our life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> That that appears now is the world, and Satan, and Death, and Hell. <hi>Hide thy ſelf for a moment.</hi> Hide thy ſelf, the Saints life is not ſeen nor known. God is the Saints life when he is hidden. And this is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that when we are hidden, he is hidden; and when he ſhall appear, we ſhall appear with him in glory, as it is in that ſame third of the <hi>Coloſsians. Hide thy ſelf.</hi> God will have us content to be hidden for a while: and truly this makes us content to be hidden, that he is hidden. He is our life; he comes not forth till we come forth; he is not in glory till we are in glory; he is dead while we are dead. <hi>Yet awhile, and the earth ſhall diſcover her dead, and ſhall no more hide her ſlain,</hi> as it follows in the Text. <hi>Hide thy ſelf.</hi> Saints are Gods hidden ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hide thy ſelf for a moment.</hi> All the ſadneſs and darkneſs of the Saints is but momentanie: Doſt thou love God? Doth thy ſoul make to him? And knoweſt thou no reſt but him? Thou art troubled, and troubled when thou thinkeſt of God; <hi>Hide thy ſelf for a moment.</hi> Here is repoſe for thee, and this indignation, this ſtorm will over. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is expreſſed for a little moment, in this Propheſie of Iſaiah, <hi>For a little moment have I hid my face from thee:</hi> It ſeems long to us, and we cry how long? It is but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in reſpect of Eternity.</p>
               <p>And this is another word of eaſe to an afflicted ſoul; the affliction is ſtrong, but it ſhall not laſt: <hi>Hide thy ſelf for a moment, until the indignation be overpaſt.</hi> It is a cloud that will blow over, this indignation will have an end, and then comes eternal Reſt, eternal Joy. And as the trouble of the Saints is but for a moment, ſo the joy of the world, it is no longer; and the moment of the Saints trouble, is the moment of the worlds rejoycing: and the indignation that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118351:102"/>
lyeth upon the Saints, ſhall be taken off from them, and fall upon the world: and that is it that is expreſſed in the next Verſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>VER. 21.</bibl> 
                  <p>For behold the Lord comes out of his place to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth alſo ſhall diſcloſe her blood, and ſhall no more cover her ſlain.</p>
               </q>
               <p>THoſe that dwell in the earth, that have their life in the world and fleſh, have all their reſt and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here in the creature; they have left the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and are turned to the creature, <hi>They have forſaken the fountain of living water, &amp;c. The Lord comes out of his place to puniſh them.</hi> The Lords coming out of his place, his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is deſtruction to all them that run a whoring from him.</p>
               <p>After indignation hath been upon the Saints, then it comes upon the world. <hi>Iudgement begins at the houſe of God.</hi> Wel, what ſhal the end of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be that obey not the Goſpel? <hi>The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comes in his place:</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) Behold the Lord comes out of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. Aſſyria, and Aegypt, and Babylon are the ſcourge of God upon his people:</hi> When his people are chaſtiſed, then he throws his rods into the fire. <hi>I will puniſh the ſtout heart of the King of Aſſyria:</hi> Iſa. 10. <hi>And it is a righteous thing with God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle 2 Theſ. 1.) <hi>to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you that are troubled reſt with us.</hi> It is the glory of God, after he hath lent his power to his enemies, to take it into his own hands, and to plague them, to bring them under his feet. While the world is rejoycing, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118351:103"/>
ſhall paſs from the people of God, upon the world.</p>
               <p>The world I count all earthly minded people, that have their joy in the creatures; <hi>The friendſhip of the world is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God.</hi> If their eyes were open, they would little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, conſidering what would be the end of this; the end of this mirth would be heavineſs. God comes forth, and all their Candles go out; no more the voyce of the Bridegroom in thee: every one that hath his life in the earth, and in the creature, is treaſuring up wrath to himſelf againſt the day of wrath; and ſo much Joy and Glory as they have had, ſo much ſorrow and torment ſhall ſeiſe upon them. <hi>The Lord is come out of his place to puniſh the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth for their iniquity:</hi> The Lord ſhall turn his hand upon the world after he hath purged his people.</p>
               <p>And this is alſo to be taken notice of here, That there is hope unto the people of God, that the bitter cup is paſſed from them, and the indignation is going off them, when God begins to take the world in hand, when indignation begins to ſeiſe upon them. <hi>Hide thy ſelf for a moment, till the indignation be overpaſt; for behold the Lord comes out of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth.</hi> It will not laſt long when God hath the world in hand; he is come out of his place to puniſh them, therefore lift up your heads.</p>
               <p>You that wait for God, and have your hope in him, lift up your weak hands, and your feeble knees; when God begins to afflict the world, he is drawing it off from his people; their yoke is breaking, when the worlds neck is going into it; when God begins with Aegypt, then Iſraels warfare is accompliſhed; when the rods are throwing into the fire, then the childrens chaſtiſement is at an end. And according unto this truth, the Saints have a pleaſant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect upon the world in all the trouble and diſtreſs of it. In Famines, Earthquakes, Peſtilences, Wars, in all the

confuſions and diſtreſſes thereof, then they that wait for God, that love him, and his appearance, are called upon to lift up their heads, for their redemption draweth nigh, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 28. And here is the ground of it in the Text, <hi>God is come forth to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.</hi> The indignation will ſoon be over, <hi>Hide thy ſelf for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> A moment, and all thy trouble will be at an end, all thy deaths will be dead: the worlds death is coming now, and deaths death is coming now. <hi>The Lord is come out of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Out of his place.</hi> That expreſſion cals for our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it hath a word before it, <hi>Behold the Lord cometh out of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth.</hi> And this is that is held forth to us here, That while the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth do live in jollity and proſperity, God is as it were withdrawn out of the earth, gone into his place. God is everywhere: and what is Gods place? He is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: but now he is pleaſed not to manifeſt himſelf here in the earth, in the world: It is a kind of withdrawing into a place, going into a hole, hiding himſelf, and as it were leaving things in mens hands to rule by Satan, leaving the earth and men to do their will, and their pleaſure. There is the ſame expreſſion in other Scriptures beſide this; Micah 1. 3. <hi>Behold the Lord comes out of his place, and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.</hi> The Lord is in a retiring place as it were: it is a Metaphorical ſpeech: he is everywhere, he doth not appear: that that we ſee is man, and here is the Devil in them, and luſt in them, and violence in them: a time of great jollity, great rejoycing, great proſperity to the inhabitants of the earth: What is this time? God is gone into his place, he hides himſelf, he is retired. He ſaith, <hi>I will go down and ſee if it be ſo in Sodom, according to the cry of it.</hi> He went down,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118351:104"/>
and by his appearance ſet <hi>Sodom</hi> on fire: he retires, is not ſeen, and the fool ſaith there is no God. The heart of worldly men ſaith, God ſees not, neither doth he regard. God is gone into his place, lets the Devil and ſin range eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywhere, and do what they will. There is that expreſſion in the Goſpel: <hi>The Kingdom of heaven is like a certain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, who went into a far Country to receive a Kingdom, and return:</hi> So God is as it were gone into a far Country to receive a Kingdom: and who hath the Kingdom now? Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath the Kingdom, man hath the Kingdom, and death hath the Kingdom, ſin hath the Kingdom; there is little to be ſeen in the world but theſe. The Spirit of God was abroad mightily in the Apoſtles time, after Chriſts Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then he was pleaſed to draw in again, that the man of ſin might come forth, and ſhew himſelf, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath it, 2 <hi>Theſ. 2. He that lets will let, till it be taken out of the way:</hi> That was that glorious manifeſtation of light and power in ſome of the people of God in thoſe times, and that did let, and the man of ſin could not come forth; but that ſhall be taken out of the way, and then he ſhould come forth; and this ſame taking out of the way, was as much as Gods going into his place. And ſo much doth that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hold forth of Gods being in heaven, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all the unrighteouſneſs of men, Rom.</hi> 1. 17. The wrath of God is as it were in its place now, kept up. The wrath of God is nothing elſe but the manifeſtation of God. God manifeſted to them that walk contrary to him, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation is wrath. God manifeſted to Bryars and Thorns ſet in battle againſt him, is conſuming fire. Now this wrath of God ſeems to be ſhut up in a ſecret place; it ſhall be revealed from heaven, it ſhall come forth out of its place: All the glory, rejoycing, and proſperity of earthly men.

Earthly minded men in the creature, you have your life in the earth, your joy in the creature, and your reſt here; you have this only while God is in his place, while he is withdrawn: but when he comes forth, indignation comes upon you, wrath comes upon you like <hi>Sorrow upon a woman in travail, and you ſhall not eſcape.</hi> Now you ſlight God, care not for him, ſay he ſees you not, ſay in you heart there is no God; he will be upon you on a ſudden: and when he doth appear, every knee ſhall bow to him, and his enemies ſhall be found lyars. And God doth appear purpoſely, that it might appear what man is: if the Majeſty of God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, no man would blaſpheme him, no man would ſlight him: but now he is in a kind of abſence and withdrawment, he is in his place: Now the world appears in riot, and the evill ſervant drinks with the drunkard, and beats his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants, and ſaith, <hi>My maſter will not yet come.</hi> When he comes forth, who ſhall ſtand before him? <hi>Who ſhall ſtand before devouring fire? Who ſhall ſtand before everlaſting burnings?</hi> All earthly-minded people, they will vaniſh away, they will come to nothing. Even as darkneſs ſtands by the abſence of light, and when light comes it is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo the darkneſs of this world, and the joy of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it hath its place while God is withdrawn: when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears and is manifeſted, when he takes off his Vail that is upon him, they conſume out of their dwelling. <hi>Let God ariſe, and his enemies ſhall be ſcattered. Set the Bryars and Thorns againſt me</hi> (ſaith God) who will do it? <hi>I will burn them together, I will go through them and burn them:</hi> and it is but going through them, and they are burnt, <hi>There is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from his preſence.</hi> Darkneſs, wickedneſs, ſin, cannot ſtand but in Gods withdrawing: and this is the reaſon of ſin and hels rage: God is gone into his place, when he comes forth again, theſe are like duſt before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:118351:105"/>There are that have their time only in Gods abſence: and who are theſe? They that live upon the world, they that are ſatisfying their luſts, they that have nothing but that which is ſeen, that put their truſt in it, have all their life in the creature: theſe have all their joy here in Gods ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and are juſt like the wild beaſts, as we have a deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of them in the Pſalms: <hi>Man goes forth unto his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour till the evening, and the evening comes, and the beaſts go abroad after their prey.</hi> And this is the time of mens ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their luſts, while God is in his place, while God is not manifeſted: <hi>My maſter defers his coming,</hi> ſaith the evil ſervant. And here is the reaſon of the dreadfulneſs of the mention of the day of Judgement unto an earthly heart, a carnal heart: O how terrible is it! The thought of Doomes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the Judgement day, the Throne ſet, the Books open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; The reaſon why this is ſo dreadfull, is, becauſe that then all their ſport is at an end, all their joy is done: they had it in the fleſh, but there ſhall no fleſh glory in his preſence. All the glory that is in fleſh, ſhall diſ-appear when the glory of God appears. The day of the Lord is darkneſs, and not light, unto all that live in the world. This is mans day: Mans day, which is Gods night: and Gods day is the worlds night. If you have your life in the earth, when God comes forth, there is an end of your life. The Saints are dead till the Lord comes forth: this is the reaſon why they wait for this day. O that the Lord would come! They love his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, they long for his appearance, they wait for his Kingdom. Thus the Spirit of God in Scripture doth deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher out Saints and Diſciples unto us, <hi>They waited for the Kingdom of God: They love and long for his appearance:</hi> As he appears, down goes ſin: his appearance ſets a flame unto ſin, even the ſin and luſt that is in us, and when that is burnt up, there is nothing but glory; nothing but glory that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.

                  <hi>He is come out of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth,</hi> that is, thoſe that have their life and reſt in the earth: They have this life, and reſt, and joy, only while God doth not appear; when he appears and comes forth, nothing but blackneſs and darkneſs, nothing but deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from his preſence: as it is in 2 Theſ. 1. <hi>Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and the glory of his power, when he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and admired in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that believe.</hi> Now he is diſhonoured and reproached; then he ſhall be glorified.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Lord is come out of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: The earth alſo ſhall diſcloſe her blood, and ſhall no more cover her ſlain.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>The earth alſo ſhall diſcloſe her blood, and ſhall no more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her ſlain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Lord is diſcovered, when he diſcovers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, there is a diſcovery of every thing, there ſhall be no longer hiding: <hi>The earth is diſcloſed:</hi> God is light, and there is an end of darkneſs when light comes forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The earth ſhall diſcloſe her blood, and ſhall no longer hide her ſlain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is this blood, and this ſlain which the earth hides and covers for the time, and which it ſhall diſcloſe? It is the Lords blood. Do we not read in Scripture of the Lords blood? <hi>Acts 20. The Church he hath redeemed by his own blood. The blood of the Lamb, the Lamb ſlain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two things to be obſerved here: Firſt this, That the Lord of life lyeth ſlain and buried in the earth: and this is his place ſpoken of before. When he comes out of his place, the earth diſcloſes her blood, and diſcovers her ſlain: The Lord lyeth ſlain and buried in the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:118351:106"/>Another thing is, That the Lord by his own power will riſe up, and diſcover, and manifeſt himſelf, and ſay, <hi>I am he that was dead, but am alive, and I live for evermore; and I have the keys of hell and death.</hi> The Lord lyeth ſlain and buried in the earth: the earth is the grave of the Lord: this Creation is the Lords Sepulchre, it is the Lords Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it hath this inſcription written upon it [<hi>Behold the place where the Lord lies</hi>] the Lord lyeth ſlain in the earth, and this is his place where he is hidden: he is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, but he is as it were dead and ſlain, <hi>Rev. 5. John ſaw the Lamb as it had been ſlain:</hi> he is as it were ſlain, but he lives all this while, and he raigns and rules, but there is nothing ſeen but the Kingdom of Men, of Devils, of Death, of Hell.</p>
               <p>The Lord he is ſlain: he comes forth at times, and makes appearances, and as he looks up, ſtill he is knockt down, and the world cries Devil and Blaſphemy: In all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances that hitherto he hath made, he hath been ſlain: the Devil hath poſſeſſed all the Mountains that ever he raiſed up: the ſeven Mountains the Whore ſits upon them. That the Apoſtle hath <hi>Heb. 6. They crucifie afreſh the ſon of God, and put him to open ſhame.</hi> God makes his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ſtill he is crucified, ſtill he is ſlain: whilſt he riſeth in fleſh, ſtill he is killed.</p>
               <p>If you ask who it is that kils him? His enemies kill him, ſin and hell: his friends kill him, therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do. Theſe are the wounds I have received in the houſe of my friends.</hi> He kils himſelf, he gives up his life: for that which <hi>Pilat</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> did, they did by the determinate Counſel of God. <hi>Awake O ſword againſt the ſhepherd that is my fellow. I lay down my life of my ſelf, and no man takes it from me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) he gives up himſelf. It is the blood of God in us that redeems
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118351:106"/>
this earth: <hi>Thou haſt redeemed us by thy blood.</hi> There is no man ſhall live, but he in whom God is dead: in whom he lyeth ſlain for a while, or as it were ſlain: and by this God comes forth in a more glorious Kingdom. His Kingdom is more glorious, when he comes out of death into it; comes upon Death, comes upon Hell, and all the powers of it.</p>
               <p>God is pleaſed to make himſelf enemies, that he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be above them. God is ſlain, his blood is ſhed in Chriſt, and Chriſt in the Saints, he ſuffers ſtill. <hi>I fill up the ſufferings of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: Here he dies, and here he riſes.</p>
               <p>And this, it may give us ſome light and inſtruction touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin: in the knowledge whereof we are exceeding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective. <hi>All have ſinned:</hi> that the Apoſtle ſaith; and ſinned the utmoſt of ſin, <hi>Slain and murdered the Lord of life.</hi> And think of it what you will, you never ſee ſin in a true light, till you ſee your ſelves murtherers and betrayers of the Lord of glory; the Spirit convincing of ſin, it convinceth of this: and this is that that earthly-mindedneſs doth; the earth in us, this love of the earth, this love of the creature, it kils the Lord, and buries the Lord, it keeps down the Lord. <hi>Do you not know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iames) that the friendſhip of the world is enmity unto God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you that know God, and love God, mind what you do whilſt you go out after the earth: Here is killing the Lord, and burying him, keeping him down: Either we are crucifying God, or elſe we are crucifying the world, and the world is crucified unto us, one of theſe two. We are crucifying God, while we do not look and long for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: all living in the earth, being at home in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is crucifying the Lord. The Devil is the god of this world, he is a murderer: and ſo are all thoſe that ſerve this world, murtherers and betrayers of the Lord of life. The
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118351:107"/>
earth buries him, the earth covers him, the Princes of this world crucifie the Lord of glory.</p>
               <p>You that profeſs to know the Lord of glory, ſee what you do whilſt you are climbing up in the world, making after the greatneſs and the glory thereof: the earth hides his blood, and covers him, here he is buried: worldly luſts, fleſhly luſts, theſe kill and flay, and bury God in you, keep down Chriſt in you.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon why the world makes ſo little account of God, and makes no more of God then a fancy; they have ſlain him, and they have buried him, and they raign: but he will riſe, and then wo to the inhabitants of the earth. The Devil is come among you, and then you ſhall ſee the Devil: the Devil is among you, but you do not ſee him, then you ſhall be delivered up to him.</p>
               <p>It is a comfort to them that they cannot ſee God, that their ſouls long after him, and they love him, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee him. Why? He is not diſcovered: where he is, he lyeth dead a great while: He lyeth dead in the hearts and ſouls of his People.</p>
               <p>And it ſhould make us beware of paſſing judgement upon any, That they are not the Lords, and the Lord is not in them, becauſe he is not at preſent manifeſted: he lyeth dead, there is his blood, and it may quicken, though it be now as dead.</p>
               <p>And it ſhould make us very wary of judging any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, thoſe that walk in the greateſt oppoſition unto God; God may lie dead in them, and when he riſes in them, that ſhall ſuffer for him that did before perſecute him: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he be that lives, he hath ſeen God dead in him, and now he is raiſed. This is indeed the converſion of a ſinner, it is the quickening of Chriſt in the heart.</p>
               <p>He is dead in the earth, here is his blood, and he will
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118351:107"/>
riſe up, the earth ſhall diſcover her blood, ſhall no longer hide her ſlain: he will come out of his place, he hath come forth in many appearances, and hath been killed again: but he will come forth in his own body, and he will ſtand in the earth: and riſing from the dead, he dies no more, death hath no more dominion over him: and he coming out of the grave, will bring forth all his with him: of which we had a type in the coming of the people of God out of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and out of Babylon: they brought forth all the riches out of Aegypt, returned with all the veſſels out of Babylon: When God brings us forth out of death and hell, he will bring us forth with all the goods, and all the riches that death and hell have robbed us of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The earth ſhall no longer cover his blood.</hi> And it cannot be, it is impoſſible he ſhould ſee corruption: it is his blood, and therefore muſt recover: it is the Lamb, but as it were ſlain: he rules ſtill, he rules amidſt his enemies: he rules in death, in hell, but is covered, is not ſeen. <hi>He ſhall live, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall live with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And look we into our hearts, what we find of the death of Chriſt, of the reſurrection of Chriſt, of fellowſhip with him in his ſufferings, and the power of his reſurrection. This is that <hi>Pauls</hi> heart did beat upon, Phil. 3. 10. <hi>We know him, and the power of his death, and fellowſhip of his ſufferings.</hi> Look what we know of him, and look for his revealing in us. <hi>When it pleaſed God to reveal his Son in me. Know ye not that Chriſt is in you? Prove your ſelves, whether you be in the faith.</hi> Chriſt in you: Chriſt in you dead, Chriſt in you alive. He is alive that was dead, then you live. <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo:</hi> Look if ye know this life. You are in him that is true, and he in you that is true: he is riſen, and you riſen with him, aſcended with him, and ſet down with him in heavenly places.</p>

                     <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation.</hi> There is Grace, and there is Salvation the Scripture ſpeaks of, but grace is not <hi>all,</hi> nor ſalvation is not <hi>all.</hi> Salvation will not ſatisfie him that hath the God of grace, but he muſt have <hi>glory</hi> as well as ſalvation: it will not ſatisfie an heir of heaven to be <hi>ſafe</hi> only, but he muſt have a <hi>Kingdom: It is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you a Kingdom.</hi> We muſt take the Scriptures in their <hi>extent:</hi> There is one place ſpeaks only of <hi>grace,</hi> there is another tels us of God: One place ſpeaks only of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> another tels us of <hi>glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God will give grace and glory.</hi> Each ſingle Scripture doth not expreſs the whole mind of God.

                  <p>
                     <hi>The grace of God that brings ſalvation. God</hi> in <hi>grace</hi> brings <hi>ſalvation,</hi> and <hi>is</hi> ſalvation: and there is no ſalvation but where the God of grace is come: Gods appearing in his love, owning us, and manifeſting himſelf to be our porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this is ſalvation. <hi>In his favour is life: Whoſoever doth not believe, the wrath of God abides upon him:</hi> His anger and abſence is death and deſtruction: every man is under deſtruction and death till the grace of God come to him, till that appear.</p>
                  <p>If you look for ſalvation, where is the grace of God, or the God of grace appearing? The grace of God is ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſalvation is the grace of God, or the God of grace. <hi>The grace of God that brings ſalvation.</hi> There is grace that doth not bring ſalvation: there is the grace of God in theſe <hi>outward</hi> things, there is the grace of God in <hi>gifts,</hi> this grace bids us <hi>look after</hi> ſalvation, this grace <hi>leads unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi>

but here is the grace of God that brings ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that is ſalvation it ſelf. Here is God in grace come to us, here is the grace that turns the heart from the world, and ſin, and hell: This is ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The grace of God that brings ſalvation.</hi> There is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by <hi>Works,</hi> there is no ſalvation by the <hi>Law;</hi> ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is by the grace of God: by that grace that <hi>makes us to do</hi> the works of God, by <hi>Gods working in us,</hi> by Gods taking us into <hi>himſelf:</hi> All our works are <hi>wrought in God:</hi> It is the Scripture expreſſion.</p>

                  <p>He appears <hi>now</hi> to ſalvation, but now he appears <hi>in ſin</hi> and <hi>weakneſs;</hi> and this is not appearing in reſpect of that which <hi>ſhall</hi> be; the glory is no glory in reſpect of that which is coming, that is at the dore. God brings forth himſelf out of the dark; he hath put himſelf into the dark, and he comes up by degrees; he lyeth under vails and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings, and hides his face. There is everlaſting mercies, but they are hidden: <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> and God reveals this by degrees: There is grace not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and ſalvation not appearing where <hi>it is.</hi> And there is <hi>wrath</hi> and deſtruction <hi>not appearing</hi> alſo where <hi>it is;</hi> they will both come forth: And till theſe do come forth, it is very irrational for any to judge that that which now doth <hi>not appear,</hi> is not there, and will never appear. It is the comfort of them that wait for grace, and cannot ſee it.

                  <p>There is nothing to be done for our ſalvation and glory, but the <hi>bringing it forth,</hi> the making it to appear.

                     <hi>Grace hath appeared, teaching us.</hi> 'Tis a bleſſed thing to know the teaching of <hi>grace:</hi> There is the <hi>Laws</hi> teaching, and <hi>Graces</hi> teaching; there is a <hi>Letter</hi> teaching, and the <hi>Spirits</hi> teaching. In the firſt teaching we are <hi>ever learning, but never able to come to the Knowledge of the truth,</hi> but are ſtill <hi>led about with luſts:</hi> Here is onely a profeſſion, and nothing but a <hi>form:</hi> but there is the teaching of grace, which is the <hi>writing the Law in our minds,</hi> and <hi>putting them in our hearts.</hi> Here is the Covenant of grace, the Law of grace, when we are <hi>delivered up into the Doctrine,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. the form of Doctrine <hi>into which you were delivered,</hi> as 'tis in the <hi>Margent.</hi> We are delivered up into the Doctrine; we are formed, and faſhioned, and moulded into it.</p>
                  <p>There is an appearance of God in Majeſtie in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that makes <hi>ſervants,</hi> and ſlaves, and bondmen; that ſaith, <hi>Do or you dye;</hi> Do or you are <hi>curſed.</hi> And there is an appearance of God from Mount <hi>Sion</hi> in <hi>love</hi> and <hi>grace:</hi> The God of grace, or the grace of God hath appeared; and he teacheth us his ways, and he makes us <hi>ſons,</hi> and he brings forth his <hi>own nature</hi> in us: 'Tis our <hi>life,</hi> our <hi>meat and drink</hi> to do his will, and finiſh his work. The everlaſting Covenant in blood comes forth, and makes us perfect to do his will. Here is the <hi>Law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> that <hi>frees us from the Law of ſin and death.</hi> 'Tis a ſad
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118351:112"/>
thing to be only under a <hi>Letter</hi> and under a <hi>Voice:</hi> to have nothing but a Letter, and a Hearſay: Nothing but a voice and direction without, here is nothing but enmity within. But <hi>the word is nigh thee in thy heart,</hi> when we come to this teaching, this <hi>inward</hi> teaching, this Law of the Spirit; All other teaching without this inward teaching, doth but put us into a <hi>Dream,</hi> into <hi>Fancies;</hi> and we think and ſeem that we eat and drink, but when we awake we ſhall find our ſouls hungry and thirſty. But this grace of God that teaches effectually, delivers us up into the Doctrine, moulds us into the form of that which is taught. The God of grace appearing to us, we are turned <hi>into his Image from glory to glory by his Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. latter end. Let's all look after this teaching, this inward teaching; <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God.</hi> Let us look after the teaching of Chriſt who <hi>ſpake with authority, and not as the Scribes.</hi> Let us look for power and life, and light from God; And let's deal with man for nothing elſe but that we may hear God by him, and ſee God in him, and be able to ſay <hi>God is in you of a truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The grace of God which brings Salvation hath appeared, teaching us; grace and favor it is exceeding winning. God doth overcome all our evil by good; Love is mightily conſtraining. <hi>She had much forgiven her, ſhe loved much. Let favour be ſhewed to the wicked, he will not learn righteouſneſs, in the land of uprightneſs will he deal unjuſtly;</hi> as 'tis in Iſa. 26. 10. <hi>Thou after thy impenitent heart treaſureſt up wrath, and diſpiſeſt the goodneſs of God that leads thee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Bounty is <hi>leading to</hi> repentance, but the God of grace, and the grace of God, it <hi>ſets up</hi> repentance in us. Let us go forth then in grace, and in love; And ſo let us be winning and working upon others. <hi>Teaching us that denying ungodlineſs</hi> and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Many men will ſay, if I deny my luſts, all the luſts of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118351:113"/>
the world, here's an end of my life, What ſhall I do? How ſhall I live? Thou ſhalt live <hi>the life of God;</hi> It brings death upon <hi>this</hi> life, this <hi>Worldly</hi> life, and brings us to live in <hi>hope. Looking for that bleſſed hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a fooliſh thing to a carnal heart to think of ſuffering it ſelf to betaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> off from the <hi>preſent enjoyment</hi> of the world, the ſatisfying his luſts, to live upon hope: But the hope that is in <hi>God</hi> is firm and <hi>ſure,</hi> and ſurerer then the World. <hi>The World paſſeth away and the luſts thereof;</hi> and they that have their life in theſe things find nothing but <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> but this hope never makes men aſhamed. <hi>Which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entereth into that within the vail.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here lets take notice of this; That the grace of God that brings Salvation is made out in teaching us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts; Every one of us talk of grace and Salvation; If we be partakers of grace and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation indeed, then we are delivered from worldly Luſts in ſome degree. We are taught by it to deny ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts. We are taught by it likeneſs to God, and not to be faſhioned to this world. To deny ungodlineſs, is to deny every thing that is not like God. Not to walk like men; the Apoſtle condemns the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that they walked like men. It may be 'tis a ſtrange thing to hear we ſhould not walke like men. Like whom ſhould we walk? Like the Devil? Like beaſts? So ſome do. No, you ſhould walk like God. The grace that brings Salvation, It doth not bring you to ſatisfie ſenſuality, to ſatisfie Luſts, nor to follow the creature, but it brings in power, it brings in and raiſeth up the life of God, whereby we deny theſe Luſts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we famiſh theſe Gods of the Earth. God ſaith he will famiſh all the Idols; And this God doth, when he riſeth up in us, he famiſheth in us the Love of the World, the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118351:113"/>
love of fleſh; This grave and hell, he ſtarves them both.</p>
                  <p>This grace of God that brings Salvation leads up into Heaven, into God, into the Spirit, and ſatisfies and fills us in the other World. And we deny our Luſts after this. <hi>They that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affections and Luſts.</hi> They have done it, and they are doing it; 'tis as good as already done; for there is that power in them, which will do it; a greater power then is in the World. 'Tis the Circumciſion in heart by the Circumciſion of Chriſt; 'Tis dying with Chriſt and being buried with Chriſt; 'Tis dying to this fleſhly State, to this glory and theſe contentments; It is the conſecrating us to God, ſo that he becomes our delight, he is our Joy, he is our riches; We ſought them in the fleſh, we ſought them in the World; Then we ſought Corn and Wine and Oyle; now nothing but the light of Gods countenance; this is grace, and this is Salvation. And the world and the fleſh which is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought after by us, it is a vail of death: It is a vail upon Chriſt, a covering upon the life of God; It is the grave and the priſon of the Saints; it is <hi>Babylon</hi> and the <hi>Northcountry</hi> into which we are carried. The North-country, far from the Sun, far from light, far from life. When we come into fleſh we are buried, here we are eſtranged from our own life, which is the life of God. And the grace of God appearing, that is as it were the Sun drawing nigh. When the Sun comes in the Spring and Summer, the face of the Earth is renewed. We come into the nature of wrath; but as grace returnes again, ſo this life appears and comes forth; this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher is opened, and this vail is rent, and the Earth gives up her dead, and no longer covers her ſlain. The fleſh and World and glory thereof, riches and contentment, are a vail and covering upon the life of the Saints. For God is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118351:114"/>
life and Salvation; union with him, that is life indeed; and the appearing of this union, is life manifeſted. That which the World and natural men do call death, is indeed the ſwallowing up of death; as 'tis called Iſa. 25. <hi>He ſhall take away the vail and the covering that is upon the face of all People. He ſhall wipe off all tears, and ſhall ſwallow up death in Victory.</hi> The World and fleſh is a <hi>Vail,</hi> and is a Vail of <hi>tears;</hi> when this Vail is rent, by the comming of that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led death, then life-comes indeed, and death is ſwallowed up in it; God who is our life appears: Grace and Salvation is not leading us into contentments of the fleſh, into the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the riches of the Earth: 'Tis not ſatisfying of luſts, but the killing of luſts; 'tis bringing <hi>forth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, bringing forth the life of God.</hi> Godly in this preſent World.</p>
                  <p>By this will appear how far Salvation is from moſt men. <hi>Salvation is far from the wicked</hi> (as David hath it) <hi>becauſe they keep not thy Statutes.</hi> Little do wicked men think there is no Salvation but in keeping Gods Statutes; but that is the truth of it; Salvation is conformity to God, to be made like to God, to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts; <hi>and the love of the World is enmity to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is Salvation, and the ſame is deſtruction to wicked men; Worldly men, they have their life in the Vail, their life is in the World and in the fleſh; When God appears and throws off the Vail, there is nothing to be ſeen by them but death and deſtruction; And what is the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> that the Scripture ſpeaks of, but the appearance of God? The manifeſtation of God, 'tis the ſecond death, 'tis everlaſting deſtruction to them that know him not, that have no life but in the fleſh and in the world. When God appears, here ends their life, and here begins deſtruction, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed from his preſence. That which is life and Salvation
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118351:114"/>
indeed, is death, hell and deſtruction to a worldly man; and if he ſpeak his heart, he will ſay, if this be ſalvation, let me have none of it, I know not what it means, I know no other life but this in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>What ſaith the Apoſtle? <hi>The life I live, I live by the faith of the Son of God; <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>tis not I live, but Chriſt that lives in me:</hi> though I live in the fleſh, yet I do not War after the fleſh: though I live in the World, I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the World, but transformed. On the other hand, the life of the World is, give me Corn, Wine and Oyl, eaſe in the fleſh, honour in the World: the life of the Saints is, lift up the light of thy countenance, make me after thine own heart, form me according to thine own Image, faſhion me to thy Will, teach me to deny my ſelf. It is feeding hell and deſtruction to ſatisfie worldly luſts; it is life and ſalvation to deny theſe, to crucifie theſe: therefore lets be acquainted with grace and ſalvation what it is.</p>
                  <p>Lets not deceive our ſelves with names of things; lets not call evil good, and good evil; put light for darkneſs, and darkneſs for light. Lets not call wrath and deſtruction grace and ſalvation: Whoever thou art that only looks to the world, and fleſh, and outward things, thou dwelleſt in wrath and deſtruction. Thou haſt vexation here, and the Goſpel makes thee mad; for it puls thee from theſe things, and with the more power it comes forth, the more hell works within thee. Now begin to learn what is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it is to have power to deny theſe luſts, to crucifie the fleſh, to be taken out of ſenſuality, to be redeemed from among men: (Is this a ſtrange thing to you? then ſalvation is ſtrange, and grace is ſtrange.) 'Tis to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to God, to know what his good and acceptable will is: If grace and ſalvation be reckoned by us, to be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118351:115"/>
ſafe in ſin, and ſafe in the world, and in the fleſh, we are in the Devils deceit, in the deceivableneſs of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among them that periſh. If you will have this made out to you by Scripture (the Saints of God know this in their hearts and ſouls, but will you have it in the Scripture?) <hi>His name ſhall be called Jeſus a Saviour,</hi> Mat. 1. Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins,</hi> Here is ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be ſaved from ſin: What is ſin? 'Tis oppoſition unto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> breaking his Laws; to be ſaved from falling out with God, this is ſalvation: And to be ſaved from ſin is to be ſaved from wrath; there is wrath and hell in ſin, though it be not yet come forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it will come forth. When ſin hath conceived, it brings forth death; if you have a Saviour he ſaves you from your ſins. Another place is <hi>Acts 3. 26. God ſent Chriſt to bleſs us, to turn every one of us from our iniquities:</hi> You look upon your ſelves as bleſſed by Chriſt; if you be bleſſed, this is the bleſſing, Turning you from your iniquities, enabling you to deny ungodlines, and worldly luſts. You may add a third place, <hi>Acts 5. 31. Whom God hath made a Prince and a Saviour</hi> (he ſpeaks of <hi>Chriſt</hi> there) <hi>to give Repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> You like forgiveneſs of ſins well; how like you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? where God gives one he gives the other: where Chriſt is our Righteouſneſs he is our Sanctification, where he is both theſe, he is our wiſdom, he gives us a new minde, and a new heart, writes his Law in our mindes; this is life, this is ſalvation: here is grace and ſalvation, teaching us to deny ungodlineſs; tis a work ſupernatural as to old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the corrupt Man; it is only in thoſe that ſpring from the Spiritual man <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they riſe up in a new life and walk in it; <hi>if ye walk in the ſpirit, fulfil not the luſts of the fleſh:</hi> Tis the Divine Nature ſpringing up in us that doth not live the life of the fleſh; if a man hath no life but in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118351:115"/>
the fleſh, that which is indeed ſalvation and grace, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and wrath to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is this denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts? Tis that which is called in other Scriptures <hi>ſelf-denying;</hi> we have a ſelf that is nothing but ungodlineſs. If we be Saints indeed, we have two ſelves, a divine ſelf, a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and heavenly ſelf, the new Creature, the Heavenly man, the Divine Nature; and there is a carnal ſelf, an earthly ſelf, a ſelf that is ſin, in which dwells nothing that is good. There is another ſelf contra-diſtinct to ſin, <hi>tis not I, but ſin in me:</hi> there is a ſelf that is Chriſt, and a ſelf that is corrupt <hi>Adam; I do not live</hi> (I of corrupt <hi>Adam) but Chriſt lives in me.</hi> Here is one ſelf never to be denied; one ſelf that is godlineſs, heavenly luſt and heavenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire makes after God only; this ſelf is to be pleaſed; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he that pleaſes this ſelf, and knows this ſelf. But there is carnal ſelf, the Law of the Members, this is ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, this carries wholly from God to the World; whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that which is not of the Father; this is to be denied. And this is beating down the body, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>I beat down my body:</hi> Whats that? is it as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do, to whip themſelves, to pine their bodies? no, there is a body of death, a body of ſin, this corruption in me, this ſelf I beat down: there is the old man, that is to be deſtroyed: The grace of God that brings Salvation, teacheth us to deny this ſelf, this ungodly ſelf, this world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſelf, this ſelf that is of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>And it is by bringing forth another ſelf, that this ſelf is denied, if it be truly denied: for there is ſelf denying ſelf, ſin denying ſin, luſt denying luſt; a <hi>maſter luſt</hi> that ſtarves other luſts: this is not the denying that the grace of God
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118351:116"/>
teacheth. There is a luſt that is kept in with bit and bridle, like a horſe and mule; there is denying ungodlineſs by the power of the <hi>Law,</hi> but here tis grace that teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs, grace <hi>that brings ſalvation.</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſelf, denies it ſelf but in ſome things; the Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables us to deny our ſelves but in ſome things, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs: and indeed it is not the denying of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the denying ungodlineſs only by a carnal man, it is ungodlineſs. Tis the new man that is brought forth in true righteouſneſs and holineſs. There is nothing but a <hi>ſhew</hi> of righteouſneſs and holineſs till this new man be brought forth after the Image of God. The Law it teacheth us to deny this piece of ungodlineſſe, or to ſeem to deny it at leaſt; to deny the groſs act of it, but to deny it in the root of it, it can never do it. But the grace of God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to deny all ungodlineſs, to come out of all that is not of God, all that is not like God. This life of God it purges out all filth; <hi>He that hath this hope purifies himſelf, as he is pure;</hi> this life it riſes out of its vail, and grave, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of worldly luſts, yea it riſeth from under the Law. This grace of God appearing is the time appointed of the Father, when we ſhall be no more under Tutors and Governors, in the condition of Servants, but Sons, Heirs, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Eaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts.</hi> Denying implies ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: ungodlineſs and worldly luſts will be ſoliciting, even in thoſe to whom the grace of God, that brings ſalvation hath appeared. After grace hath ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually appeared, there will be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations, temptations and motions to ſin, ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, ſoliciting and tempting to return again unto them, but the grace of God that brings ſalvation teacheth us to deny them. There is ſin in our Members ſtill, there is ſoliciting, and there is very far prevailing: The grace of God that brings ſalvation, ſprouting forth, is often ſtruck back into a ſeed, into the root again. There may be a <hi>bewitching</hi> of the Spiritual man, as the Apoſtle writes to the <hi>Galatians, O fooliſh Galatians, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched you, that you ſhould not obey the Truth?</hi> There is many a blaſt that comes upon the Oaks and the tall Trees, and there may be withering in the branches, while the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118351:117"/>
the holy ſeed abides in the root. There are ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of death, after grace and Salvation hath appeared; and ſometimes exceeding violent; In ſo much that <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>I am carried captive! O miſerable man! Who ſhall deliver me? Rom.</hi> 7. The reaſon of this is, becauſe ungodlines and worldly luſts are not quite deſtroyed at once; But the work is carried on by degrees; Chriſt he is formed in us, but he comes forth as a child, and weak at firſt. The Lord he comes and takes poſſeſſion, ſits in the throne, and throws Satan and ſin down; but then they are ſtriving to recover themſelves again, to come into their command &amp; rule again; <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. So that you cannot do the things that you would: Every thing would live, fleſh would live; When God comes to deſtroy it, it ſtrives and ſtrugles as long as it can.</p>
                  <p>God will keep his people in exerciſe, through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he will bring them into ſtrength, and ſo his ſtrength ſhall be perfected. And through many foiles, and many times being overcome, he will bring them at laſt into a compleat and glorious victory: They ſhall try all the Powers of Hell and Satan, and ſo ſee <hi>That greater is he that is in them, then he that is in the World;</hi> they ſhall ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (though often foyl'd) <hi>more then Conquerors through him that loves them; They ſhall not go forth in haſte,</hi> as the Lord promiſes in bringing his People out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and is made true in their bringing forth out of Spiritual <hi>Babylon;</hi> they ſhall not ſneak out, or ſteal out, but ſhall go forth at laſt as Conquerors, and the more foyles they have had, the oftner overcome, the more glorious will be their conqueſt; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fight the good fight of Faith; O ye men of God, fight the good fight of Faith; You that are quickned with Chriſt &amp; raiſed up to fear God, be not diſcouraged at thoſe motions that you find in you, endeavouring to hale and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118351:117"/>
draw you back to ungodlineſs and worldly luſts again, though they ſhould come with violencc to draw you to that Priſon and darkneſs again; And you may wonder a while, and ſay, <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> as <hi>Rebeccah</hi> did when <hi>twins were in her womb.</hi> For tis the ſame caſe here, the fleſh luſts againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh; As you grow up into the light and knowledge of God, you wil be above fears in this matter; 'twill not at all move you, diſcourage you, or diſ-hearten you. We do not feel death but as life comes in; So long as thou ſtand'ſt thy ground, and wilt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, though thou dealeſt with an enemy, and there be force upon thee; Yet there is no cauſe why thou ſhould'ſt be diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>Here is ungodlineſs, and here are worldly luſts, but here is grace to deny them; Here is the fleſh that luſts againſt the Spirit, but here is the Spirit alſo that luſts againſt the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> comes, the burthens of the Iſraelites are doubled; So when the Spirit comes, when righteouſneſs comes, when wiſdom and Sanctification comes, there is a fuller diſcovery, and more buſling of Satan and Hell then ever was before: <hi>Denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts.</hi> They have their motions, they do ſolicite, where the grace of God <hi>that brings Salvation hath appeared;</hi> But reſiſt them, <hi>Whom reſiſt ye ſtedfaſt in the Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Ungodlineſs is whatever is not of God, whatever is not of the Father, <hi>the luſt of the eye, the luſt of the fleſh, and the pride of life:</hi> This is not of the Father, this is ungodlineſs; Godlineſs is likneſs unto God; tis bringing forth the Divine nature in us, <hi>By precious promiſes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) he hath made us
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118351:118"/>
partakers of the Divine nature.</hi> The new man grows up in this ſunſhine; the Spiritual, the Heavenly man, made after the Image of God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 21. God calls us to be holy, <hi>as he</hi> himſelf <hi>is holy,</hi> this is godlineſs. <hi>God hath predeſtinated us to be conformable to the Image of his Son; He hath given him to us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps. Chriſt is the expreſs Image of his fathers perſon;</hi> And the deſign of the Goſpel is to bring forth Chriſt in us, <hi>My little children of whom I travail in birth till Chriſt be formed in you;</hi> This is godlineſs, to bring forth Chriſt in us, God in us. We ſhall be like him, ſaith <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. at the beginning; <hi>We ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is:</hi> The grace of God that brings Salvation, brings us to be acquainted with God. It is the revealing of God in us. It is Gods manifeſting himſelf to us <hi>with open face,</hi> So that we <hi>are changed into his Image from glory to glory by the Spirit.</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. It is <hi>Gods becoming our wiſdom, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Sanctification, and redemption.</hi> 1 Cor. 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But obſerve the manner of the Scriptures ſpeaking in this particular. <hi>To be led by the Spirit of God;</hi> So are his Sons. <hi>Rom. 8. To have our works wrought in God,</hi> John 3. <hi>He comes to the light, that his works may be manifeſted, that they are wrought in God: to ceaſe from our own works as God did from his,</hi> Heb. 4. Chriſt brought forth in us; he ſpeaks not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he works not of himſelf; the Father ſpeaks, and <hi>the Father doth the works,</hi> Joh. 1. 4. 10. Godlineſs is Godlikeneſs, and when once we are taught Godlineſs, we are taught not to walk as <hi>men,</hi> as the Apoſtle hath it to the <hi>Corinthians, Ye are carnal</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and walk as men;</hi> We walk in another light, in another wiſdom, in another power, in another life, when once we are taught Godlineſs: <hi>Chriſt died for us, the juſt for the unjuſt, to bring us unto God:</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> hath it, <hi>The grace of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118351:118"/>
God teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs,</hi> carries us into the life of God, into the power of God, into the light of the God, into glory of God, into the Kingdom of God; Doth not the Scripture ſay as much?</p>
                  <p>It were grace and Salvation to reſtore us unto that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Image in which <hi>Adam</hi> was brought forth in fleſh: But God hath <hi>more grace</hi> for us, and greater Salvation, even to bring forth <hi>his own</hi> life in us, to make us Children of the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> The life of <hi>Adam,</hi> as it was in innocency, it was a glorious life, but it was weak and <hi>fading,</hi> as we ſee; But this life is a life that can never fade, 'tis ſtrong, 'tis ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, '<hi>tis an inheritance immortal, undefiled, that fadeth not away:</hi> that ſin and death can never conquer. (<hi>Chriſt riſing from the dead he dies no more.) 'Tis the life of God the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of, I in them and they in me, that they may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> in one. <hi>Becauſe I live you ſhall live alſo.</hi> 'Tis not <hi>the Image of the earthly man, but the Image of the Heavenly man,</hi> that the grace of God reſtores us to. We come ſhort of the Goſpel if we ſit down and reſt our ſelves in the righteouſnes <hi>of man, 'tis the righteouſneſneſs of God, which is the mark that is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; he hath called us into his own Kingdom and glory; The grace of God</hi> brings us into the Spirit, and now our <hi>way is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> all the righteouſneſs of man, above all the wiſdom of man, above all the contentments of the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Ungodlineſs and Worldly luſts. Here take notice of this, that ungodlineſs lieth in worldly luſts; Godlineſs is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like unto God; Ungodlineſs is faſhioning our ſelves to the World.</p>
                  <p>Ungodlineſs and worldly luſts are one; So far as we are in worldly luſts, we are in ungodlineſs; <hi>You cannot ſerve God and Mammon. The Apoſtle calls the love of Mony the root of all evil.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 10. Mony ſtands for <hi>any</hi> thing of <hi>this World,</hi> of this life; the love of that, the <hi>luſt</hi> after that is the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118351:119"/>
root of all evil. The ſame that <hi>James</hi> tell us, <hi>Jam. 4. 4. The friendſhip of the world is enmity unto God;</hi> and thoſe that love the World, and go after the things <hi>thereof, he calls A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers and adultereſſes; Love not the world nor the things of the world,</hi> ſaith <hi>John, For if ye love the World, the love of the Father is not in you,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 15. The Lord complains Jer. 2. 13. <hi>My people have committed two great evils, for which be aſtoniſhed you Heavens, and horribly afraid;</hi> And what are thoſe two great evils? <hi>They have forſaken me the fountain of living water, and have hewen unto themſelves broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns that will hold no water.</hi> They run from the Creator to the Creature; <hi>They have turned the glory of the inviſible God into an Image made like to corruptible man, and to birds and four-footed beaſts:</hi> They have ſet up the creature in my place, and made it their fear and their joy, and their delight, and their love; And ſo the Apoſtle in Phil. 3. Speaks of thoſe, <hi>Whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is their ſhame, who mind earthly things.</hi> They that mind <hi>earthly</hi> things are <hi>ungodly,</hi> in the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſenſe. <hi>God</hi> that made Heaven and Earth is not <hi>their</hi> God, but the <hi>things</hi> that are made; <hi>Their belly is their God:</hi> all they ſeek is for their belly, who craves it of them.</p>
                  <p>All ungodlineſs lieth in worldly luſts; Faſhioning our ſelves unto the World, is the defacing of the Image of God; It is a turning away from the <hi>good and holy and acceptable will of God,</hi> as 'tis in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>And the ground of this is plain and obvious to every one that will ſee it; Whither can a man go forth from God, unleſs it be to the creature? there is the <hi>Creator</hi> and the <hi>Creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> he that goes from God, muſt go to the creature; Whither can he go elſe? Ye have <hi>forſaken me, and digged to your ſelves broken Ciſterns.</hi> There is no going from God and godlineſs but to worldly luſts. There is no ſtirring anywhere elſe; All ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs lieth in worldly luſts, worldly deſires, going out to the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118351:119"/>
Creature. All going forth to theſe, is going forth to the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is the <hi>Prince of this World,</hi> as Chriſt calls him. The Prince of this World comes, ſaith Chriſt; All that ſue to the World ſue to him, worſhip him. The Devil is ſerved in every deſire that goeth forth from God; In all oppoſition to God the Devll is ſet up. We uſe to reckon of three enemies to God, the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil; The going out to the World is for the fleſh; the ſerving the fleſh and the World, is ſerving the Devil. What is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in ſacrifice to <hi>Idols,</hi> is ſacrificed to <hi>Devils;</hi> and the Apoſtle calling us to the mortifying of fleſhly and worldly luſts, mentions <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> among them, which he calls Idolatry, and Covetouſneſs which is Idolatry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lieth in worldly luſts; that is, in loving the world and deſiring the things of the World; <hi>Love not the World, nor the things of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, Is every deſire of any worldly thing ungodly?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you will hear the Scripture, and let that be judge, harken while I propound ſome Scriptures unto you, which ſhall ſhew you what luſts they are; What deſires after the World they are in which ungodlineſs lieth: Conſider that in Heb. 13. <hi>Let your converſation be without covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; be content with ſuch things as you have, for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Deſiring any thing more then you have, is covetouſneſs and worldly luſts, and is a denying of Godlineſs. If you be not content with that you have, you are covetous, and there is ungodlineſs. God is rich in himſelf, content in himſelf, full in himſelf, and if you partake of the Divine nature, you ſhall have riches and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in him. <hi>I am God Alſufficient</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Abraham, I am thy exceeding great reward; walk before me and be perfect; q. d.</hi> thou haſt nothing to do, but to approve thy ſelf to me:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118351:120"/>
whatever thou wanteſt, here it is. I am God alſufficient; Looking after any thing but me is looking from me, and is ungodlineſs. Again, conſider that Scripture in Mat. 5. <hi>Take no thought what you ſhall eat, or what you ſhall drink, or what you ſhall put on; after theſe things do the Gentiles ſeek;</hi> All this is ungodlineſs, 'tis ungodlineſs <hi>to take thought what you ſhall eat, what you ſhall drink, or what you ſhall put on.</hi> Now what is godlineſs? <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs thereof</hi> Here you ſhall have ſupply: So far forth as you look from God, his Kingdom and the righteouſneſs thereof, you are of the world, you are ungodly, 'tis your <hi>little Faith!</hi> O ye of little faith, why do ye take care? Seek nothing but the Kingdom of God; if there be any thing elſe, it ſhall come into you with it; 'Tis godlineſs to ſeek God, 'tis failing of godlineſs when you ſeek any thing elſe but God, when you turn to any broken Ciſtern whatſoever, when you ſee not God before you, there turn away, or elſe you turn from God. <hi>Love the Lord your God withal your heart withal your Soul, with all your ſtrength.</hi> Let nothing of the world have any place in you; Let God fill your hearts; his train filled the Temple. <hi>What concord is there between Chriſt and Belial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Mammon? I have learned to abound and to want, to be full and to be hungry.</hi> Phil. 4. <hi>In every ſtate I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,</hi> I know what to do, and I am content; <hi>godlineſs is contentment, and that is Great gain.</hi> We have content in God, and nowhere elſe; If we ſeek anywhere elſe, we ſeek trouble and vexation and diſappointment; <hi>Man doth not live by bread, but by every word of God.</hi> What a fooliſh thing 'tis for man to ſeek life frombread! let him ſeek God, everyword of God. So Chriſt put off the Devil, when he bid him of ſtones to make bread; he tells him man could not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:118351:120"/>Conſider that Scripture, <hi>mans life doth not conſiſt in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundance of thoſe things he poſſeſſes;</hi> or that Scripture, <hi>All things are lawfull, but I will not be brought under the power of any thing;</hi> I'le be under the power of none but God, I want none but God, I'le ſeek to none but God. Conſider that of the Apoſtle in 1 Cor. 7. <hi>Let them that are married be as if they were not married; and they that uſe the world, as if they uſed it not;</hi> All going forth to the creature, to the world, to any piece of it, tis ungodlineſs, tis going from God. If you cannot be content with God alone, tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs: You deny his alſufficiency, 'tis little Faith: this is want of godlineſs; <hi>Your Father knows what you have need of:</hi> you have nothing to do but to pleaſe your Father, he will ſupply theſe things; Seek his kingdom, theſe things ſhall be ſent into you.</p>
                  <p>So, All going forth unto any part of this Creation, is ungodlineſs, it is going from God. Here is the <hi>root</hi> of all ungodlineſs diſcovered, <hi>going from God to the creature.</hi> You will be rich, and you muſt have this, and you muſt have that: <hi>there is but one thing neceſſary,</hi> and if you think any thing elſe neceſſary, tis denyal of God, tis ungodlineſs.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay this is a hard ſaying, and who can bear it.</p>
                  <p>When Chriſt had told his diſciples that it <hi>was eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle then for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> who then can be ſaved? ſay they: Surely not one that truſts in riches, for that is a denying of God. Who ſhall be ſaved then? who is there ſhall take off his deſire from every creature, that ſhall take off his heart, and make it over wholly unto the Lord, that ſhall deſire nothing but the Lord, and ſay, I have none in Heaven but thee, nor in earth but thee? mark what Chriſt anſwers there, <hi>to men this is impoſsible: but with God all
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118351:121"/>
things are poſsible.</hi> That which is called for of us is impoſſible to man; but to God all things are poſſible, even this is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                  <p>The Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus will free us from the Law of ſin and death; God calls us to that which is <hi>above</hi> mans ſtrength to yield to: His <hi>belly</hi> cleaves to the <hi>ground,</hi> and <hi>duſt</hi> is his <hi>meat,</hi> being beguiled by the <hi>Serpent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and his <hi>looking</hi> towards God is meerly <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical;</hi> But God brings forth Chriſt in him, raiſes up that ſubſtance, that holy ſeed, and that ſeeks him alone. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs you be born again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> So that it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, except you know a better Righteouſneſs then mans Righteouſneſs, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs your righteouſneſs exceeed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Man will not ſee the extent of ſin, becauſe he will not ſee his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation in it; but that man that is of God, he ſees that the power of God is his, and the holineſs of God is his; And he hath a nature that ſhall riſe up out of the creature, and throw off all its duſt and earth that is upon it, and cleave perfectly to God.</p>
                  <p>And he delights in the greatneſs of the commands that God gives. Look how great the command is, ſo great is his <hi>inheritance;</hi> there is nothing God commands but what he hath <hi>promiſed;</hi> His Law he writes in the heart; What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God commands, he gives; the higher God commands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spiritual Man likes them the better. God will work all this in me, to this ſhall I riſe in and through God. Chriſt in me is able to do this. <hi>It is God worketh in me to will and to do of his own good pleaſure;</hi> I'le work out my Salvation: Man dealing with the Scripture is leſſening ſin as much as may be, by ſaying this is not ſin, and that is not ſin; May not I do this, and may I not do that? may I not take care
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118351:121"/>
how I ſhall live? And then he comes to his <hi>diſtinctions</hi> of a <hi>tormenting</hi> care, and a <hi>neceſſary</hi> care: there muſt be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. This is true providence, to ſeek God; You are to know your Father, to pleaſe him, and to deal in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things as he leads you, and no farther. If you want, it ſhall be good for you: he will teach you to want, and to abound, to be hungry, and to be full; Godlineſs is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond mans reach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he cannot comprehend it, tis beyond what he can attain unto by nature: and if you will have a right ſcantling of ſin, look upon it as the Apoſtle ſets it out, <hi>All have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> All falling ſhort of the <hi>glory</hi> of God is ſin; We ſhall be brought in Chriſt into the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and then we ſhall be brought quite out of ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> For the Applying of this: Let this direct us in our account of ſin and of ungodlineſs. Let us reckon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto this rule, all worldly luſts, all going forth from God to the world, is ungodlineſs. Where is the godly man? There is no fleſh can ſtand before God. There is the man that is <hi>born of God,</hi> though he lieth in fleſh, he will come forth, and will be able to ſtand before God, <hi>when fearfulneſs ſurpriſeth the Hypocrite.</hi> There is the new man that is created in true holineſs ſhall ſtand. There is an Hypocritical holineſs, an Hypocritical godlineſs that runs to the world, and runs to the fleſh; making their belly their God, they mind earthly things, and yet they hold forth themſelves high in godlineſs: But the Scripture holds forth all going forth to the creature, but in the Lord, to be ungodlineſs. It muſt needs be ungodlineſs to go out from God; and it muſt needs be a denying God and his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, to go out to anything but him; Therefore let this teach us to mend our account, and to correct our reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in matter of ſin, and matter of ungodlineſs. If we be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118351:122"/>
free from Cheats, and Robberies, and groſs defraudings, we lick our ſelves whole, we wipe our mouth, we are of the godly party; ſo long as thou doſt well for thy ſelf, men will ſpeak well of thee: when as there is raking after the world, ſcraping riches and wealth together, and we are ready to die for this thing and the other thing, adding houſe to houſe, and land to land; I know not how to live without this; Thus hell and the grave in us will never be ſatisfied, alway craving. And this is wiſdom, Prudence, Providence; This is to be a wiſe man in the account of men; Men cry up this. But doſt thou acknowledge the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then conſider how that cenſures it. Why do you take care? Why do you look after any thing but God? is not he alſufficient? doth he not know what you need? have you any thing to do but to look after his Kingdom? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not you truſt him, O ye of little Faith? is <hi>unbelieving</hi> god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs with you? is not denying God ungodlineſs? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Lets look into our own hearts, and learn what to count ungodlineſs.</p>
                  <p>Sin lurks and is loth to be diſcovered: the diſcovery of it is the death of it; and if we be nothing but ſin, then tis <hi>our</hi> death; How many be there whoſe life is death, and their Covenant &amp; agreement with Hel is all their ſtability? And when we come to think of ungodlineſs, wickedneſs, departing from God, one man propounds this to himſelf, another that; to be a prophane ſwearer, this is a courſe of ungodlineſs; to be a beaſtly drunkard, this is ungodlineſs; to be a filthy unclean perſon, this is ugodlineſs. 'Tis true, all this is ungodlineſs, this is baſe, this is filthy; but is here all? No all worldly luſts, all going out in deſire after any piece of this Creation, is ungodlineſs. There is a <hi>Civil</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, that is <hi>modeſt</hi> and handſome unto the world, and that is it they call <hi>providence</hi> and <hi>prudence,</hi> which is nothing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118351:122"/>
elſe but baſe diſtruſt and denying God: 'tis nothing but Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as the Apoſtle calls it, nothing but adultery: <hi>Ye adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity to God?</hi> and then there is baſe and deboiſt ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that breaks out in drunkneſs and whoredom, and fraud, and rapine, and theft: Nothing but the breaking forth into ſcabbs and boiles, and blanes, and botches; But there is that poyſon within, which we ſee not: There is the Itch as well as the Scab, and Boil; Itching after the world, and the things thereof is ungodlineſs. After the worlds account only, what is hurtfull to the ſociety of men is reputed ungodlineſs; what ſinks men in their peace, in their wealth, in their eſtate, in their credit: So the world looks upon ſin as to ſuch and ſuch evil fruits as are hurtfull to this preſent ſtate of fleſh: It doth not look to the offence of God, to the going out from God, to the leaving God; It doth not know the life of God, it knows only ſin as it is any way prejudicial to the life of ſenſe: It doth not know ſin in the root of it: Let us learn ſo to know ſin, even in the root of it, and that is worldly luſts: hence it proceeds.</p>
                  <p>This is ungodlineſs, leaving the Creator and ſetling our ſelves in the creature: and ſetting up the creature in the place of God.</p>
                  <p>How many be there, that are condemning uncivil courſes (as they are to be condemned) but condemning them ſo as they juſtifie themſelves, as the Phariſee doth? <hi>God, I thank thee, I am</hi> not thus and thus, <hi>I am not like this Publican,</hi> this harlot, this drunkard. Look into thy heart what thou art before God: Make inquiſition after worldly luſts there, the root of all ungodlineſs, the root of that thou condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Publican, in the Harlot, in the Drunkard. This love of the World and turning from God to the world,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118351:123"/>
this breaks out in him; look how it works in thee: Perhaps thou art more civil, more modeſt, thou carrieſt thy ſelf ſo that thou art not ſo <hi>unmanly.</hi> (For there are worldly luſts that do unman a man, and make him like a beaſt, and there are worldly luſts that are very glorious things with men.) But thy heart and inſide are as bad as this, and as great an abhorring in the ſight of God. <hi>God hath choſen to himſelf the man that is godly.</hi> The Godly man is he that cleaves to God, reſts in God, truſts God, believes in God, that <hi>hath all in God:</hi> This is godlineſs: let us receive this truth which is acccording unto godlineſs.</p>

Lying thus, it is impoſſible for a man, for a ſon, a meer ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> to eſcape ungodlineſs; only he that is born of God, only Chriſt that came from heaven, and we through him do it.</p>

                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:118351:124"/>Now as grace teaches what us to avoid and ſhun, what to go from; ſo it teaches us what to make to. We ſhould live ſoberly, godlily, and righteouſly in this preſent World; to theſe words now.</p>
                  <p>Here is the leſſon that grace teaches us, that brings Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; To live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily; here is the place and time when it teaches us this leſſon; where? in this preſent world. It teaches us to live, ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and godlily. There is no ſober man, that is not a righteous and a godly man. There is no righteous man that is not a ſober and a godly man. It teaches us to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godlily. And there is no ſober man but he whom the grace of God that brings Salvation, hath taught to be ſober; and there is no righteous man, but he whom the grace of God that brings Salvation, hath taught to be ſo. And there is no godly man, but he whom the grace of God that brings Salvation, hath taught to be ſo; Now a little to Dilate upon theſe three.</p>
                  <p>1. That the ſober man is only he whom the grace of God that brings Salvation, hath taught to be ſo; We know not how to live ſoberly, till the grace of God that brought Salvation hath taught us. What is ſobriety? what is it to live ſoberly? Sobriety is oppoſed to two things; to Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to Drunkenneſs; Madneſs is Drunkenneſs, and Drunkenneſs is Madneſs; There's Drunkenneſs by drink, by Wine: and Drunkenneſs by paſſion and pride: there's drunkenneſs by cares of the world, and drunkenneſs by heavineſs; There's fury, and wrath, and there's joy too in making over much; and ſometimes this ſame drunkenneſs by fury, and wrath, and by joy, do uſher the grace of God that brings Salvation. The grace of God, it muſt bring us into ſobriety through diſtempers; diſcovering our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and our diſtempers together with the curing of them.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118351:124"/>
This ſame Drunkenneſs that is oppoſite to ſobriety, (take it in the lump all together) it is our ſtate in the fleſh with the Devil: We come out of the life of God into the fleſh: come into the dark, into a diſtempered ſtate: It is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching drunkenneſs that is upon us: There is a pure ſtate of fleſh that is not without diſtemper in compariſon to the life of God: There is a corrupt ſtate of fleſh that is pure diſtemper: Our true life (if we be of God,) is the life of God, and the glory of God; and all that comes ſhort of the glory of God is diſtemper: <hi>All have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi> And ſo <hi>Madneſs</hi> hath ſeized upon all, and all are under diſtemper, till the grace of God that brings Salvation appears, which returns the life of God in you, revives us according to the Divine nature. It is the grace of God that brings Salvation, that only cures us of diſtemper, and makes us perfect men in Jeſus Chriſt: It is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the only <hi>perfect</hi> and ſound man, the wiſdom of God: and we are ſound when he is formed in our hearts, brought forth and raiſed up in us: The Apoſtle attributes this ſound mind to the grace of God: <hi>God hath not given us the ſpirit of fear, but of power, but of God and of a ſound mind,</hi> The Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt is a ſpirit of a ſound minde: While we have not the ſpirit, we are under a cloud, we are in a diſtemper, and in weakneſs, even in the pureſt ſtate of fleſh: God finds weakneſs and folly in his Angels, he hath not put truſt in them: There is no ſound and perfect ſtate but the ſtate of God: all that are born of God are born into that ſtate, and he is their wiſdom: Jeſus Chriſt the wiſdom of God, and is made ſo to us of God.</p>
                  <p>Of the Prodigal tis ſaid, when he came to himſelf he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred his fathers houſe: <hi>Paul</hi> ſays that he was mad againſt the Church, 1 <hi>Tim. I was exceedingly mad:</hi> how
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118351:125"/>
came he changed? the grace of God was exceeding abundant towards him which is in Chriſt Jeſus: This revived his ſoul. The grace of God that brings Salvation, teaches us to live ſoberly. It makes us ſober <hi>indeed,</hi> it makes us mad in <hi>appearance. Paul</hi> ſays he was mad before the grace of God appeared: <hi>Feſtus</hi> told him he was mad after the grace of God had appeared; There is a <hi>ſeeming</hi> madneſs, and a <hi>ſeeming</hi> ſobriety; Sobriety is madneſs unto <hi>mad</hi> people; Mans ſobriety is madneſs unto God, and Gods wiſdom is folly and madneſs unto <hi>men.</hi> The ſpirit of God coming upon the Diſciples, there's a multitude that cry theſe men are full of new Wine, they are drunk; they ſpake truer then they were aware of; 'Twas new Wine indeed they had drank, but ſuch wine as they knew not of; and that which they look't upon as Drunkenneſs was true ſobriety, and they but then came into their wits, to a ſound mind; There was a Spirit of Power and Glory then came upon them, and the Spirit of fear it was vaniſhing away; When Chriſt began to manifeſt himſelf, his kinred ſaid he was mad; <hi>They went forth to lay hands on him, and ſaid he was mad.</hi> As the grace of God does appear in us and to us, it makes us <hi>ſigns and wonders in Iſrael:</hi> It is <hi>from the Lord of hoſts:</hi> It takes us off from following our own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and it leads us in a way that men do not walk in; The way of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is not the way of <hi>men;</hi> it transforms us out of the World, and changes us by the renewing of our mind. The mad world thinks us mad when we begin to be ſober; There's Gods wiſdom and mans wiſdom: mans wiſdom is fooliſhneſs to God, and Gods wiſdom is fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to man; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays of man, that <hi>folly and madneſs is in his heart;</hi> till the wiſdom of God come in, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe: and he that is in the height of madneſs, his mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not ſeen to himſelf; madneſs is continually there;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118351:125"/>
here is madneſs that he ſtumbles at God. There is no ſuch madneſs as is diſcovered by the wiſe and prudent man, when he diſcourſes in matters of Religion. There was not ſuch a mad and frantick man, to throw fire and arrows of death, as <hi>Paul,</hi> when only humane learning led him in the practice of Religion. The madneſs of men appears in <hi>calling evil good,</hi> and <hi>good evil,</hi> in running after <hi>ſhadows</hi> and leaving the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> in walking againſt the very light of their conſciences to run into the world, when they know the world is but a vain ſhadow; in <hi>tempting God,</hi> when they know he is ſtronger then they; The grace of God makes a man ſober: And there is this ground for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Becauſe God is the only wiſe God; <hi>To the only wiſe God:</hi> If God be only wiſe, then every man muſt be a fool: but <hi>man will be wiſe,</hi> ſays <hi>Job, though he be born like a wild aſſes colt:</hi> and here he diſcovers greateſt folly; Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever yields God that title <hi>The only wiſe God,</hi> he does deny it to himſelf, unleſs it be in Chriſt, unleſs it be by grace: if the grace of God hath entered, it teacheth us to live ſoberly; God hath let Satan enter upon this Creation, that mad Spirit that carries us to deſtruction, ſetting up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it, and ſtriving with God, though he ſhall never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: as God breaks in and throws out Satan, wiſdom comes, and madneſs goes: and therefore every one that looks upon himſelf as ſober, and would be counted ſo, let him conſider whence this ſobriety comes; hath the grace of God appeared that brings Salvation? Is it from God? or from man? There is not ſuch a mad man as a worldly wiſe man dealing in Religion. <hi>The fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer then men,</hi> and <hi>the weakneſs of God is ſtronger then men:</hi> and the wiſdom and excellency of men is fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God; <hi>He takes the wiſe in their craftineſs:</hi> their light is nothing but darkneſs: whoſoever they be that have not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118351:126"/>
the madneſs of man and fleſh diſcovered to them, do not yet know ſobriety; All that the world calls ſobriety and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it will appear but madneſs in the day of the Lord; The wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity to God: what folly is this? what do you get by <hi>enmity to God?</hi> Fleſh is not <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be;</hi> If you be truly wiſe and ſober, it is by the grace of God appearing, that hath brought Salvation; And whoſoever is indeed made wiſe and ſober, by this grace of God appearing, he muſt look to be accounted mad and fooliſh: True ſobriety muſt needs be accounted madneſs of thoſe that have it not; <hi>I and the ſons whom thou haſt given me are for ſigns:</hi> A man inſtructed by God, by a ſtrong hand, <hi>Noah</hi> was lookt on for a mad man, and condemned by the world: and he that is made ſober by God, he knows what the ſobriety of the world is; the world does not know what his ſobriety is: and he can carry himſelf <hi>boldly</hi> before the world in that it counts madneſs and folly, knowing that it will juſtifie it ſelf, and bring confuſion on all their wiſdom; That's the firſt, The grace of God that brings Salvation appearing, is that only that teaches ſobriety.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The grace of God that brings Salvation, appearing, is that only that teaches true Righteouſneſs: It teaches us to live ſoberly and righteouſly; Till the grace of God that bringeth Salvation appears, we do not know true righteouſneſs: all the righteouſneſs that we practiſe before, is but the <hi>ſhew</hi> of righteouſneſs: Till the new man be brought forth, there's no <hi>true holineſs,</hi> but he is created after the Image of God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 24. Paul</hi> was a wiſe man and a righteous man in his own opinion, and the opinion of the great and learned profeſſors of his time: but when the grace of God appeared to him, he ſaw he was a mad man, and a wicked man: he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118351:126"/>
ſaw he was a blaſphemer and a perſecutor: and he throws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all, he accounts it as dung: <hi>I accounted all dung for Chriſt, that I might be found in him, not having my own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is by the Law, but the righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt;</hi> the righteouſneſs which is <hi>by faith,</hi> the Lord our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the righteouſneſs of God; When that righteouſneſs comes forth, all our righteouſneſs that is by the Law, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as an unclean thing, as a <hi>menſtruous cloth,</hi> in <hi>Iſa. 64. all our righteouſneſs is as menſtruous cloths.</hi> Ther's no true righteouſneſs, but what the grace of God bringing Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt help us to: There is no man righteous before God: <hi>in his ſight ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified;</hi> Ther's none juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied but Chriſt, none bleſſed but Chriſt. <hi>If Abraham were juſtified by works, he had whereof to glory, but not before God;</hi> There's no glorying of man in his own righteouſneſs: No fleſh ſhall glory in his preſence; only he that is of <hi>God,</hi> to whom <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is made <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> he can <hi>glory in the Lord; I know that in me</hi> (ſays <hi>Paul) that is in my fleſh, dwells nothing that is good.</hi> It is in vain for God to be our righteouſneſs, if the righteouſneſs of man would ſerve the turn: where any man ſtands up in his own righteouſneſs, Chriſt hath nothing to do with him; <hi>The whole have no need of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, but the ſick: I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance:</hi> In all mans righteouſneſs, there's nothing but <hi>man,</hi> there's nothing but <hi>ſelf:</hi> the things of man end in man, it comes to nothing, it reaches not to <hi>God.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reaches to God, but that that comes from god. The righteouſneſs of man how glorious a ſhew ſoever it makes, is only in <hi>worldly</hi> and <hi>earthly</hi> deſigns. That's evil with him, that does any way oppoſe <hi>him</hi> in his <hi>peace,</hi> in his quiet, in his reſt in the <hi>fleſh;</hi> The righteouſneſs of man, let it come to the higheſt, it is but paſſive, and it is very fickle and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118351:127"/>
It is a proud righteouſneſs that makes a man ſwell againſt God; As there is no wiſdom but God, ſo there is no righteouſneſs but God; he is the only wiſe, he is the only holy God, and he is the only righteous God. The grace of God appearing bringing Salvation, that teacheth us to live righteouſly; and ſo Salvation is not for righteouſneſs, but Salvation is righteouſneſs, and righteouſneſs is Salvation. And every one that pretends to righteouſneſs, ſhould look whether he hath ſeen that righteouſneſs of God, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath met with the diſcovery of his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of the righteouſneſs of man, the deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs. Till the true and perfect righteouſneſs comes in, there is no diſcovery of the deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs; Iniquity walks in a <hi>Myſterie;</hi> and till the Myſterie of <hi>God</hi> be opened, the Myſterie of iniquity does not appear. There is a golden cup of Fornication the Whore carries in her hand. It is not enough to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that which man calls evil, but from that alſo man calls <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> There is as great abomination in that man calls and counts righteouſneſs, as there is in any thing he counts evil; there is that makes man a fair ſhew, and is glorious to men, which is abomination in the ſight of <hi>God;</hi> The Jews <hi>followed after righteouſneſs, but obtained it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſought it as it were by the works of the Law; We by the Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>wait for the hope of righteouſneſs by Faith:</hi> You that look for righteouſneſs, look out for true righteouſneſs; Take heed of the deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs; man will call evil good, and good evil, call Satan Chriſt, and Chriſt Satan. If you look for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, look for the righteouſneſs of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> look for the righteouſneſs of <hi>God;</hi> Men they call this and that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and look not what is <hi>the will of God;</hi> righteouſneſs is nothing but <hi>conformity unto God,</hi> and to that will of God
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118351:127"/>
that is <hi>revealed within;</hi> Chriſt <hi>within,</hi> is guiding and leading by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not only by a <hi>Letter;</hi> not that we ſhould throw away Letter: but what is Letter without the Spirit? A man watching in mans righteouſneſs, may make a very fair ſhew to the <hi>eye,</hi> even dazel mens eyes; but there is no righteouſneſs before God, but the righteouſneſs that is of God, the righteouſneſs that is of him. A man walking in his own righteouſneſs, may be very acceptable with men: but a man brought out of that into this, and walking in the righteouſneſs of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is lookt on as frantick and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical with men: For when he walks in Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he does not walk by his <hi>own</hi> will and <hi>reaſon,</hi> he doth not <hi>act himſelf:</hi> the Lord muſt act him, and guide him; And there is nothing ſo <hi>disfigures</hi> a mans face to the World, as being acted and guided by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God: the Spirit of God is wiſdom it ſelf, yet counted folly with men: It leads us in many ways men call folly and madneſs; I and the children whom thou haſt given me, are for ſigns and wonders from the Lord of Hoſts; <hi>Abraham</hi> could be counted no leſs then a mad man, and <hi>Noah</hi> no leſs then an old doating fellow, to build a ſhip in the midſt of the land, and be knocking 120. years together: what do you think this man indured all that while? The righteouſneſs of God is conformity to God: this Chriſt is made unto us: <hi>the grace of God that brings Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And he is made unto us godlineſs. There is no true Godlineſs, till this grace of God comes that brings Salvation; There is a <hi>form</hi> of Godlineſs before, but where's the <hi>power</hi> of it: when the grace of God comes bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation, the power of it comes: godlineſs is like God: godlineſs is partaking of the Divine nature, (as we ſhewed you in the morning) godlineſs <hi>is being guided by the Spirit of God.</hi> Godlineſs is <hi>working our works in God;</hi> godlineſs is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118351:128"/>
                     <hi>God ſpeaking in us, and acting in us, and we ceaſing from our own works;</hi> There is no man knows godlineſs, but he that is <hi>born again</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and no man that knows godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that walks <hi>only by the outward commandment and Letter,</hi> and hath it not <hi>alſo</hi> by the <hi>Spirit;</hi> There is a worldly ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and there is a houſe not of that building. There is a <hi>Law of the Spirit of life</hi> that is never <hi>without</hi> godlineſs; there is <hi>Redemption</hi> from all iniquity, as it follows here in the text; <hi>Grace and Salvation is all,</hi> grace brings Salvation; and it brings Salvation in bringing Sobriety, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Godlineſs: tis grace that does all; and here is Salvation, Righteouſneſs, Sobriety and Godlineſs. There's the life of man, and the life of beaſts, and the life of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils: and there is the life of God, when the grace of God that brings Salvation appears. And now for the time and place where this leſſon is taught, and where this Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and righteouſneſs, and godlineſs is brought forth: <hi>in this preſent World;</hi> a little of the time, and I have done; In this preſent World; In <hi>this place,</hi> in <hi>this time;</hi> the World, the preſent World, the <hi>mad</hi> World, the <hi>unrighteous</hi> World, the <hi>ungodly</hi> World, the World that lies in the <hi>wicked one,</hi> in the power of the wicked one: in this time of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>and hour of temptation,</hi> in this Kingdom of the World, and Kingdom of Satan; God he hath let Satan poſſeſs himſelf of this World, and of this Creation; and God is here trampled upon, and oppreſſed by Satan and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and he lies under foot as madneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, as filthineſs: and the Devil, and the World, they ſtand up and boaſt of ſobriety and godlineſs, they ſtand in the power of the Creature: and the glory of God is ſhut up in his Servants; Notwithſtanding all this power and rage, he appears in his ſervants <hi>in this preſent World.</hi> He teaches us to oppoſe, and confront, and adjudge the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118351:128"/>
World, and the wickedneſs of it: <hi>I have made thee a fenced City, and a wall of braſs,</hi> ſays God, <hi>againſt the princes of Judah;</hi> The grace of God enables a man where it appears: he fears not <hi>faces,</hi> he fears not <hi>Hell: he ſees him that is inviſible; Moſes</hi> feared not <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> It ſets us above all ſcorn and all reproaches in this preſent World; We muſt needs be ſigns and wonders, ſigns to be ſpoken againſt; we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be ſo, we can bear it; The grace of God that brings Salvation teaches us ſo: Perſecution comes, and troubles come, we can take up our Croſs, and we can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt. This ſobriety which the grace of God teaches, and this godlineſs and righteouſneſs exceedingly enables a man to be contented to be ſcornd and ſpit on: <hi>My life is not dear to me,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>that I may finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry I have received. Endure the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the World,</hi> ſays <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, by the power of God;</hi> And when the grace of God hath broken forth, and I have ſeen him that is inviſible, whats this World? when God hath ſet it up only to make a fool of it: God uſes the Devil, and wicked men, and enemies to make fools of them: and we ſee God ſtanding behind: then what cauſe is there to fear, in this preſent world, under their very noſe, to their face, to their teeth? The grace of God teaches us to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godlily: <hi>God out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings ordains ſtrength:</hi> God ſuffers himſelf to be brought into <hi>a very ſeed,</hi> by the Devil and the World, and thence he riſes up: and the lower he ſuffers himſelf to be brought, the more glorious is he in the <hi>Conqueſt;</hi> The Kingdom of heaven comes to be like a grain of muſtardſeed: it is a very little ſeed, and it is hid in the earth: a little leaven is hid in three meaſures of meal, that nothing is ſeen, but the power of darkneſs, the Kingdom of Satan, and ſin: this little grain of muſtardſeed ſprings up: and though all the power
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118351:129"/>
of the World riſe againſt it, it prevails and is glorious. Here's two or thre things I would but hint at by way of application.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. The grace of God teaches us to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godlily <hi>in this World;</hi> Firſt of all, this ſhews how much out they are that think to carry Religion ſo that they'l ſleep in a whole skin; will carry it like a Talent bound in a napkin. The grace of God teaches us to live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly in this preſent World; 'Tis as poſſible to carry fire about us and not to be burnt; If it be true Religion, it will be <hi>burning;</hi> Is that Religion that lies under fleſhly luſts, and worldly luſts? From the Devil it came, and to him it muſt go, it hath his life in it; God is not in it; but one that is truly Religious, he may for a time think of hiding and concealing himſel, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> came to Jeſus by night: but where godlineſs is in truth, it will he like new wine, that will vent or break the veſſel; God hath not given light to put under a buſhel, but to ſet on a candleſtick.</p>
                  <p>2. Again, There are many profeſſing Religion that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves, that the times are evil, and therefore they cannot do this or that; If the grace of God hath taught thee, it ſhall teach thee in evil times to appear ſoberly and righteouſly; There is a love grows cold as iniquity abounds: this is not the love of God: that like fire grows hotter in the coldeſt weather; God had Saints in <hi>Nero's</hi> houſe, he had them in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and they ſhined there, and appeared there, and oppoſed this world, this preſent World.</p>
                  <p>3. And again, Some are putting off this day; <hi>This is for heaven,</hi> ſay they, this is not for the <hi>preſent;</hi> It ſeems grace and Salvation is not come to ſuch: they that are not here in heaven, will never be in heaven; One Scripture that may conclude us in this, is, <hi>No man aſcended into heaven, but he that came down from heaven;</hi> If ye are not in heaven while ye
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118351:129"/>
are in the world, you'l never be in heaven; The grace of God that brings Salvation, <hi>hath appeared;</hi> Heaven hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to you, and heaven is <hi>in you,</hi> you are in heaven, and that ſame heaven ſhall be interpreted into you, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance ſhall be given more abundantly. If you ſay, this is a hard Saying, to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily: to convince the world, to challenge the world, to dare the world, what a life muſt we live? what ſuffering muſt we meet with? You are appointed thereunto: God hath given us another hope, <hi>a bleſſed hope,</hi> that is that follows, <hi>Looking for that bleſſed hope, at the appearing of the great God and our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The grace of God that brings Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will be a ſtrong help to you even in perſecution; for the joy that is ſet before us, we ſhall bear up againſt all the perſecutions we meet with in the world, under all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, all burdens, under all ſcoffs and ſufferings. The grace of God brings Salvation. Let the world do what they can do: let hell do what it can do, I'le be a ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to them, ſays God: The grace of God teaches us to live ſoberly and righteouſly in this preſent world, even in the midſt of enemies: It lifts up our heads even here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, and enables us to judge the world, and condemn the world, and ſo ſhall all do that are heirs of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is by faith: And thus much for this time.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>ANd in this mountain</hi>] The Lord is this mountain: that appeares in the firſt verſe of the chapter, <hi>Thou art my God, and I will exalt thee.</hi>] A Mountain is a thing exalted, and we exalt God when we bring him forth in power: He lies hid in our weakneſs, we ſhall bring him forth in his power. <hi>You are dead, and your life lies hid with Chriſt in God; when Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we appear with him in glory.</hi> When he lies no longer hid in our weakneſs and darkneſs, but comes forth in his own life, righteouſneſs, and ſtrength, then he is our Mountain: There is an expreſſion to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Pſal. 18. 2. The Lord is my Rock, my Fortreſs, my Strength, my high Tower,</hi> &amp;c. There are many Mountains, many appearances of God in fleſh; whereſoever God appeares in fleſh, that is a Mountain: When he is pleaſed to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and give way to the devil, then the whore comes and ſits upon the <hi>ſeaven Mountains;</hi> Not that I exclude the common interpretation of the ſeven Hills, but take in this with it. But though Satan hath poſſeſſed all other Mountains,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118351:132"/>
this he ſhall never poſſeſs: this is like <hi>Mount-Sion that ſhall never be removed:</hi> Mount-Sion indeed is but a ſhadow of this Mountain.</p>
                  <p>The woman of <hi>Samaria, Joh.</hi> 4. propounds a queſtion to Chriſt, whether they were to worſhip in the Samaritan Mountain, or at Mount-Sion; but ſhe was content to wait for the reſolution till the Meſſias come: Sion is the true figure, but Chriſt that <hi>reveals the Father,</hi> is the true Mountain.</p>
                  <p>God ſpeaks in figures and parables very much:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Mountain.</hi>] That is it that all other Mountans are but Types and Figures of. All this world is a Figure, and ſome ſpecial parts and pieces thereof are more inſtituted figures, more eminently ſo: where God appears to his people, that is a Mountain.</p>
                  <p>A Mountain is an exalted thing, a great thing, and ſtrong thing; A Mountain ſtands in a good Ayre: The Mountain of Spices; a Mountain gives a pleaſant proſpect; theſe are the properties of Mountains. God will appear in his people in his greatneſs, pleaſantneſs, height, ſtrength, eternity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In this mountain ſhall the Lord make a Feaſt.</hi>] There is a <hi>Mountain that is not to be touched, Heb.</hi> 12. But ye are come to the <hi>Mountain that may be touched:</hi> Ye ſhall feaſt in this Mountain. The world ſhall ſee the Feaſt, not touch it.</p>
                  <p>The natural man knows no Mountain but what is viſible, This Mountain is to fleſh inviſible. Whilſt the Saints do boaſt of God, and have outward helps to lean upon, the world looks upon them as ſuch as have ſome cauſe why they ſhould boaſt: but when their fleſhly helps fail, the world jeers them. Now <hi>flee to the mountain like a bird.</hi> The eleventh Pſalm is an anſwer to the Worlds jeer. <hi>I truſt in the Lord; how ſay ye to my ſoul, flee as a bird to your

The Church is called a <hi>City on a hill</hi> or Mountain, which is founded in God. <hi>We are not come to the mount that may not be touched.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord is the <hi>Mountain</hi> and the <hi>feaſt</hi> too: The Lord the <hi>Mountain,</hi> and the Lord the <hi>Feaſt. Nicodemus</hi> will ſay, how can this be? This is Non-ſenſe. <hi>To them that are without, we ſpeak parables: To you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>it is given to know the myſteries of the kingdom, but to others in parables, that ſeeing, they might ſee, and not underſtand. There is a vail upon all faces:</hi> If this will not go down eaſily with you, the Lord is the <hi>Mountain,</hi> and the Lord is the <hi>Feaſt;</hi> conſider, it comes but to this, to make the Lord all, <hi>all in all,</hi> and the world a ſhadow of him, a vail upon him: it is no diſhonour to the Lord, to make him all: if it be a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the world to make it a ſhadow, to make it nothing, let it be ſo: if you cannot bear the worlds diſhonour, we muſt take that boldneſs to give you offence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mountain</hi> and the <hi>feaſt</hi> too: How ſo? There is <hi>bread</hi> and there is <hi>wine</hi> in this <hi>feaſt; Chriſt, the true bread,</hi> Joh. 6. <hi>Chriſt the true vine,</hi> Joh. 15.

                        </gap>od is drink indeed.</hi> That is, my life, not onely my natural life, but my life which I had with the Father, ſlain and buryed, is <hi>meat indeed; the words that I ſpeak are ſpirit and life</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) where ſpirit and life is not, this is not received.</p>

                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:118351:133"/>What is this fleſh and blood, but <hi>the divine nature</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in you? for a while, as it were, dead and buryed in fleſh; afterwards raiſed and quickned in fleſh; <hi>and you hath he quickned:</hi> as it is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. This diſcovery of our true life, and this life brought forth in us, is the <hi>true meat,</hi> the <hi>true drink,</hi> the <hi>true fleſh,</hi> the <hi>true blood;</hi> and this ſame <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> is meat and drink too: for that being ſlain, the grave is opened where the true life lies.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> His manifeſtation, his bringing forth himſelf, is making the feaſt: his Death and Reſurrection brought forth in us, is making the Feaſt: then we feed <hi>on his fleſh,</hi> and <hi>on his blood,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks. This is a <hi>feaſt,</hi> and this <hi>feaſt</hi> hath <hi>fatneſs and ſweetneſs</hi> in it to a ſpiritual man; and the <hi>rich mans</hi> table, and the delicacies are but cruſts, and ſcraps, and parings to this Feaſt. The Feaſt lies in <hi>Abrahams boſome,</hi> the common life of all Saints, one with <hi>Abraham,</hi> gathered into the <hi>boſome of Abraham,</hi> the ſame life that <hi>Abraham</hi> lived: <hi>He that eats of this bread, ſhall hunger no more; he that drinks of this water, ſhall thirſt no more:</hi> There is muſick and dancing in this feaſt alſo, as we may ſee in the <hi>Prodigals</hi> entertainment upon his return to his <hi>fathers houſe;</hi> but the <hi>elder brother</hi> did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lord</hi> is this <hi>feaſt,</hi> and whereſoever the <hi>Lord</hi> is not, after a little while there ſhall be nothing but hunger and thirſt: where the Lord is not, there are but dreams. <hi>The hungry man dreams that he eats and drinks, and when he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes his ſoul is empty,</hi> as it is in <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> He that hath not entertainment with the Lord: He that dwells not in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118351:133"/>
boſom,</hi> ſhall hunger and thirſt, and languiſh, and fade away to nothing. Mark that Scripture in <hi>Iſa. 65. 11, 12, 13. Ye are they that forſake the Lord, and forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furniſh the drink offering unto that number: Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold my ſervant ſhall eat, but ye ſhall be hungry; behold, my ſervant ſhall drink, but ye ſhall be thirſty; behold my ſervant ſhall rejoyce, but ye ſhall be aſhamed:</hi> ye worſhip many Gods, ye ſhall have many troubles.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>mountain</hi> is, and is not; the Feaſt is, and is not; it is ſet out, but not fully; <hi>the hour cometh and now is</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; we are the Lords Feaſt, and he is ours: everywhere but in the Lord, ſhall be hunger and thirſt, dearth and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs: he that can receive it, let him receive it.</p>
                  <p>There are that have devoted themſelves to the Law, and the letter of Scripture: there are others that have all their life in the creature: God will ſhortly draw all life into himſelf: and all they that run after other Gods, ſhall ſtarve and famiſh; they and their Gods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ſay, There is ſomething in the Text that ſeems to contradict this; for it is not ſaid, <hi>He ſhall make unto [all people] a feaſt.</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>In the ſpiritual Feaſt, there is <hi>neither Jew nor Gentile, neither male, nor female, but all are one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

                  <p>The Lord, <hi>in this Mountain,</hi> in his appearing, <hi>will deſtroy the face of the covering.</hi> In the <hi>Mountain</hi> a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> in the <hi>Mountain the face of the covering deſtroyed.</hi> The carnal Jew looks for the fullfilling of the letter: the ſpiritual Jew looks for the ſpirit: <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, ſought a Country; not an earthly one, but a heavenly:</hi> we pitch upon figures and vails: and <hi>enter not within the vail.</hi> Theſe outward things are a <hi>vail, a Table made a ſnare:</hi> but when we are <hi>turned to the Lord, the vail ſhall be taken away.</hi> All mans teaching, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes the vaile the thicker: thoſe that feed onely upon the vail, upon outward things, in which God appears, their life ſhall be deſtroyed, when others are fed and feaſted.</p>
