            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> 
               <hi>Diurnall</hi> is a puny Chronicle, scarce pinfeather'd with the wings of time: It is an History in <hi>Sippets;</hi> the English <hi>Iliads</hi> in a Nut-shell; the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Parliaments book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> in single sheets. It would tyre a Welch pedigree, to reckon how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aps 'tis remov'd from an Annal: For it is of that Extract; onely of the younger House, like a Shrimp to a Lobster. The <hi>originall sinner</hi> in this kind was Dutch, <hi>Galliobelgicus</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toplast;</hi> and the <hi>moderne Mercuries</hi> but <hi>Hans-en-Kelders.</hi> The Countesse of <hi>Zealand</hi> was brought to Bed of an Almanack; as many Children, as dayes in the yeare. It may be the <hi>Legislative Lady</hi> is of that Lynage: so she spawnes the <hi>Diurnalls,</hi> and they at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> take them in Adoption, by the names of <hi>Scoticus, Civicus, Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannicus.</hi> In the Frontispice of the old <hi>Beldame Diurnall,</hi> like the Contents of the Chapter, sits the House of Commons, judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> You may call them, the Kingdomes Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy before the weekly Kalender: For such is a <hi>Diurnall,</hi> the day of the moneth, with what weather in the Common-wealth. 'Tis taken for the Pulse of the Body Politique; and the Emperick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the Assembly, those spirituall <hi>Dragooners,</hi> thumbe it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. Indeed it is a pretty <hi>Synopsis;</hi> and those grave <hi>Rabbyes</hi> (though in poynt of <hi>Divinity)</hi> trade in no larger Authors. The Country Carryer, when he buyes it for their Vicar, miscalls it the <hi>Urinall:</hi> yet properly enough; For it casts the Water of the State, ever since it staled bloud. It differs from an <hi>Aulicus,</hi> as the Devill and his Exorcist; or as a black Witch doth from a white one, whose office is to unravell her inchantments.</p>
            <p>It begins usually with an Ordinance, which is a Law still-borne; dropt, before quickned by the Royall assent: 'Tis one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103610:3"/>
by-blowes, (Acts onely being legitimate) and hath no more Syre, then a <hi>Spanish</hi> Genn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, that's begotten by the Wind.</p>
            <p>Thus their <hi>Militia,</hi> (like its Patron, <hi>Mars)</hi> is the issue onely of the Mother, without the concourse of Royall <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet Law it is, if they Vote it, though in defiance to their <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals;</hi> like the old <hi>Sexton,</hi> who swore his Clock went true, what ever the Sunne said to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Ingredient,</hi> of a <hi>Diurnall</hi> is Plots, horrible Plots; which with wonderfull Sagacity it hunts dry-foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, while they are yet in their Causes, before <hi>Materia prima</hi> can put on her Smock. How many such fits of the Mother have troubled the Kingdome, and (for all Sir <hi>Walter Earle</hi> looks like a Man-Midwife) not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of so much, as a Cushion? But Actours must have their Properties; And, since the Stages were Voted downe, the onely Playhouse is at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suteable to their Plots are their Informers; <hi>Skippers</hi> and <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;</hi> Spaniells both for the Land and the Water: <hi>Good conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> Intelligence! For however <hi>Pym's</hi> Bill may inflame the Reckoning, the honest Vermyn have not so much for Lying, as the <hi>Publique Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus a zealous Botcher in <hi>Morefields,</hi> while he was contriving some <hi>Quirpo-cut,</hi> of Church-Government, by the help of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying Eares, and the <hi>Otac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustion</hi> of the Spirit, discovered such a Plot, that <hi>Selden</hi> intends to combate Antiquity, and maintaine it was a Taylours Goose, that preserved the <hi>Capitol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wonder my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is not once more all-to-be-Traytor'd for dealing with the Lyons, to settle the Commission of Array in the Tower. It would doe well to crampe the Articles Dormant, besides the opportunity of reforming those Beasts of the Prerogative, and changing their prophaner names of <hi>Harry</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> into <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Eleazer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppose a Corne-cutter, being to give little <hi>Isaack</hi> a cast of his Office, should fall to paring his Browes, mistaking the one end for the other; because he branches at both, This would be a Plot; and the next <hi>Diurnall</hi> would furnish you with this Scale of Votes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resolved</hi> upon the Question; that this Act of the Corne-cutters, was an absolute Invasion of the Cities Charter, in the <hi>representative</hi> Forehead of <hi>Isaack, Resolved,</hi> that the evill Councellors about the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103610:3"/>
Corne-cutter are Popishly affected, and Enmies to the State <hi>Resolved,</hi> that there be a publique Thankesgiving for the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of <hi>Isaack's</hi> Brow-antlers, and a solemne Covenant drawn up, to defye the Corne-cutter and all his workes.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Quixotes</hi> of this Age fight with the Windmills of their owne Heads; quell Monsters of their owne Creation; make Plots, and then discover them; as who fitter to unkennell the Fox, then the Tarryer, that is a part of him.</p>
            <p>In the third place match their Adventures; the <hi>Roundheads</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend, the Rebels Romance; Stories of a larger size, then the Eares of their Sect; able to strangle the Beliefe of a <hi>Soli-fidian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'le present them in their order; and first, as a Whiffeler before the show, enter <hi>Stamford;</hi> one that trod the Stage with the first, travers'd his ground, made a legge and <hi>Exit.</hi> The Country People took him for one, that by Order of the Houses was to dance a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice through the West of <hi>England.</hi> Well, hee's a nimble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; set him but upon <hi>Bankes</hi> his Horse in a Saddle Rampant; and it is a great question, which part of the Centaure shewes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tricks.</p>
            <p>There was a Vote passing to translate him, with all his Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, into Monumentall-Gingerbread: but it was cross'd by the Female Committee, alleadging that the valour of his Image would bite their Children by the Tongues.</p>
            <p>This Cubit and an halfe of Commander, by the help of a <hi>Diurnall,</hi> routed his Enemies fifty miles off: 'tis strange you'l say; and yet it is generally believed, he would as soon doe it at that distance, as nearer hand. Sure it was his Sword, for which the weapon-salvo was invented; that so wounding and healing, like loving <hi>Correlates,</hi> might both worke at the same removes.</p>
            <p>But the Squibbe is run to the end of the Rope. Roome; for the <hi>Prodigy</hi> of <hi>Valour, Madam Atr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus they kill a man over and over, as <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold</hi> murder the Psalmes with another to the same, one chimes all in, and then the other strikes up, as the Saints Bell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103610:4"/>
I wonder, for how many lives my Lord <hi>Hoptons</hi> Soule took the Lease of his Body.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Stamford</hi> slew him: then <hi>Waller</hi> out kill'd that halfe a Barre: and yet it is thought the sullen Corpes would scarce bleed, were both these Man-slayers never so neare it.</p>
            <p>The fame goes of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Heads-man, that he would doe his Office with so much ease and Dexterity, that the Head after Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution should stand still upon the shoulders: pray God Sir <hi>William</hi> be not Probationer for the place. For, as if he had the like knack too, most of those, whom the <hi>Diurnall</hi> hath slaine for him, to us poor Mortalls seem untoucht.</p>
            <p>Thus these Artificers of Death can kill the Man, without wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body, like lightning, that melts the Sword, and never singes the Scabbard.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>William,</hi> whose Lady is the <hi>Conquerour;</hi> This is the <hi>Cities Champion,</hi> and the <hi>Diurnalls delight;</hi> he, that Cuckolds the Generall in his Commission: for he stalkes with <hi>Essex,</hi> and shoots under his Belly, because his Oxcellency hlmselfe is not charged there. Yet in all this Triumph there is a whip and a Bell: Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate but the Scene to <hi>Round-way-downe.</hi> There <hi>Haslerigges</hi> Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters were turn'd into Crabs, and crawl'd backwards; there poore Sir <hi>William</hi> ran to his Lady for a use of consolation.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Diurnall</hi> is weary of the Arme of flesh, and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins an <hi>Hosanna</hi> to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> one that hath beat up hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Drummes cleane through the Old Testament: you may learne the Genealogy of our Saviour, by the names in his Regiment: The Muster-Master uses no other List, then the first Chapter of <hi>Matthew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With what face can they object to the King the bringing in of Forraigners, when themselves intertaine such an Army of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes?</hi> This <hi>Cromwell</hi> is never so valorous, as when he is making Speeches for the Association, which neverthelesse he doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ominously, with his Neck awry, holding up his Eare, as if he expected <hi>Mahomets Pigeon</hi> to come, and prompt him: He should be a Bird of Prey too, by his bloudy Beake: his Nose is able to try a young Eagle, whether she be lawfully begotten. But all is not Gold that glisters: What we wonder at in the rest of them, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to him; to kill without Bloudshed: For most of his Trophees are in a Church-Window; when a Looking Glasse would shew him
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103610:4"/>
more superstition: He is so perfect a hater of Images, that he hath defaced Gods in his owne Countenance: If he deale with Men, it is when he takes them napping in an old Monument: Then downe goes Dust and Ashes. And the stoutest Cavalier is no better. O brave <hi>Oliver</hi>! Times voyder, Sub-sizer to the Wormes; in whom Death, that formerly devoured our Ancestors, now chewes the Cud: He said Grace once, as if he would have fallen aboard with the Marquesse of <hi>Newcastle:</hi> Nay, and the <hi>Diurnall</hi> gave you his Bill of Fare; But it prov'd but a Running Banquet, as appeares by the Story. Beleeve him as he whistles to his <hi>Cambridge Teeme</hi> of Committee-men; and he doth Wonders. But Holy men (like the <hi>Holy language)</hi> must be read backwards. They rifle Colledges, to promote Learning; and pull downe Churches for Edification. But Sacriledge is entailed upon him: There must be a <hi>Cromwell</hi> for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedralls, as well as Abbyes: A secure sinner, whose offence carries its Pardon in its Mouth: For how can he be hang'd for Church rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, which gives it selfe the Benefit of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>But for all <hi>Cromwells</hi> Nose weares the Dominicall Letter, yet compared with <hi>Manchester,</hi> he is but like the <hi>Vigils</hi> to an Holy-day. This, this is the man of God; so sanctified a Thunder-bolt, that <hi>Burrowes</hi> in a proportionable blasphemy to his <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> would stile him the <hi>Archangell,</hi> giving Battell to the Devill.</p>
            <p>Indeed as the Angells, each of them makes a severall <hi>Species;</hi> so every one of his Souldiers is a distinct Church.

            <p>They agree in nothing, but that they are all <hi>Adamites</hi> in Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: It is the signe of a Coward, to <hi>winke</hi> and <hi>Fight;</hi> yet all their Valour proceedes from their <hi>Ignorance.</hi>

            <p>But I wonder whence their Generalls Purity proceedes; it is not by <hi>Traduction:</hi> if he was begotten Saint, it was by Equivocall Generation: for the Devill in the Father, is turn'd Monke in the Sonne; so his godlinesse is of the same Parentage with good Lawes; both extracted out of bad Manners; and would he alter the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as he hath attempted the Creed, he might vary the Text; and say to Corruption, Thou art my <hi>Father.</hi>

            <p>This is he, that hath put out one of the Kingdomes eyes, by

clouding our Mother-Vniversity, and (if the Scotch-mist further prevaile) will extinguish this other: He hath the like quarrell to both; because both are strung with the same <hi>Optick Nerve, knowing Loyalty.</hi> Barbarous Rebell! who will be reveng'd upon all Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, because his Treason is beyond the Mercy of the Book.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Diurnall</hi> as yet hath not talk't much of his Victories; but there is the more behind: For the Knight must alwayes beat the Gyant; That's resolv'd. If any thing fall out amisse, which cannot be smothered, the <hi>Diurnall</hi> hath a help at Mawe; It is but putting to Sea, and taking a <hi>Danish Fleet;</hi> or Brewing it with some successe out of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and it goes downe merrily.</p>
            <p>There are more Puppets, that move by the Wyre of a <hi>Diurnall;</hi> as <hi>Brereton</hi> and <hi>Gell;</hi> two of <hi>Mars</hi> his Petty-toes; such sniveling Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, that it is a favour to call them so, was <hi>Brereton</hi> to fight with his Teeth as in all other things he resembles the Beast, he would have odds of any man at the weapon; O he's a terrible slaughterman at a Thankesgiving Dinner, had he been a <hi>Canniball</hi> to have eaten those that he vanquish'd, his gut would have made him Valiant.</p>
            <p>The greatest wonder is at <hi>Fairfax;</hi> how he comes to be a Babe of Grace? Certainly it is not in his personall, but (as the <hi>State Sophies</hi> distinguish) in his Politique Capacity; regenerated <hi>ab ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> by the zeale of the House he fare in; as Chickens are hatcht at <hi>Grand Cair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is the <hi>Wood-Monger</hi> too, a feeble crutch to a declining Cause; a new Branch of the old <hi>Oake</hi> of <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I speake of Reformation, <hi>vous avez Fox,</hi> the Tinker; the liveliest Embleme of it that may be; For what did this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ever goe about to reforme, but Tinker-wise; in mending one Hole, they made three.</p>
