            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And I will turn your <hi>Feaſts</hi> into <hi>Mourning,</hi>
and all your <hi>Songs</hi> into <hi>Lamentation;</hi> I will bring
up <hi>Sack-cloth</hi> upon all Loyns, and <hi>Baldneſs</hi> upon every

To whom ſhall I ſpeak and give Warning, that

               <head>A Lamentation over England, and the
Dominions thereunto belonging.</head>
               <p>OH <hi>England! England!</hi> the Land of my Nativity, for
whom my Soul hath often mourned, and at this time
mourns before the Lord, and my Spirit is grieved
within me, to behold ſo much <hi>Wickedneſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, Oppreſſion,</hi>
and <hi>Abomination</hi> as at this day abounds in thee! A Nation to
whom God Almighty hath ſignally appeared, and been at work
in by his mighty Arm and divine Power; and the proffers of
Love and Mercy from the God of Mercies have been to thee, and
the Lord hath long waited to be gracious and merciful to thee,
and hath extended one Viſitation after another unto thee, and
hath many a time ſought thy Inhabitants in tender yearning
Bowels of Love.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe Mercies, and tender Dealings
of the Lord with you the Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> how have you
continued in your Sins and Tranſgreſſions againſt the Lord, that
hath thus ſought your return to him, that he might have mercy
on you! And when Intreatings and yearning Bowels would not
draw nor prevail upon you (to reſtrain you from your evil courſes,
and to bring you to Amendment of Life) he hath threatned
Judgment, and alſo many times executed it upon thy Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
O <hi>England!</hi> and hath ſhewed his Diſpleaſure againſt you
many a time: But neither Mercy nor Judgment, Smiles nor
Threats have taken place among many of thy Rebellious and
Gain-ſaying Inhabitants. For though the Lord hath often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
and his Arm of everlaſting Mercies have been ſtretched
out to you, as it was to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of Old; and as they rebelled
againſt the Lord, who would have gathered them, even ſo have
you refuſed to hearken to him, and to <hi>Forſake the Evil of your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42634:3"/>
Wayes,</hi> and to turn to the Lord God, who would have ſaved
you from the Wrath and fierce Vengeance that is coming upon
the Rebellious.</p>
               <p>And though he hath pleaded with you in Judgment, and hath
manifeſted his Diſpleaſure and Wrath in the midſt of thy Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
(though alwayes mixed with Mercy) and ſhewed them
that he can do whatſoever he will; For who can withſtand him
in his great Power? ſeeing the Nations are but as the drop of a
Bucket before him, and as the ſmall Duſt in the Ballance; for
he hath overturned on one Hand, and overturned on the other
Hand, in the ſight of many of you who are yet alive;
and hath brought down the Mighty from their Seats (who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
themſelves againſt the Lord, and againſt the Innocent)
and hath exalted them of low degree; and when they did not
anſwer the End, for which the Lord God appeared on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
but rebelled againſt the living God, who had ſcattered
their Enemies before them, the Hand of the Lord alſo turned
againſt them, and confounded them, and broke and ſcattered
them, and hath blown them away with the Breath of his Mouth,
as the Chaff of the Summer-threſhing-Floor.</p>
               <p>And yet all theſe <hi>Revolutions</hi> and <hi>Overturnings,</hi> which the Lord
hath brought to paſs in the ſight of many of you the Inhabitants
of <hi>England,</hi> and his pleadings with you in Judgment, time after
time with <hi>Sword,</hi> with <hi>Peſtilence</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> and many other
dreadful Judgments, which have been both threatned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
in a dreadful manner; yet have not many of thy Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
bowed themſelves to the Lord, who hath thus appeared,
nor feared before this dreadful God, <hi>who will be revealed in flames
of Fire, taking Vengeance on the Rebellious and Gain-ſayers of the
Goſpel of his Son;</hi> but have grieved and provoked him by your
Wickedneſs and Ungodlineſs from day to day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when the Lord hath ſent his</hi> Servants <hi>and</hi> Meſſengers <hi>to
you, who have faithfully</hi> reproved Sin in the Gate, <hi>and where-ever
it appeared; and have cryed unto you,</hi> To break off from your Sins
and Tranſgreſſions by true Repentance and Godly Sorrow, for your
Sins, and to Amend your Lives and Converſations, and to turn to
God with all your Hearts, and to put away the Evil of your doings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42634:3"/>
from before the Eyes of the Lord, and to ceaſe to do Evil, and learn
to do Well; that ſo the Lord <hi>(according to his Promiſe)</hi> might
have blotted out your Sins, and remembred your Tranſgreſſions no
more, that Reſt and Peace with the everlaſting God might have been
known to your immortal Souls forever and ever.</p>
               <p>But all theſe Labours of Love, and yearning Bowels, with
which you have been ſought both by the Lord, and alſo by his
Servants (who have riſen early, and travelled with their Lives in
their Hands, &amp; have earneſtly deſired your turning to the Lord)
have been ſlighted, and ſet at nought by you: Neither have you
turned from the Evil of your wayes at all, but like <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of
Old, (whom the Lord would have gathered) have rejected the
Reproofs of the Spirit and Grace of God in your ſelves, and are
doing Deſpight to the Spirit of Grace, by which you ſhould
have been both ſanctified, and alſo ſealed to the Day of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and alſo rejecting the Inſtructions, Reproofs and Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which by the faithful Servants of the Lord have been ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in your Ears; Inſtead of hearkening thereunto, you have
evilly intreated them with <hi>Whipping, Stocking, Stoning, ſpoiling
of their Goods,</hi> to the Ruining of many Families, Impriſoning ſome
to Death, and Baniſhing others; with many other groſs and
horrid Abuſes, wherewith you have entreated the Servants of
the Lord, for no other Cauſe than for the exerciſe of their
Conſciences towards God, and reproving you for your Sins, and
crying to you for Amendment of Life; which beſpeaks you to
be a People that hate Righteouſneſs, and love Iniquity, chuſing
your own Vanities, and ſlighting the Tender Mercies of the
Lord God, treaſuring up to your ſelves Wrath againſt the Day
of Wrath; and ſo are bringing ſwift Deſtruction and Miſery
upon your ſelves. Oh! My Soul mourns in the ſight and ſence
of that <hi>dreadful Day</hi> which is coming upon you, for your Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
and Rebellion againſt the living God, and for your
thus abuſing and ſhamefully entreating them, who have been
ſent unto you by the Lord, who ſought nothing but the good
and everlaſting Peace of your immortal Souls.</p>
               <p>But none of theſe things have prevailed upon many of thy
Inhabitants, O <hi>England!</hi> to ſoften your hard Hearts, and to
tender them before the Lord. For inſtead of ceaſing from your
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42634:4"/>
Sins and Abominations (which abound amongſt many of you)
by true Repentance and Amendment of your Lives and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
and turning to the Lord, who hath cryed to you many a
time, ſaying, <hi>Turn you, turn you, why will you dye?</hi> (as he did
to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old) but you have ſtopped your Ears as they did,
who were compared to the <hi>deaf Adder that would not hear the
Voice of the Charmer, charming never ſo wiſely;</hi> and ſo continuing
ſtill in your Abominations (which the Lord would have gathered
you from, had you obey'd his Voice) manifold Sins and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
encreaſe amongſt you, as <hi>Swearing, Curſing, Damning,
Revelling, Drunkenneſs, Whoredoms</hi> and <hi>Murders,</hi> with many
other groſs and ſhameful Impieties; yea, almoſt all manner of
Wickedneſs, Rebellion and Treachery, both againſt God and
Man, abounds amongſt many of you the Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi>
for which God will bring Judgment &amp; Sorrow upon you, yea, ſuch
Sorrow as ſhall never have an end, except you ſpeedily Repent.</p>
               <p>And thoſe that can act theſe horrid Wickedneſſes and crying
Sins (which indeed make the Land Mourn) without fear or
ſhame, as if they did not conſider that there is a God, who will
puniſh for them, are they not moſt eſteemed and ſet up amongſt
many of you now a days? and ſo that is ſeen to increaſe amongſt
many of you the Inhabitants of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> (to the grief and
ſorrow of the hearts of many) which the Prophet ſaw, and
concerning which he cryed out of old, ſaying, <hi>The Proud are
counted Happy, yea, they that work Wickedneſs are even ſet up, and
they that tempt God are even delivered,</hi> Mal. 3. 15.</p>
               <p>But let all ſuch know, who are guilty of theſe Evils, your
everlaſting Thraldom and eternal Miſery is coming on, and
will overtake you, (if ye ſpeedily Repent not) out of which
you ſhall never be delivered.</p>
               <p>And ſuch as cannot run with the Multitude into thoſe Evils
and Abominations which provoke the Lord God of Heaven
and Earth to Anger, but live in the fear of God, and a Life
becoming <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as knowing they muſt give an Account
(and ſo muſt all the Sons and Daughters of men) to God the
Judge of all, both quick and dead, and muſt receive a Reward
at his hand, according to their Doings, whether they be good
or evil, and ſo cannot ruſh into Iniquity with them, as the Horſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42634:4"/>
ruſheth into Battel, are become a Prey to the Ungodly, and as
objects of Scorn and Deriſion, on whom the Wicked and the
Ungodly execute their Cruelty and grievous Oppreſſion; yea,
Godlineſs and Piety is ſo little regarded amongſt many who
profeſs <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that a ſober Life and a godly Converſation
is become a Deriſion; its Crime enough now a days among
many, for a man to have a civil Carriage and a ſober Behaviour
(and to walk as one who fears the Lord) to be ſcoffed at and
vilified with reproachful Names, as he paſſeth through Town or
City.</p>
               <p>So that Wickedneſs and Debauchery, Looſeneſs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanneſs
is encouraged and abounds, Virtue and Sobriety are
diſcouraged and decryed among many of you the Inhabitants of
<hi>ENGLAND.</hi> For we ſee many of you are living and ſpending
your days here in this World, in thoſe things which are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Chriſtianity, Purity and Holineſs (without which none
ſhall ſee the Lord) as if there were no ſuch thing to be known or
minded by you: And all thoſe holy Admonitions in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Truth, and the threatnings of Puniſhment and eternal
Sorrow to the Wicked and Ungodly, which the Scriptures are
full of (if timely Repentance be not known) are ſlighted and
diſregarded by you, as if they ſhould never be fulfilled nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
upon you.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the Practices that have been and yet are found
amongſt you, encouraged and upheld by you to this day, againſt
an innocent and harmleſs People, whom God Almighty hath
gathered and choſen out of the World, the Ways and Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof, to be a peculiar People to himſelf, zealous of good
Works, who have always ſought the good and peace of the
Nation, and the abounding of Juſtice and Equity therein, and
have often entreated the Lord, and ſupplicated God on your
behalf, <hi>That he would not break in upon you, the Inhabitants of</hi>
ENGLAND, <hi>by his fierce Wrath and ſore Diſpleaſure,</hi> leſt he
ſhould conſume you all at once, for your Sins and Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
againſt him, who hath tendred Salvation, but you refuſed it.</p>
               <p>And many have laboured faithfully among you, to turn you
from Darkneſs to the Light of Chriſt (which now ſhines, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be the Lord forever) and from Satans Power (by which you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42634:5"/>
have been, and yet are captivated and prevailed upon to work
Iniquity with greedineſs) to the Power of God, which would
have Redeemed out of that Slavery and Captivity, into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Liberty and Freedom of the Sons of God, had there been
Obedience and Subjection yielded to it.</p>
               <p>But this alſo hath been ſlighted and ſet at nought by many of
you: And thoſe who have thus laboured and travelled among
you for your good, you have rewarded with <hi>Stocking, Stoning</hi> and
<hi>Impriſonments,</hi> with many other groſs and horrid Abuſes, as <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
did of Old them that were ſent to her: And inſtead of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Chriſt, the true Light, that enlightens every man that cometh
into the World,</hi> John 19. You have made a ſcorn and a deriſion of
it, and have loved Darkneſs rather than the Light, (which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts
to you the Wickedneſs of your Evil Hearts, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations
that have lodged there) becauſe there Deeds are
Evil, <hi>John</hi> 3. 19, 20. And ſo have hated the bleſſed Light that
doth reprove for Sin, loving your Sins, for which you have been
reproved, better than the Light who hath reproved you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo have manifeſted your ſelves to be ſuch as the Apoſtle
ſpoke of,</hi> Lovers of your own Pleaſures, Proud, Blaſphemers, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to Parents, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthankful, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy, without natural Affection,
Truce-breakers, falſe Accuſers, Incontient, Fierce, Deſpiſers of thoſe
that are good, Treacherous, Heady, High-minded, lovers of Pleaſure
more than lovers of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>And in theſe Evils above-mentioned, you are ſatisfying your
own Hearts Luſts, living in all manner of Voluptuouſneſs, Pride,
vain Glory, and forgetfulneſs of God, and ſo are guilty of
thoſe Sins which <hi>Iſrael</hi> of Old were guilty of, <hi>who ſate down</hi>
(in forgetfulneſs of God) <hi>to Eat and to Drink, and roſe up to Play,</hi>
Exod. 32. 6.</p>
               <p>And this is the State of too many of you the Inhabitants of
<hi>England,</hi> both Prieſts and People, for which the Wrath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God is kindled againſt you, and his ſore Diſpleaſure is
nigh to break forth upon you, in which he will trample you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Feet, and appoint you your portion in the Lake of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
forever, if you Repent not, and that ſpeedily.</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>England! England!</hi> How many Warnings have thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
had? And how long hath the Lord ſtrove with you?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42634:5"/>
both by his Servants, and alſo by the many ſignal Tokens that
have appeared of his diſpleaſure amongſt you? Yet none of
thoſe things have prevailed upon you to turn from the Evil of
your wayes; but you have hardened your Hearts, and ſtiffened
your Necks in your Wickedneſs and Rebellion againſt God
(though he has long waited to be gracious to you) for which
God will bring everlaſting Miſery and Sorrow upon you, if ye
continue in theſe Evils which have abounded, and yet abound
among you.</p>
               <p>For although the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>Know you not that the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived,
neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
theſe Teſtimonies which are certainly true, and will
be fulfilled upon all the Ungodly: How many are living in theſe
very Evils! as <hi>Whoredoms, Drunkenneſs, Revilings,</hi> with many
other crying Sins, which are expreſly forbidden; yet you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in them, as if all thoſe Judgments and Torments threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Scriptures of Truth againſt the Wicked, were but
meer Fictions. And ſo you go on in your Wickedneſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs,
as if there were neither Puniſhment nor Torment to
the Wicked, and as if there were neither God nor Devil, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
nor Hell.</p>
               <p>But let all ſuch know, that the dreadful God of Heaven and
Earth, that rained Fire and Brimſtone upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi>
of Old, that puniſhed the Wicked in every Age, (who hath
promiſed, and will perform it) though the Wicked joyn Hand
in Hand, they ſhall not go unpuniſhed; but he will render the
Recompence and Reward of your own doings into your Boſoms;
and if you do not turn to him while he ſtrives with you, ye ſhall
feel the weight of his avenging Hand and Iron Rod, with
which he will daſh the Rebellious Nations to pieces like a
Potters Veſſel. And now my Soul deſires that you may turn
from your Evil Courſes, and no longer continue in your Exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
of mind and heart, and in your Wickedneſs and Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
leſt you be brought down and turned into Hell, with all
Nations that forget God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 17. to be tormented with the
Devil and his Angels forever and evermore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:42634:6"/>
For the Lord hath often waited to be gracious unto you, and
hath born with you, though you have greatly provoked him,
yet his Patience has laſted long; and he hath held forth a Hand
of love to many, who have taken no notice of it: But now his
Patience is almoſt worn out, and his long ſuffering well nigh
come to an End; yea, I am afraid its come to an end already
to many of you, the Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> and his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is kindled, and burns hot againſt you, who have refuſed to
hearken to him, who hath called you time after time, and is
nigh to break forth like a devouring Fire; and before him the
Wicked ſhall be as Hay, and as Stubble: whom God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
and will leave them neither Root nor Branch.</p>
               <p>For behold, the Cry of your Iniquities hath reached unto
Heaven, and your Sins have come up before the Lord, and into
remembrance with our God; and the Day wherein he will eaſe
him of his Adverſaries, and avenge him of his Enemies maketh
haſte, wherein he will pour out his Wrath, Indignation and
Judgment upon you, the Inhabitants of <hi>England</hi> (that continue
in your Gain-ſaying and Rebellion againſt God) without any
mixture of Mercy.</p>
               <p>Oh! you my native Country Men and People of <hi>England</hi> (in
general) for whom a travail is upon my Spirit at preſent, and
hath been many a time, that you might be prevailed upon (whoſe
Day of Mercy is not yet ended and over, whom the ſhadow of
Death and the Night is not yet wholly ſpread) to conſider your
latter end, before it be too late; and to turn from your Sins and
Tranſgreſſions, your Haughtineſs, Pride and vain Glory, and your
abuſing your ſelves with thoſe things which God hath extended
as Mercies unto you, <hi>viz.</hi> your waſting, abuſing and ſpending
the good Creatures of God to ſatisfie your Luſts, which hath
highly diſpleaſed the Lord, and provoked him to Anger.</p>
               <p>And that you may all come to learn that bleſſed Leſſon, which
the holy men of Old learned, who were taught by the Grace and
Spirit of God, <hi>(a meaſure whereof is given to every man to profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 7.) which was, <hi>That denying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, and worldly
Luſts, they might live Soberly, Righteouſly and Godlily in the preſent
evil World,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. Which all that ever come to inherit
Reſt and Peace with God, and to have a habitation in his holy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42634:6"/>
Kingdom of everlaſting Joy, muſt be found living in, and to
cry to God in a ſence of your Miſerable ſtate and Deplorable
Condition, while the Ear of his tender Mercy is open to hear
you, leſt ſuch a Day come upon and overtake you, as was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to a People of Old, <hi>wherein you may Cry, and the Lord will not
hear you;</hi> (becauſe you have not hearkened to him, when he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
<hi>you may Call, and he will not Anſwer; but will laugh at your
Calamity, and mock when your Fear cometh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that this Day may never overtake you, to whom the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation
of God is yet continued, is the hearty Deſire and Prayer
of my Soul to God for you: Therefore turn to God with all your
Hearts, while his Arms of tender Mercy are open to receive you;
and triffle not away your precious time that yet remains, leſt by ſo
doing, you bring the ſentence of an eternal Excluſion upon your
ſelves from God, and the joy of his Kingdom forever and ever.</p>
               <p>And, Oh that a true Deſire were begotten in all your Hearts
and Minds, to come to that bleſſed Fountain of God's free Love,
which he hath opened for all who are willing to come to it, the
Virtue whereof purgeth the Souls of all that waſh in it, from
Sin and Uncleanneſs, and ſo ſprinkles the Conſcience from
death, and dead works, to ſerve the living God in newneſs and
purity of a Holy Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now, Oh that you all may be willing to take that good
Counſel, which was given by the Lord to a People of Old, when
he ſaid by the Mouth of his Prophet,</hi> Waſh you, make you clean,
put away from before me the Evil of your doings; ceaſe to do Evil,
and learn to do Well; ſeek Judgment, relieve the Oppreſſed, judge the
Fatherleſs, plead for the Widdow: Come now, let us reaſon together,
ſaith the Lord; though your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white
as Snow; though they be red as Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool: If
you be willing and obedient, you ſhall eat the good of the Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Iſa. 1. 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the precious Promiſes of God to all who are willing
to forſake the Evil of their doings, and to turn to him with all
their Hearts, who deſires not the death (or deſtruction) of any,
but rather that they may Repent, and live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And again, the good Counſel and Advice of the holy Apoſtle
ought to be minded and obſerved by you all, which is on this wiſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:42634:7"/>
Cleanſe your Hands ye Sinners, purifie your Hearts ye Double-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
be Afflicted, and Mourn, and Weep; Let your Laughter be
turned into Mourning, and your Joy into Heavineſs: Humble your
ſelves in the ſight of the Lord, and he ſhall lift you up, <hi>James</hi> 4. 8,
9, 10.</p>
               <p>And unleſs you thus humble your ſelves under the mighty
Hand of God, and turn to the Lord, and forſake your ſinful
Wayes and evil Courſes, and wait to know a being waſhed in
the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt (which cleanſeth from all Sin) that
is the Fountain of God's free and great Love opened unto all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
you can never come to have a place in the Reſt which
God hath prepared, nor in that Kingdom of eternal Glory,
which remains ſure to the Righteous forever.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord knows (who ſearches the Hearts, and tryeth
the Reigns of all, from whoſe all-ſeeing Eye nothing can be hid)
that I labour for, and ſeek nothing more, than your turning to
the Lord with broken, tender and penitent Hearts, that you
may find Mercy with God to your immortal Souls; and that
while you have dayes here in this world, you may ſo live in his
Fear, Wiſdom and Counſel, as that when-ever your latter
end cometh, and Death looks you in the Face, and ſummons
you before the righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth, you may
lay down your Heads, and go to your Graves in Peace with God,
and in a full aſſurance of a Habitation in that Eternal Joy,
where no Sorrow nor Sighing ſhall ever come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe are the Deſires and earneſt Breathings of him, whoſe Soul hath

the Wickedneſs and Abominations which have abounded,
and yet do abound amongſt many unto this very day; and alſo hath
mourned, and been bowed before the Lord, in the ſight and ſence of

the Lord God of Heaven and Earth (in whom Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

World) becauſe you have not feared before his eternal Power
and Majeſty, by whom the Life, Breath and Beeing of all
Mankind, and every living Creature is continued, who can
take it away, and bring the higheſt and loftieſt of Mortal
Men to the Duſt (from whence they come) at his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

Concerns as you have undertaken; which if you had done,
ye would have encouraged Virtue and Righteouſneſs in all, and
puniſhed Vice and Wickedneſs, where-ever it appeared, and
have been a Terror to Evil-doers, and a Praiſe to them that
were found doing Well; and ſo would have eaſed the Oppreſſed,
by breaking the Bonds of Oppreſſion, and executed Juſtice and
Equity in the Earth, and thereby Truth and Holineſs, Purity
and Righteouſneſs would have been exalted among you; and
this would have brought Peace and laſting Satisfaction into
your own Hearts, and Joy and Tranquillity to the Nation in
general.</p>
               <p>But have not many of you done and acted to the contrary?
For inſtead of puniſhing Debauchery and Wickedneſs, viz.
<hi>Swearing, Curſing, Drunkenneſs, Whoredoms, Looſeneſs</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42634:8"/>
                  <hi>Prophanneſs</hi> in others, (which you ought to have done, and to

Judge of Heaven and Earth (who will not be byaſſed with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)

if there be a continuing in them.</p>
               <p>And many of you, by your bad Lives and Converſations,
(others having taken you for Examples) have you not

Such found in the Steps of thoſe againſt whom the Prophet of the

They truſt in Vanity, and ſpeak Lyes; They conceive Miſchief, and bring

The way of Peace they know not, and there is no Judgment in their

to the Ruin, Spoiling and expoſing many Families to Poverty,
which were capable of relieving and aſſiſting others? And are
not theſe Cruelties and Unrighteous Practices upheld and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued?
So that at this very day, many undergo great Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
Abuſes and cruel Uſages, for no other Cauſe that can
juſtly be laid to their Charge, than for keeping their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

               <p>And the Cry that hath run through many in this day, to

Cruelty, Spoiling of Goods and Impriſonments, with

which our innocent Sufferings for many years, and unto this very

Though alwayes without any Juſt cauſe given on our parts; for

What <hi>Diſturbance</hi> have we made to the <hi>Government?</hi>
Have we not always been an innocent, ſuffering People? Look

towards all men: And alſo, take a view of your dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings

of your doings, and ſee whether many of you are not found too
much in the ſteps of thoſe of old, whom the Prophet of the Lord
cryed out againſt, ſaying, <hi>Hear I pray you, O Heads of</hi> Jacob,
<hi>and ye Princes of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>Is it not for you to know
Judgment? who hate the good and love the evil, who pluck off their
skins from off them, and their fleſh from off their Bones: Who alſo eat
the fleſh of my People and flay their skins from off them, and they broak
their Bones and chop them in pieces as fleſh for the Caldron,</hi> Micah
3. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Judgment threatned, which was juſt upon them for
their Wickedneſs, Cruelty and Oppreſſion, which was inflicted on
his People by them without any bowels of mercy, was on this
wiſe;</hi> Then ſhall they Cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear them,—he

ill in their doings, verſ. 4. <hi>Again, the Prophet ſaith,</hi> But truly
I am full of Power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of Judgment, and
of Might, to declare unto <hi>Jacob</hi> his Tranſgreſſions, and to <hi>Iſrael</hi> his
ſins. Hear this, I pray you, ye Heads of the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and
ye Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that abhor Judgment, and pervert all
Equity, that build up <hi>Zion</hi> with Blood and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with Iniquity;
The Heads thereof judge for Reward, and the Prieſts teach for Hire,
&amp;c, yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay <hi>(as many are ſaying
now)</hi> is not the Lord amongſt us? No Evil can come upon us:
Therefore ſhall <hi>Zion</hi> for your ſakes be plowed as a Field, and <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
ſhall become heaps, and the mountain of the houſe as the high places
of the Forreſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>And as the Lord was angry with that Generation for thoſe
Evils that abounded amongſt them, even ſo is he angry with this
Nation, becauſe Iniquity and Tranſgreſſion abounds, and love
to Righteouſneſs, Equity and Juſtice (and to them that live there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in)
waxeth cold in many, who make a Profeſſion of God, and
Godlineſs. But behold! the Lord hath looked down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and hath beheld the Iniquities of many to be of a Scarlet
and Crimſon dye, and hath alſo beheld the great Oppreſſion of
his People, and the Groanings of the Oppreſſed hath entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Ears; And the Lord God is ariſen in his mighty Power to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42634:10"/>
plead the Cauſe of the afflicted, and will call all to an Account,
who are guilty, both for their Sins againſt him, and alſo for
their Oppreſſing of his innocent People, and will render a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of Reward into every ones boſom, according to their
doings.</p>
               <p>Therefore a <hi>WARNING</hi> is in my heart to you all, whoſe day
of Mercy is not yet ended; Forſake your evil Courſes, break
off from your Sins by true Repentance, and fear before the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
God of Heaven and Earth, before whoſe Bar of divine
Juſtice, you muſt all ſtand, and receive a Sentence from him the
true and equal Judge. And ceaſe from oppreſſing and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the People of the Lord, who ſeek nothing more than the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Glory of his great Name.</p>
               <p>And ſet up Judgment and Juſtice in the Earth, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
Truth and Righteouſneſs, and take the Rod of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from off the back of the Righteous, which hath lain heavy
upon them long; And puniſh <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Curſing, Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>Whoredom;</hi> all which abound to
the grief and ſorrow of many. You may hear it every day in
your Ears, and behold it with your Eyes, not only many in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
(who ſhould have been better examples) but alſo the
very Boys and Children in the Streets, their Mouths are full of
<hi>Curſing</hi> and <hi>Damning,</hi> which is dreadful to think off; its grown
ſo common, and ſo much incouraged by the bad examples of
many of thoſe that ſhould have been a terror to evil doers.</p>
               <p>Therefore puniſh theſe <hi>Wickedneſſes,</hi> which run down like
a flood, and indeavour to ſtop the Current of Iniquity, which at
this day encreaſes in a dreadful manner; And be good Examples
your ſelves in Holineſs of Life and Converſation; <hi>Or elſe God will
pour out Shame and everlaſting Contempt upon you, and will plead with
you in his firce Wrath, and in his ſore Diſpleaſure; and his Indignation
will break forth like devouring fire, and ye ſhall be</hi> (who are guilty
of thoſe Evils) <hi>like Hay and Stubble before him, who will conſume you
both Root and Branch, of you Repent not, and that ſpeedily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, Oh that you would fear before the living God, and
dread his holy Name, and ſeek the Lord while he may be found;
Call upon him while he is near; Leſt that day come upon you
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42634:10"/>
wherein you may ſeek him and he will not be found of you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you have rejected his Reproofs, and would have none of
his Counſel.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if a day yet remain to you, mind the Honour of
God, and the good of your own Souls; and the propagating of
<hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> more than your own <hi>Intereſt, Friendſhip</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
of men, or your <hi>Pride, Pomp</hi> and <hi>vain Glory,</hi> which God will
ſtain and blaſt by the breath of his mouth, and will blow it away
with the Whirlwind of his Wrath, like the Chaff of the Summer
threſhing floor forever.</p>
               <p>But that you may have a habitation in the Kingdom of eternal
Glory, which God hath prepared as a dwelling place for the
Righteous, is the deſire of my Soul.</p>

Shepherds, and to feed them (as you pretend) with Spiritual Food.</p>
               <p>The Controverſie of the great God of Heaven and Earth is
with you, and the day wherein he will plead with you in his ſore
Diſpleaſure, makes haſte upon you, becauſe you have neither
fed the People with the Food you pretended, nor taken ſuch
care of their Souls, as to have led and guided them in the way
of Truth and Righteouſneſs, as you ought to have done: For
have you not made the People to err by your Lyes, and by your
Lightneſs? For according to what ye have taken upon you,
ye ſhould have been good Examples to all, in Holineſs, in
Purity of Life and Converſation. You have been Examples
to the People, I grant; but in what? Hath it not been (with
many of you) in <hi>Pride, Lightneſs, Prophaneneſs, Covetouſneſs,
Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Debauchery, as Drunkenneſs, Curſing, Swearing</hi>

theſe Abominations abound amongſt many of you (upheld

And ſo inſtead of leading People in the Way of the Lord,
(which is a <hi>pure Way</hi> ſorever) and into Righteouſneſs and
Holineſs (without which none can ſee the Lord) have you
not been Inſtrumental (in the hand of the Enemy of all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs)

and of his holy Spirit and Grace (which was the Teacher and

               <p>
                  <hi>And are you not (with many of your Hearers) in the
ſteps of thoſe the Prophet of the Lord cryed out againſt?
ſaying,</hi> A wonderful and a hurrible thing is committed in the
Land, the Prophets thereof prophecy falſly, and the Prieſts bear Rule
by their Means, and my People love to have it ſo; And what will you
do in the end thereof? <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 30, 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, another Prophet cryeth out in theſe Words;</hi> Thus ſaith
the Lord God, Wo unto the falſe Prophets that follow their own Spirit,
and have ſeen nothing. Oh <hi>Iſrael!</hi> thy Prophets are like the Foxes in
the Deſart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They have ſeen Vanity, and Lying Divination, ſaying,
The Lord ſaith, and the Lord hath not ſent them; and they have
made others to hope that they would confirm the Word: Have you
not ſeen a vain Viſion? And have you not ſpoken a Lying Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination?
Whereas you ſay, The Lord ſaith it; Albeit I have not
ſpoken: Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, Becauſe you have ſpoken
Vanity, and ſeen Lyes; therefore behold I am againſt you, ſaith
the Lord God, and my Hand ſhall be upon the Prophets that ſee
Vanity, and divine Lyes; They ſhall not be in the Aſſembly of my

built up a Wall, and lo, others daubed it with untempered Morter,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, the Lord cryed out by his Prophet, ſaying,</hi> Son of
man, prophecy againſt the Prophets of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> prophecy, and ſay
unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord God unto the Shepherds, Wo be
to the Shepherds of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that do feed themſelves; Should not the
Shepherds feed the Flock? Ye eat the Eat, and ye clothe you with
the Wool; ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the Flock: The
diſeaſed have ye not ſtrengthened, neither have ye healed that which
was ſick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither
have you brought again that which was driven away, neitheir have
ye ſought that which was loſt; but with Force and with Cruelty have
ye ruled them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore, O ye Shepherds, hear the Word of
the Lord; thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold I am againſt the
Shepherds, and will require the Flock at their Hands, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.
2, 3, 4, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, the Lord cryeth out on this wife by another of his
Prophets;</hi> For from the leaſt of them, even unto the greateſt of
them, every one is given to Covetouſneſs; and from the Prophet,
even unto the Prieſt, every one dealeth falſly: They have healed
alſo the hurt of the Daughter of my People ſlightly, ſaying, Peace,
Peace, when there is no Peace. Were they aſhamed when they had
committed Abomination? Nay, they were not at all aſhamed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>
                  <hi>And again, another of the Prophets of the Lord cryed out
on this wiſe;</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord concerning the Prophets, that
make my People err, that bite with their Teeth, and cry Peace; and
he that putteth not into their Mouthes, they even prepare War againſt
him: Therefore Night ſhall be upon you, that you ſhall not have a
Viſion, and it ſhall be dark over you, that you ſhall not divine; and
the Sun ſhall go down over the Prophets, and the Day ſhall be dark
over them; then ſhall the Seers be aſhamed, and the Diviners

<hi>Mich.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7, 11.</p>
               <p>And are not you, the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
thereunto belonging, highly guilty of moſt, if not
all theſe great Evils and Abominations which the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of Old were guilty of, for which the true Prophets cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out againſt them? For have you not run, when the Lord
never ſent you? Though moſt of you have not run very far,
it hath but been to augment your Wages, and to get fater Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices:
So we find that filthy Lucre has been your greateſt
inducement in your Runnings; for it hath been for that many
of you have run from one place to another, and have taken
upon you to ſpeak in the Name of the Lord, though he
never gave you Commiſſion ſo to do; and therefore you have
not profited the People at all: For notwithſtanding all your
Preaching to the People, how does Iniquity abound, and
Tranſgreſſion encreaſe amongſt them? Don't you hear with
your Ears the horrible Crys, Oaths, and dreadful Curſings
and Damnings, which make the Land mourn? Don't you
ſee with your Eyes the Prophaneneſs, Drunkenneſs, Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and almoſt all manner of Wickedneſs and Debauchery
which encreaſeth amongſt many of your Hearers? And are
not many of you your ſelves (who ſhould be Examples of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things) living and taking Pleaſure therein? Yea, I am
ſure many who live near the Fountains, from whence you
ſpring, and where you learn your Arts and Sciences, have too
much cauſe to affirm it to your ſhame, who daily hear and ſee to
their great grief and ſorrow of Heart, that almoſt all manner of
Ungodlineſs, Debauchery and Uncleanneſs abounds amongſt
many of you in theſe places; and not only in theſe places,
but alſo in many other places where you come; Let but People
obſerve your Lives and Converſations, and ſee whether many
of you, who pretend to be Leaders and Teachers of others,
(but let all People conſider whither ſuch can lead them; its but
into the broad way, the end whereof is eternal Miſery:
Therefore let all People leave off following thoſe Leaders, who
are ſuch bad Examples to their Followers) are not highly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42634:13"/>
guilty of the before-mentioned Abominations; and ſo are
not Examples of Righteouſneſs and Purity, but of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Prophaneneſs to your Hearers; for which the Anger
of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth is kindled, and nigh
to break ſorth upon you like a devouring Fire; and if you
Repent not ſpeedily, will conſume you Root and Branch.</p>
               <p>And are you not bearing Rule by your Means, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to make the People love to have it ſo? and by Force
and Cruelty, oppreſſing and perſecuting thoſe, who cannot
for Conſcience ſake own you to be the true Miniſters of Chriſt,
nor put into your Mouthes, like thoſe the true Prophets of the
Lord cryed out againſt? Read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>And are you not ſeeking your Gain from your Quarters,
and minding the Fleece more than the Flock? And don't
you Preach for Hire, and Divine for Money? Yea; Are you
not ſelling both your Sermons and your Prayers for Money?
And ſo are doing contrary to the command of Chriſt to his
Miniſters and Meſſengers, when he ſent them forth (as Lambs
among Wolves) to preach the Goſpel of Glad-tidings to the
People, who ſaid, <hi>Freely you have received, freely give.</hi> Let
your Doings teſtifie againſt you, that you are not in the ſteps
of the Diſciples of Chriſt, but are in the ſteps of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
(or worſe than he) who would have bought the Gift of God
for Money: But you ſell your own Divinations (under a
pretence of the Gift of God) for Money: And if his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
was condemnable, how can yours be juſtifiable?
So that which was ſaid to him by the holy Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> may
juſtly be ſaid to you; <hi>You have neither Part nor Lot in this matter;
for your Hearts are not right in the ſight of God; and you are ſeen
to be in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and Bond of Iniquity.</hi> Neither
do we yet find or underſtand, that you have yet repented of
your Wickedneſs (ſo much as he did of his) for inſtead of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,
are you not going on and endeavouring to obtain your
Covetous Ends, and are giving Flattering Titles to many, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
mens Perſons in Admiration for your own advantage &amp; ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends,
and are crying Peace to many, in ſuch a State and Condition
as the Lord never ſpoke Peace to any in? And ſo are manifeſt to
be like thoſe that cry <hi>Peace, Peace, when ſuddain Deſtruction and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42634:13"/>
is at hand.</hi> And you have fed your ſelves with the Fat, and
clothed your ſelves with the Wool, and have preyed upon the
People; and by your Oppreſſion and Cruelty have ſcattered the
Flock, inſtead of gathering them, or turning them to God,
who is become the Shepherd and Teacher of his People himſelf,
according to his Promiſe of old, <hi>That he would gather his Sheep
from the Mouthes of thoſe Shepherds that made a Prey upon them:</hi>
Which Promiſe many have witneſſed to be fulfilled in this our
day, bleſſed be his Name forever.</p>
               <p>And are you not biting with your Teeth (like the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of old) and crying <hi>Peace</hi> to them that put into your
Mouthes (though never ſo Unchriſtian-like in their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
But they that cannot for Conſcience-ſake put into your
Mouthes, to maintain your Pride, High-mindedneſs and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
have you not, and yet are <hi>preparing War againſt them?</hi>
Let the great Spoil and Havock you have made of many ſober
and conſcientious Peoples Goods bear witneſs againſt you:
And the many Priſons in <hi>England</hi> and elſe-where, in which you
have impriſoned ſome unto Death, and many others to the
Ruining of them and their Families, becauſe they could not for
Conſcience ſake pay you your Unjuſt and Unchriſtian Demands,
as <hi>Tythes,</hi> and many other things, which never were demanded
nor paid in the primitive Chriſtian Times, as Goſpel-Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
(neither is there any ground in the Scriptures for them to
be demanded) by the Miniſters of the Goſpel; and ſeeing they
were neither demanded nor paid by the Apoſtles or their
Succeſſors, while they kept in the primitive Purity; nor any
Preſcription given forth by the Apoſtles, that they (to wit,
Tythes) ſhould ever be paid or received by the Chriſtians in
future Ages: And alſo, ſeeing they were denyed and teſtified
againſt by ſeveral of the firſt Reformed Proteſtants, as <hi>Walter
Brute, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore, for you to demand them, and to caſt
men into Priſon for the Non-Payment of them, manifeſts you
to be ſuch as the holy Apoſtle cryed out againſt; <hi>Who beguile
unſtable Souls; an heart they have exerciſed with Covetous Practices;
Curſed Children, which have forſaken the Right Way, and are gone
aſtay, following the Way of</hi> Balaam, <hi>the Son of</hi> Boſor, <hi>who loved

               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:42634:14"/>
And theſe your Cruelties, Perſecutions and Oppreſſions
teſtifie to your faces (and to all People that are willing to ſee
you) that you are out of the Steps, Life and Spirit of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
and Miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus; neither have you any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
for theſe your Wicked Practices and Ungodly Lives,
neither from the Prieſts under the Law, nor from the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Chriſt and Preachers of the holy Goſpel in the primitive
Times, and in ſeveral Ages ſince the Apoſtles dayes, but from
<hi>Balaam,</hi> falſe Prophets, falſe Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch as the Prophets
of the Lord teſtified againſt.</p>
               <p>And all theſe your Practices of Oppreſſion, Cruelty and
Perſecution, and your Unholy Lives and Converſations are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Evidence and Ground for us, (had we no more) not to
believe that you are the Miniſters and Meſſengers of Chriſt, but
of Antichriſt; for we don't read that ever the true Miniſters of
Chriſt did oppreſs or perſecute others, or leave any Preſident
for any ſuch Practice, but the contrary; for it was many times
their Lots to be perſecuted, ſhamefully abuſed, and caſt into
Priſon by others, both in the primitive Times, and in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and almoſt in every Age until this very day: And ſo
the words of the Apoſtle have been and yet are fulfilled (to wit)
<hi>Yea, and all that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer Perſecution,</hi>
2 Tim. 3. 12. And it was the Portion (that Chriſt our Lord
ſaid, that ſuch who lived in and followed him ſhould meet withal,
viz. <hi>That they ſhould be hated of all Nations for his Names ſake:</hi>
And that <hi>they ſhould hale them before Rulers and their Councils;</hi>
And that <hi>they ſhould caſt them into Priſon, and Kill them.</hi> He did
not ſay, The Believers ſhould caſt their Enemies into Priſon and
perſecute them; but commanded, <hi>To love their Enemies, and to
pray for them that deſpightfully uſed them, and perſecuted them,
that they might be the Children of their Father in Heaven, who ſends
the Rain on the juſt and unjuſt, &amp;c.</hi> But you have been ſo far from
obeying Chriſt's command, to love your Enemies, that you have,
and yet are doing deſpight to thoſe that never did you any harm,
but have ſought, and yet are ſeeking your Everlaſting Peace and
Well-beeing, both of Soul and Body. So that Perſecution and
Cruelty is not a Mark of true Believers, that obey Chriſt, neither
of his Meſſengers and Miniſters, whom he ſends forth to preach
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42634:14"/>
the Everlaſting Goſpel, but a Mark of the Whore, falſe Prophets
and Antichriſt. Notwithſtanding all their fair Pretences for
Chriſt, yet they have been perſecuting the Saints, and drinking
the Blood of the Martyrs and Servants of Chriſt, <hi>For which
the Anger of the Lord is breaking forth, and he is ariſing in his Mighty
Power to plead the Cauſe of his Suffering People; and will give the
Whore Blood to drink, and the Cup of his Indignation and Fury</hi>
(which ſhe ſhall not eſcape) <hi>from his hand ſhall be her Portion, and
the Portion of all that joyn with her, except they Repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that you are in the ſame Steps, your own Practices, in
perſecuting and oppreſſing an innocent People, are Evidence and
Proof ſufficient againſt you. And therefore all you whoſe Day
of Mercy is not yet over, and are guilty of theſe things, Repent
of, and ceaſe from theſe your Wicked and Unchriſtian-like
Practices of Cruelty, Oppreſſion and Perſecution, and alſo from
your Wicked, Unclean Lives and Converſations, and humble
your ſelves under the Mighty Hand of God, ſubmit to &amp; lie under
his Righteous Judgments, and bear his Indignation and Wrath,
which is juſt upon you for your Nickedneſs, Cruelty and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
and for your Pride and Ungodlineſs, which abound
amongſt many of you; that thereby you may learn Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and to dread and fear before the living God, and to ſerve
him in Truth and Righteouſneſs, who over all is worthy to be
ſerved, honoured and obeyed forever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And mind the teachings of his holy Grace and Spirit</hi> (a meaſure
whereof is given to every man to profit withal,) <hi>which teacheth</hi> to deny
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, and worldly Luſts, and to live a Sober, a Righteous and

               <p>

Or elſe the Dreadful God of Heaven and Earth will pour out his
Fury like Fire upon you; and ye ſhall be as Hay and as Stubble before his
Fiery Indignation, which ſhall burn you up, and none ſhall be able to

               <p>Moreover, God Almighty, whoſe Righteous Soul has been
grieved by your Cruelty and Oppreſſion againſt his People, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42634:15"/>
whoſe holy Name has been and yet is diſhonoured by your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Lives, <hi>will pour out Shame and Everlaſting Contempt upon you;
and ye ſhall be like Chaff before the Breath of the Almighty, who will
drive you away like Smoak before the Wind, never to be found any
more: And your Names ſhall Rot in the Earth, and your Stink ſhall
come up.</hi> And as the Remembrance of the Wicked and falſe
Prophets are an evil Savour to this day, <hi>ſo ſhall the Remembrance
of you be to the Generations that are yet to come, if ye Repent not
ſpeedily.</hi>

               <p>But that you may all eſcape theſe Judgments of the Lord, and
Eternal Sorrows (which are prepared as a Portion for the
Wicked) in returning to the Lord by true Repentance and
Amendment of your Lives; and that you may find Mercy with
God to your Immortal Souls, both in this World, and in that
which is to come, is the Deſire of him who is concerned to give
forth this Teſtimony, as a Warning to all whoſe day is not yet
over.</p>
