            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Me thought this vvas but an vnfreendly vvelcome, considering before I thought that euery man beyond the Seas vvas as frank as an Emperour, and that a man might liue there a Gentlemans life, and doo nothing but vvalke at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but finding it not so: I vvished my self at home again, vvith sorovve to my sugred sops. But calling to minde that he vvhich fainteth at the first assault: vvould hardly indure to fight out the Battell: tooke Courage afresh, hoping my hap vvould proue better in the end, since it had such a bitter beginning, and so passed forvvard to Paris.</p>
            <p>Beeing there ariued, to recompenee my former mishaps: I found the vvorld vvell amended, for not only I obtayned nevv garments, but diuers Gentlemen to be my freends al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, some that had sustained as ill fortune as I, and therfore returned back againe into England, and other some that vvere very glad of my comming, in hope I had beene such a one as they looked for. But repelling such Sathanicall illusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons such golden proffers of preferment, to aduaunce me vn to my larger contentment: I gaue them the hearing of all their politique deuises, vvhich (as they thought) had taken deep root at their first planting. And considering that I had enterprised this iourney for my pleasure, and in hope to attaine to some knovvledge in the French tung, if that I should seeme to scripulous in their presence: it might turn to my farder harme. For there no freends I had to help me, no vvelth to maintaine me, no succour neere to saue me,
<pb facs="tcp:10600:3"/>
but if I denyed, my nevv freends vvould disdaine: persvvae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my self in their presence to doo as they bad me, but vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vvere absent: to doo then as pleasd me. By these mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes I obtayned their lavvfull fauoure, in so much, that they thorovvly prouided me for my iourney to Roome. VVhere for my more preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t likvvise, they deliuered me diuers let ters, to sundry persons (vvhose names I remit) that there I should be placed in the office of a Preest.

            <p>But vvhen vve had vvith an nights rest pondered of our iourney, and considered the emminent daungers before our eyes.

His Honnor perceiuing our imbi cilitie, and opening the Letters: found therin vvhere of I haue before certified your Honnor, vvhich vvhen he had vvoorthily ballanced in the brest of a second Solon sayd.</p>
            <p>My deere and faithfull Countrymen (as I hope you are) not so glad of your vvelfare, as sory for your ariuall, in that you hazard your selues on such a staylesse state, to become as freends to your enemyes, and foes to your Countrey, heere standing at the mercye of a rauening VVolfe, vvho not on ly vvould deuoure you from your Countrie: but bothe body and soule from Heauenly felicitie, Better therfore to abide the pouertie, of this your vvant and necessitie, then to sell your selues vvilfully into such perpetuall slauery, and not on ly to your great ignomy, but to your freends perpetuall infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to your Prince and famous Countrie, if you leaue your Captaine thus covvardly.

            <p>This excellent Discourse pronounced by so prudent a per sonage, me thought did demonstrate the excellencye of true nobilitie.
