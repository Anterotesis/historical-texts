            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (my good Lord) is the Sunne of my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, and I am this clowd covered with the rayes of your favours, which makes all the world admire in me, the greatnesse of your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity, and the excellencie of your goodnes.</p>
            <p>But herein (notwithstanding) consists not my satisfaction, but rather your honour and glory, and as I desire to publish that, so I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise desire to finde this; For I cannot live contented, if I made not a publique acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of those many favours, whereby you have perfectly purchased and made me yours, and this Confession consisteth in the oath of fidelity and obedience, which I have sworne to the honour of your service, and to testifie the the immortality of my vowes, wherein with all possible humility I present you my selfe, and this small Booke to your Honours feete; A worke proportionable to my weakenesse, but meerely disproportionable to your Greatnesse.</p>
            <p>If I am any way guilty herein, your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is the true cause thereof; in regard it makes me beleeve that you will rather excuse

            <p>For after a Coward hath once tasted of blood, he delights in no other spectacle.</p>

            <p>We reade words like unto these, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.36. <hi>Be yee mercifull, as your Father is mercifull:</hi> And againe after, <hi>forgive and it shall be forgiven unto you; give and it shall be given unto you:</hi> And <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4. <hi>Be mercifull to the Orphans, be unto them a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to their mothers a husband, and then yee shall be the obedient sonnes of the most high, who will yet more liberally distribute unto you his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:</hi> And <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. <hi>The soule that doth good, shall be exceedingly filled and replenished.</hi>

            <p>It is a principle flowing from our nature, that we must not doe to another what we would not have done to our selves, from which principle is derived that golden sentence of Christ. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.

            </p>
            <p>And first, let us heare the sacred voyce of the eternall Sonne of God, the Redeemer of our soules, saying in the first part of our Text, <hi>Blessed are the mercifull,</hi> as if he had said, O how great and altogether incomparable, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible are the favours, blessings, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces laid up for them that shall practise the works of mercie, they shall be Citizens of heaven, the Angels companions, and shall eternally enjoy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now that we may the better know the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of this word, <hi>Mercifull,</hi> which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, or conjoyned, we will fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The object of it, is, the miserie and affliction

of other, which makes her produce these graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pittifull effects, because shee is unable to behold the sore, without applying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</p>
            <p>God being one, cannot suffer any kinde of division, there be no qualities nor accidents in him, but all things are essentiall in him, the Scripture to represent him unto us, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe him all justice, and all mercie, so by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the fore-going maxime, wee cannot say, that mercie is one of his parts, seeing that being one, hee is indivisible; but wee will more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly say, that he is <hi>Mercie</hi> it selfe, and therefore the faithfull that shall bee mercifull, that shall practise the works of charity, of clemencie, and meekenesse, may undoubtedly beleeve that they are the sonnes of the most high, who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto them a ray or sparke of his insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite grace, and mercie, that so they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by resplend and shine with the same light with their heavenly Father, tread upon his steps, and be made like him as much as may be, <hi>Be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (saith Iesus Christ) as your heavenly Father is mercifull,</hi> Luke 6.36.</p>
            <p>Mercie, said an ancient Doctor, <hi>est fidei orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> it is the ornament of faith, for faith sheweth her selfe by her fruits, which are pious and charitable works, and as trees are never so faire to behold, as when they are loaden and covered with fruits; so faith never appeareth so glorious, as when she is adorned and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the sweet and delightfull fruites of

            <p>
               <hi>Salomon</hi> that wise King, counselleth us to make a carcanet of mercie, to put it about our necke, and that in this habit and ornament wee shall make the accesse of heaven free to our selves, finding grace before God, and men: and indeed it is one of the most pretious stones, and that is fit to beautifie and adorne the crowne of perfection it selfe.</p>
            <p>Wee will therefore compare it to the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall stone <hi>Irius,</hi> which represents the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours that appeare in the Raine-bowe, so the mercifull makes all sorts of graces and blessings to shine upon his forehead, and to appeare in his actions; this Oppall stone <hi>Irius</hi> is greene, red, and white, the greene colour represents unto us that Hope which we have to finde grace before the soveraigne Iudge of our soules and bodies; The red colour represents unto us the pure blood of Christ, shed upon the Crosse, to obtaine this grace for us, she also denoteth unto us the rednesse of our sinnes, according to the Prophets phrase, <hi>Though our sinnes were as red as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snowe, Isa.</hi> 1.18. and the white colour figureth unto us the divine

            <p>In this fable wee see a remarkable morall, which is, that it is a symbole of the Mercifull, who quickly and without delay takes pitie of the miserie of others, according to this axiome, no lesse common then true, <hi>Bis dat, qui cito dat,</hi> he giveth twice, that giveth speedily.

            <p>But that we may walke in the sacred pathes of the holy Scripture, let us compare <hi>Mercie</hi> to the Serpentine rod of <hi>Moses,</hi> that faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, for if this had done many miracles in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that hath done as many wonders in the world: If this was called the finger of God, that is an excellent vertue, that maketh us come neare to God; but contrarily if the rod hath turned the waters into blood, <hi>Mercie</hi> turneth the blood of wrath into the water of mildnesse, and mansuetude; If that hath caused darknesse, this bringeth light, if that wounds, this cures; In this they agree, that as the one divided the red Sea, to deliver the people from <hi>Pharaohs</hi> slavery, so the other maketh us passe the red waters of Gods divine justice, to shunne the devils seizing of us, and to come to the Sanctuarie of caelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all goodnesse, according to the sense of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mercie is compared to a tree, planted in the fruitfull ground of the hearts of the faithfull, that is watered by the wholesome waters of blessing and grace, which the holy Ghost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually distilleth thereon, and upon which the Sunne of righteousnesse continually shineth, that so at all times he may beare abundantly the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and delectable fruits of charity, compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and meekenesse.</p>

            <p>The third and last branch, is, to forgive our enemies, and cast away from us all desire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in the Chapter before cited, after hee had exhorted us to bee mercifull, as our heavenly Father is mercifull, divideth this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie into three kindes, as we have already shewed, saying, first,

            <p>Wee must then observe these maximes in judging the actions of others, that if they be manifestly good, wee praise and imitate them, that those that did them may be encouraged to continue, and that the wicked leaving their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wayes, may follow them, for examples move more then rules or precepts.</p>

            <p>It is a wonder to see and behold the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects, and workes of the Almighty, that which commonly makes those to abound in wealth, that bestowe largely upon the poore, like a good spring or fountaine, which the more it is emptied, the more it overflowes in the excellencie of her waters; so the more the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is like a little piece of leaven among a great deale of dowe, which raiseth, and maketh it to encrease, and therefore the Wiseman exhorteth us, to give the first of our fruits to the poore, and that the rest will make our Barnes to overflow with plenty and abundance.</p>
            <p>The widdow of <hi>Sarephta,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. making a Cake for the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> with a little meale and some few drops of oyle, which onely were left unto her in that extreame famine, desiring rather to obey the Prophet, then to satisfie her owne hunger, and that of her owne sonne: but how can we produce this example without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring this her incomparable charity, to see the love of her selfe, the naturall affection shee bare to her deare, onely, and welbeloved child, give place to the pittie and compassion shee had a

unto the poore.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 11.41. <hi>Give almes of what you have, and behold all things shall be cleane unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because many seeke precautions, going about to practise the workes of charity, I will give my opinion upon this matter, that is, that we must not be like <hi>Martha,</hi> curious to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of so many things, but as Iesus Christ, before whom there is no regard of persons, but maketh his Sun equally to shine both on the just, and on the unjust, and maketh his raine to fall upon the good and bad, the Sunne shineth as well upon mud and dirt as upon Roses on the valleyes, as on the mountaines; the raine fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth as well upon the rocks and sands, as upon the good and fertile ground: so the mercifull wheresoever he seeth any calamity, he partaketh of it, and applieth the beft remedie to it that possibly he can.</p>
            <p>Intention is the levell and square wherewith all our actions are measured. It is the rule to measure them; the touchstone to know their value: Havens and Harbours receive as well the broken and torne pieces of a shipwrack, as a great and rich lading in a good vessell; the earth which is the mother and cradle of all mortall men, receiveth equally <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and <hi>Dives, Irus,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus, Diogenes,</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the mercifull must alwayes propose this object to himselfe, to obey Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in assisting the poore, and in comforting and consolating the afflicted, without searching
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2452:15"/>
further if he be worthy or not of your compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if it be his lazinesse, or his folly that have made him miserable; these things are not to be examined by you, it belongeth to God to judge of it, and to you to obey Gods holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
            <p>Iesus Christ being here on earth, exercised his charity on all those that asked it of him: He fed severall times great multitudes: Hee healed the sicke: He made the lame walke, the blinde see, and that at the first request, without further enquiring.</p>
            <p>Mercie is the banke and haven of miserie, if thou receive the unworthy, after thou shalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the worthy: <hi>Abraham</hi> making an Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall of his tent, received therein all Strangers indifferently that came to him; and in practising this courteous and bountifull hospitality, hee received Angels into his house: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 13. biddeth us forget not hospitality, for some have lodged Angels, not knowing it. <hi>When thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is hungry, give him to eate, and to him that asketh give,</hi> saith Christ.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Math Chap.</hi> 4. The devill seeing that Christ was hungry, asked him if hee were the Sonne of God: you likewise when you see the poore languishing and starving at your doores, succour him quickly, and aske him not if he be the child of God, if he be an honest man and worthy of your almes, because that Christ saith, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.41. <hi>He that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:2452:15"/>The good <hi>Tobias</hi> finding any ofhis brethren lying dead in the middest of the streetes, used to rise from his bed, and left his meales to come and burie him.</p>

            <p>From all these examples we must draw this wholesome doctrine, That there is no vertue that makes us so conformable and delightfull to our heavenly Father, as <hi>Mercie,</hi> and therefore that wee beare not wrongfully the title of the sonnes of God, let us extend our liberalities to the poore; Let us give them cheerefully, and without grudging or enquiring, the first and best of our almes deedes, let us not stay to bee troubled with their cries.</p>

that obtaineth of him all she asketh, shee setteth prisoners at liberty, recalls the banished, and implores and obtaines grace for the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; the hand of the poore is the purse of God, it is the Altar whereon wee leave our gifts, to goe and reconcile our selues to our eldest bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iesus Christ our Saviour, whom the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of our sinnes, did cruelly fixe and naile to the Crosse.</p>
            <p>Having sufficiently confidered the two first branches of mercie, let us now behold the third branch of this divine plant which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> hath perfectly taught us, saying, <gap reason="foreign">

And indeed this part of mercie doth greatly beautifie, and make glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious her body; for her two sisters, Pitie in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and Compassion in condoling, are actions which humanity cannot refuse, to the lamentable cries of the languishing, to the sad and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full objects of poore and miserable men, but must move your hearts were they of steele, and draw teares from your eyes, though they were of marble.</p>
            <p>But to forgive our enemies, is to vanquish and overcome our selues, it is a nearer approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the divine nature, then to the humane.</p>
            <p>All Histories are full of charitable actions of men towards their neighbours, and without taking them out of Scripture, the examples are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2452:17"/>
(thankes be to God) usually to be seene, but to forgive our enemies, not to annoy them when it is in our power, is to be enlightned by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred presence of the holy Ghost, to be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by his grace, to bee fully possessed of mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> (that great servant of God) who had beheld him face to face, that had seene him practise this rare and excellent vertue, towards the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> falling into Idolatry; Hee that had mediated for them, speaking to God after this manner: O Lord what will thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies say, that thou hast brought thy people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by a strong hand and stretched out arme, to kill them in the wildernesse, seeing that thou couldest not bring them into the land which thou diddest promise them, and himselfe notwithstanding is carried away by this passion of revenge, when hee made the earth open and swallow vp alive <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> with their families, though it bee not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they had participated in the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their heads; yea, he did not spare <hi>Mary</hi> his owne sister, whom he covered with lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Neither is it to the purpose to say that it was in Gods cause that hee used this revenge, that is vallable in putting <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> to death, because they had violated the divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; God forbid that I should excuse their fault, but I desire onely to shew, that though <hi>Moses</hi> were so holy a man, yet hee had some touch of humane weakenesse.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:2452:18"/>But in this circumstance what shall wee say of <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods owne heart, that so often curseth his enemies, that giveth charge to <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And the Apostles themselues having not beene well received in a certaine place, said to Christ, <hi>Wilt thou that we make fire fall from heauen, upon that Citie? but Iesus diverted and hindered them.</hi>

            <p>Wee produce all these examples not to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, but to shunne them, and thereby to make it appeare that wee must not revenge our selues when wee can doe it, but rather to doe good to our enemies, when they have done us hurt, is to make our selues perfect in this excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Mercy.

            </p>
            <p>The Apostles indeed suffered themselues to be carried away by this sweet desire and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of revenge, when they would make fire fall from heaven upon that Towne, that had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, but it was because they were fraile and weake men, like us when they fell i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This vertue cannot but be very pleasing to God, since he himselfe hath put it in practise, in appearing to <hi>Moses</hi> in a bush, which is a base and abject plant, despising the lofty Pine trees, and C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Angels also have practised it, when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left the heavens to appeare unto men, they have not taken the forme and majestie of Kings, to be respected of all, but rather the habit of Pilgrimes, and men of base quality, to teach us to shunne pride and vaine glory, and to shew us by their cloathes that we are Strangers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes in this world, that our houses are but

Now if it were god himselfe in the forme of three men, to represent the three persons of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity, or if they were Angels sent by him, is a question out of the subject of our Text; but because many Fathers of the Church are of the second opinion, we also will hold it, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 13.

            </p>
            <p>Vpon these words there is an objection to be resolved, why Christ saith here <hi>the pure in heart,</hi> seeing the Scripture in many places is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opposite to this justice, to this purity, to this cleanenesse, as we read <hi>Prou.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can say I have made my heart cleane, I am pure from my sinne?</hi> And in the first booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> the 8. Chap. <hi>There is no man that sinneth not.</hi> And in the 1. Epist. of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. Chap. <hi>If we say that we have no sinne, we deceive our selues, and the truth is not in us.</hi> And in the 25. Chap. of <hi>Iob, How can man be justified with God: or how can he be cleane that is borne of a woman?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although these places, and many more (that we purposely leave to avoyd prolixity) seeme to be opposite to our Text, notwithstanding we will reconcile them together.</p>
            <p>For when the Spirit of God calleth heere those that live justly and holily pure in heart, we must not understand it so, as if they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and absolutely cleane from the filthinesse of sinne: for in that sence the royall Prophet <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>There is none just, no not one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:2452:35"/>But we must understand here those that strive to walke in the sacred pathes of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, that live holily before God, and without reproach before men, that have beene purified, like gold tried seaven times in the fire, and that fire is the word of God, that enters and penetrates to the most secret thoughts, there to consume the wood and chaffe of our wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</p>
            <p>This cleansing and purification is clearely set forth unto us in the 15. Chap. of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in these words of Christ, <hi>Now ye are cleane through the word which I have spoken.</hi> And in the 13. Chap. ver. 10. of the same Gospell, <hi>Hee that is washed, needeth not save to wash his feete, but is cleane every whit: and ye are cleane, but not all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, the faithfull that live holily, may be called just, and pure in heart, <hi>Secundum quid, non-simpliciter,</hi> Iust in that degree of Iustice that may fall on man whilest he is here below figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against flesh and blood his domesticall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that often overcome him, and would quite keepe him downe if hee were not upheld and fortified by the spirit of grace, and by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Almighty hand of God that raiseth and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth him.</p>
            <p>The faithfull servant of the Lord is againe called pure in heart, because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee is such in part already, and that besides the great disposition that is in him to tend to his perfection, hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready here begins to tast the excellent sweetnes of that delicate fruit whereof he shall hereafter
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2452:35"/>
be fully and perfectly satisfied and satiated in Gods Paradise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blessed then are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee have another circumstance here very pregnant and remarkable, to wit, that Christ exhorteth us here to be pure in heart, and not of our head, or hands, because that the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t being the seate of the soule, sinne is most busie to viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and infect it with his foule and filty cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which it doth not in the other parts of the body, and therefore you see that God doth so strictly command us to keepe our hearts for his part and behoofe, saying, <hi>My sonne give mee thy heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to omit or let passe nothing worthy consideration like the inhabitants of <hi>Nilus,</hi> wee will draw water in running.</p>
            <p>We say then that this word heart, is diversly taken in the Scripture, First, it is taken for faith, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>For with the heart man beleeveth unto right<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And in this last signification it is taken in our Text, to wit, for the <hi>Conscience,</hi> as if Christ had said, <hi>Blessed are those that possesse a holy, pure, and just soule, a good, cleane, and spotlesse conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> desirous to raise himselfe from his fall, and to restore the temple of his body pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by wicked adultery, desired of God a new Altar, <hi>praying him to create in him a cleane heart, and to renew a right spirit within him. Psal.</hi> 51.12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudas Maccabeus</hi> having seene the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> prophaned by <hi>Antiochus</hi> his sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hands, he purifieth it, destroyes all the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars where that Pagan had sacrificed to his Idols, and called that the renewing of the Temple: Our bodies are the living temples of the holy Ghost, our hearts the Altars, on the which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wickedly sacrificed to the Idols of our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, we must breake them and destroy them, by our true repentance and conversion to God, <hi>who despiseth not a broken and a contrite heart:</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward we must build new ones pure and clean, on the which wee must offer to God Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombes of Iustice, and solemne burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings

and sacrifices wherein hee delighteth.</p>
            <p>The Etymologists hold, that this word <hi>Cor</hi> is derived of <hi>Cura,</hi> that is, care, because that part communicateth, sendeth, and doth distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute blood and life to the rest of the body: Even so all our study, all our exercise, and occupation should be to seeke the meanes fit for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of our soules: <hi>for what will it profit a man if hee gaine the whole world, and loose his soule. Math.</hi> 16.26.</p>
            <p>As soone as the Embrion is conceived, the first part which is formed in the heart, being as it were the center whence the severall lines are drawne to the circumference of our bodies, it is also the first member living, and when the paines of death have compassed a man, the blood from all parts retires to the heart, as to a citadell, so that it is also the last part that dieth in us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that common saying, <hi>Cor est primum vivens, &amp; ultimum moriens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So when the faithfull of the Lord resolveth to live piously, he must cast for a sure and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able foundation, the righteousnesse of a pure and cleane conscience, which must be the Ocean where all the rivers of hisaffections must runne and tend, the corner and fundamentall stone, on the which must be edified this his Pilgrimage: All the building of this mortall and transitorie life, must begin with the just mans beginning, and never end till his death, when it shall bee augmented and perfected in heaven.</p>
            <p>It was Gods commandement under the law,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2452:37"/>
that all Israelites, all the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> should offer and consecrate to him the first borne, both of man and beast; now if wee unvayle the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and consider what it therein figured unto us, we may note among other things, that God desired by this Decree, whose letter and figure is abrogated, though the truth and sence of it be eternall, that wee should offer and consecrate unto him our hearts, which are the first borne of our selues.</p>
            <p>The greatest part of Physitians hold, that the soule being generally all over the body, hath her principall seat in the heart, as the King hath in his Court, although his power reach tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all his Kingdome; so that the soule being that very man which God requireth, it is then not without reason, that God demandeth our heart, which is her throne: <hi>My sonne give me thy heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The heart is knowne to bee the originall of naturall heat; now God being a burning fire of love, and affection towards his children, wee ought to consecrate that part to him for his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.</p>
            <p>The heart is red and bloody, to shew us the fervencie and zeale that should be in us to Gods service and glory, and that our thoughts should alwayes burne with love to him, and with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to our neighbours.</p>
            <p>It is little; whence wee may learne not to puffe, or swell it with pride, but to keepe it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes humble and modest. Vertues that seeke

            </p>
            <p>The heart is agitated by a continuall motion, by reason of his vitall spirits, that animate and nourish it: So our thoughts should beare and conduct us to the actions of Iustice, innocencie, and godlinesse, and to follow the steps of the Scripture, Charity alwayes worketh, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver idle, by reason of the spirit of grace dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in our soules, who inspires continually in us holy and religious thoughts.</p>
            <p>There is but one heart in man, and yet his shape and forme is triangular, a figure bearing proportion to his object, that is God, one in Essence, and three in persons: So our soules should be adorned with these three beautiful vertues, Faith, hope and Charity.</p>

            <p>Our actions are of no value without the heart, but the heart may bee good without the actions; God had respect to <hi>Abel,</hi> and afterwards to his offering; the good Thiefe to obtaine mercy gave nothing but his heart; <hi>Marie Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene</hi> but her teares, and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> but sighes and lamentations, proceeding from the depth of his soule.</p>
            <p>Now that this heart may be pleasing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, it must be cleare, bright, and shining, to the end that as in a glasse God may see his owne image and likenesse after which he at the first created it, and when it is once cleane and pure, then right so, and in that manner, we must keepe it in the same glorious estate, for

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e holdeth, That soules delivered of this corporall vayle, cannot see Gods face, for two reasons; the first is, that God being a spirituall Essence, infinite, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e by a finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2452:41"/>
without implying contradiction, for then the containing, to wit, the blessed soule should bee greater then the contained, that is, God, which is absurd, by this axiome, that the object is contained by the visuall faculty: As if a man placed in the midst of the earth, or of the sea, looking round about a great distance off, as farre as his sight could reach, could not for all that say, That hee saw all the earth, or all the sea.</p>
            <p>Those of the second opinion answere to this first reason, saying, That the Creator may not be compared with the creatures, that God is all in all, and all, and whole in every part, that hee is one, and consequently indivisible; that all things in him are Essentiall, and is not subject to division, that whosoever seeth him, seeth him totally.</p>
            <p>The second reason of the first, is, that wee measure our soules by our bodies, imagining that they shall have eyes, with the which they shall be able to discerne and distinguish the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent objects.</p>
            <p>To which the others answere, that indeede the soules in heaven shall have no corporall eyes like ours; but that notwithstanding God will give them a seeing faculty, by the which they shall perceive the present objects: 2. When these soules shall be rejoyned, and revnited to their bodies, God having purified them from all vncleanenesse, will make them like unto the glorious body of his Sonne Iesus Christ our
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2452:42"/>
Lord, who saith, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. <hi>That our bodies shall be as the Angels of God in heaven, who alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of God, Math.</hi> 18. that is, <hi>that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his presence, and that see him perfectly,</hi> in respect of themselues, as much as it pleased God to permit, but not perfectly in respect of God, as he that seeth the Sunne, may say, that hee seeth it perfectly, in respect of himselfe, if his faculty be good, and notwithstanding he ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>not see him as he is, because of the weakenesse of his eyes.</p>
            <p>The second opinion which is more generally received, holdeth, that this word <hi>See,</hi> is taken simply, and absolutely, for to <hi>Know,</hi> and those that hold it, say, That Iesus Christ in our Text promiseth to the pure in heart, a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the divine goodnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e; wherein consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fulnesse of our felicity, of our delights, and content, which they doe well proove by the 14. Chap. of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>If ye had knowne me, ye should have knowne my Father also, and from henceforth ye know him, and have seene him</hi>; where Christ sheweth to his Disciples, that they have seene his Father, because they have knowne him by so many miracles done before their eyes. And in the 17. Chap. of the same Gospell, <hi>This is life eternall, that they might know thee the onely true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent:</hi> where it plainely appeareth, that this word to <hi>know God,</hi> is as much as to possesse life eternall.</p>
            <p>And so from those two places joyned to our Text, this conclusion followeth, that, <hi>To see God, know God, and have ete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nall life, are the same thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:2452:42"/>As the Angels then see the face of God, even so shall we also see it, for that blessed sight is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for a recompence of our faith, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 1. Epist. 3. Chap. <hi>When he shall appeare we shall be like him, for we shall see him face to face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that we must imagine, that God hath any members, although it be said, that man is made in the image of God, for that is thus to be understood, that man hath beene created in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect justice, and innocencie, after the example of God.</p>
            <p>But by this face of God, we must vnderstand with the Scripture, the Church, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and namely Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his booke <hi>Decivit. Dei,</hi> the manifestation of his glory, and a perfect knowledge of his wonderfull mercie, which he will communicate unto vs.</p>
            <p>It is a hard question, and difficult to handle, Whether the Saints after the Resurr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction shall see God with their corporall eyes, after they be glorified; so <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>In my flesh shall I see God:</hi> there <hi>Iob</hi> prophesieth the Resurrection of his body: but hee doth not say, I will see him by my flesh; and if he had, it might have beene understood of Christ, that shall come at the last judgement in the sight of all; but his meaning was, that when hee should see God, hee should be in his flesh, though the wormes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had devoured it.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> is excellent upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, saying, We shall see God with our corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall glorified eyes, as we see the life of a man by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2452:43"/>
his living actions, not seeing life it selfe; so is it likely, that being enlightened by a heavenly and divine light, we shall be able to see the Creator of all things both in them, and himselfe, so doubtfully the learnedst speak of it.</p>
            <p>In the 5. Chap. of the 2. booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> we reade, that <hi>Elisha</hi> after that he had healed <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the Syrian, saw <hi>Gehazi</hi> his servant take Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents from him, although hee were beyond the common reach of the sight; and when <hi>Gehazi</hi> was returned, he said unto him, <hi>Went not my heart with thee, when the man turned againe from his Chare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to meet thee.</hi> Now if this Prophet hath bin able to see the actions of his servant, although absent from him, how much more shall our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified bodies see all, when God shall be all in all.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Elisha</hi> saw this action of his servant, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a speciall revelation from God, or by the sight of a spirituall imagination of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that shewed him the thing, after which manner he knew the most secret counsells of the King of <hi>Syria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We speake of these things, as blind men doe of colours, wee finde no certainty of them any where, the Fathers themselues speake so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely of them, they goe as softly on, in the handling of this question, as if they trod on thornes, they grope along, as if they went in the obscure darknes of the blackest night, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can you finde two agreeing together, and which is more strange, not one that is agreed with himselfe; and indeed how should a worme

of the earth, the dwelling of errours, the subject of ignorance, know or comprehend that great God, which is the fountaine of all knowledge, and the bottomlesse and shorelesse Ocean of wisedome, and prudence.</p>
            <p>It is true, that when our soules shall be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with that eternall happines, &amp; that they shal enjoy the divine vision, in which consisteth our chiefest felicity, we shall then see God as he is, but to conceive and comprehend the infinity of his being, it will be altogether impossible to us.</p>
            <p>Those that sayle in the maine Sea, which way soever they looke, finde no other object but the heaven, or the waves, their sight being too weake to penetrate to the bottome, or to view the shores; Even so shall we see God, and know him as farre as it shall please him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us, but so farre shall wee be from compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That Romane Emperour perspicuously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and deciphered the excellent power and effects of this feare, when he caried for his Motto and Devise, <hi>Oderint dum metuant,</hi> Let those hate me that will, so they feare me; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby what small account and esteeme hee made of the hatred, and how dearely he prised and respected the feare which hee would have given and borne to him.</p>
            <p>Morall Philosophers affirme and say, That Love and feare are two sister germanes, because the one is conjoyned to the other, and both

            <p>So he which is possessed with a perfect feare, to offend his God, or to lose his favour, he is linked and joyned to God with the Gordian knots of his love, which are then wholly made indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and inseparable; and the Love of God conjoyned with the feare of man, cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="1">1.

            </p>
            <p>Which is to say: The first feare apprehends torments; The second, the privation of glory; and the third wholly possesseth our hearts and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The servile feare is attributed to the wicked.</p>
            <p>The filiall, to the good, I meane to those who are the children of God.</p>
            <p>The Initiant (or intermixed) is proper as well to the good, as the bad, and also it is the most frequent and generall.</p>

            <p>The two noblest and most excellent offices, which the Angels, and blessed soules enjoy above in the triumphant Church, are the vision of God, and the ordinary action of glorifying and honouring God, about the which they are eternally imployed, and therefore the holy Ghost to fashion and dispose us here belowe in the militant Church, to glorifie in time his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majestie in heaven, commandeth us in our text likewise, to <hi>Honour the King,</hi> as being the true Image and lively representation of that great King of glory, of the Father of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of the mighty God of Hoasts, <hi>Feare God,</hi>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2452:81"/>
that affection and charity which we owe to our neighbour, without comparison gives place to that extreame and infinite love which wee owe to our God, and heavenly Father; so the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we are to beare to all men in generall, is so much inferiour to that we owe the King, as his dignity is elevated above that of other men; and therefore you see, that as soone as our Apostle commandeth us to feare God, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Shewing by that order, that the honour and service due to the King, immediatly followes that which wee owe to God, and therefore a great servant of God of our times, expounding these words, saith after <hi>Tertullian,</hi> That in the performance of these two precepts, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian makes himselfe perfect, both for the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And in honouring the King, he observes his lawes, and by those meanes buildeth up for himselfe a delightfull rest, and an incomparable felicity.</p>
            <p>But because it is to undertake to sayle over a boundlesse and bottomlesse Ocean, if we should goe about to alledge here all the places which we might cite out of the Fathers, and many others; let us hearken to the holy Ghost, in the most common places of Scripture, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r, then tending to the service and glory of God, which is the onely centre, unto the which all the lines of our intentions immediatly tend and ayme.</p>
            <p>Wee very easily learne the definition, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of this word to <hi>Honour,</hi> in the 6. Chap of <hi>Esther,</hi> when <hi>Ahashuerosh</hi> asked <hi>Haman</hi> what should be done unto the man whom the King would honour; <hi>Haman</hi> thinking the King spake so for him, invented all the wayes and meanes hee could, to enjoy and encrease this honour; therefore he answered the King thus, As for the man whom the King will honour, let them bring for him royall apparell, which the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>seth to weare, and the horse that the King ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth upon, and that the crowne royall may be set upon his head, and that one of the greatest Princes should goe before him, and proclaime, <hi>Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the King will honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this ample description of <hi>Honour,</hi> we note the definition of it; to wit, to give glory, to doe homage to any one, to seeke all the meanes that may be to advance his credit, and encrease his reputation through all the world, and thus that cursed <hi>Haman</hi> thought to be honoured.</p>
            <p>But this word to <hi>Honour the King,</hi> in that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2452:82"/>
sense that our Apostle takes it, is like to that honour mentioned in the first Commandement of the second table, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy mother,</hi> which signifieth in generall, to serve, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, obey, assist those whom wee honour, and of that reverence, obedience, and assistance, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh expresly, 1. <hi>

and recompence, which those shall certainely receive that obey this commandement of God, in <hi>honouring the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Interpreters of the law of God, with one consent agree, that the first commandement of the second table, to wit, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> is to be understood of all them that have any power or dominion over us, and chiefely of Kings, and Princes, to whom wee are subject, and to whom wee owe both our lives and goods; and besides, that all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of that opinion, yet we also see it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the 13. Chap. to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> where the Apostle teaching the faithfull all the lawes which they must observe; hee runnes over all the Commandements of God, and yet speakes not of this word <hi>Father,</hi> because hee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth it sufficiently under that of <hi>King,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Father is King in his Family, and the King is the Father of his people.</p>

mountaine of <hi>Sinai</hi>; but the reason is, that by the word <hi>Father,</hi> God understandeth, as well Kings and Princes, as those that have begotten us; all the curses made against the rebellious, and disobedient to this commandement, are common both to the rebellious to their Prince, and to the disobedient to their Father; as on the contrary, those that are obedient to both, shall bee equally rewarded with the same bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and the promise made to them by God, who doe honour their parents, is also to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to those who honour their Kings, and Princes, which promise is happinesse, and length of dayes upon the land.</p>
            <p>Which promise (though it often seeme other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) is alwayes fulfilled, for when an obedient sonne to his father, or a faithfull subject to his Prince dieth young, and in the flower of his age, God neverthelesse accomplisheth his word, and fulfilleth truely his promise; for if it bee good for the faithfull to remaine in the land, GOD will make him abundantly to prosper therein; but if his admirable and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible providence, see that hee should be sundry wayes grievously afflicted, he of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not for our profit, bereaving us of this, hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth us into the incorruptible Kingdome of glory, more excellent without comparison then the first, and so whether hee let us dwell here belowe, or whether hee call us above to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, we shall alwayes be in a most happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if we obey his commandement, in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring the King.</hi>

            <p>All living creatures alwayes behold the earth, but God hath made and erected mans face, that he might behold the heaven, and the starres; even so must we consider the beauty of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in the Kings face and Majestie, as being the head thereof.</p>
            <p>As you see that all the senses both internall and externall are seated, and take their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the head; so all the counsells, all the resolutions, justice, the lawes, in a word, all that is necessary for the Kingdomes conservation, is all to be found in the <hi>King,</hi> as in his center, and in the place whence they take their beginning.</p>
            <p>Let us then examine particularly, since wee have a Royall subject in hand, all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, by which the King in comparison of his subjects, is just as the head is over the rest of the members, wherein reason holdeth her Assizes and Sessions, the better to governe this <hi>Microcosme,</hi> or little world.</p>

            <p>In a word, as all the parts of the body, and all the appetites of the soule, stirre according to the motion of the will; so the people should never have any other desire, thought or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the desire, thought, and designe of their King, who is the Lords anointed, sent by God to administer Iustice, and so governe his people in Equity, as the Psalmist speaketh. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 46.10.</p>

            <p>Words worthy of a great and profound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and which totally desides, and cuts off that question, which we now have in hand, for it is God himselfe that speaketh to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that strictly chargeth them to obey the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> into whose hands he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them; and although hee was an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and unfaithfull King, yet they will obey him, on paine of his curse and malediction; what judgements, what punishments should we much more cause to fall upon us, if the least thought of rebellion, or disobedience to the Lords anointed should enter into our mindes, if we were not perfectly obedient to Kings, who are good, faithfull, and zealous to further the glory of God, if our hearts and our mouthes be not alwayes filled with prayers, and vowes d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2452:92"/>
of the earth, who (say they) hath attained to the crowne by force, and by violence, words which we finde not in the Scripture; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily we read, <hi>Genes.</hi> 10.8. that <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sh</hi> begat <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> who began to be mighty in the earth, hee was a mighty Hunter before the Lord. These words will never oblige us to conclude, that hee hath raised himselfe violently; but wee may more truely expound the wordes, <hi>Hee was mighty before the Lord,</hi> that is, he was lifted up to greatnesse by the most High, hee walked in his wayes, and followed his ordinances; and when <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>that he began to be mighty in the earth,</hi> he meaneth, that hee was more feared then his predecessours, who were also Kings, Priests, and soveraigne Princes of their families: For after the generall deluge, which overflowed the whole earth, men lived commonly five or sixe hundred yeares, and so one of his posterity might see aboue a hundred thousand persons, over whom he was Prince, and soveraigne Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, because there was then no other forme of government in the earth; so we reade <hi>Genes.</hi> 23. Chap. that the Hittites, of whom <hi>Abraham</hi> asked a Sepulchre to bury <hi>Sara,</hi> these I say cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him a Prince of God, or a most excellent Prince, which hee clearely manifested at the overthrow of the five Kings, which had beaten the King of <hi>Sodome,</hi> had pillaged the Towne, and carried away his Nephew <hi>Lot</hi> prisoner, for at the rumour of these sorrowfull newes, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med three hundred and eighteene of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

borne in his house, and yet had no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>It is then in vaine to alledge, that violence, craft, and hereditary succession, are the onely meanes to attaine to Crownes; for although some attaine to it by humane meanes, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by dangerous wayes, as <hi>Absalom,</hi> who caused himselfe to be anointed King by expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Father, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> by the death of 70 of his brethren upon the same stone; yet for all these wayes to come to raigne, are never brought to passe, without a manifest fore-sight, and providence of God, permitting it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to punish those peoples, and sometimes for a punishment to the Kings that raigne over them; yet whatsoever they be, God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us to obey, and perfectly to honour them: now cursed, cursed be he that shall resist the will of God, and that shall not obey his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
            <p>After we haue heard both Scripture, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, manifestly evincing the truth, Let us now heare Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion in this matter, in his booke <hi>De civit. Dei.</hi> The cause (saith he) of the greatnesse of Empires, is neither casuall, nor fatall, it commeth neither by chance, nor by destinie; By chance I understand (saith he) the things that happen; we not being able to know the causes of them, or that happen without any premeditated order of reason, assisting their conception and birth: By fatall things I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand (as Pagans esteeme) what happeneth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2452:93"/>
the will of God, and men, by the necessity of some particular order; which opinion is greatly injurious to Gods divine providence, but rather wee must certainely beleeve, that Kingdomes are constituted, and established simply, and absolutely by the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.</p>
            <p>And in another place, Let us not attribute the power of giving, or disposing of an Empire, but onely to the true God, that giveth eternall happinesse in heaven to his children onely; but for earthly Kingdomes, he giveth them to good and bad, as it seemeth good to him, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him, who is delighted in no unjust thing; therefore this true and onely God, that alwayes provideth mankinde, both with ayde and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, when he would, and as long as he pleased, hath given the governement, and Empire to the people of <hi>Rome</hi>; hee is the giver of all felicity, that giveth earthly Kingdomes to whom hee pleaseth, and yet alwayes with justice and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, though the meanes seeme to us oftentimes manifestly contrary to both.</p>
            <p>I thinke we have employed too much time, and too many good weapons, to fight against this horrible monster, and monstrous Hydra, and therefore the shortest and surest way, is to follow the example of that valiant <hi>Hercules,</hi> and so to cut off this monster, for hee that will not heare the Scripture, so manifestly shewing unto us our duty to our Kings, that so expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to yeeld unto them all obedience,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2452:93"/>
hee that stoppeth his eares to those sweet and most gracious invitations of reason, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination, to honour and serue him, whom the bounty and will of GOD hath established over us; He who watcheth in labour, to make us sleepe in rest; Hee who sits on the throne to doe us right, that to ease us, beareth the burthen of all ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But wee, who by the grace of GOD are brought up in his Schoole, that together with our mothers milke have sucked the honour, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and obedience which wee owe to our Kings and Princes; Let us not suffer those wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and dangerous plagues, to infect the purity of our hearts, and let not the whitenesse of our soules be spotted and defiled, by so blacke and venomous a crime, assuring our selves, that the least thought of disobedience and rebellion, which possesseth the minde; besides, that it is an evident token of an ungodly minde, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the most severe punishments that can be imagined.</p>
            <p>But let us shew, that we are begotten among the children of GOD, and regenerated by the Spirit of his grace, let our ambition never flye higher then to the execution of his sacred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
