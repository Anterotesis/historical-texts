            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

be taken away. If all motion be taken away, there is nothing
in the world that can continue. 2 But otherſome hold, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

no where ſhew the diſſolution of the worlds ſubſtance. Alſo the
bodies of the Saints muſt be in a place: but what place ſhall they
haue, if they haue not a place in the worlde? Moreouer, man for
whoſe ſinne all woe came vpon the world, ſhall not vtterly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
but ſhall be renued in bodie, and inueſted with immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,

the bodie muſt be puniſhed with it. Therefore the bodie muſt riſe
againe. The Philoſophers doe denie the ſequence, and ſay that it
is enough that the minde bee rewarded according to the actions
thereof, and that it is not néedefull that the bodie which was not
principall but acceſſarie in the ſinne, and only but the inſtrument
to ſerue ſins turne, ſhould partake with the mind. And they ſhew
compariſons for the ſame of Artificers and craftſmen, who for
making a houſe, or any other peece of worke, haue their hire and
couenants, when as the inſtruments wherewith they wrought
are not rewarded, neither are they damnified though the worke
by them be not accordingly performed. Of a poiſoned pot, which

by diſtinction of inſtruments, as they are of coniunct, and

is eternall, which ſeemeth not to be anſwerable to Gods infinite
mercie. We anſwere extraordinarie tranſgreſſion hath no
proportion with ordinarie correction. Againe, what is the
cauſe that thy domeſticall and ordinarie fire goeth out? Is it
not becauſe thou feedeſt it not with combuſtible matter? For
let it haue alwayes ſtouer giuen to it, and it will alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.
In hell the fire is maintained by fewell fit for it. For
there is euerie mans wicked will, and endleſſe deſire of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which can neuer be done away, becauſe there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
in hell, which is the nutriment and preſeruatiue of
this fire. Therefore ſo long as the ſinne remaineth, it is but equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and iuſtice that the puniſhment ſhould continue. Sinners
are like Card-players, who will not giue ouer though the night
bee neuer ſo much ſpent, vnleſſe their Candle ſaile them: ſo did
not the light of life faile them, and were not their Candle
(as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaieth) put out, and ſpent to the Socket, they would not
ceaſe to ſinne. Wherfore the puniſhment is agreeable with their
ſinfull wiſhes. They wiſh to ſinne for euer: therefore they are
worthily plagued for euer.</p>
            <p>Therewarde of the righteous is euerlaſting: therefore the
wages of the wicked is euerlaſting. May not the ſonne is ſinne
againſt the father, and the ſubiect againſt his ſoueraigne, as in
the rule of reaſon and iuſtice the one may be diſinherited, and
the other confined and baniſhed for euer? If wee admit theſe;
it holdeth by compariſon, that our heauenly King and father
may doe ſo with his degenerate children, and rebellious people.
But yet it is verie ſtrange, that this fire ſhould burne, and not
conſume? But the anſwere hereof is, the will of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
who hath giuen this condition and qualitie vnto it. The

they doe wee draw this difference of the recompence? This
our dignitie is meerelye Gods dignation: therefore wee
fetch the inequalitie thereof not from our merrits, but his

glories.</p>
            <p>There bee other reaſons, but theſe are the chiefeſt that
make for this matter. The aduerſe part is aſwell prouid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to hold their aſſertion: Their arguments are many and
good, and they are theſe. 1. Firſt they ſay, God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
euery one according to his workes, and as his worke
is ſo ſhall his wages be.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures goe with this:<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 6.</note> it is <hi>Paules</hi> ſaying: <hi>Who
will reward euerie man according to his workes. 2. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
foretelling the condition of the Saints after this life,
is flat for difference of rewardes, ſaying: <hi>They that be wiſe
ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the firmament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and they
that turne many to righteouſneſſe ſhall ſhine as the Stars
for euermore.</hi> But there is manifeſt difference betweene
the brightneſſe of the firmament, and the brightneſſe of the
Starres. 3. From the contraries they conclude the caſe
thus: There are diuerſities of puniſhments in Hell, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the conſequence holdeth by compariſon that there is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
of rewardes in heauen. That the ſufferings in Hell
are ſundrie, it is apparant by Chriſtes wordes: <hi>It ſhall
