            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>LIke Cunning Wives to cheat you to your Bliss,</l>
               <l>We took the Garb and Humours of your Miss.</l>
               <l>As gay,—as vain, and ayery we are grown;</l>
               <l>And you, as brisk; as young Gallants came on:</l>
               <l>And look as dull as they, now th' Act is done.</l>
               <l>Since Non-sense, Noise, and Show still bear the Bell,</l>
               <l>As wise Physicians do with Mad-men deal,</l>
               <l>We humour you, to make you sooner well.</l>
               <l>If this won't take—</l>
               <l>T'insure our future charge, and Credit too.</l>
               <l>As undertakers for great Volumes do.</l>
               <l>We'l paint your Coats of Arms o'r ev'ry Scene,</l>
               <l>And dedicate 'm t'ye to draw you in.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Poor <hi>Nonsy</hi> dreading the approaching storm,</l>
               <l>Sits trembling like a Hare within her Form:</l>
               <l>While Criticks swarm from ev'ry part o'th'Town,</l>
               <l>Prepar'd with Damning noise to run her down:</l>
               <l>She fears no Gen'rous Hunters, for they come</l>
               <l>Only for sport, and would prevent her Doom.</l>
               <l>She fears no snarling Fops, though ev'ry foot,</l>
               <l>Like eager Lovers they will put her to't.</l>
               <l>Still hunting close, and snatching at her Scut;</l>
               <l>No, only sneaking Poachers, she can dread;</l>
               <l>That with their long-tail'd Mungrils hunt for Bread,</l>
               <l>And lurk in holes to knock her on the head.</l>
               <l>Tou Gentlemen that for your pleasure came,</l>
               <l>Let not those creeping Vermine kill your game:</l>
               <l>Give her fair Law, and while in view she flies,</l>
               <l>Your swelling hopes and sweet delights will rise:</l>
               <l>But when you paunch her, all your pleasure dies.</l>
               <l>Keep up your sport; and to prevent our sorrow,</l>
               <l>Save her this night, and run her down to morrow.</l>

               <l>You She-Weavers, that without lawless Engines, come;</l>
               <l>Engines—</l>
               <l>That like dark Lanthorns lurk in little Room,</l>
               <l>And manage twenty Shuttles with one Loom:</l>
               <l>While honest Lab'rers that can use but one,</l>
               <l>For want of work lye still, and are undone.</l>
               <l>Let all your Tools be stirring for your Aid,</l>
               <l>Or we will burn your Engines, and destroy your Trade.</l>
