         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <q>In the day that the enemies of the Jewes hoped to have power over them, the Jewes gathered themſelves together into
their Cities, through out all the Provinces of King <hi>Ahaſhuerus,</hi> to lay hand on thoſe that ſought their lives, and
no man could withſtand them; for the feare of them fell upon all people. Thus the Jewes ſinote all their enemies
with the ſtroke of the ſword, and ſlaughter and deſtruction; and did what they would with thoſe that hated them;
but on the ſpoile laid they not their hand.</q>

they have by all poſſible meanes endeavored to prevent this warre at firſt, and ſince to
accommodate it, though in vaine, upon juſt, reaſonable, and honorable ſafe termes for
King and Kingdome. The ſole Queſtion then in this caſe thus truely ſtated will be.</p>
            <p>Whether his Majeſtie, having contrary to his Oath, Duty, the fundamentall Laws of
God and the Realme, raiſed an Armie of Malignants, Papiſts, Forraigners; againſt
his Parliament, Kingdome, People, to make an Offenſive warre upon them, to
murther, rob, ſpoyle, deprive them of their peace, liberties, properties, eſtates; to
impoſe unlawfull taxes by force upon them; protect Delinquents and evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
againſt the Parliaments Iuſtice, and violently to undermine our eſtabliſhed
Proteſtant Religion; the Common-wealth of <hi>England</hi> legally aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and all Subjects in ſuch caſes by Command and direction from both Houſes
of Parliament, may not lawfully and juſtly without any Treaſon or Rebellion, in point
of Law and Conſcience, take up defenſive Armes to preſerve the Priviledges of
Parliament, their Lawes, lives, liberties, eſtates, properties, Religion, to bring Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
and ill Councellours to condigne puniſhment, and reſcue his ſeduced Majeſtie
out of their hands and power, though he be perſonally preſent with them, to aſſiſt
and countenance them in this unnaturall deſtructive warre?</p>
            <p>And under correction (notwithſtanding any thing I ever yet heard or read to the
contrary) I conceive affirmatively, that they may juſtly do it, both in point of Law and
Conſcience. I ſhall begin with Law, becauſe in this unhappie controverſie, it muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

aſſembled in it, to be the Soveraigne power, and of greater authority then the

obeyed, and quietly ſubmitted to, as Gods owne Miniſters, without the leaſt reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
private or publike; neither ought any private men upon any private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,

publike Magiſtrates in whom all the Kingdome have an intereſt, without the generall
aſſent and authority of the whole State and Kingdome, or of both Houſes of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which repreſents it. But if Kings degenerate into Tyrants, and turne profeſſed
enemies to their Kingdomes, Parliaments, People, by making open Warre againſt
them; by ſpoyling, murthering, impriſoning, maiming, ſacking, deſtroying, or
putting them out of their Protections, without any juſt or lawfull grounds, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
by force of Armes to ſubvert their Lawes, Liberties, Religion, and expoſe
them as a prey to their mercileſſe blood-thirſty Souldiers; or bring in Forraigne For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to conquer them, (our preſent caſe;) I dare confidently averre, it was never the
thought nor intention of <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Holy Ghoſt, much leſſe of our Nobles, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats,
and Commons in Parliament, which enacted theſe Lawes (who ſo oft tooke
up Armes, aſwell offenſive, as defenſive, againſt our Kings, in ſuch like caſes hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
to inhibit Subjects, Kingdomes, Parliaments (eſpecially, by direct Votes
and Ordinances of both Houſes) under paine of damnation, high Treaſon, or Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
by defenſive Armes to reſiſt Kings themſelves, or any of their Cavalliers: and
if this queſtion had beene put to <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> or any of thoſe Parliaments, which
enacted theſe objected Lawes; <hi>Whether they ever meant by theſe Precepts or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
totally to prohibite all Subjects, by generall aſſent in Parliament, to take up ſuch
defenſive Armes, or make any forceable reſiſtance, againſt their Kings or their Armies,
in ſuch caſes of extremity and neceſſity as theſe, under the foreſaid penalties?</hi> I make
little queſtion, but they would have clearely reſolved; that it was never ſo much as
within the compaſſe of their thoughts, much leſſe their plaine intention, to prohibite
ſuch a reſiſtance, in this or ſuch like caſes, but onely according to the precedent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of their words; and that they never imagined to eſtabliſh in the world any
Vnreſiſtable Lawleſſe Tyranny, or any ſuch ſpoile or butchery of Kingdomes, of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
execrable to God and man, in all perſons, all ages, which have<note n="*" place="margin">See Doctor <hi>Beards</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater of Gods Iudgements, <hi>l. 2. c. 13. to</hi> 42.</note> reſiſted them even

            <p>Firſt, it is unqueſtionable, that by the Common and Statute Law of the Land,

            <p>Secondly, It is irrefragable, that the Subjects in defence of their own Perſons,
Houſes, Goods, Wives, Families, againſt ſuch as violently aſſault them by open force
of Armes, to wound, ſlay, beate, impriſon, robbe, or plunder them, (though by
the Kings own illegall Commiſſion) may not onely lawfully arme themſelves, and

apprehend, diſarme, beat, wound, repulſe, kill them in their juſt neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
not onely without guilt of Treaſon, or Rebellion, but of Treſſpas, or the

beating, but killing of ſuch perſons, who aſſault their Maſters perſons, goods, or

their perſons, houſes, goods, or habitations, without any Treaſon, Rebellion, or

            <p>Thirdly, It is paſt diſpute, <q>That the Sheriffes Iuſtices of Peace, Mayors, Conſtables
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115430:11"/>
and all other Officers of the Realme, may and ought by our Lawes and Statutes to

they may lawfully kill and ſlay them without crime or guilt, if they cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſuppreſſe or apprehend them: yea, the Sheriffes, and all other Officers may

and the Deſcription of the King and Kingdome, (governed by an annointed and
Crowned King, knowne of old to be free and ingenuous; <hi>ad nullius, praeterquam
Dei ſpectans dominationem</hi>) with the nature and diſpoſition of the people, ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
the baſeneſſe and impiety of the Offerer, that fetching a deepe ſigh from his
heart, he anſwered, <q>I have never read nor heard, of any King poſſeſſing ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
a Kingdome, ſubject and obedient to him, who would thus willingly ruine
his Principality, as of free to make it tributary, of his owne to make it anothers, of
happy to make it miſerable, and to ſubmit himſelf to anothers pleaſure, as one conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
without a wound. But I have heard and read of many, who with effuſion and
loſſe of much blood (which was laudable) have procured liberty to themſelves; <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do

<hi>That the King was unworthy of his Confederacie;</hi> and looking on the two Knights
with a ſterne countenance,</q> 
               <hi>he commanded them to depart inſtantly out of his preſence,
and to ſee his face no more;</hi> whereupon they departing with ſhame; hee charged
<hi>Robert</hi> the Clerke, <hi>to informe him truely what manner of perſon King</hi> Iohn <hi>was:</hi> who
replied, <q>That he was rather a Tyrant then a King; rather a Subverter then a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
a Subverter of his owne Subjects, and a Foſterer of Strangers; a Lyon to
his owne Subjects, a Lambe to Aliens and Rebels; who by his ſloathfulneſſe
had loſt the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and many other Lands, and moreover thirſted
to loſe and deſtroy the Kingdome of <hi>England:</hi> An unſatiable Extortioner of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
an invader and deſtroyer of the poſſeſſions of his naturall people, &amp;c.</q> When
<hi>Miramumalim</hi> heard this, he <hi>not onely deſpiſed, as at firſt, but deteſted and accurſed him,
and ſaid:</hi> 
               <q>Why doe the miſerable <hi>Engliſh</hi> permit ſuch a one to raigne and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer
over them?</q> Truely, they are effeminate and flaviſh: To which <hi>Robert</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<q>the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are the moſt patient of all men, untill they are offended and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
beyond meaſure. But now they are angry, like a Lion or Elephant, when he
perceives himſelfe hurt or bloody; and though late, they purpoſe and endeavour to
ſhake the yoake of the Oppreſſor from their necks which lie under it:</q> Whereupon
<hi>he reprehended the overmuch patience and fearefulneſſe of the Engliſh;</hi> and diſmiſſed
theſe Meſſengers; who returning, and relating his Anſwer to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ſorrowfull, and in much bitterneſſe of Spirit, that he was thus contemned and
diſapointed of his purpoſe. Yet perſiſting in his pre-conceived wicked deſigne to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115430:17"/>
ruine his Kingdome and people, and hating all the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England,</hi>
with a viperous Venom, he ſets upon another courſe; and knowing<note n="*" place="margin">A true Character of a Pope,</note> Pope <hi>Jnno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
to be the moſt ambitious, proud, and covetous of all men, who by gifts and promiſes
would be wrought upon, to act any wickedneſſe:</hi> Thereupon he haſtily diſpatcheth meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
to him with great ſummes of Money, and a re-aſſurance of his tributary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
(which ſhortly after he confirmed by a new Oath and Charter,) to procure him
to Excommunicate the <hi>Archbiſhop of Canterbury,</hi> and the Barons, whom he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
favoured; which things he greedily deſired, <hi>that he might wrecke has malice an
them by Diſ inheriting, Impriſoning, and Spoiling them being Excommunicated:</hi> Which
things when he had wickedly plotted, he more wickedly executed afterwards. In
the meane time, the Barons foreſeeing that nothing was to be obtained but by ſtrong
hand, aſſemble an Army at <hi>Stamford,</hi> wherein were ſaid to be <hi>two thouſand Knights,</hi>
beſides Eſquires, and marched from thence towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the King expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
their comming to anſwer their demands. And being come to <hi>Brackley</hi> with their
Army, the King ſends the <hi>Earle of Pembroke Mariſcall,</hi> and the <hi>Archbiſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
with others, to demand of them, <hi>what were thoſe Lawes and Liberties they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired?</hi>
to whom they ſhewed a Schedule of them, which the Commiſſioners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to the King: who having heard them read, in great indignation asked; <hi>Why
the Barons did not likewiſe demand the Kingdome? and ſwore he would never grant thoſe
Articles, whereby himſelfe ſhould be made a Servant.</hi> So harſh a thing is it to a power,
that is once gotten out into the wide libertie of his will, to heare againe of any redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
within his Circle. Vpon this anſwer, the Barons <hi>reſolve to ſeize the Kings Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;</hi>
conſtitute <hi>Robert Fitz-walter</hi> their Generall, entituling him, <hi>Mariſcall of the
ARMY of GOD, and of HOLY CHVRCH:</hi> A Title they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have given their Generall, or Army, had they deemed this Warre unlawfull
in Law or Conſcience. After which they tooke divers of the Kings Caſtles and are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into <hi>London;</hi> where their number daily increaſing, they make this Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>Never to give over the proſecution of their deſire, till they had conſtrained the
King (whom they held perjured) to grant them their Rights.</hi> Which queſtionleſſe,
they would not have done, had they not beleeved this Warre to be juſt and lawfull.
<hi>King</hi> Iohn <hi>ſeeing himſelfe in a manner generally forſaken of all his people, and Nobles,
having ſcarce 7. Knights faithfull to him</hi> (another ſtrong argument, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

to regaine, to preſerve their hereditary Rights and Liberties, to be lawfull) counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits
the Seales of the Biſhops, and writes in their Names to all Nations, <hi>That the
Engliſh were all Apoſtates, and whoſoever would come to invade them, hee, by the
Popes conſent, would conferre upon them all their Lands and Poſſoſſions.</hi> But this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
working no effect, in regard they gave no credit to it, and found it apparently
falſe; the King ſeeing himſelfe deſerted of all, and that thoſe of the Barons part

Treaſon nor Rebellion in the judgements of our Anceſtors and thoſe Parliaments
which procured, and ratified <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> to take up armes in defence thereof;
much leſſe can it be Treaſon or Rebellion in the Parliament and Subjects now (by
Votes, by Ordinances of both Houſes) with force of armes to preſerve, not only theſe
their hereditarie Charters, Lawes, Priviledges, but their very Lives, Eſtates; yea, the

            <p>What opinion the world had of the lawfulneſſe of moſt of the Barons Warres in
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> his Raigne, againſt this troubleſome perſidious King, in defence
of their Lawes, Liberties, Eſtates, appeares firſt, by the Dialogue betweene <hi>Agnel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
a Frier minorite, one of King <hi>Henry</hi> his Counſell, (purpoſely ſent to the Earle
<hi>Marſhall,</hi> then in armes againſt the King) and this Martiall <hi>Earle,</hi> in the Abbey of
<hi>Morgan. Anno</hi> 1233. I will firſt relate the true ſtate of that Warre, and then their
Dialogue concerning it:<note n="q" place="margin">Math. Paris Hiſt. <hi>p. 371. to</hi> 385. Daniel, <hi>p. 153. 154. See</hi> Holinſſe, Graft. Speed. Matth. Weſt. Anno 1233.</note> King <hi>Henry</hi> by the ill counſell of <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
removed all his Engliſh Officers, Counſellors, and Servants from his Court,
and put <hi>Poictovines,</hi> and Forraigners in their places, being ruled wholly by them;
withall he puts the Engliſh Gariſons out of all his Caſtles, and ſubſtitutes Forraigners
in them, which dayly arived both with Horſe and armes in great multitudes, and much
oppreſſed the people, calling them Traitors; ſo that the power and wealth of the
Realme was wholly under their Command. The Earle Marſhall ſeeing the Noble
and Ignoble thus oppreſſed, and the rights of the Kingdome like utterly to be loſt; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
with a zeale of Iuſtice, aſſociating to himſelfe other Noble men, goes boldly to
the King, reproves him in the hearing of many, <q>For calling in thoſe <hi>Poictovines,</hi> by
evill Counſell, to the oppreſſion of the Kingdome, and of his naturall Subjects,
and likewiſe of Lawes and Liberties; <hi>Humbly beſeeching him,</hi> haſtily to correct theſe
exceſſes, which threatned the imminent ſubverſion both of His Crowne and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which if he refuſed to doe, he and the other Nobles of the Realme, would
withdraw themſelves from his Counſell, as long as he harboured thoſe Strangers.</q> To
which <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> replyed: <hi>That the King might lawfully call in what ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
be would, for the Defence of his Kingdome and Crowne, and likwiſe ſo many, and
ſuch, as might compell his proud and rebellious Subjects to due Obedience.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Earle Marſhall and other Nobles, departing diſcontented from the Court,
when they could get no other anſwer, promiſed firmely one to another; <hi>That for
this cauſe which concerned them all, they would manfully fight, even to the ſeparation of
Soule and Body.</hi> After which, they ſeeing more Strangers arrive with Horſe and
armes every day, ſent word to the King; <hi>That hee ſhould foorthwith remove Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
Peter, <hi>and all his Strangers from his Court, which if he refuſed, they all would
BY THE COMMON CONSENT OF THE WHOLE REALM
drive him, with his wicked Counſellours, out of the Realme, and conſult of chuſing them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115430:19"/>
a new King.</hi> After theſe, and ſome other like paſſages, the King rayſing an Army,
beſiegeth one of the Earles Caſtles; and not being able to winne it, and aſhamed to
raiſe his Seige without gaining it, he ſent certaine Biſhops to the Earle, and reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
him; that ſince he had beſieged his Caſtle, and hee could not with Honour
depart without winning it, which he could not doe by force, that the Earle to ſave
his Honour would cauſe it to be ſurrended to him, upon this condition, <hi>That hee
would reſtore it certainely to him within 15. dayes, and that by adviſe of the Biſhops
he would amend all things amiſſe in his Kingdome;</hi> for performance of which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
became his Pledges, and the King appointed a meeting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> on a ſet
day betweene Him and the Lords: whereupon the Earle ſurrendred the Caſtle to the
King, upon Oath made by the Biſhops that it ſhould be reſtored at the day. But the
King refuſing to deliver the Earle the Caſtle, according to promiſe, and threatning to
ſubdue his other Caſtles; the Earle hereupon raiſeth his Forces, winnes his Caſtle
againe, routs divers of the Kings Forraigne Forces, at <hi>Gorſemond, Monmouth,</hi> and
<q>other places; and invaded the lands of his Enemies. Vpon this occaſion, Frier <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellus</hi>
(or <hi>Lambe</hi>) acquaints the Earle, what the King, together with his Counſell
and Court, thought of his proceedings; to wit, that the King ſaid, he had proceeded
over traiterouſly, and unjuſtly againſt him, yet he was willing to receive him into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
if he would wholly ſubmit himſelfe to his mercy; and that others held it not
juſt, ſafe, and profitable for him to doe it; becauſe he had done wrong to the King,
in that before the King had invaded his Lands or Perſon, he invaded and deſtroyed
the Kings Lands, and ſlew his men; and if he ſhould ſay, he did this in defence of
his body and inheritance; they anſwered, no, becauſe there was never any plot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
either of them; and that were it true, yet he ought not thus to breake forth
againſt the King his Lord, untill hee had certaine knowledge, that the King had
ſuch intenſions againſt him: <hi>ET EX TVNC LICERET TALIA
ATTEMPTARE;</hi> and from thenceforth he might lawfully attempt ſuch things,
(by the Courtiers and Friers owne Confeſſions:) Vpon which the Marſhiall ſaid to
Frier <hi>Lambe:</hi> To the firſt they ſay, that I ought to ſubmit my ſelfe, becauſe I have
invaded the King: it is not true, becauſe the King himſelfe, (though I have beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ready to ſtand to the Law and judgement of my Peeres in his Court, and have
oft times requeſted it by many meſſengers betweene us, which he alwaies denied to
grant) violently entred my Land, and invaded it againſt all juſtice: whom hoping
in humility to pleaſe, I freely entred into a forme of peace with him, which was
very prejudiciall to me: wherein he granted, that if on his part all things were not
punctually performed toward me, I ſhould be in my priſtine ſtate before that peace
conclnded; namely, that I ſhould be without this homage, and abſolved from my
allegiance to him, as I was at firſt by the Biſhop of Saint <hi>Davids;</hi> Seeing then hee
hath violated all the Articles of the Peace, IT WAS LAWFVLL FOR
ME, According to my agreement, to recover what was mine owne; and to
debilitate his power by all meanes; eſpecially ſeeing he endeavoured my deſtruction,
diſ-inheritance, and ſeizing of my Body, of which I have certaine intelligence, and
am able to prove it if neede be. And which is more, after the 15 daies truce, before
I entred <hi>Wales,</hi> or made any defence, he deprived me of the Office of Marſhall,
without judgement, which belongs to me, and I have enjoyed by Inheritance, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would he by any meanes reſtore mee to it, though required. Whence I have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115430:19"/>
plainely learned, that he will keepe no peace with me, ſeeing ſince the Peace hee
handles me worſe then before. <hi>Whereby I ceaſed to bee his Subject, and was abſolved
from his homage by him. Wherefore it was, and is lawfull for me to defend my ſelfe,
and to withſtand the malice of his Counſellors by all meanes.</hi> And whereas the
Kings Counſellors ſay, it is profitable for me to ſubmit to the Kings mercy, becauſe he
is more rich and powerfull then I am. It is true, the King is richer and more potent
then I, but yet he is not more powerfull then God, who is Iuſtice it ſelfe, in whom
I truſt, in the confirmation and proſecution of my right, and of the Kingdomes. And
whereas they ſay, the King can bring in Strangers of his kinred, who are neither
<hi>Scots,</hi> nor <hi>French,</hi> nor <hi>Welſh,</hi> who ſhall make all his foes his Foot-ſtoole, and come in
ſuch multitudes, as they ſhall cover the face of the earth, and that he can raiſe ſeven
men to my one: I neither truſt in Strangers, nor deſire their confederaciei
nor will I invoke their aide, <hi>Vnleſſe,</hi> which God forbid, <hi>inopinata &amp; immutabilis,
fuero compulſus neceſſitate;</hi> I ſhall be compelied by a ſudden and immutable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity;
and I beleeve by his Counſells ill adviſe he will quickly bring in ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of Strangers, that he will not be able to free the Kingdome of them againe;
for I have learned from credible men, that the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> is bound to
the Emperour, that he will make the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> ſubject to him; which
God in his providence avert. And whereas they ſay, That I may confide in the King
and his Counſell, becauſe the King is mercifull, credible, &amp;c. It may well be that the
King is mercifull; but he is ſeduced be the Counſell of thoſe, by whom we feele our
ſelves much hurt; and he is Noble and credible (whom God long preſerve ſo) as
much as in him lies; but as for his Counſell, I ſay, that no one promiſe made
to me, was ever yet kept, and they have violated many corporall Oathes made to
me, and the Oathes they tooke for obſerving <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> for which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
excommunicate and perjured. Yea, they are enjured concerning the faithfull
Counſell which they have ſworne to give to our Lord the King, when as they
have wilfully given him the Counſell of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> againſt juſtice; and corrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
the juſt Lawes they have ſworne to keepe, and introduced unuſuall ones: for
which, and for many other things, for which neither God nor man ought to truſt
them, or their complices, are they not every one excommunicated?</q>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Whereas the ſaid Counſellors of the King ſay, that I invaded the Kings body at
<hi>Gorſmund</hi> Caſtle, before the King had entred my Land; and ſo I did injurie to
the King, for which I ought to implore his mercie, leaſt others ſhould take example
thence to raiſe up Armes againſt the King. I anſwer, that I was not there in perſon;
and if any of my Family were thereby chance, they invaded onely the Family of
the King, not the perſon of the King: which yet if they had done, it were no
wonder, ſeeing the king came with his Army into my Land, that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
me, and oppreſſe me by all the meanes he could, which may appeare to all
by the tenor of his Letters, by which hee made a generall aſſembly throughout
<hi>England</hi> againſt my Army. And ſince the premiſes objected againſt mee are falſe,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115430:20"/>
and it is true, that the King hath treated me worſe ſince the time I expected his
mercy, then any time before, and doth yet uſe the ſame Counſell as then; and
ſince he endeavours preciſely to follow their Counſels in all things, by whoſe
adviſe I ſuffer all the premiſed grievances; I ought not to proſtitute my ſelfe to
his mercy. Neither would this be for the Kings honour, that I ſhould conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his will, which is not grounded upon reaſon. Yea, I ſhould doe an injury to
him, and to Iuſtice, which he ought to uſe towards his Subjects, and to maintaine.
And I ſhould give an ill example to all, by deſerting Iuſtice, and the proſecution of
right, for an erronious will againſt all Iuſtice, and the injury of the Subjects: For by
this it would appeare, that we loved our worldly poſſeſſions, more then Iuſtice it
ſelfe. And whereas the Kings Counſellours object, that wee have combined with
the Kings capitall enemies, namely, the <hi>French, Scots, Welſh,</hi> out of hatred and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to king and kingdome: That of the <hi>French</hi> is altogether falſe, and that of the
<hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Welſh</hi> too; excepting the king of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Leoline</hi> Prince of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wales;</hi>
who were not the kings enemies, but faithfull friends, untill by injuries offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them by the King and his Counſell, they were by coertion againſt their wills, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated
from their fidelitie, as I am. And for this cauſe I am confederated with them,
that we may the better being united, then ſeparated, regaine and defend our rights, of
which we are unjuſtly deprived, and in a great part ſpoiled. Whereas the Kings
Counſell propoſe, that I ought not to confide in my Confederates, becauſe the
King, without any great hurt to his Land, can eaſily ſeparate them from my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
Of this I make no great doubt, but by this the iniquity of his Counſellors
doth moſt of all appeare: that in ſome ſort they would cauſe the King to ſuſtaine
loſſe, by thoſe whom he ſpecially calls, capitall enemies, to injure mee who have
alwaies beene his faithfull Subject, whiles I remained with him, and yet would
be ſo, if he would reſtore to me and my friends our right. Whereas the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
ſay, that the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> doe ſpecially love the King and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and will Excommunicate all his adverſaries, which thing is even at the
dores, becauſe they have already ſent for a Legate: It pleaſeth mee well, ſaid the
Marſhall; becauſe the more they love the King and Kingdome, by ſo much the
more will they deſire that the King ſhould treat his Realme and Subjects, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to juſtice: And I am well pleaſed they ſhould excommunicate the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Kingdome, becauſe they are thoſe who give Counſell againſt Iuſtice,
whom workes will manifeſt; becauſe Iuſtice and Peace have kiſſed each other; and
becauſe of this, where Iuſtice is corrupted, Peace is likewiſe violated. Alſo I am
pleaſed that a Legate is comming, becauſe the more diſcreet men ſhall heare our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
by ſo much the more vilely ſhall the adverſaries of Iuſtice be confounded.  In
which notable diſcourſe we ſee the lawfullneſſe of a neceſſary defenſive Warre
yeelded and juſtified both by the King, his Counſell, and the Earle Marſhall, as well
againſt the King himſelfe, if he invade his Subjects firſt, as any of his Forces who
aſſiſt him. After which the Marſhall ſlew many of his Enemies by an Ambuſcado,
while they thought to ſurpriſe him, and waſted and ſpoiled their goods, houſes,
lands; obſerving this generall laudable rule which they made, to doe no hurt, nor ill
to any one, but to the Kings evill Counſellors by whom they were baniſhed, whoſe
goods, houſes, woods, Orchards, they ſpoiled, burnt, and rooted up. The King
remaining at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> heard of theſe proceedings of the Marſhall, but his forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115430:20"/>
too weake, he durſt not encounter him, but retired to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> with Biſhop
<hi>Peter,</hi> confounded with over much ſhame, leaving that Country to be waſted by his
adverſaries; where innumerable carcaſes of thoſe there ſlaine lay naked and unburied in
the wayes, being food to the beaſts and birds of prey: a ſad ſpectacle to paſſengers,
which ſo corrupted the ayre, that it infected and killed many who were healthy. Yet
the Kings heart was ſo hardned, by the wicked councell he followed, againſt the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall,
that the Biſhops admoniſhing him to make peace with him, WHO FOVGHT
FOR IVSTISE: he anſwered, that he would never make peace with him, unleſſe
comming with an halter about his necke and acknowledging himſelfe to be a
Traytor, he would implore his mercy. The Marſhall both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi>

Which act the King by his Writ, ſent to the Judges of the Kings Bench, commanding that
this grant and concord ſhall be firme and stable in all its points, and that every of them
ſhould be held, and kept in perpetuitie; to which end he commands them to cauſe this act
to be there inrolled, and firmely kept for ever.</hi> A pregnant evidence that the Barons
taking up Armes then againſt this Traytor and enemie of the Realme, in purſuance of
the Act and ſentence of Parliament for his baniſhment, though the King were in his

no Treaſon, nor Rebellion at all in point of Law, but a juſt &amp; honorable action:
Wherefore their taking up Armes is not mentioned in this Act of oblivion, ſeeing they
all held it juſt, but their putting <hi>Piers</hi> to death, without legall triall; which in ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Law, could not be juſtified. Now whether this be not the Parliaments and

defence of their owne Priviledges of Parliament, and apprehention of delinquents
who ſeducing the king withdrew him from the Parliament, and cauſed him to raiſe

the unlawfull outrages, robberies, and murders committed by the ſouldiers on the kings
leige people, and not on the two <hi>Spenſers</hi> the ſole delinquents, were the occaſion of
this Act of oblivion and pardon, not the Armed purſuing of them, when they had
gotten above the reach of Law. Thirdly, that though this were an offenſive not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
warre, made without common aſſent of Parliament, and many murthers, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries,
and miſdemeanors committed in the proſecution of it upon the kings leige peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who were no Delinquents; yet being for the common good to ſuppreſſe and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
theſe ill Councellors, enemies, Traytors to King and Kingdome, the King and
Parliament thought it ſuch a publicke ſervice as merited a pardon of theſe miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
in the carriage of it, and acquitted all who were parties to it, from all ſuites and
puniſhments. All which conſidered, is a cleare demonſtration, that they would have
reſolved our preſent defenſive warre, by Authoritie of both Houſes, accompanied
with no ſuch outrages as theſe; for the apprehenſion of ſuch as have beene voted
Traytors and Delinquents by Parliament, and ſtand out in contempt againſt its ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
for the defence of the Priviledges and Members of Parliament, the Liberties and
properties of the ſubject, the fundamentall lawes of the Realme, the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
now indangered by Papiſts up in Armes in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to extirpate it,
and the removing ill Counſellors from his Majeſtie; to be no high Treaſon, Rebellion
or offence at all againſt the king, but a juſt and lawful Act, the very miſcarriages wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in the generall (except in ſuch diſorderly Souldiers for whom martiall Law hath
provided due puniſhments) deſerve a publike pardon both from King and Kingdome.
And to put this out of Queſtion; as no fancie of mine owne, we have an expreſſe Act
of Parliament, reſolving the taking up of Armes by the Queene, Prince, (both but
ſubjects and capable of High Treaſon in ſuch a caſe as well as others) the Nobles and
people of the Realme againſt theſe two <hi>Spenſers</hi> and other ill Counſellors about this
king in the laſt yeare of his raigne, (though the King himſelf were in their Company,
and taken priſoner by the Forces raiſed againſt them,) for the neceſſary preſervation,
reliefe, and ſafety of the Queene, Prince, Nobles, Kingdome, to be no high Treaſon
nor offence at all: namely, the ſtatute of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 1. 2. 3, which I ſhall recite at large.

pittying the miſery of my Nation and Country, which now by your ſloathfulneſſe, of

danger, to take up Armes and raiſe Forces by Sea or Land to defend the king

In the meane time <hi>Hugh Linne</hi> an old Souldier, who had loſt his ſenſes, and was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

AND THAT THEY MIGHT PVLL AWAY THOSE TRAITORS
FROM HIM, WHICH HE CONTINVALLY DET AINED WITH HIM.
The Traytors they appealed were the foreſaid ill Councellors, and Nicholas Brambre the

If thoſe then who in this offenſive Warre aſſiſted <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. to apprehend, and

<q>If ever God gave victory to men fighting in a juſt quarrell; or if he ever aided
ſuch as made warre for the wealth and tuition of their owne naturall and nutritive
Countrey: or if he ever ſuccoured them which adventured their lives for the reliefe
of Innocents, ſuppreſſion of malefactors, and apparent Offenders; No doubt, my
Fellowes and Friends, but he of his bountifull goodneſſe will this day ſend us trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
victory, and a lucky revenge over our proud Enemies, and arrogant adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
for if you remember and conſider the very cauſe of our juſt quarrel, you ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
perceive the ſame to be true godly, and vertuous. In the which I doubt not
but God will rather ayde us, (yea, and fight for us) then ſee us vanquiſhed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
by ſuch as neither feare him, nor his Lawes, nor yet regard Iuſtice and honeſty.
Our cauſe is ſo juſt, that no enterpriſe can be of more vertue, both by the Laws Divine
and Civill, &amp;c. If this cauſe be not juſt, and this quarrell godly, let God, the giver
of victory judge and determine, &amp;c. Let us therefore fight like invincible Gyants,
and ſet on our enemies like untimorous Tygers, and baniſh all feare like tamping Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
March forth like ſtrong and robuſtious Champions, and begin the battaile like
hardy Conquerors; the Battell is at hand, and the Victory approacheth, and if wee
ſhamefully recule, or cowardly fly, we and all our ſequele be deſtroyed, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
for ever. This is the day of gaine, and this is the time of loſſe; get this
dayes victory, and be Conquerours; and loſe this dayes battell, and bee villaines.

already meditated of, already prepared; and alſo not thought upon, but very likely,
poſſible: yet neither this laſt ſimply; or would I call it juſt, to endeavour this war,
as ſoone as ever any ſhould be made too potent; which I doe not affirme. For what
if any Princes power ſhould be increaſed by ſucceſſions, by elections; wilt thou
trouble him with warre, becauſe his power may be dangerous to thee? Another
thing therefore muſt be added concerning Iuſtice. We will adde to others, who
what they have thought of a juſt war, attend.</q>

unto Princes of the earth. But even without any circumſtance at all, the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
ſpeake thus to the <hi>Athenians:</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Thuc. l. 1.</note> We doe plainely deny that any is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

your owne Subjects will defend themſelves from you. Yet I thinke not Subjects of
other men are altogether ſtrangers from that neerenſſe of nature, and union of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
you doe alſo cut off the unity of mankinde, whereby life is ſuſtained, as excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<note n="d" place="margin">4. de Beneſ.</note> 
                     <hi>Seneca.</hi> And if we make not Princes lawleſſe, tyed to no Lawes nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:
It is neceſſary, that there be ſome to admoniſh them of their duty, and
may hold them faſt bound; which reaſon I expounded in the ſecond Booke of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies.
Neither will I heere infer any confuſion of kingdomes, or any inſpection
of one Prince over another Prince: neither doe I ſuffer thoſe things to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed,
which are moſt firmely glued together by nature, I meane, that kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with all, among all. Neither here otherwiſe may one Prince have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
over another Prince, but ſuch as may happen by every other Warre,
wherein one Prince carries himſelfe as a judge both of himſelfe, and of another.
If a queſtion were among private men, it were moſt unjuſt to goe to a Forraigne
Prince about it. Alſo if there ariſe a difference betweene a private man and his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
there are Magiſtrates appointed which may be ſought unto. But when
the controverſie is touching the Common-wealth, there neither are, nor can be any
judges in the City. I call that a publike matter, when ſuch, and ſo great a part of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115430:34"/>
the Subiects is moved, that now there is need of Warre againſt thoſe that defend
themſelves by Warre. And as if thoſe ſhould come into part of the Principality of
the publike, and are Peeres to the Prince, who can doe ſo much as hee.<note n="e" place="margin">Ceph. 612.</note> Even as
one King is ſaid to be equall to another, who can reſiſt another offering wrong,
however greater, and more powerfull; although I ſay not theſe things of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
themſelves, unleſſe it be in reſpect of Forraigne Princes, which will ayde the
Subject againſt their Soveraigne, and who can ayde them no otherwiſe then in a
controverſie,<note place="margin">Con. Regn. Pecca. par. p. 9. Bod. l. 2. de Rep. c. 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> l. 5. c ult. Cic 3. de Off.</note> as I have expounded, of the Common-wealth.<hi rend="sup">f</hi> And indeede, if the
Subjects be uſed more cruelly and unjuſtly, this opinion of defending is approved
even of others, who both bring that laudable example of <hi>Hercules,</hi> the Lord of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
and Monſters. There is alſo the example of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who ayded the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
againſt <hi>Maxentius,</hi> as I noted before.<note n="g" place="margin">Bal. lib. 4. c. de iuſt. &amp; ſubſt.</note> We defend Sonnes againſt injuſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

doe not impugne my Countrey, but is burdenſome to his owne, and being ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
my Countrey doth vexe his owne, yet ſo great naughtineſſe of minde hath
cut him off: although it maketh him not an enemy, yet hatefull unto mee. And
the reaſon of the duty which I owe unto <hi>mankinde, is both more precious, and more
powerfull with me, then that which I owne to one ſingle man.</hi> Thus verily; or elſe
we make all men forreigners to all Princes, if we determine that they can doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their pleaſure and luſt. Now what if the cauſe of the Subject be unjuſt?
The foreſaid Authors deny, that men ought to ayde uniuſt Forraigne Subjects,

to be loved nor aſſiſted with helpe. But this is falſe of a Father, as I taught in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Diſputation, perhaps it is more true, that thoſe may be defended of us by war,
who are unjuſt. For if it be a juſt warre which is to repulſe a wrong, although
they that repulſe an injury, have given occaſion to the warre: the ſame it ſeemes
may be determined in the defence of others, even of Subjects, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Surely there is that iniquity in Warre, that it will make the ſame man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

                     <hi>Seeing it is not inhumane to doe good to thoſe that have offended.</hi> Yet I dare
affirme, that this reaſon of bringing helpe doth ſeldome ſtand alone, but that another
of neceſſity and profit may be pretended, or truely ſhewn, as is ſaid before. Behold
now is the greateſt queſtion: <hi>If the Engliſh have juſtly ayded the</hi> Hollanders <hi>becauſe

which notwithſtanding are falſe. It was ſaid, that a Warre was to bee underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

Wherefore neither if theſe neighbouring Subjects would change their condition,

they ſpake even this, that Neighbouring Princes would not have another
Neighbour, whom furthermore they knew not, what he might hereafter be. And you
may note, that <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> held Townes from the Church, and for his commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

theſe things be true in private mens cauſes.<note n="k" place="margin">26. de da. inf. Alex. 2. 174.</note> For a private man ſeemes to
have power to doe with his owne what he liſt, if it bee profitable to himſelfe,
and hurt not another. Yet theſe things bee true thus in the cauſes of Empires.
For Princes ought to take heed for the future, that another if he will, may not

worſe nor more grievous thereby: although it be true that no man may take
care of the gaine, which his Neighbour made, and which was owing to him by
no obligation. But even ſecurity, and a certaine ſingular conjunction of love from a
Neighbour, is due to Empires: Now this we know, what things are taken away
when Neighbours are changed.<note n="m" place="margin">Ariſt. 3. pol.</note> And the ſame people is not the ſame that they
were, if the Common-wealth be not the ſame that it was. For it is not lawfull

lawfull to make Fortes in his owne Land,<note place="margin">Bal. 5. Conſ. 409.</note> which may be terrible to thoſe that

Warre, in point of <hi>Common, Civill, Canon Law,</hi> and <hi>Policy,</hi> having been large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
debated in the premiſes, becauſe not hitherto diſcuſſed in that kinde by any, to
my knowledge; I ſhall in the next place proceed to juſtifie it in point of <hi>Divinity</hi>
and <hi>Conſcience;</hi> Wherein, though I ſhall be more conciſe then I intended, becauſe

The ſeverall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Ferne.</hi> The honeſt Broker, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, pleading for Defenſive Armes (the beſt and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt of this kind) with many others.</note> in many late <hi>Printed Bookes,</hi> common in all mens hands
have profeſſedly handled it at large, and given good ſatisfaction unto many unreſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſcrupulous Conſciences; yet becauſe this Treatiſe may come into diverſe hands,
which have not peruſed their diſcourſes; and thoſe whoſe judgements may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the <hi>Legall,</hi> may ſtill have ſome ſcruples of Conſcience reſting in them,
in reguard of the <hi>Theologicall Part,</hi> and becauſe ſome things (perchance) in Point
of <hi>Theology,</hi> which others have wholly omitted, may ſeaſonably be here ſupplyed, to
ſatisfie Conſciences yet unreſolved of the juſtneſſe of the preſent, and all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Defenſive Warres, I ſhall not over-ſparingly or curſorily paſſe through it,
without a competent debate.</p>
            <p>Now leſt the Conſciences of any ſhould bee ſeduced, enſnared with generalities
or cleere miſtakes through the miſ-ſtating of the points in queſtion, with which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
many have beene hitherto deluded by the Oppoſites, who cumbate onely with
their owne miſhapen fancies, diſcharging all their Gunſhot againſt ſuch Tenets as are
not in queſtion, and no waies comming neere the <hi>White</hi> in Controverſie, I ſhal for my
own orderly proceeding, and the better ſatisfaction of ignorant, ſcrupulous, ſeduced
conſciences, more punctually ſtate the Queſtion, then formerly in the Legall Part; firſt,
<hi>Negatively,</hi> next, <hi>Poſitively;</hi> and then proceede to its debate. Take notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>that this is no part of the queſtion in diſpute.</hi> Whether the Parliament, or any
Subjects who ſoever, may actually diſobey, or violently with force of Armes reſiſt the
Kings, or any other lawfull Magiſtrates juſt commands, warranted either by Gods
Word, or the Lawes of <hi>England? it being out of controverſie, readily ſubſcribed by
all of both ſides; that</hi> Such commands ought not ſo much as to be diſobeyed, much leſſe
forcibly reſiſted but cheerefully ſubmitted to, and readily executed for Conſcience ſake,
Rom. 13. 1. <hi>to</hi> 6. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Tit. 3. 1. Hebr. 13. 17. Ioſh. 1. 16, 17. 18. Ezra.
7. 26. Eccleſ. 8 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>the onely thing theſe objected Scriptures prove, which
come not neere the thing in queſtion, though our Oppoſites moſt rely upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:115430:36"/>
               <hi>Secondly, Neither is this any branch of the diſpute:</hi> Whether Subjects may lawfully
riſe up, or rebell againſt their Prince, by way of Muteny, Faction, or Sedition, without
any juſt, or lawfull publicke ground; or for every trifling injury, or provocation offered
them by their Prince? Or whether private men, for perſonall wrongs (eſpecially where
their lives, chaſtities, livelihoods are not immediatly endangered, by actuall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
unjuſt aſſaults) may in point of Conſcience, lawfully reſiſt, or riſe up againſt
their Kings, or any other lawfull Magiſtrates? <hi>Since all diſavow ſuch tumultuous
Inſurrections and Rebellions in ſuch caſes: yet this is all which the oft objected Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Num. 16.</note> Korah, Dathan, <hi>and</hi> Abiram, <hi>with other Scriptures of this Nature,
doe or can evince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, nor is this any parcell of the Controverſie.</hi> Whether Subjects may lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
hands upon the perſons of their Princes, wittingly or willingly to deprive them
of their Lives or Liberties, eſpecially, for private Injuries; or in cold blood, when they
doe not actually nor perſonally aſſault their lives or chaſtities; or for any publike miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours,
without a precedent ſentence of Impriſonment, or death againſt them given
judicially, by the whole States or Realmes, where they have ſuch Authority to araigne
and judge them? <hi>For all unanimouſly diſclaime, yea abominate ſuch Traitorous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
and Ieſuiticall Poſitions, as execrable and unchriſtian: yet this is all which
the example of</hi> Davids not offering violence to King Saul: <hi>the</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 3. <hi>to</hi> 22.
cap. 26. 2. to 25. 2 Sam. 1. 2. to 17. <hi>or that perverted Text of</hi> Pſal. 105. 15. (<hi>the
beſt Artillery in our Adverſaries Magazines) truely prove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Neither is this the thing in difference, as moſt miſtake it.</hi> Whether the
Parliament may lawfully raiſe an Army to goe immediately and directly against the
very perſon of the King, to apprehend or offer violence to him, much leſſe intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to deſtroy him, or to reſist his owne perſonall attempts againſt them, even to the
hazard of his life? <hi>For the</hi> Parliament, <hi>and their</hi> Army <hi>too, have in ſundry</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">See an exact Collection of of al Remon. ſtrances, &amp;c.</note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances,

intention or deſigne at all; for which there is no colour to charge them; and were
his Majeſtie now alone, or attended onely with his Ordinary</hi> Courtly Guard, <hi>there
needed no Army nor Forces to reſiſt his perſonall aſſaults. Yet this is made the
principall matter in queſtion by Doctor</hi> Ferne,<note n="d" place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of Conſcience. The Neceſſity of Chriſtian Subjection, &amp;c. A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vindication. The Grand Rebellion, &amp;c</note> 
               <hi>by</hi> An appeale to thy Conſcience, <hi>and
other Anti-parliamentary</hi> Pamphlets; <hi>who make this the ſole Theame of their
Diſcourſes:</hi> That Subjects may not take up Armes <hi>Againſt their Lawfull Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,</hi>
becauſe he is wicked and unjuſt; no, though he be an Idolater and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor:
<hi>That,</hi> Suppoſe the King will not diſcharge his truſt, but is bent, or ſeduced to
ſubvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties, yet Subjects may not take up Armes, and reſiſt
the King, it being unwarrantable, and according to the Apoſtle, damnable, Rom. 13.
<hi>Yea, this is all the queſtions the G. valleers and Malignants demand of their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites
in this cauſe.</hi> What? will you take up Armes; will you fight againſt, or reſiſt
the King? &amp;c. <hi>Never ſtating the queſtion of his Forces, his Army of Papiſts,
Malignants, Delinquents, but onely of the King himſelfe abſtracted from his inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
depopulating Forces, againſt whom, in this ſence of theirs, the Parliament ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet raiſed any Forces, nor made the leaſt reſiſtance hitherto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe foure particulars then being not in queſtion, I ſhall here appeale to the moſt
Malignant Conſcience: Whether Doctor <hi>Ferne,</hi> and all other our Oppoſites, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
of Conſcience, haue not ignorantly, if not maliciouſly, made ſhipwracke of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115430:36"/>
their good Conſciences (had they ever any) by a wilfull miſtating of the Controverſie,
concerning the preſent Defenſive Warre, in the foure preceding particulars, which
they make the onely <hi>Queſtions;</hi> when not ſo much as one of them comes within the
Verge of that which is the reall Controverſie; and never once naming that in all,
or any of their Writings, which is the point indeed? Secondly, Whether there bee
any one Text or Reaſon in all their Pamphlets, particularly applied to any thing
which concernes the preſent Warre, but onely to theſe foure particulars, which are
not in debate? And if ſo, (as no Conſcience can gaine-ſay it) then there is nought in
all the waſt Papers they have publiſhed, which may either reſolve or ſcruple any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<hi>That the Parliaments Defenſive Armes and reſiſtance are unlawfull in point
of Divinity, or Conſcience,</hi> which is ſteered by the Scriptures Compaſſe.</p>
            <p>But if theſe particulars be not in queſtion; you may now demand, what the knot
and true ſtate of the preſent Controverſie, in point of Conſcience, is? In few words,
take it thus.</p>
            <p>Whether both Houſes of Parliament, and the Subjects by their Authority, for the
preſervation of their owne Perſons, Priviledges, Lawes, Lives, Liberties, Eſtates, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;

his ſeduced Majeſtie out of the power of Popiſh pernicious Counſellours and Forces,
who end avour the Kingdomes ſubverſion, by withdrawing him from, and incenſing him
againſt his Parliament, may not lawfully with a good Conſcience, take up neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
Armes, and make actuall Warlike reſiſtance againſt his Majeſties Malignant
ill Counſellors, and invading Popiſh Forces (<hi>who now Murther, Rob, Spoile, Sacke,
Depopulate the Kingdome in a moſt Hoſtile manner, to ſet up Tyranny, Popery, and
an Arbitrary lawleſſe Government,</hi>) in caſe they come armed with his perſonall preſence,
or commiſſion, to execute theſe their wicked illegall deſignes; <hi>Eſpecially,</hi> when neither the
Parliament nor their forces in this their reſiſtance, have the leaſt thought at all, to offer any
violence, to the Kings owne perſon, or to oppoſe his Legall, iuſt Soveraigne Authority?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or ſhorter,</hi> Whether the Kings Captaines and Souldiers invading the Parliament,
and Subiects, as aforeſaid, the Parliament or Subjects (eſpecially when authorized by
an Ordinance of both Houſes) may not with a ſafe Conſcience forcibly reſiſt theſe Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
though armed with the Kings illegall Commiſſions, without his perſonall preſence;
or with his preſence and Commiſſions too? And for my part, I thinke it moſt evident,
that they may lawfully reſiſt, repulſe them, even by Divine Authority. <hi>For the better
clearing whereof, I ſhall premiſe theſe three undeniable Concluſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That no lawfull King or Monarch whatſoever, (much leſſe the Kings of
<hi>England,</hi> who are no abſolute Princes) have any the leaſt Authority from the Lawes
of God or man, perſonally by themſelves, or inſtruments, to doe any injurie or
iniuſtice to their Subiects; how much leſſe then by open Force to Murther, Rob,
Plunder, Raviſh, Ruine, or Spoile them of their Lawes, Liberties, Eſtates, Religion,
all which is plentifully proved by Law Authorities, in the premiſes; and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

and Subjects every where, is ſuch. Therefore it may juſtly with a ſafe Conſcience be
reſiſted; eſpecially in the Kings Commanders and Souldiers, who are neither the King
himſelf, nor the Higher Powers ordained by God; and no other then plain Theeves
and Murtherers in Law and Conſcience, if they plunder, kill, ſpoile; their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being but Nullities in both; and they in this particular meere private men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Authority to iuſtifie their actions, as I have already proved.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> That reſiſtance which is warranted by direct Precedents recorded, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
in Scripture even by God himſelf, muſt queſtionleſſe be lawfull in caſe of co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But the reſiſtance even of Kings, their higheſt Magiſtrates, officers in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of their unjuſt Commands is thus warranted. Therfore, doubtles, it muſt be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in point of Conſcience. The <hi>Minor</hi> (only queſtionable) is thus confirmed. Firſt, by
the notable example of the Prophet <hi>Elijah, 2 Kings</hi> 1. 2. to 16. who ſending backe
King <hi>Ahaziah</hi> his Meſſengers (ſent by him to enquire of <hi>Baal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>zebub</hi> the God of
<hi>Ekron, whether hee ſhould recover of his diſeaſe</hi>) with an harſh Meſſage to the
King, contrary to his Command, which they diſobeyed; thereupon this King, in
an angry fume, ſent <hi>two Captaines with 50. men apeece,</hi> one after another, <hi>to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Prophet for this affront;</hi> (as<note n="g" place="margin">Antiq. Iud. lib. 9. cap. 1. Ipſe Prophetae cum minatus vim eſſet, ut ni ſponte ſua faciat, vi co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actum eo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahat. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> with other Interpreters accord,)
who comming with their forces to him, ſaid; <hi>Thou man of God, the King hath ſaid,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115430:38"/>
come downe quickly.</hi> To whom he ſucceſſively anſwered: <hi>If I be a man of God, then
let fire come downe from Heaven, and conſume thee and thy fifty; And there came fire
from heaven thereupon, and conſumed two Captaines and their fifties:</hi> but the <hi>third Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and his fifty, who humbled themſelves to the Prophet, and begged the ſparing of their
lives,</hi> were ſpared; <hi>the Angel of the Lord bidding the Prophet to goe downe with them
to the King, and not be afraid.</hi> From which Text it is infallible, even by a divine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
from heaven, doubled by God himſelfe; That it is lawfull for Subjects in ſome
caſes, to reſiſt the unjuſt violence of the Souldiers and Captaines of their Kings
though armed with their Regall Commands. Secondly, by the Hiſtory of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Eliſha, 2 Kings</hi> 6. 31, 32, 33. Who when <hi>King Ioram</hi> (his Soveraigne) had
ſworne unjuſtly in his fury; <hi>God doe ſo to me and more alſo, if the head of Eliſha
ſhall ſtand on him this day;</hi> and thereupon ſent <hi>a Meſſenger before him to Eliſha his
houſe to take away his head;</hi> the Prophet was ſo farre from ſubmitting to this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his; that he <hi>Commanded the Elders ſitting then with him in the houſe, to looke
when the Meſſenger came, and ſhut the doore, and <hi>Hold him faſt at the Doore,</hi> though
the ſound of his Maſters feet</hi> (the King) <hi>were behind him;</hi> whom he ſtiles, <hi>the ſonne
of a Murderer.</hi> Might theſe two eminenteſt Prophets thus openly reſiſt the Captaines,
Souldiers, and unjuſt Executioners of their Princes, with a good Conſcience; and
may not others lawfully doe the like? No doubt they may. Thirdly, (If I bee
not much miſtaken) this kind of reſiſtance is warranted even by Chriſt himſelfe,
and his Apoſtles: For a little before his Apprehention, Chriſt uttered this ſpeech un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Diſciples, <hi>Luke 22. 36, 37, 38. But <hi>Now,</hi> he that hath no Sword, let him ſell
his garment and buy one, &amp;c.—And they ſaid, Lord, behold, here are two Swords. And
he ſaid unto them, it is enough.</hi> Why would Chriſt have his Diſciples buy Swords
now, unleſſe it were for his and their owne better Defence, being the time when he
was to be apprehended.<note n="h" place="margin">Matth. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Iohn 18.</note> 
               <hi>Soone after this</hi> Judas <hi>and his Band of men ſent from the
High Prieſts, with Swords and Staves came to ſeize upon Chriſt.</hi> Which <hi>when they
who were about him ſaw what would follow: They ſaid unto him; Lord, ſhall we ſmite
with the Sword?</hi> His commanding them to buy Swords now, was ſufficient ground
for this queſtion, and intimation enough, that they might now uſe them: whereupon
Chriſt giving no negative anſwer; <hi>One of them which were with Ieſus</hi> (and <hi>John</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaith it was <hi>Peter</hi>) ſmote a ſervant of the High Prieſt (whoſe name was <hi>Malchus</hi>)
and cut off his <hi>right eare.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Suffer yee <hi>Thus Farre:</hi>
               </hi>
So<note n="i" place="margin">Luc. 22. 50. 51.</note> 
               <hi>Luke; Marke</hi> relates no anſwer at all reprehending this fact:<note n="k" place="margin">Iohn 18. 10. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> records his
ſpeech to <hi>Peter</hi> thus. <hi>Then, ſaid Ieſus unto Peter, Put up thy Sword into the ſheath. The
Cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drinke?</hi> To which <hi>Matthew</hi> addes,
<note n="l" place="margin">Math. 26. 52 53.</note> 
               <hi>thinkinſt thou that I cannot pray to my Father, and he ſhall preſently give me more then
twelve Legions of Angels?</hi> But how <hi>then ſhall the Scriptures bee fulfilled, that thus it
muſt be?</hi> So that the reaſon why Chriſt bade <hi>Peter</hi> thus to <hi>put up his ſword;</hi> was not
becauſe he thought defence of himſelfe, and <hi>Peters</hi> ſmiting now altogether unlawfull
in it ſelfe; but onely inconſiſtent with Gods preſent providence, which it ſhould
ſeeme to croſſe. Chriſt was now by<note n="m" place="margin">Acts 2. 23. Cap. 4. 27. 28. Luk. 24. 21. 26. 27. Iſay 53.</note> 
               <hi>Gods eternall decree, and the Scriptures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
(which muſt be neceſſarily fulfilled) to <hi>ſuffer death upon the Croſſe for our
iniquities:</hi> ſhould <hi>Peter</hi> then, with the other Diſciples have totally reſiſted his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehention
at this time, and proceeded ſtill to ſmite with the Sword as they began,
till they had reſcued our Saviour, he could not then have ſuffered, nor the Scriptures
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115430:38"/>
be fulfilled: had it not beene for this ſpeciall reaſon (rendred by Chriſt himſelfe, to
cleare all ſcruples againſt the Lawfulneſſe of ſelfe-defence in ſuch caſes,) <hi>Peter</hi> might
ſtill have uſed his ſword to reſcue his Maſter from theſe Catchpoles violence; and if
he and his fellowes had beene too weake to withſtand them, Chriſt was ſo farre from
imagining that hee might not have lawfully defended himſelfe; that hee informes
them, <hi>he could</hi> (and would no doubt) <hi>have preſently commanded whole Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
from heaven, by his Fathers approbation, to reſcue him from unjuſt violence.</hi> And
his Speech to <hi>Pilate,</hi> after his taking, plainely, iuſtifies the lawfulneſſe of ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
defence with Armes to preſerve a mans life from unjuſt execution: <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 36
<hi>If my Kingdome were of this world, <hi>Then would my Servants fight</hi>
               </hi> (in my Defence
and Reſcue) <hi>that I ſhould Not be delivered to the Iewes: <hi>but now my kingdom is not
from hence.</hi>
               </hi> All which conſidered, clearely juſtifies, the Lawfulneſſe of reſiſting the
Kings, or higher Powers Officers, in caſes of apparant unjuſt open violence or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults;
and withall anſwers one grand argument againſt reſiſtance from our Saviours
preſent Example: namely,<note n="*" place="margin">See Doct. <hi>Fernes</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. An Appeale to thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who muchrely on this ill foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt himſelfe made no reſiſtance when hee was unjuſtly
apprehended;</hi> Ergo, <hi>Chriſtians his Followers (Ergo,</hi> no Kings, no Magiſtrates too,
as well as Chriſt the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, for they are Chriſtians as
well as ſubjects;) <hi>ought not to make any forcible reſiſtance of open violence:</hi> Which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is a meere inconſequent; becauſe the reaſon why Chriſt reſiſted not theſe Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevants,
and High Prieſts Officers, was onely, <hi>that his Fathers decree, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
foretelling his Paſſion might be fulfilled,</hi> as himſelfe reſolves; not becauſe hee
deemed reſiſtance Vnlawfull, which he even then approved, though hee practiſed it
not, as theſe Texts doe fully proove.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> The lawfulneſſe of a defenſive Warre, againſt the invading Forces of
a Soveraigne, is warranted by the example of the City <hi>Abel;</hi> which ſtood out and
defended it ſelfe againſt <hi>Ioab, Davids</hi> Generall, and his Forces, when they beſieged
and battered it; till they had made their peace, with the head of <hi>Sheba</hi> who fled into
it for ſhelter, 2 <hi>Sam. 20. 14. to</hi> 23. And by that of <hi>Eſter,</hi> Ch. 8. 8. to 17. chap: 9.
1. to 17. pertinent to this purpoſe. Where <hi>Haman</hi> having gotten the Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
to be ſent unto all Provinces <hi>for the utter extirpation of the whole Nation of the
Iewes,</hi> the King after <hi>Hamans</hi> Execution (through Gods great mercy, and <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caies</hi>
and Queene <hi>Eſters</hi> diligence) to prevent this bloody maſſacre by their Enemies,
granted to the Iewes in every City, by Letters under his Seale, <q>To gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
together, and to ſtand for their lives, to deſtroy, to ſlay, and to cauſe to periſh
all the power of the people and Province <hi>That would Aſſault them,</hi> both litle ones
and women, and to take the ſpoile of them for a prey; and that the Iewes ſhould
be ready againſt the day, to avenge themſelves of their enemies. <hi>Hereupon</hi> when
the day, that the Kings Commandment and Decree (<hi>for their extirpation</hi>) drew neere
to be put in execution, in the day that the enmies of the Iewes hoped to have
power over them; the Iewes gathered themſelves together in their Cities, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the Provinces of King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> to lay hand on ſuch as ſought their hurt;
and no man could withſtand them, for the feare of them fell upon all people: And
all the Rulers of the Provinces, and the Lieutenants, Deputies, and Officers of the
King helped the Iewes, becauſe the feare of <hi>Mordecai</hi> fell upon them: So the Iewes
ſmote all their enemies with the ſtroake of the Sword, and ſlaughter, and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and did what they would unto thoſe that hated them. In the Palace they ſlew
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115430:39"/>
eight hundred men, and <hi>Hamans</hi> tenne ſonnes, on ſeverall dayes. And the other
Iewes that were in the Provinces, gathered themſelves together, and <hi>Stood for
their Lives,</hi> and had reſt from their enemies, and ſlew of their foes ſeventy and
five thouſand, but they laid not their hands on the prey.</q> Loe here a Defenſive war,
juſtified, and granted lawfull, by the Kings owne Letters to the Iewes, againſt their
enemies, who by former Charters from him, had Commiſſion wholly to extirpate
them. Neither had this licence of the King in point of Conſcience, been lawfull, had
their defence and reſiſtance of the Kings former Commiſſion been wholly unlawfull.
And the reaſon of the Kings grant to them, to reſiſt and ſlay their Enemies, that
would aſſault them; was not ſimply, becauſe their reſiſtance without it, and ſtanding for
their lives, had beene unlawfull, by reaſon of the Kings firſt unjuſt Decree, which
they ought not in Conſcience to ſubmit to, without repugnancy; But onely to enable
the Iewes, then Captives, and ſcattered abroad one from another in every Province,
with more convenience, ſecuritie, boldneſſe, and courage now to joyne their forces
together, to reſiſt their malicious potent enemies; to daunt them the more thereby;
Nature it ſelfe, yea, and all Lawes in ſuch a bloody Nationall Butchery as this, without
any juſt cauſe at all, both taught and enabled every one of the Iewes, to <hi>ſtand for his life,</hi>
his Nations, Religions, preſervation, even to the laſt drop of blood. Therefore the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the King did not ſimply enable them to reſiſt their enemies, which they might
have done without them; but give them Authority to <hi>deſtroy, and ſlay the Wives and
little children of their Enemies, and to take the ſpoile of them for a prey;</hi> which they
refuſed to doe, becauſe they deemed it unjuſt, notwithſtanding the Kings permiſſion
and conceſſion, which as to theſe particulars, was illegall, and more then hee could
juſtly grant. This generall Nationall reſiſtance of Gods own people then of their
aſſaulting cruell Enemies, even among Strangers, in the land of their Captivity under
a forraigne Enemy, with the former and other following precedents, will queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
more then conjecturally prove, if not infallibly reſolve, The lawfulneſſe of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Defenſive Warre, and oppoſition by free Subiects, againſt their Kings aſſailing
Forces which ſeekes their ruine, though armed with their Kings Commiſſion, and
that without any Ordinance of Parliament authoriſing them to reſiſt, much more then,
when enabled to oppoſe them by Ordinances of both Houſes; as the Iewes were to
reſiſt and ſlay their enemies by this Kings Letters and Authority.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> That kind of reſiſtance which hath no one Text, nor Example in Scripture
to impeach its lawfulneſſe, but many Texts and precedents to countenance it, muſt
doubtleſſe be lawfull in point of Conſcience. But the reſiſting of Kings invading pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging,
deſtructive Forces (who have nothing to plead; to juſtifie all their Villanies but
a void illegall Warrant) hath no one Text nor example in Scripture to impeach its law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,

it, they may no doubt lawfully reſiſt even with force of Armes, when they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
meanes and conveniences to reſiſt, and cannot flee or ſubmit thereto, without
the publicke ruine: ſince the ſame juſtice and equity, which enables them by flight or
ſtratagem to decline unjuſt aſſaults of a ſuperior power, or its judgements, doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
enable them to eſcape and prevent it with reſiſtance, when they cannot doe it by
flight or other policie: If then they may lawfully with a ſafe conſcience hide, flee, or
uſe lawfull policies, to prevent the open injuſt violence of their kings and their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
when not guilty of any capitall crime deſerving cenſures; becauſe by the very
light of nature, and Law of Charity they are obliged to preſerve themſelves from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt

aſſaults, or oppreſſions of others: then by the ſelfeſame reaſon, they may lawfully with
force of Armes defend themſelves againſt ſuch violent unjuſt attempts which they are
no way obliged to ſubmit unto, when as they cannot conveniently ſecure themſelves

how ſoone would they murther, impriſon, execute our Nobleſt Lords, Knights, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes,

how ſoone would our whole Kingdome become an <hi>Acheldama,</hi> a wilderneſſe, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,

Yea how ſpeedy might any private Officers, Captaines, Commanders, by colour of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legall

notorious rogues and theeves of <hi>England,</hi> under colour of being liſted in the Kings
Army, if the people might not in point of Law or Conſcience reſiſt them with Armes
who came armed for to act their villanies, maliciouſly rob, ſpoyle, plunder, murther
all the Kings leige people, without any remedy or prevention, and by this pretext,
that they are the Kings Souldiers, ſodainely ſeiſe and gaine all the armes, treaſure, forts,
ammunition, power of the Realme, into their poſſeſſions in a moment; and having
thus ſtrengthned themſelves, and ſlaine the Kings faithfull ſubjects, uſurpe the crown

deſtructive miſchiefes to People, Kingdome, Kings themſelves, God himſelfe
hath left us no other certaine, proper, ſufficient remedy but a forcible reſiſtance, which
all Kingdomes, Nations throughout the world, haue conſtantly uſed in ſuch caſes, as
I ſhall manifeſt more largely in the <hi>Appendix.</hi> Therefore certainely it muſt needs bee
lawfull, being Gods and Natures ſpeciall Ordinance to ſecure innocent perſons, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Nations, Kingdomes, Lawes, Liberties, Lives, Eſtates, Religion, and mankinde
it ſelfe, againſt the hurtfull Luſts of unnaturall Tyrants, and their accurſed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115430:40"/>
againſt ambitious, treacherous, male-contented Spirits, maliciouſly bent againſt
the publicke weale, and peace. There are two things onely which uſually reſtraine
inferiour perſons from murthering, robbing, diſſeiſing, injuring one another; the one
is, feare of puniſhment by the Magiſtrate; the other, feare and danger of being reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
repulſed with ſhame and loſſe of limbe or life by thoſe they violently aſſault,
injure; and were this once beleeved, received for Law or Divinity in the world, that
it were unlawful to reſiſt, repulſe a theefe, murtherer, riotor, or diſſeiſor comming in the
Kings name, long enjoy his life, goods, liberty, lands, but ſome or other would
deprive him of them notwithſtanding all reſtraints of Lawes, of penalties, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſuites againſt him with his owne eſtate violently ſeiſed on; the right of
lawfull defence, being every mans beſt ſecurity, to preſerve his life, eſtate, in peace
againſt the violence of another, whence the wiſdom of the Common Law, makes every
mans houſe his Caſtle, in the neceſſary defence wherof, and of his perſon, goods from
the violence, rape of others, it gives him libertie to beate, repulſe, yea kill injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
aſſailants: which right of defence if once denyed, would open a wide gap to all
wickedneſſe, injuſtice, diſorders whatſoever, and ſpeedily bring in abſolute confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſubverſion of all property, Law, Order. As for Emperors, Kings, great
Officers, and other ungodly inſtruments, armed with Princes unjuſt commiſſions,
who deeme themſelves above the reach of humane Lawes, cenſures, and accountable
for their unjuſt actions to none but God himſelfe, there is no other knowne barre or
obſtacle to hinder or reſtraine their armed violence, Tyrannie, oppreſſions, but onely
the feare of the oppreſſed aſſaulted ſubjects armed reſiſtance; which if once denyed
to be lawfull, all Royalties would ſoone be transformed into profeſſed Tyrannies, all
Kings &amp; Magiſtrates into Tyrants, all Liberty into ſlavery, property into communitie,
and every one would thereby be expoſed as a voluntary prey to the arbitrary cruelty
covetouſneſſe, avarice, luſts, of the greateſt men. Therefore doubtleſſe this armed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
cannot but be lawfull, neceſſary, juſt, in point of Law and Conſcience, to
eſchew theſe generall miſchiefes.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, all will readily grant it lawfull in caſe of Conſcience, for ſubjects to reſiſt a
forraigne enemie which invades them with force of Armes, though animated by the
King himſelfe to ſuch invaſion; and why ſo, but becauſe they are their enemies, who
would wrongfully deprive them of their native inheritance, Liberties, eſtates, and
worke them harme; upon which ground, we read in the 2 <hi>Kings 3. 21. That when the
Moabites heard that the Kings of Iſrael, Judah and Edom came up to fight againſt them
with a great Army, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward to
withſtand them, and ſtood in the border;</hi> and when ever the <hi>Midianites, Philiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Babylonians, AEgyptians, Cananites</hi> or other enemies came to aſſault the <hi>Jſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
they preſently aſſembled together in Armes to encounter and repulſe them, as
the Hiſtories of <hi>Joſhua, Judges, Samuel,</hi> the <hi>Kings, Chronicles,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
evidence, almoſt in every Chapter. If then Subjects may with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
reſiſt forragin enemies on this ground alone; then likewiſe domeſtick foes and
their Kings own Forces, when they become open enemies, to rob, kill, plunder, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them as inhumanely, as injuriouſly as the worſt Forraigne foes, there being the
ſelfe ſame ground for the lawfulneſſe of reſiſtance of the one as the other, and if the
ballance encline to one ſide more than other, an inteſtine enemie being more unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
unjuſt, hurtfull, dangerous, and tranſgreſſing more Lawes of the Realme
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115430:41"/>
(which obliege not ſtrangers) than a Forraigner, and a Civill warre being far worſe,
and more deſtructive than a Forraigne; the reſiſtance of an homebred enemy, muſt
be the more juſt and lawfull of the two, even in point of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The very Law of God both alloweth and commands all men, to reſiſt
their ſpirituall enemies, with ſpirituall Armes: <hi>Jam 4. 7. Reſiſt the Devill and he will

brethren be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might: Put on the whole Armour
of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the devill. For we wreſtle</hi> (or

Rulers of the darkneſſe of this world, againſt Spirituall wickedneſſe</hi> (or wicked ſpirits)

to withſtand in the evill day, and having done all, to ſtand: Stand therefore having
your loynes girded about with truth, &amp;c. Above all taking the ſheild of faith, wherewith
ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked; And take the helmes of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

God to deliveer them from their <hi>AEgyptian</hi> bondage, after 430. yeares captivity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of demanding but three dayes liberty to goe into the wilderneſſe to ſerve
the Lord, and <hi>Pharoah,</hi> (notwithſtanding all Gods Miracles and Plagues,) refuſing ſtill
to let them depart, till enforced to it by the ſlaughter of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> firſt borne;
as ſoone as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were marching away, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>AEgyptians, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of their departure,</hi> purſued them with their Chariots and Horſes, and a great army
even to the red Sea, to reduce them; here upon the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being aſtoniſhed and
murmuring againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> giving themſelves all for dead men; <hi>Moſes ſayd unto the
people feare ye not, ſtand ſtill, and ſee the Salvation of the Lord, which he will ſhew to you
this day: for the AEgyptians whom you have ſeene to day, ye ſhall ſee them againe no more
for ever, the Lord ſhall fight for you, &amp;c. And hereupon God himſelfe diſcomfited rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and drowned them all in the red Sea:</hi> I would demaund in this caſe, whether the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
might not here lawfully (for their owne redemption from unjuſt bondage) have
fought againſt and reſiſted their Lord, King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his invading Hoſt, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115430:43"/>
with his preſence, had they had power and hearts to doe it, as well as God
himſelfe, who fought againſt and deſtroyed them on their behalfe; If ſo, (as all men
I thinke muſt grant, unleſſe they will cenſure God himſelfe) then a defenſive warre
in reſpect of life and liberty onely, is juſt and Lawfull even in conſcience, by this
moſt memorable ſtory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> by that example recorded <hi>Iudges</hi> 3. 8. 9. 10. where God growing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for their Apoſtacie and Idolatry, ſold them (here was a divine
title) into the hands of <hi>Cuſhan-Riſhathaim</hi> King of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and the children
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſerved him 8. yeares. Here was a lawfull title by conqueſt and 8 yeeres ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
ſeconding it. But when the <hi>children of Iſrael cryed unto the Lord, the Lord raiſed
up a deliverer to them even Othniel, the ſonne of Kenaz: and the Spirit of the Lord came
upon him, and he went out to warre, and the Lord delivered Cuſhan-riſhatiam King of
Meſopotamia into his hands, and his hand prevailed againſt him, ſo the land had reſt</hi> 40.
<hi>yeeres.</hi> Loe here a juſt defenſive warre approved and raiſed up by God and his Spirit
(in an ordinary manner only, as I take it, by encouraging the Inſtruments) wherein
a conquering King, for Redemption former liberties, is not onely reſiſted but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
taken priſoner, and his former dominion abrogated, by thoſe that ſerved
him, as conquered ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> by the example of <hi>Ehud,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Iudges chap. 3. 11. to 31
where we finde, God himſelf ſtrengthning <hi>Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab</hi> againſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
for their ſinnes, who thereupon gathering an Army ſmote <hi>Iſrael,</hi> poſſeſſed their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ſo as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſerved this King 18. yeeres. Here was a title by conqueſt,
approved by God, ſubmitted to by the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> yet after all this, when the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cryed unto the Lord, he raiſed them up a deliverer, namely <hi>Ehud,</hi> who
ſtabbing <hi>Eglonn</hi> the King in the belly, under pretext of private conference with him,
and eſcaping; he therupon blew the trumpet, commanded the Iſraelites to follow
him to the warre, ſlew ten thouſand valiant men of <hi>Moah,</hi> which he ſubdued, and
procured reſt to his Country 40. yeeres. God, his Spirit, Word, approving this
his action.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> by the example of <hi>Barack</hi> and Deborah, Iudges <hi>ch.</hi> 4. and 5. Where God
ſelling the children of Iſrael for their ſinnes into the hand of <hi>Iabin</hi> King of <hi>Cannan;</hi>
and his Captaine <hi>Siſera,</hi> for 20. yeeres ſpace, during which he mightily oppreſſed
them, hereupon <hi>Barack,</hi> at the inſtigation of the Propheteſſe <hi>Deborah,</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Lord God of Iſrael, gathered an Army of ten thouſand men; which
<hi>Siſera,</hi> and the King of <hi>Canaan</hi> hearing of; aſſembled all their Chariots and Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
at the River of <hi>Kiſhon,</hi> where the Lord diſcomfited <hi>Siſera</hi> and all his
Hoſt, with the edge of the ſword before <hi>Barack</hi> his Army, and ſubdued <hi>Iabin</hi> the
King of <hi>Canaan,</hi> before the children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> which warre is by a ſpeciall Song of
<hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barack</hi> highly extolled, and God in it, as moſt juſt and honorable: and
this curſe denounced againſt thoſe that refuſed to aſſiſt in it, <hi>Iudges 4. 23. Curſe ye

juſtifie the lawfulneſſe of a juſt defenſive warre?</p>
            <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6.</note> by the Example of <hi>Gideon</hi> and the Iſraelites, Iudges c. 6. Who being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115430:43"/>

incouragement and direction from God himſelfe, with a poore deſpicable Army
of 300. men, defeated the great Hoaſt of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and tooke and ſlew their
Princes. By theſe 4 laſt pregnant preſidents, it is moſt evident, that a forraigne King
who hath gained a Title onely by conqueſt (though with divine concurrence, by
way of puniſhment for that peoples ſinne) may lawfully be reſiſted, repulſed, even
after ſome yeares forced ſubjection and ſubmiſſion to him, by the people conquered, to
regaine their former liberties.</p>
            <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7.</note> by the precedent of <hi>Abimelech</hi> King of <hi>Shechem,</hi> who being elected
King by the voluntary aſſents of the people, God afterwards ſending an evill ſpirit
of diviſion between <hi>Abimelech</hi> and the men of <hi>Shechem;</hi> thereupon they revolted from
him, and chuſing <hi>Gael</hi> for their Captaine, fortified the City againſt him; and when
<hi>Abimelech</hi> came with an Army to take in the Towne, they in their defence, went
forth and fought with him; reſiſted his ſeige; and they of the Tower of <hi>Shechem</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

ſlew him:</hi> whereupon he thruſt him through, that he dyed: and ſo every man
departed to his place. Thus God rendred the wickedneſſe of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and all the

            <p>Eightly,<note place="margin">8.</note> by the example of <hi>Iepthah,</hi> who after that God had ſold the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for

<hi>Sam.</hi> 7. and approved, nay, wrought by God.</p>
            <p>Tenthly,<note place="margin">10.</note> by the Example of <hi>David,</hi> who being perſecuted by fedifragous diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

Soone after the <hi>Philiſtimes</hi> beſeiging <hi>Keilah, David</hi> by Gods encouragement, ſmote
them and ſaved <hi>Keilah;</hi> intending there to ſecure himſelfe and his men: which <hi>Saul</hi>
hearing of, ſaid; <hi>God hath delivered him into my hands; for he is ſhut in by entring into a

Towne which hath gates and barres, whereupon he called all the people together to beſeige
David and his men:</hi> (which he needed not doe, did he or any elſe beleeve, that they
would not, ought not to have made any forcible reſiſtance:) <hi>David</hi> informed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
enquired ſeriouſly of God, whether <hi>Saul</hi> would certainely come downe? and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
twice of him: <hi>will the men of Keila deliver me and my men up into his hand?</hi>
And the Lord ſaid, <hi>they will deliver thee up.</hi> Had not <hi>David</hi> and his men reſolved to
fortifie and defend themſelves there, if the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would have beene faithfull
to them, and beleeved they might have reſiſted <hi>Saul</hi> with his Forces, certainely he
would never have preſumed to aske ſuch a queſtion twice together of God himſelfe,
to receive his reſolution therein, neither would God have vouchaſed an anſwere
thereto: but his double inquirie, and Gods reſolution, infallibly demonſtrate his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to reſiſt, and the lawfulnes of his defenſive reſiſtance, would the <hi>Keilites</hi> have
adhered to him. This the very next words fully cleare, 1 <hi>Sam. 23. 13. Then David
and his men, about ſix hundred aroſe, and departed out of Keilah, and went whereſoever
they could goe, and it was told Saul, the David was eſcaped from Keilah:</hi> Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the <hi>Keilites</hi> treachery was the onely cauſe of their departure thence, where
they had reſolved to defend themſelves, of which hope being diſappointed beyond
expectation, they want whither ſoever they could goe. After which <hi>David</hi> and his
men being but few in number, not able in humane probability, without tempting
God, to encounter <hi>Sauls</hi> great Forces, retired themſelves into woods, mountaines,
rocks, ſtrong holds, wilderneſſes; where <hi>Saul</hi> purſuing them, they ſtill declined
him: but had he and his army ever aſſaulted them, no doubt they would and might
lawfully have defended themſelves, elſe why did they joyne themſelves in a body?
why retire to ſtrong holds, and places of advantage? why<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 23 13. to 29. c. 24. 1. to 20.</note> twice urge <hi>David</hi> to

within his danger? Why did <hi>David</hi> himſelfe, ſay, even when he ſpared his
life when he was a ſleepe, 1 <hi>Sam. 26. 10. As the Lord liveth, the Lord ſhall ſmite him,
or his day ſhall come to dye, or he ſhall deſcend into battell and periſh?</hi> but that if he had
given him battle, he might have defended himſelfe againſt him, though <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould
caſually or wilfully periſh in the fight? And why was <hi>David</hi> ſo importunate to goe
up againſt him with King <hi>Achiſh</hi> to the battle wherein he periſhed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29. were
reſiſtance of him, in caſe he aſſaulted him, and his Forces utterly unlawfull? This prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of <hi>David</hi> then, if rightly weighed, is very punctuall to prove the juſtneſſe of a
defenſive warre, (of which more anon) and no evidence at all againſt it.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly,<note place="margin">11.</note> by the practiſe of the 10 Tribes: who after their revolt from <hi>Rehoboam</hi>

            <p>Finally, by the Hiſtory of the Maccabees and whole ſtate of the Iews defenſive wars
under them, which though but Apochryphall in regard of the compiler, yet no doubt
they had a divine Spirit concurring with them in reſpect of the managing and Actors

conquering Ieruſalem, ſpoyled it and the Temple, ſet up Heatheniſh cuſtomes and
Idolatry in it, ſubverted Gods worſhip deſtroyed the Bookes of Gods Law, forced
the people to forſake God, to ſacrifice to Idols ſlew and perſecuted all that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and exerciſed all manner of Tyranny againſt them. Hereupon <hi>Mattathias</hi> a
Prieſt and his Sonnes, moved with a godly zeale, refuſing to obey the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in falling away from the Religion of his Fathers, ſlew a Iew that ſacrificed to
an Idoll in his preſence, together with the Kings Commiſſary, who compelled men
to Sacrifice, and pulled downe their Idolatrous Altar; which done they fled into the
mountaines, whither all the well-affected Iewes repaired to them. Whereupon the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115430:45"/>
Kings Forces hearing the premiſes purſued them, and warred againſt them on the
Sabbath day; whereupon they out of an over-nice ſuperſtition<note n="o" place="margin">1 Mac. 2, 32. to 42.</note> leaſt they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane

caſt a ſtone at them, nor ſtopped the places where they were hid, but ſaid, let us
dye all in our innocencie; heaven and earth ſhall teſtifie for us, that your put us to death
wrongfully, whereupon they ſlew both them, their wives, and children, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
to the number of a thouſand perſons. Which <hi>Mattathias</hi> and the reſt of their
friends hearing of, mourned for them right ſore, and ſaid one to another (marke their
ſpeech) if we all doe as our brethren have done, and fight not for our lives, and
Lawes againſt the Heathen, they will now quickly roote us out of the earth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they decreed, ſaying; whoſoever ſhall come to make battle with us on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day, we will fight againſt him, neither will we doe all as our brethren, that were
murthered in their ſecret places. Whereupon they preſently gathered and united their
Forces, aſſaulted their enemies, recovered their Cities, Lawes, Liberties; defended
themſelves manfully, and fought many battles with good ſucceſſe againſt the ſeverall
kings who invaded and layd claime to their Country, as you may reade at large in the
bookes of Maccabees. All theſe examples, (moſt of them mannaged by the moſt pious,
religious perſons of thoſe dayes, preſcribed and aſſiſted by God himſelfe, whoſe
Spirit ſpecially encouraged, ſtrengthned the hands and Spirits of the undertakers of
them (as<note n="p" place="margin">Enchirid. Controverſ. c. 9. De Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat. Polit.</note> 
               <hi>Oſiander</hi> well obſerves,) and therefore cannot be condemned as unjuſt,
without blaſphemy and impiety:) in my opinion are a moſt cleare demonſtration of
the lawfulneſſe of a defenſive warre (in point of Divinity and Conſcience) againſt
Kings and their Armies who wrongfully invade or aſſault their Subjects, though
themſelves be perſonally preſent in their armies, to countenance their unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
warres; and likewiſe evidence, that a Royall title gotten forcibly by conqueſt
onely, though continued ſundry yeares, is not ſo valid in point of conſcience, but that
it may be ſafely queſtioned, yea rejected; there being no true lawfull Title of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignety
over any people, but that which originally depends upon their owne free
election, and unconſtrained ſubjection ſimply conſidered, or which is ſubſequently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
therewith after a poſſeſſion got by force or conqueſt.</p>
            <p>Now that the kings perſonall preſence cannot juſtifie the unjuſt actions, or protect
the perſons of thoſe that aſſiſt him in any unlawfull action contrary to the Lawes of
God, or the Realme, is a truth ſo evident, that it needes no proofe, it being no part of
the kings Royall prerogative or Office, but diametrally repugnant to it, either to doe
injury himſelfe, or to authorize, or protect others in committing it, as I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
proved at large. Therefore it can adminiſter no patronage nor defence at all to
thoſe who accompany his perſon in the unjuſt invaſions of his Subjects, nor diſ-able
them to defend or repulſe their unjuſt aſſaults and rapines. For ſuppoſe a King ſhould
ſo farre degenerate and diſhonour himſelfe, as perſonally to accompany a packe of
theeves who ſhould rob his ſubjects on the high way, break up their houſes in the night,
or practiſe Piracie on the Sea, or commit Rapes or murthers on his people every
where; I thinke no man ſo voyd of Reaſon, Law, Conſcience, but would readily grant,
that the Subjects in all theſe caſes might lawfully defend themſelves by force againſt
theſe Robbers, Theeves, Murtherers, notwithſtanding the Kings preſence or aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

OF THE PRINCE HIMSELFE THVS FARRE, to ward his blowes, to
hold his hands and the like: not to endanger his perſon, not to returne blowes; no: for
though it be naturall to defend a mans ſelfe, yet the whole common-wealth is concerned in
his perſon:</hi> the king therefore himſelfe, (much more in his Cavalliers) may thus farre
at leaſt ſafely be reſiſted in point of conſcience. And that he may be ſo indeed is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
by two pregant Scripture examples, The firſt is that of King <hi>Saul, 1 Sam</hi> 14.
38. to 46. where <hi>Ionathan</hi> and his Armour-bearer, routing the Philiſtimes whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
violated his Father <hi>Sauls</hi> command, of which he was wholy ignorant in taking a
little honey one the end of his ſticke in the purſuite; hereupon king <hi>Saul,</hi> moſt
raſhly and unjuſtly vowed twice one after another, to put him to death: whereupon
the people much diſcontented with this injuſtice, were ſo farre from ſubmitting to
the Kings pleaſure in it, that they preſently ſaid to the king: <hi>ſhall Jonathan dye, who
hath wrought ſo great Salvation in Iſrael? God forbid: As the Lord liveth there ſhall
not one haire of his head fall to the ground, So the people, RESCVED JONATHAN
that he dyed not;</hi> though he were not onely King <hi>Sauls</hi> Subject, but Sonne too. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
it appeares not in the Text, that <hi>Saul</hi> offered any violence to <hi>Ionathans</hi> perſon,
or the people to <hi>Sauls:</hi> and it may be the peoples peremptory vow and unanimous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to defend <hi>Jonathan,</hi> from this unjuſt ſentence of death againſt him, made <hi>Saul</hi>
deſiſt from his vowed bloody intendment: but the word <hi>reſcued,</hi> with other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in the ſtory, ſeeme to intimate, that <hi>Ionathan</hi> was in hold to be put to death,
and that the people forcibly reſcued him, out of the executioners hands. However,
certainely their vow and ſpeeches declare, that if <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe or any other by his
commanded had aſſaulted <hi>Ionathan</hi> to take away his life, they<note n="*" place="margin">Joſephas Antiq. Judae <hi>l. 4. c. 8, p.</hi> 104.</note> would have forcibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
them and preſerved his life, though with loſſe of their owne, beleeving they
might lawfully doe it, elſe they would not have made this reſolute vow; nor could
they have performed it, had <hi>Saul</hi> wilfully proceeded, but by a forcible reſcue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of his perſonall violence. The other is that of king <hi>Vzziah, 2 Chron.</hi> 27. 16.
to 22. who preſumptuouſly going into the Temple againſt Gods Law, to burne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
on the Altar, <hi>Azariah</hi> the high Prieſt, and with him foureſcore Prieſts of the
Lord, that were valiant men went in after him, and WITHSTOOD (or reſiſted)
<hi>Vzziah</hi> the king; and ſaid unto him; <hi>It appertaineth not unto thee Vzziah to burne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
unto the Lord, but to the Prieſts the ſonnes of Aaron, that are conſecrated to burne

from the Lord God. Then Vzziah was wroth, and had a cenſor in his hand to burne
incenſe, and whiles he was wroth with the Prieſts, the Leproſie roſe up in his forehead:
And Azariah, and all the Prieſts looked upon him, and behold he was Leprous in
his forehead: AND THEY THRVST HIM OVT FROM THENCE; yea
himſelfe haſted alſo to goe out, becauſe the Lord had ſmitten him.</hi> If then theſe Prieſts
thus actually reſiſted King <hi>Vzziah</hi> in this ſinfull Act, thruſting him perforce out of the
Temple when he would but offer incenſe; much more might they, would they have
done it, had he violently aſſaulted their perſons. If any king ſhall unjuſtly aſſault the
perſons of any private Subjects, men or women, to violate their lives or chaſtities
(over which they have no power) I make no doubt, that they may and ought to bee
reſiſted, repulſed, even in point of conſcience, but not ſlaine; though many kings
have loſt their lives, upon ſuch occaſions: as<note n="s" place="margin">Philip. de Melanct, Chr. l. 4. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Beards <hi>Theatre of Gods Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment l. 2. c. 29. p.</hi> 400.</note> 
               <hi>Rodoaldus</hi> the 8. king of <hi>Lumbardy
Anno</hi> 659. being taken in the very act of adultery by the adultereſſes husband, was
ſlaine by him without delay; and how kings attempting to murther private Subjects
unjuſtly, have themſelves beene ſometimes wounded, and caſually ſlaine, is ſo riſe in

the Lawes; and if he addicted himſelfe to theſe things more than was fitting. HE
WAS TO BE RESISTED, leaſt he became more powerfull then was expedient

offered to them or any aſſault upon them. Ergo (marke the Non-ſence of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation)
no Subjects may lawfully take up meere neceſſary defenſive Armes in any
caſe to reſiſt the bloody Tyrannie, Oppreſſion, and outrages of wicked Princes, or
their Cavalleires, when they make warre upon them to deſtroy or enſlave them.</p>
            <p>An Argument much like this in ſubſtance.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> No man ought to riſe up againſt an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Officer or Captaine in the due execution of his Office, when he offers him no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury

or murtherer, and felloniouſly aſſaults him, to rob him of his purſe, or cut his
throate. Or, private men muſt not cauſeleſly mutinie againſt a lawfull Magiſtrate
for doing juſtice and performing his duty: <hi>Ergo</hi> the whole Kingdome in Parliament
may not in Conſcience reſiſt the Kings Captaines and Cavalleeres, when they moſt
unnaturally and impiouſly aſſault them to take away their Lives, Liberties, Priviledges,
Eſtates, Religion, oppoſe and reſiſt juſtice, and bring the whole Kingdome to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deſolation. The very recitall of this argument is an ample ſatisfactory refutation
of it, with this addition. Theſe ſeditious Levites Rebelled againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi>
onely becauſe God himſelfe had reſtrained them from medling with the Prieſts Office
which they would contemptuouſly uſurpe, and therefore were moſt ſeverely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

Gods Ordinances, Religion, Lawes, Liberties, make the leaſt reſiſtance againſt the
king or his invading forces, under paine of Rebellion, High Treaſon, and eternall
condemnation, This is Doctor <hi>Fernes</hi> and ſome others, Bedlam Logicke, &amp; Divinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next is this,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the firſt text pertaines properly to Judges and other ſorts of Rulers, not
to Kings, not then in being among the Iſraelites: the ſecond, to <hi>rich men as well as
Kings.</hi> They may as well argue then from theſe texts: that no Iudges nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulers,
nor rich men whatſoever, though never ſo unjuſt or wicked, may or ought in
conſcience to be reſiſted in their unjuſt aſſaults, Riots, Robberies, no though they be
bent to ſubvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties: as that the King and his Souldiers joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or ſeverally conſidered, may not be reſiſted: yea, theſe acute diſputants may argue
further by this new kinde of Logicke: Chriſtians are expreſly prohibited to curſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
any man whatſoever, under paine of damnation, <hi>Rom. 12. 14. Mat. 5. 44. Levit.</hi>

<hi>Prov. 20. 20. 1 Cor. 6. 10 1 Cor. 4. 12. 1 Pet. 2. 23. Jude 9. Ergo,</hi> we ought to
reſiſt no man whatſoever, (no not a theefe that would rob us, cut-throate Cavaleers
that would murther us, lechers that would raviſh us) under paine of damnation.
What pious profitable Doctrine, thinke you, is this: All curſings and railings are
ſimply unlawfull in themſelves: all reſiſtance is not ſo, eſpecially that neceſſary we
now diſcourſe of, againſt unlawfull violence to ruine Church and State. To argue
therefore, all reſiſtance is ſimply unlawfull, becauſe curſing and reviling (of a different
nature) are ſo, is ill Logicke, and worſe Divinity. If the objectors will limit their
reſiſtance, (to make the Argument ſenſible,) and propoſe it thus: All curſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115430:48"/>
of Kings and Rulers for executing juſtice impartially (for ſo is the chiefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
of the place objected, delinquents being apt to clamour againſt thoſe who
juſtly cenſure them) is unlawfull; <hi>Ergo</hi> the forcible reſiſting of them in the execution
of juſtice and their lawfull authority is unlawfull: the ſequell I ſhall grant, but
the Argument will be wholy impertinent, which I leave to the Objectors to
refine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third Argument is this:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> That which peculiarly belongs to God, no man without
his ſpeciall authority ought to meddle with:<note n="p" place="margin">An Appeale to thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. p. 2.</note> 
               <hi>But</hi> taking up Armes peculiarly belongeth
to he Lord. Deut 32. 35. <hi>Where the Lord ſaith,</hi> vengeance is mine: eſpecially the
ſword, which of all temporall vengeance is the greateſt.</p>
            <p>The Objector puts no <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> or concluſion to it, becauſe it concludes nothing at all
to purpoſe, but onely this. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The King and Cavalleeres muſt lay downe their
Armes and ſwords, becauſe God never gave them any ſpeciall commiſſion to take
them up. Or, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no man but God muſt weare a ſword, at leaſt of revenge; and

            <p>

ſtand not in an evill thing; for he doth whatſoever pleaſeth him: where the word of a king
is there is power; and who may ſay unto him, what doſt thou?</p>
            <p>This Text adminiſters the Oppoſites a double Argument,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> The firſt is this; All the
Kings Commands are to be kept of all his Subjects, by vertue of the Oathes of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
alleigance, and the late proteſtation including them both: <hi>Ergo,</hi> by vertue of
theſe Oathes we muſt not reſiſt his Cavalleeres, but yeeld our thoates to their ſwords,
our purſes and eſtates to their rapines, our chaſtities to their Lecheries, our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to their Tyrannies, our Lawes to their luſts, our Religion to their Popiſh Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
and Blaſphemies, without any oppoſition, becauſe the king hath oft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us not to reſiſt them. But ſeeing the Oath and Law of God, and thoſe oathes
of ours, obleige us onely, to obey the Kings juſt legall commands and no other, not
the Commands and luſts of evill Councellors and Souldiers, this firſt Argument muſt
be better pointed ere it will wound our cauſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, this: The king may lawfully do whatſoever pleaſeth him <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither
are He, or his Forces to be reſiſted. To which I anſwer, that this verſe relates onely
unto God, the next antecedent; <hi>who onely doth and may doe what he pleaſeth, and that
both in heaven and earth, Pſal. 135. 6. Pſal. 115. 3 Eſay</hi> 46. 10. not to Kings who
neither may nor can doe what they pleaſe in either, being bound both by the Laws of
God, man, and their Coronation Oathes (perchance the oath of God here meant, rather

not, that a king may lawfully doe what he pleaſeth: but he doth whatſoever pleaſeth

               <hi>Scripture;</hi> was all therefore juſt,
lawfull, unblameable, becauſe they did herein whatſoever they pleaſed, not what was
pleaſing to God? If not, as all muſt grant: then your foundation failes; that Kings
may lawfully doe whatſoever they will; and <hi>Solomons</hi> words muſt be taken all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not by fragments; and theſe latter words coupled with the next preceeding;
<hi>Stand not in an evill matter:</hi> and then <hi>Pauls</hi> words will well interpret his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4.
<hi>But if thou doe that which is evill be afraid, for he beareth not the ſword in vaine, for he is
the miniſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon them that doe evill.</hi> So that the
genuine ſence of the place is, and muſt be this. <hi>Stand not in an evill matter,</hi> for the
king path an abſolute power to doe whatſoever he pleaſeth, in way of juſtice to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
thee, if thou continue obſtinate in thy evill courſes; to pardon thee, if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,

abſolute power to murther, plunder, deſtroy his Subjects, ſubvert Religion, and
he and his Forces muſt not herein be reſiſted, is an ill conſequent from ſuch good
premiſes.</p>
            <p>The third is this: <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is power,</hi>

they might rather conclude. Therefore neither Kingdome nor Parliament, nor any
Subject or perſon whatſoever ought to demand of the king, to what end, or why he
hath raiſed Forces and Armed Papiſts againſt the Parliament, and Proteſtant Religion?
Theſe Court-Doctors might as truely conclude from hence: If the king ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

Ergo the King and his Cavaleers muſt not be ſo much as touched nor reſiſted,
I wonder they did not as well argue, <hi>Ergo</hi> none muſt henceforth kiſſe his Majeſties

him, nor his Bedchamber-men attire him, for feare of high Treaſon in touching him:
And the Cavaleers muſt not henceforth be arreſted for their debts, apprehended for
their robberies and murthers; neither muſt the Chyrurgion dreſſe their wounds, or
pock-ſoars, or otherwiſe touch them, (ſo dangerous is it to touch them, not out of fear

            <p>But to anſwer this long ſince exploded triviall Objection,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> not named by Dr <hi>Ferne,</hi>
though revived by others ſince him. I ſay firſt, that this Text concernes not kings at
all, but the <hi>true anoynted Saints of God their Subjects, whom kings have been alwayes
apt to oppreſſe and perſecute,</hi> witneſſe <hi>Pſal. 2. 2. &amp;c. Act. 4. 26. 27. Act.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3
with all ſacred and Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, ancient or moderne. This is moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
firſt, becauſe theſe words were ſpoken by <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Kings</hi> themſelves, as the Text
is expreſſe, <hi>Pſal 105 14, 15. 1 Chron. 16. 20, 21. He ſuffered no man to do them wrong,
but reproved even KINGS for their ſakes,</hi> ſaying, (even to king themſelves, namely to

<hi>Touch not mine Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm:</hi> Therefore not meant of kings.
Secondly, becauſe theſe words were ſpoken directly and immediately of <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac, Iacob,</hi> their wives and families, as it is evident by Verſe 6. the whole ſeries
of the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> which is Hiſtoricall; the forecited Texts of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to which the words
relate, the punctuall confeſſion of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and all other <hi>Expoſitors</hi> on this
<hi>Pſalm;</hi> Now neither they, nor their wives, nor their children clearly, were actuall,
much leſſe <hi>anointed Kings;</hi> For firſt, they lived long before the government of kings was
erected among the Iſraelites, of whom<note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. 8. &amp; 9. &amp; 10. ſee 1 Chron. 1. 43.</note> 
               <hi>Saul was the firſt.</hi> 2. They had no king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
nor territories of their own when theſe words were uttered, but <hi>were ſtrangers in
the Land, going from one Nation and Kingdom to another, ſojourning obſcurely like
Pilgrims and Strangers upon earth, in Egypt, and Gerar, under King</hi> Pharaoh, Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,
<hi>and other Princes,</hi> not as kings, but <hi>ſubjects and private men,</hi> as <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. 13.

Thirdly, <hi>They were but very few men in number, Verſe 12. Geneſis</hi> 34. 30.
they were Maſters onely of their own ſmall families, and that under forraign Kings;
therfore doubtleſſe no kings at all. Fourthly, this was ſpoken of theſe Patriarchs <hi>Wives
and Families,</hi> as well as of themſelves, (and they certainly were no kings, unleſſe you
will have kingdoms conſiſting onely of kings, and no ſubjects at all) <hi>Verſe 12. 14. Gen.</hi>

it) <hi>no harm:</hi> The later Clauſe, <hi>Do my Prophets no harm,</hi> being an exact interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Sixtly, Though there were kings in <hi>Abrahams</hi> dayes or before, as is evident by <hi>Gen.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Kings themſelves muſt not touch Gods ſpiritually <hi>anointed</hi> Saints and ſervants to
do them harm; <hi>Ergo,</hi> if Kings do violently and unjuſtly make warre upon them, not
onely to harm, but plunder, murther, deſtroy them utterly, extirpate that Religion they
profeſſe and are bound to maintain, they are obliged in point of conſcience, under
pain of damnation, not to reſiſt; Whereas the concluſion ſhould be directly contrary.
Therefore they may lawfully with good conſcience reſiſt them to the uttermoſt, in ſuch
caſes: For ſince God hath thus directly enjoyned Kings, <hi>Not to touch, or do them harm;</hi>
if Kings will wilfully violate this injunction, they may with ſafe conſcience, by force
of Arms withſtand, repulſe, their unjuſt violence, and hinder Kings or their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

<hi>Kings</hi>) may in their erronious ſence ſafely argue thence, That if ſubiects take up Arme
againſt their Princes, contrary to this Text, their Princes may by vertue of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
iuſtly reſiſt them with force, and repulſe their iniuries; then by the true genuine
ſence thereof (being meant of Subiects, Saints, not Kings) if Kings will violently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
and make war upon Saints, their Subiects, to harm them, they may with as good
reaſon and conſcience defend themſelves againſt their Kings and ill Inſtruments, as
their Kings protect themſelves in this ſort againſt them, and that by authoritie of this
Text, by our Oppoſites own argumentation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, admit this Scripture meant of Kings, yet what ſtrength is there in it to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115430:50"/>
them from iuſt neceſſary reſiſtance? If any, it muſt reſt in the word <hi>annointed;</hi>
but this will afford kings no ſuch corporall priviledges as many fancie, neither from
lawfull reſiſtance, nor depoſition, nor ſentence of death it ſelf, which I ſhall undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
evidence to refute a commonly received errour: For, firſt, it is apparent, that the
anointed here meant, are ſuch onely who are ſpiritually annointed, either with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
profeſſion and ceremonies of Gods true religion, or with the internall graces of
the Spirit; for neither <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob,</hi> nor their families (nor any kings
or Prieſts in their dayes) for ought we finde, were corporally annointed. Beſides,
the annointing here intended, is that which is <hi>common</hi> to<note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 30. 30. c. 40. 13, 15. Levit. 4. 3. 16. 1 King. 19. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> (as
<hi>Touch not mine annointed, and do my Prophets no harm,</hi> infallibly proves) rather then
that which is peculiar to kings. Whence I thus argue, That annointing which is
common to ſubiects as well as kings, and cannot ſecure any ſubiects, who in the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſence
of the Text, are <hi>Gods annointed,</hi> from iuſt reſiſtance, corporall violence, legall
cenſures, or death, cannot in or of it ſelf alone ſecure kings from any of theſe, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then it ſecures ſubiects: for the annointing being the ſame in both, muſt have the
ſelf-ſame operation and immunities in both. But this anointing in ſubiects can neither
exempt their perſons from neceſſary iuſt reſiſtance, if they unlawfully aſſault or war
upon their Superiours, equalls, inferiours; nor free them from arreſts, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
arraignments, deprivations, or capitall cenſures, if they offend and demerit
them, as we all know <hi>by</hi>

               <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>experience:</hi> Therefore it can tranſfer no
ſuch corporall immunities or exemptions from all or any of theſe, to kings; but onely,
exempt them from unlawfull violence and injuries, in point of right, ſo far forth, as it
doth other Subjects. In a word, this annointing being common to all Chriſtians,

he may after wards be choſen king, though for the preſent he be neither actually

none will affirm, I am certain none can prove: If ſo, then it was not <hi>Sauls</hi> annointing
but onely his Royall Authority, which made <hi>David</hi> thus to ſpare his life, his perſon.
So that our Oppoſites preſſing this Argument only from his Annointing, is both falſe
and idle, as all the premiſes demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>But to ſet the Argument right; I anſwer thirdly, That all which theſe Texts and
<hi>Davids</hi> example prove, is but this. That Subjects ought not wilfully or purpoſely to
murder or offer violence to the perſons of their kings; eſpecially in cold blood when
they doe not actually aſſault them. Ergo they may not reſiſt, repulſe their perſonall
actuall aſſaults, nor oppoſe their cut-throat Cavaleers when they make an unjuſt
warre againſt them. Which Argument is a meer <hi>Non ſequitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 1. <hi>Davids example</hi> extends only to <hi>Sauls</hi> own perſon, not to his Souldiers, who
were neither kings, nor Gods Annointed; and whom <hi>David</hi> no doubt would have
reſiſted and ſlain too had they aſſaulted him, though he ſpared <hi>Saul:</hi> as<note n="a" place="margin">Sect. 2, <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> Dr. <hi>Fern</hi>
himſelfe inſinuates in theſe words; <hi>Davids Guard that he had about him, was onely to
ſecure his perſon againſt the cut-throats of Saul, if ſent to take away his life, &amp;c. He was
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115430:52"/>
annoynted and deſigned by the Lord to ſucceed</hi> Saul, <hi>and therefore he might uſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
way of ſafe-guarding his perſon:</hi> Therefore he and his Guard would and
might doubtleſſe have with a ſafe conſcience reſiſted,<note place="margin">Sect,</note> repulſed <hi>Sauls</hi> cut-throat Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
had they aſſaulted <hi>David,</hi> to take away his life. And iffo, then the Kings Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throat
Cavalleers by his own confeſſion, may lawfully be reſiſted, repulſed, ſlain in a
defenſive way, by the Parliaments forces now.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the argument is abſurd, becauſe we may forcibly reſiſt and repulſe with
ſafe conſcience, thoſe whom we may not wilfully ſlay. If a man aſſaults me, to beat
or wound me, I may reſiſt, repulſe him with violence, but I may not kill him in mine
own defence, without murder or manſlaughter, unleſſe I could not otherwiſe preſerve
my own life by ſlight or reſiſtance.<note n="b" place="margin">Sect, 2, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Doctor Ferne</hi> grants, that <hi>a Subject may in his
own private defence, lawfully ward off the Kings own blows, and hold his hands, in caſe
of ſudden and illegall aſſaults,</hi> much more then of malicious and premeditated: but
yet denies, <hi>he may either wound or kill him,</hi> and that truely. To argue therefore from
<hi>Davids</hi> example and words, The King may not with ſafe conſcience be wittingly ſlain
by his ſubjects: <hi>Ergo,</hi> He and his Cavaleers may not be forcibly reſiſted, repulſed by
them for their own defence and preſervation, is a groſſe inconſequent by the <hi>Doctors</hi>
own confeſſion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is nothing in all theſe ſpeeches, or the practiſe, or in <hi>David,</hi> pertinent to
the caſe in diſpute; for when<note n="c" place="margin">1. Sam. 2 <hi>c.</hi> 3. 10 16.</note> 
               <hi>Davids men moved him to kill Saul, and would have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
up againſt him, to ſlay him,</hi> &amp; <hi>David</hi> refuſed to act, or ſuffer his men to do it; neither
<hi>Saul</hi> not any of his men did actually aſſault <hi>David</hi> or his followers, nor ſo much as
once diſcover them; but <hi>Saul</hi> went <hi>caſually to cover his feet into the Cave, where they lay
hid;</hi> which done, <hi>he roſe up and went on his way, not once eſpying</hi> David (though <hi>he
cut off the skirt of his Robe privily</hi>) nor any of his men with him. To argue therefore,
That <hi>David</hi> and his men might not with a ſafe conſcience ſtretch forth their hands
and riſe up againſt their Soveraigne king <hi>Saul,</hi> to kill him thus in cold blood, when
he aſſaulted them not, nor ſo much as thought of their being in the Cave, and went out
of it quietly, not diſcovering them; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they might not, they would not in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
have reſiſted, repulſed him, or his Forces, had they aſſaulted, or given them bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
in the Cave, is a <hi>Non-ſence</hi> Concluſion; juſt in effect the ſame with this. I may not
reſiſt or repulſe one who aſſaulrs me not, <hi>Ergo,</hi> I may not reſiſt one that actually aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
me to take away my life, or to beat, rob, wound me: What Logick, Reaſon,
Law or Divinitie is there in ſuch an argument? So after this when<note n="d" place="margin">1. Sam. 26, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and to do it with the hazard of their own lives, had any of <hi>Sauls</hi> Army been

their departure with the Spear and Cruſe was more Heroicall, Loyall, prudentiall. To
conclude therefore, as our Oppoſites do from this ſpeech and example, That <hi>David</hi>

Lord King <hi>Saul,</hi> when he and his men were thus faſt aſleep in the midſt of their
Trenches, offering them no wrong, making no actuall aſſaults upon them; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they
could not, would not juſtly with ſafe conſciences have forcibly defended themſelves
againſt <hi>Saul</hi> and his Army, had they been aſſaulted by them in their own Trenches; is
a tranſcendent abſurdity, refuted by the very next words of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abiſhai</hi> at that
inſtant, 1 <hi>Sam. 26. 10. And</hi> David <hi>ſaid furthermore, As the Lord liveth, the Lord ſhall
ſmite him, or his day ſhall come to die; or he ſhall DESCEND INTO BATTELL
AND PERISH;</hi> which intimates, that if <hi>Saul</hi> would force him to a battell, then
he might lawfully defend himſelfe againſt his violence, though he might not murther
him now in his ſleep, when he did him no hard; and if he caſually periſhed in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
it was <hi>Sauls</hi> own wilfull default, not his, who could not diſſwade him by all this
his fair carriage and ſparing of his life, (when he had thoſe two advantages to ſlay
him) from his violent proſecution, nor yet ſucceed him in the Crown (as God had
appointed and foretold) ſhould he ſuffer him to murther him and his men in battell

who brought him tydings of <hi>Sauls</hi> death, reporting <hi>that himſelf had ſlain him, to gain

onely, that it was not lawfull for any of <hi>Sauls</hi> own men to ſaly him, by his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
Not that reſiſtance of him in the open battell was unlawfull in point of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Other anſwer might be given to this Objection concerning <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi>
As 1. that this difference was but private and perſonall between <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
being then <hi>Sauls</hi> private ſubject, Servant, Son in Law, not publike between <hi>Saul</hi>
his whole Parliament or Kingdom; now many things are unlawfull to be done in
private quarrels, which are iuſt and honourable in publike differences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that</hi> David <hi>himſelf, though he thus forbore to murther</hi> Saul, <hi>yet he tels
him, 1. Sam.</hi> 24, 10, 11, 12. This day thine eyes have ſeen how that the Lord had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
thee to day into mine hand in the Cave, and ſome had me kill thee, but mine eye
<hi>SPARED THEE;</hi> and I ſaid, I will not put forth my hand againſt my Lord, for he is
the Lords anoynted. Moreover, my father, ſee, yea ſee the skirt of thy Robe in my hand,
for in that I cut off the skirt of thy Robe and <hi>KILLED THHE NOT,</hi> know then and

thee, yet then hunteſt my ſoul to take it. The Lord judge between me &amp; thee, and the Lord
avenge me of thee, but mine hand ſhall not be upon thee, and plead my cauſe and deliver
me out of thine hand. <hi>And after this upon the ſecond advantage, he uſeth like words,</hi> The
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115430:53"/>
Lord render to every man according to his right conſnes &amp; faithfulnes, for the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
thee into my hand to day,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 23, 24.</note> but I would not ſtretch forth my hand againſt the Lords
annointed. And behold, as THY LIFE WAS MVCH SET BY THIS DAY
IN MY EYES, ſo let my life be much ſet by in the eyes of the Lord, and let him
deliver me out of all tribulations: <hi>Wherein</hi> David <hi>declared, that God had given up</hi>
Sauls <hi>life into his power, that it was his owne meer goodneſſe that moved him to
ſpare</hi> Saul <hi>contrary to his</hi> Souldiers, <hi>and</hi> Abiſhaies <hi>minds, who would have</hi> ſlain
him, <hi>without any ſeruple of conſcience; that the reaſons he ſpared him were: Firſt,
becauſe he was</hi> Gods Annointed, <hi>that is, ſpecially deſigned and made King of</hi> Iſrael <hi>by</hi>
Gods <hi>own election, which no kings at this day are, &amp; ſo this reaſon extends not ſo fully
to them, as to</hi> Saul. <hi>Secondly, Becauſe he was his Father and Lord too, and ſo it
would have been deemed ſome what an unnaturall act in him. Thirdly, becauſe it had
favoured onely of private ſelf-revenge and ambitious aſpiring to the Crown before
due time, which became not</hi> David, <hi>the quarrell, being then not publike, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
betwixt him and</hi> David <hi>onely, who was next to ſucceed him after his death.
Fourthly, becauſe by this his lenity he would convince &amp; reclaim</hi> Saul <hi>fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his bloody
purſuit, and cleare his innocency to the world. Fifthly, to evidence his dependence
upon God and his ſpeciall promiſe; that</hi> he ſhould enjoy the Crown after <hi>Saul</hi> by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
appointment; <hi>and therefore he would not ſeem to uſurp it by taking</hi> Saul <hi>life
violently away. Moſt of which conſideration faile in caſes of publike defence, and
the preſent controverſie. Thirdly, that</hi> Saul <hi>himſelfe, as well as</hi> Davids <hi>Souldiers,
conceived, that</hi> David <hi>might with ſafe conſcience have ſlain as well as ſpared him;
witneſſe his words, 1. Sam.</hi> 24. 17, 18, 19 Thou art more righteous then I, for thou haſt
rewarded me good, where as I have rewarded thee evill: And thou haſt ſhewedme this
day how thou haſt deals well with me; for aſmuch as when the Lord had delivered me
into thine hand THOU KILLEDST ME NOT. For if a man finde his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
WIL HE LET HIM GO WEL AWAY? Wherefore the Lord reward
three good for that thou haſt done unto me this day, &amp;c. <hi>And in 1. Sam. 26. 21. Then</hi>
ſaid Saul, I have ſinned; returne my ſonne David, for I will no more do thee harm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
my ſolve was precious in thine eyes this day; behold I have played the fool excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
&amp;c. <hi>But the former anſwers are ſo ſatisfactory, that I ſhall not pray in
ayd from theſe, much leſſe from that evaſion of Dr.</hi> Fern, <hi>who</hi> makes this, and all other
Davids demeanors in ſtanding out againſt <hi>Saul</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Sect. 2. p. 2.</note> EXTRAORDINARY; for he was

ſcruple of conſeience in ſparing</hi> Sauls <hi>life was but extraordinary, (the rather, becauſe
all his Souldiers and</hi> Abiſhai would have ſlain Saul without any ſuch ſcruple, and Saul
himſelfe conceived, that any man elſe but David would have done it:) <hi>and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
affirms, that this his ſparing of</hi> Saul <hi>is no wayes obligatory to other ſubjects,

unto the higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God; the Powers that be, are Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and
they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves damnation. <hi>From whence Dr.</hi> Fern <hi>concludes,</hi>
1. That the King is the Supreme or Higheſt Power here intended. 2. That all perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Highest Power are expreſſely forbidden to reſiſt. 3. That in thoſe dayes there was
aſtanding and continuall great Senate, which not long before had the Supreme Power in
the Roman State, and might challenge more by the fundamentalls of that State, then our
Great Councell will or can. But now the Emperour being ſupreme, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> calls him,
or the Higher Power, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> here, there is no power of reſiſtance left to any that are
under him, by the Apoſtle. 4 Was there ever more cauſe of reſiſtance then in thoſe dayes?
Were not the Kings then not onely conceived to be inclined ſo, and ſo, but even actually to
be enemies of Religion, had overthrown Laws and Liberties? And therefore if any ſhould
from the Apostles reaſons that he gives againſt reſiſtance in the 3, 4, 5, Verſes. (<hi>for Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers

good, are not to be reſiſted; the conſideration of thoſe times leaves no place for ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
becauſe the Powers then (which the Apoſtle forbids to reſiſt) were nothing ſo, but
ſubverters of that which was good and juſt. The Emperors did then indeed rule abſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

5. The prohibition doth not onely concern Chriſtians, but all the people under thoſe
Emperors, and not onely Religion was perſecuted, but Liberties alſo loſt, the people and
Senate were then enſlaved by Edicts and Laws then inforced on them by <hi>Nero</hi> and other

               <hi>Dr Willet recites 7. Reaſons of it,</hi> all fortifying my aſſertion; I ſhall
mention onely the three moſt probable, moſt received of them, and apply them as I go.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Roman Magiſtrates being then infidels, the new converted Chriſtians
among them, either did, or might take themſelves to be wholly exempted from any
ſubjection or obedience to them, <hi>reputing it a great incongruity, that Chriſtians ſhould
owe any ſubjection to Pagans:</hi> To refute which error, the Apoſtle informs them, that
though the Magiſtrates themſelves were Ethnicks, yet their <hi>Authority and Power was
from God himſelfe;</hi> therefore their profeſſion of Chriſtianitie did rather oblige them
to, then exempt them from ſubjection. Thus <hi>Haymo Soto, Calvin, Guather, Marlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,
Willet, Pareus,</hi> with others on this Text. Turn this Reaſon then into an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and it will be but this <hi>Non ſequitur:</hi> Chriſtianity exempts not ſubjects from due
obedience to iuſt Pagan Magiſtrates, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Tyrants may not be reſiſted, neither ought
the Parliament and their Forces to reſiſt the King Cavallcers unjuſt aſſaults, as the
caſe is formerly ſtated. Pretty Logick, and Divinity.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Gaulonites,</hi> as<note n="k" place="margin">Antiqu. Iud. l. 18. c. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Ioſephus</hi> records, with other lews, being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed,
held it unlawfull for them to yeeld any <hi>ſubjection or tribute to the Roman Emperors,

            <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle having formerly t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> have done)
that it was not lawfull for Chriſtians to uſe the Magiſtrates defence againſt wrongs,
nor for the Magiſtrate himſelf to take vengeance of evill doers: To prevent this the
Apoſtle argues, That the Magiſtrates <hi>are Gods Miniſters, appointed by him to puniſh
Malefactors, and take vengeance on them.</hi> So <hi>Gualther, Willet,</hi> and others. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from this ground: Oppreſſed Subjects may ſeek redreſſe of their grievances from
the Magiſtrates, who may lawfully puniſh Malefactors, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they may not reſiſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115430:57"/>
with force, Tyrannicall bloody Magiſtrates, or their wicked Inſtruments, when they
actually make war upon them, to ruine, ſpoyl, enſlave them, is but a ridiculous <hi>Non
ſequitur.</hi> There is nothing therefore in the occaſions of the Apoſtles words which
gives the leaſt colour, to diſprove the lawfulneſſe of ſuch reſiſtance, or of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
juſt defenſive war.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, this is manifeſt by the</hi> whole Scope <hi>of this Text, which in ſumme is onely
this,</hi> That Chriſtians ought in conſcience to (l) be ſubject to all lawfull higher Powers, ſo
farre forth as they are Gods Ordinance, Gods Miniſters, for their good, to the praiſe of
the good, and puniſhment of evill doers, and notto reſiſt them in the execution of their juſt

            <p>Fourthly, the Apoſtle ſubjoynes this argument againſt reſiſtance. <hi>Wilt thou not
then be afraid of the power? doe that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame,</hi>
Verſ. 3. That power is not to bee reſiſted, which wee need not be afraid of, and of
whom we ſhall have prayſe whiles we doe that which is good: But this onely can bee
intended of a lawfull power juſtly executed; not of Tyrants, or their ill Miniſters
bent with force of armes to ruine Religion, Lawes, Liberties,; who onely terrifie,
diſgrace, diſcountenance thoſe that are good; applaud, advance none but thoſe who
are evill, and as <hi>Micah</hi> writes, Chap. 3. 2. 3. <hi>Love the evill and hate the good, and pluck
off their skin from off them, and their fleſh from off their bones, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore this inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of reſiſtance extends onely to lawfull Magiſtrates, not to ungodly oppreſſing
Tyrants.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, he is not to be reſiſted, but obeyed; <hi>becauſe he is the Miniſter of God to thee
for good, Verſ.</hi> 4. But is this true of Tyrants? of ungodly Magiſtrates bent to ſubvert
Religion, Lawes, Liberties, and deſtroy their people? True of<note n="u" place="margin">See <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Eutropius, Zonaras, Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> and others in their lives.</note>

who <hi>wiſhed all the Romans had but one necke, that he might cut them all off at one ſtroke;</hi> and

they are without his inhibition; which extends onely to ſuch, who are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

<hi>Devils Miniſters</hi> to us for evill, rather then Gods for good.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, He ſubjoynes this further reaſon of obedience and not reſiſtance, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5.
<hi>But if thou doſt that which is evill be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vaine; for hee
is the Miniſter of God, a revenger, to execute wrath upon him that doth evill;</hi> which no
wayes ſuites with a Tyrant bent to ſubvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties: For he ſecures
all evill men, eſpecially thoſe who are inſtrumentall to advance his cruelty, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions;
gives liberty to all manner of wickedneſſes, Proclaimes impunity to his ill
inſtruments, knowing that of the Poet to be true;

He beareth the ſword not onely in vaine, in reference to any good end, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of Gods glory and the publike good; but likewiſe draweth it forth, and
uſeth it directly againſt both;<note n="z" place="margin">See <hi>Fox</hi> Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents throughout.</note> And is ſo farre from being <hi>a Miniſter of God, or reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

               <hi>extends to all civill Magiſtrates, as well inferiour and ſubordinate, as ſuperiour,</hi> (and many

Theodulus, Chryſoſtome, Theodoret, Primaſius, Haymo, Rabanus Maurus, Theophylact,

ſundry others. This then being irrefragable, hereby it is moſt apparent; Firſt, that
no reſiſtance of the higher powers is here prohibited, but onely in the due and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
execution of their offices: For if any inferiour Officers illegally indeavour to
ſubvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties, and unrightly governe the people, they may
lawfully be reſiſted by them: For example, if a Maior, Juſtice of Peace, Conſtable
or other officer; extravagating from the common courſe of Law and Juſtice; ſhall
with force of armes in a riotous manner aſſault any private man, or the whole
Citie or Village where he lives, to beate, wound, kill, plunder, diſpoſſeſſe the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of their houſes, goods, franchiſes, or aſſault them on the highway ſide, to
take away their purſes; in theſe and ſuch like caſes, both in point of Law and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
he may not onely be forcibly reſiſted, but repulſed, apprehended, battered,
if not lawfully ſlaine by the people, and proceeded againſt as a delinquent: The reaſon
is, becauſe theſe illegall unjuſt actions, are not onely beſides, without their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,
but directly contrary to their offices, and the Lawes, which never gave
them authority to act ſuch injuſtice: yet they are <hi>higher Powers ordained of God,</hi> within
this Text, and no way to be reſiſted in the due execution of their Offices according
to Law. If then theſe inferiour Officers may be thus forcibly reſiſted, repulſed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this Text, in ſuch caſes as theſe; then by the ſelfe ſame reaſon Kings
and Emperours may bee thus reſiſted too; ſince the Text extends indifferently to
them both. Let then the objectors take their choyce; either affirme, that no inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
lawfull Officers whatſoever, may be forcibly reſiſted, by the people, or repulſed,
arraigned cenſured for their miſdemeanour, by vertue of this Text; which would
bring an abſolute Tyranny, Anarchy and confuſion preſently into the world, and
make every Conſtable as great a Tyrant, Monarch as the grand Emperor of the <hi>Turks;</hi>
or elſe confeſſe, that this Text condemnes not ſuch reſiſtance, even of Kings and
Princes, when they forcibly war upon their Subjects to ſubvert Religion, Lawes,
Liberties, and ruine the republike; ſince it makes no diſtinction at all betweene
the ones power and the others; but equally enjoynes ſubjection, prohibits reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
unto both; and that onely in juſt adminiſtration of their ſeverall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
not in the arbitrary unjuſt proſecutions of their wils and luſts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it followes, that the Kings Souldiers, Cavaliers and Forces now raiſed
againſt Law, and armed onely with illegall Commiſſions voyd in Law, as I have
proved; are none of the high powers ordained of God, nor lawfull Rulers or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
within the meaning of this Scripture; and ſo the forcible reſiſting of them,
and of the Kings illegall commands and deſignes executed by them, is no reſiſtance of
the higher powers here prohibited.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the Houſes of Parliament being in truth the higheſt powers ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of God in this Realme, and their juſt legall Ordinances, Votes, Forces, for the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115430:58"/>

and Malignant Popiſh Forces, neither may, nor ought in conſcience to be reſiſted by

Emperours were but the Senates and peoples publike ſervants; therefore they were
their Lords; and not inferiour, but ſuperiour to their ſervants. Thirdly, that they
were ſubordinate and inferiour to the Lawes made by the Senate and people; and

               <q>This Law firſt ſhewes, that there was not one royall Law made for all Emperors,
but that for every ſeverall Emperour ſeverall Lawes were neceſſary, containing the
conditions whereupon the Principalitie was collated by the Roman people: For
to <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> it appeares power was granted, of enlarging or ſetling the bounds,
as it was granted to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> but not to other Princes. And in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
but one, which ſaith: And by thoſe things which by any Law, &amp;c. it is lawfull
to doe; a larger power is given to <hi>Veſpatian</hi> then to the forenamed Emperours;
and that they ought to doe ſome things, which <hi>Veſpatian</hi> ought not to doe by
Law. Likewiſe by theſe words; <hi>Vtique quibus legibus, &amp;c. ſolutus ſit:</hi> it appeares
that <hi>Veſpatian</hi> was not freed from all Lawes, nor yet the Emperour before him.
Likewiſe out of the Chapter where it ſaith, <hi>Ex uſu Reip. Majeſtate, &amp;c.</hi> it is evident
that not an abſolute free adminiſtration of things was committed to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
but onely ſuch as was uſefull, that is, which ſhould be for the profit and
honour of the republike: whence is inferred, that thoſe things which were not
for the benefit and honour of the Commonweale, Emperors had no right nor
power to doe. And in the laſt Chapter is perſpicuouſly ſet downe THAT SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERIOUR
POWER OF THE PEOPLE, GREATER THEN
THE PRINCIPALITY IT SELFE. How then doth <hi>Vlpian</hi> ſay, the
<hi>Prince is looſed from Lawes?</hi> he ſaith not from all Lawes: verily that he was exempt

and much more <hi>Salamonius.</hi> All which conſidered, will infallibly evidence, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

            <p>To which I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that theſe words onely prove the Emperour in the Roman
State to be the higheſt Officer and Magiſtrate under God, of any one particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
not that he was the Soveraigne higheſt power above the Senate and people col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively
conſidered: And the occaſion of theſe words will diſcover the Authors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115430:60"/>
to be no other: which was this. The Chriſtians in that age were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and put to death by <hi>Scapula</hi> Preſident of <hi>Carthage,</hi> to whom<note n="m" place="margin">Rhenani Annot. Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> writes
this Booke, <hi>becauſe they refuſed to adore the Emperour for a God, to ſweare by his Genius,
and to obſerve his ſolemnities and triumphs in an Ethnicall manner; as is evident by the
words</hi> preceding this paſſage: <hi>Sic &amp; circa Majeſtatem Imperatoris infamamur, &amp;c.</hi> and
by ſundry notable paſſages in his <hi>Apologeticus.</hi> In anſwer to which accuſation <hi>Tertullian</hi>
reaſons in the Chriſtians behalfe; <hi>that though they adored not the Emperour as a God; yet
they reverenced him as a man next under God; as one onely leſſe then God; as one greater then
all others, whiles leſſe onely then the true God, and greater then the Idol Gods themſelves, who
were in the Emperours power, &amp;c.</hi> Here was no other thing in queſtion; but whether
the Emperour were to be adored as God? not, whether he or the Roman Senate and
people were the greateſt higheſt Soveraigne power? And the anſwer being, that he
was but a man next under God, above any other particular officer in the Roman State;
is no proofe at all, that he was paramount the whole Senate and people collectively
conſidered, or of greater Soveraigne power then they; which the premiſes clearely
diſprove. Adde; that this Father in his <hi>Apologie</hi> thus cenſures the Pagan Romans for
their groſſe flattery of their Emperours whom they feared more then their Gods,
appliable to our preſent times; <hi>Siquidem majore formidine &amp; callidiore timiditate Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarem
obſervatis, quam ipſum de Olympo Jovem, &amp;c. adeo &amp; in iſto irreligioſi erga
dees veſtros deprehendimini, cum plus timoris, humano Domino dicatis; citius denique apud
vos per omnes Deos, quam per unum genium Caeſaris pejeratur.</hi> Then he addes, <hi>Intereſt
hominis Deo cedere; ſatis habeat appellari Imperator: grande &amp; hoc nomen eſt, quod a Deo
tradetur: negat illum imperatorem qui deum dicit; niſi homo ſit, non eſt imperator. Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
ſe eſſe etiam triumphans in illo ſublimiſſimo curru admonetur. Suggeritur enim ci a tergo,
Reſpice poſt te; hominem memento te. Etiam hoc magis gaudet tanta ſe gloria coruſcare, ut
illi admonitio conditionis ſuae ſit neceſſaria. Major eſt qui revocatur ne ſe deum exiſtimet.
Auguſtus imperii formator, ne Dominum quidem dici ſe volebat: et hoc enim Dei eſt cognomen.
Dicam plane Imperatorem Dominum, ſed more communi, ſed quando non cogor, ut Dominum
Dei vice dicam.</hi> Concluding thus: <hi>Nullum bonum ſub exceptione perſonarum admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtramus,
&amp;c. lidem ſumus Imperatoribus qui &amp; vicinis noſtris. Male enim velle, male fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
male dicere, male cogitare de quoquam ex aequo vetamur, Quodcunque non licet in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratorem,
id nec in quenquam: quod in neminem, eo forſitan magis nec in ipſum qui per deum
tantus eſt, &amp;c.</hi> From which it is evident, that the Chriſtians did not deifie nor flatter
their Emperours more then was meet, and deemed they might not reſiſt them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in ſuch caſes where they might reſiſt no others, and ſo by conſequence lawfully
reſiſt them, where it was lawfull for them to reſiſt other private men who did injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
aſſault them.</p>
            <p>If then the Roman Emperors were not the higheſt Soveraigne power in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
State when <hi>Paul</hi> writ this Epiſtle, but the Roman Senate and State, as I have
cleared: and if the Parliament, not the King, be the ſupremeſt Soveraigne power in our
Realme, as I have abundantly manifeſted; then this objected Text (ſo much inſiſted
on by our oppoſites) could no wayes extend to the Roman Senate, State, or our
Engliſh Parliament, who are the very higher powers themſelves, and proves moſt
fatall and deſtructive to their cauſe of any other, even by their owne Argument,
which I ſhall thus doubly diſcharge upon them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that power which is the higheſt and moſt ſoveraigne Authority in any State
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115430:60"/>
or kingdome by the Apoſtles and our Antagoniſts owne doctrine, even in point of
conſcience, neither may, nor ought in what caſe ſoever (ſay our oppoſites) to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
reſiſted, either in their perſons, ordinances, commands, inſtruments, offices,
or Armed Souldiers, by any inferiour powers, perſons or ſubjects whatſoever, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when their proceedings are juſt and legall, under paine of temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
condemnation. But the Senate among the Romans, not the Emperour; and
the Parliament in England, not the King, really were and are the higher Powers
and moſt ſoveraigne Authority. Therefore by the Apoſtles own Doctrine even in
point of conſcience, they neither may nor ought to be diſobeyed or forcibly reſiſted
in any caſe whatſoever, either in their Perſons, Ordinances, Commands, Inſtruments,
Officers, or Armed Souldiers, by the King himſelfe, his Counſellors, Armies, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers,
or by any inferiour powers, perſons, or Subjects whatſoever, eſpecially
when their proceedings are juſt and legall, (as hitherto they have beene) under paine
of temporall and eternall condemnation. I hope the Doctor and his Camerads will
now beſhrew themſelves that ever they medled with this Text, and made ſuch a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to ſtrangle their owne treacherous cauſe, and thoſe who have taken up armes in
its defence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that Power which is ſimply higheſt and ſupreame in any State, may
lawfully with good conſcience take up Armes to reſiſt or ſuppreſſe any other power,
that ſhall take up armes to ſubvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties, the Republike, or the
juſt Rights and Priviledges of the Subject, or of this higher power. This is our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites
owne argumentation. Therefore the Parliament being in verity the higheſt
ſupreame Power in our State, may lawfully with good conſcience take up Armes to
reſiſt or ſuppreſſe his Majeſties Malignant, Popiſh Forces, or any other power which
already hath, or hereafter ſhall be raiſed to ſubvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties, the
Republike, juſt Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, or the Subjects; and every
man with ſafe conſcience may chearefully ſerve in ſuch a warre, upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
encouragement or command, without guilt of treaſon, or rebellion either
in Law or Conſcience.</p>
            <p>For the third Queſtion;<note place="margin">Queſt. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Whether Tyrants or unjuſt oppreſſing Magiſtrates, as they are
ſuch, be within the intendment of this Text, and not to be reſiſted in any caſe?</hi> I have fully
cleared this before from the occaſion, ſcope and arguments uſed in this Chapter;
that they are not within the compaſſe of this Text; as they are ſuch, and may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in their Tyranny and oppreſſions notwithſtanding this inhibition; I ſhall
not repeat, but onely fortifie this Poſition with ſome new reaſons and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, that which is not the ordinance of God, but rather of the Devill, and
the meere ſinne and enormity of the Governour himſelfe, not of the Government,
is not within the intention of this Text, and may lawfully bee reſiſted without
any violation of it. But Tyrants and unjuſt oppreſſing Magiſtrates as they are ſuch,
are<note n="n" place="margin">See Mich. 3. 1. to 5. Iſay 3. 4, 5. Zeph. 3, 3. Ezech. 45. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>not Gods ordinance, but rather the Devills,</hi> and their Tyranny and oppreſſion
is <hi>onely the ſinne and enormity of the Governours themſelves, not of the government;</hi> A truth
granted by all men: Therefore they are not within the compaſſe of this Text, and
may lawfully be reſiſted without any violation of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that which is no point of the Magiſtrates lawfull power ordained of
God, but diametrally repugnant to it, cannot be within the meaning of this Text,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115430:61"/>
and may lawfully be reſiſted; but the tyranny, oppreſſion, rapine, and violence of
lawleſſe Kings and Magiſtrates are ſuch, as all muſt and doe acknowledge. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
they are not within the verge and compaſſe of this Text, and may lawfully bee
reſiſted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, all powers intended in the Text, are not only ordained, but <hi>ordered</hi> of God,
that is,<note n="o" place="margin">In Rom. 13. <hi>Col 1266. Willet.</hi> on Rom. 13. <hi>queſt. 6. p.</hi> 583.</note> 
               <hi>Paraeus</hi> with others obſerve) <hi>they are circumſcribed &amp; bounded with certain
Rules or Lawes of juſtice and honeſty, within which they muſt containe themſelves, elſe they exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitate
from Gods ordinance when they paſſe beyond theſe limits, and become none of Gods;</hi> This
the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (which <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> and others render, <hi>ordinatae,</hi>
and the Margin of our Engliſh Bibles, <hi>are ordered of God;</hi>) doth ſufficiently war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
being coupled with the ſubſequent limitations; <hi>For rulers are not a terrour to good
workes, but to evill, &amp;c. they are Gods Miniſters attending continually on this very thing.</hi> Now
the Tyranny and oppreſſion of Kings and other Rulers, are meere exorbitances,
arbitrary illegall actions, exceeding the bounds of juſtice and honeſty preſcribed by
the Lawes of God and men. Therefore not within the limits of this Text, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, it is generally accorded by all Commentators, that though the lawfull
power of Princes or other Magiſtrates degenerating unto Tyrants, be of God, and
not to be reſiſted; yet the</hi> Tyranny it ſelfe, and abuſe of this power is of Satan, not of God,
and the vice of the perſons onely, not of the Power it ſelfe; <hi>whence they conclude,</hi> that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
are not within the meaning of this Scripture. <hi>So</hi> Origen, Paraeus, Willet, <hi>with moſt
others on this Text; and</hi> Zuinglius <hi>moſt expreſly</hi> Explanatio Artic. 41. Tom. 1. f. 82.
83. <hi>where he complaines,</hi> that many Tyrants, cheate, ſteale, rob, ſlay, plunder, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing againſt their ſubjects to oppreſſe them; aſſuming a pretext and vayle of their
malice from this Text of Paul. <hi>Yea</hi> Dominicus Soto, Cajetan, Pererius, <hi>and other Popiſh
commentators on this place obſerve; that</hi> Paul addes this Epithet, of higher or excelling
powers (<hi>omitted by him in other parallel Texts</hi>) of purpoſe to exclude Tyrants, who are
no excelling Lords, nor lawfull Powers; reigning oft times by Gods permiſſion for the peoples
puniſhment; not by his ordination for their good: <hi>and blame</hi> Bueer <hi>for ſaying, that</hi> Tyrants
power is from God, as if he were ths author of ſinne and Tyranny.</p>
            <p>This then fully anſwers that abſurd errour of Doctor<note n="p" place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Ferne,</hi> wherein all his force
is placed: <hi>That the Power in Pauls dayes which he here prohibits to reſiſt, were ſubverters of
that which was good; and the Roman Emperors Tyrants:</hi> where he ſottiſhly confounds the
tyranny, luſts, and vices of the Emperors perſons, which were deteſtable, with their
power it ſelfe, which was good and commendable; as if the Imperiall power it
ſelfe was ill, becauſe <hi>Nero</hi> was ill, <hi>and was</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Grimſton, Suetenius, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropius, Zonaras, Volaterranus, Speed <hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in his life.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>therefore juſtly condemned to death by the
Roman Senate, as a publike enemy to the Roman State,</hi> though they approved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
his juſt Imperiall principality, which laſted in ſucceſſion for many hundred
yeares after his cenſure, death. To which I ſhall onely adde; that though <hi>Nero</hi>
himſelfe were a Tyrant, yet the Roman Senate, and all their Inferiour Offices were
not Tyrants; many of them, no doubt, being juſt and upright Magiſtrates. The
Precept therefore being thus in the generall, and the plurall number, <hi>Let every ſoule

we muſt diſtinguiſh:</p>
            <p>Firſt, betweene, <hi>Government it ſelfe in generall,</hi> and kingly or other kindes of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in ſpeciall, (as our oppoſites diſtinguiſh betweene, a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the <hi>Sabbath;</hi>
the firſt they ſay is morall and of divine inſtitution, the later not.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, betweene the Regall power of Kings, the perſons inveſted with this
power, the manner of obtaining, and the adminiſtration of their power.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, of Gods manner of inſtituting and ordaining things; which is twofold,
immediately by himſelfe, mediately by others. And theſe inſtitutions of both kinds
are either univerſall, extending to all places, Nations; or particular, concerning
ſome Countries, and Nations onely, and not others; Perpetuall for ever, or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
onely for ſome ſet time: Immutable, not capable of the leaſt alteration; or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and that either at the pleaſure of God onely; or at the will of men, when they
ſhall ſee juſt cauſe, either in part or in whole.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in what ſeverall ſenſes things may be ſaid to be of God. Firſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his owne immediate inſtitution. Secondly, of his generall or ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
Thirdly, of his generall or ſpeciall diſpoſing providence, without any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
inſtitution or command. Fourthly, of his approbation of, aſſent unto, and
bleſſing on the meere inſtitutions of men. Fiftly, of his permiſſion onely.</p>
            <p>To apply theſe diſtinctions to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is cleare, that power and government in generall are Gods owne inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
who as he hath <hi>appointed (in the great fabricke of the world a</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 1. 16. 18. 28. 29 30. Jer. 31. 35, 36. Pſal. 136. 8, 9.</note>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115430:62"/>
forme of government and ſubordination of one creature to another</hi>) ſo he hath for the good
of mankinde, appointed that there ſhould be ſome forme of government or other
among men in the world; which in reſpect of families hee hath ſpecially and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
decreed,<note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 3. 16. Exod. 20. 12. Epheſ. 6. 1, 2. 5. c. 5. 22. 24. Col. 3. 23. to 25. c. 4. 1, 2. 1 Tim. 6. 1, 2. 1 Pet. 2. 18. c. 3. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>as that the wife ſhould be ſubject to the husband, the children to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
the ſervants to their maſters;</hi> but in regard of Commonweales, or Nations, hee
hath left it arbitrary and indefinite, leaving every Nation and Country free liberty
to elect ſuch a publike politike forme of government, as themſelves ſhould judge
moſt expedient for their publike good, and that mutable (ſince all humane things
are ſo) as they ſhould ſee juſt occaſion, not preſcribing any ſempiternall, immutable
forme of government to any particular Nations, Regions, much leſſe to all the
world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, government in generall being thus of God, but the kindes of it thus
left arbitrary to mens inſtitution and free election; the particular governments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
by any Nation for the better regulating of their lives, the preſervation of
humane ſociety, and advancement of Gods glory, may be truely ſaid in ſome ſenſe
<hi>to be of God,</hi> though inſtituted, invented by men. Not becauſe God himſelfe did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ordain or preſcribe them by ſpeciall command to all, or any one people:
or becauſe God himſelf did immediately ordaine or preſcribe them by ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to this, all, or any one people: but becauſe hee by his generall or ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
did direct this Nation to make choyſe of ſuch a government, or gave them
wiſedome to invent and ſettle it, as moſt commodious for their republike, till they
ſhould ſee cauſe to alter it: or becauſe he bleſſed and approved it, when invented
and received by them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Kingly powers, Kingdomes, Kings (the things now in queſtion) are, and
may be ſaid to <hi>be of God, and ordained of God,</hi> in no other manner or ſenſe, then all
other particular Governments or Magiſtrates are. For this Text of the Romans,
ſpeaking onely of the <hi>higher powers, the powers that are,</hi> and <hi>of Rulers;</hi> as doth that
place of <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 1. And the Text of <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15, 16. (ſo much relied on by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors)
extending as well to all ſubordinate Rulers as Kings; witneſſe the ſubſequent
words, <hi>By me Kings reigne, and Princes decree juſtice: by me Princes rule</hi> AND NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLES,
<hi>yea</hi> ALL THE JUDGES OF THE EARTH; (that is, all
Magiſtrates whatſoever) it cannot but be yeelded; that all and every lawfull kinde of
government, all lawfull Rulers and Magiſtrates of what fort ſoever are of Gods <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and his ordinance,</hi> as farre forth as Monarchies are; and what is truely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
of the one, is of the other too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe generalls thus premiſed as indubitable; I ſay firſt of all:</hi> That Monarchy or
regall power is not of God, nor yet Gods ordinance by way of immediate divine inſtitution or
ſpeciall command from Gods owne free motion, <hi>as our oppoſites affirme it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For firſt, God himſelf never immediately inſtituted a royall Monarchicall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in any Nation whatſoever, no not among his owne people; whoſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was at firſt<note n="y" place="margin">Joſepbus Antiq. Jud. l. 4. c. 8. Carolus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonius de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub. Hecraeorum. l. 7. c. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Paternall and Patriarchicall; next Ariſtocraticall; then Regall; not
by Gods immediate institution and voluntary deſignation; but by the peoples earneſt importunity,
contrary to the good liking of God and Samuel,</hi> as is evident by 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> c. 8, and 9,
and 10, and 11. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 4. and the Appendix.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note n="z" place="margin">Ariſtot. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyt. l. 3. &amp; 5. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lib. Hiſt. l. 6. Juſt. in Hiſt. l. 1.

               <hi>All Politicians, and Hiſtorians grant, that the originall crection of all Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>echies
was either by the peoples free conſent and ordination; or by Tyranny and uſurpation; or
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115430:62"/>
be conqeſt;</hi> none by divine inſtitution or ſpeciall command from God: And it muſt

               <hi>kingdomes were primitively erected, either among Pagan Nations
and States, who knew not God nor his Word, or among Christian States ſince ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and Revelations from heaven ceaſed:</hi> which if our oppoſites deny; I ſhall deſire
them to inſtance in any one Monarchy in the world, inſtituted immediately by God
himſelfe, or by ſpeciall command from his owne free motion: Till this be done, all
their aſſeverations will be accounted fabulous.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if Regall power be Gods ordinance by way of divine immediate inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and command; then this inſtitution of Regall Monarchy, with the ſeverall
Prerogatives, and boundaries of it, would appeare in ſome Text of Scripture, and
this government would be ſpecially and perpetually preſcribed either to all, or ſome
particular Nations by God himſelfe. But this inſtitution, with the generall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
and bounds of Regall Authority, are no where extant in Scripture, neither
this forme of government therein preſcribed, but left arbitrary to all or any
Nation in particular, for ought any man can demonſtrate. Thoſe Texts which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the Kings of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in point of ſoveraignty, and Prerogative, being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
onely, and peculiar to that Nation, nor morall, or extending unto others.
Therefore it is not Gods ordinance by way of divine immediate inſtitution, or
command.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if it were of divine ordination in this ſenſe; then the Regall power and
authority of all Kings and Monarchs in the world ſhould bee equall, yea the very
ſame; and there ſhould be no different kinde of Kings; as the divine authority of
all Miniſters (being of Gods owne inſtitution by one and the ſame commiſſion) is
one and the ſame: But the regall power and juriſdiction of all Kings and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
in the world is not equall nor the ſame; for ſome have farre greater authority
then others; there are many different ſorts of Kings in the world, <hi>ſome onely annuall,
others for life, others hereditary, others at will, depoſible at the peoples pleaſures when ever
they offended, (Such were the Kings of the</hi>

               <hi>Gothes in Spaine;
cum ipſos deponerent populi quoties diſplicuiſſent:</hi> ſuch the Kings of the <hi>Heruli (Procopius,
Gothicorum</hi>) Of the <hi>Lombards, Paulus Warnafredi, l. 4. &amp;</hi> 6. Of the <hi>Burgundians, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus,</hi>

with ſundry others hereafter mentioned.) Some elective, others ſucceſſive, ſome
conditionall, others abſolute, as I have plentifully mentioned in the <hi>Appendix.</hi>
Therefore they are not of divine ordination in the objectors ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, If Kings were of divine ordination in this ſenſe, then their kingdomes
and people upon their Elections, Inſtitutions and Coronations could not juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
any conditions, oathes or covenants to them, upon promiſe of performance
whereof they onely accept of them to be their Kings, refuſing elſe to admit them to
reigne over them; and ſuch conditions, oathes, covenants, would be meere nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ſince men have no power at all to detract from Gods owne divine inſtitutions,
or to annex any conditions or reſtrictions to them. But our Antagoniſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
dare not averre, that Kingdomes and Nations upon their Kings Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Inſtitutions and elections may not lawfully preſcribe conditions, oathes, and
limitations to them, upon promiſe of performance whereof they onely ſubmitted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115430:63"/>
to them as their Soveraignes, it being the received practiſe of our owne, of all or
moſt other Kingdomes whatſoever,<note n="e" place="margin">See Part 1. p. 51 to 76. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Authority, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. 1. to 19. Therefore they are not of divine inſtitution
in the objected ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, All<note n="f" place="margin">Bracton l. 3. c. 9. Fleta l. 1. c. 5. 17. <hi>See here,</hi> p. 5. &amp; part 1. p. 88.</note> 
               <hi>Lawyers</hi> and moſt <hi>Orthodox Divines determine, that Kings have no
other juſt or lawfull royall Authority,</hi> but that which the Lawes and cuſtomes of their
Kingdomes allot them, and <hi>that the Law onely makes them Kings, from which if they
exorbitate they become Tyrants and ceaſe to be Kings.</hi> Their Royall authority therefore
is of humane inſtitution properly, not Divine; from their people, who both elect,
conſtitute them Kings, and give them all their regall Authority by humane Lawes
enacted, not from God as the onely efficient cauſe.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, All Kingdomes, Monarchies, Policies, are mutable and variable in
themſelves, while they continue ſuch; yea, temporary and alterable into other formes
of Government by publicke conſent, if there be juſt cauſe; without any immediate
command or alteration made by God himſele, or his divine authority: There being
no poſitive Law of God confining any Nation, (whoſe humane earthly condition
is ſtill variable) to a Monarchicall or any other conſtant forme of government on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
much leſſe for perpetuity without variation. Therefore, they are not of divine
inſtitution in this ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Eightly, St. <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſely defines Kings and Monarchies, in reſpect of their
inſtitution, to be humane creatures, or inſtitutions, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 13. Submit your ſelves
to every</hi> ORDINANCE OF MAN <hi>for the Lords ſake; whether it be to the
King, as ſupreame, &amp;c.</hi> And they are common to Pagans who know not God, as well
as to Chriſtians. Therefore, they are not ſimply divine, but humane Ordinances.</p>
            <p>Ninethly, Our Antigoniſts will yeeld, that other formes of Government, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ariſtocraticall, Oligarchicall, Democraticall,</hi> or mixt of all three, are not abſolutely
and immediately of divine inſtitution; nor yet <hi>Dukes, Principalities,</hi> with other inferior
<hi>Rulers,</hi> though the Apoſtle in this Text makes them all equally Gods Ordinance,
and Divine. Therefore Monarchy, Kings and Kingdomes are not ſo.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, The very Text it ſelfe ſeemes to intimate, that Royalties and higher
powers are not of God, by way of originall or immediate inſtitution, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
for the Apoſtle ſaith not; that all powers whatſoever were originally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
and ordained by God himſelfe; but, <hi>There is no power but of God; The powers
that be, are</hi> (not were at firſt) <hi>ordained</hi> (or rather, ordered) <hi>of God:</hi> that is; where
powers and Governments are once erected by men, through Gods generall or ſpeciall
providence, there God approves and orders them for the good of men.</p>
            <p>2. If Monarchies, and Kings themſelves be not of divine inſtitution, and Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
in the former ſenſe, as is moſt apparent: &amp; <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato,</hi> all Politicians grant;
Then they are ſo onely in ſome other ſenſe, in what I ſhall truely informe you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Ordinance,</hi> by way of imitation, as derived from
Gods owne forme of Government, which is Monarchicall; Whence he is called,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, By way of approbation;</hi> He<note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 17. 14. 15, 16. 1 Sam. 8. 22. 2 Sam. 7. 12.</note> approves and allowes this kinde of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
where it is received, as well as other formes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by way of direction, he gives divers <hi>generall</hi>

Kings</hi> (and to other Rulers and Magiſtrates alſo as well as them) <hi>in his ſacred word

how they ſhould carry themſelves towards their Kings;</hi> and all other Rulers and
Governours temporall or ſpirituall: in which ſenſe they may be properly ſaid, to be
<hi>ordered</hi> and <hi>ordained</hi> too, of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By way of ſpeciall providence and incitation; God excites and moves
ſome people to make choyce of Kings, and Monarchicall formes of Government, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than others; and to elect one man or family to that dignity rather than others,
yea his <hi>providence mightily rules</hi> and ſwayes in the changes, the elections, actions,
counſels, affaires of Monarchies, Kingdomes, Kings, States, to order them for his own
glory, the Kings, the Subjects good or ill, in wayes of Juſtice or Mercy; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

drift of all theſe Texts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Kings may be ſaid to be of God and his Ordinance, becauſe they, (and
ſo all other Rulers, Judges, Magiſtrates as well as they, in reſpect of their repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and the true end of Government) are ſaid</hi> to be Gods; to be Gods Miniſters and
Vicegerents; to ſit upon Gods Throne, and ought to reigne, to judge for God, and to rule Gods
people according to Gods Word, with ſuch juſtice, equity, integrity as God himſelfe would Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
them. Exod. 22. 28. 2 Chron. 9. 8. Rom. 13. 4, 5. 2 Sam. 23. 3. Pſal. 78. 72, 73, 74

1. 17.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Ill Kings, and Tyrants, may be ſaid to be of God, by way of permiſſion,
and of Ordination too, in reference to the peoples puniſhment, <hi>Job 34. 30. Hoſ.</hi> 13.
11. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 18. In theſe regards (common to all other Governours and lawfull
Governments, as well as Kings and Monarchies) Kings and Kingly Authority,
are and may be ſaid to <hi>be of God,</hi> and <hi>Gods Ordinance;</hi> yet not immediately, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
in the firſt acception, here refuted, but ſo as that ſtill they are really the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ordinances of men, of humane, not divine right, and authority.</p>
            <p>As for the objected Scriptures to prove Kings <hi>jure Divino,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Object.</note> as <hi>Prov. 8. 15. By me Kings
Reigne, &amp;c. Ergo,</hi> they are of immediate divine inſtitution, and have all their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from God, not from the people, and may in no caſe be reſiſted, cenſured,
depoſed, or put to death for any miſdemeanours; the conſequences thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
            <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Firſt, That this Text ſpeakes onely of the promotion or Reigne of
Kings;<note n="m" place="margin">2 Chro. 9. 8. Iſa. 32. 2 c. 16. 5.</note> not of the erections and power of Monarchies; and ſo doe <hi>Daniel 2. 21. c.</hi> 4.
17. 25. <hi>c.</hi> 5. 26. 28. with the other objected Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If it be meant of the rule of Kings; then true it is, that good Kings
Reigne by Gods direction, according to his word, <hi>executing juſtice, and judgement,
as he enjoynes them;</hi> But then it is not true of wicked Kings and Tyrants, who though
they Reigne by Gods Providence or permiſſion, yet they rule not by his word and
will as he preſcribes them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If it be meant of the meanes and manner of Kings comming to their
Kingdomes, as I conceive it is, and the Texts of <hi>Daniel</hi> perſwade:</p>
            <p>True it is: firſt, That ſome Kings Reigned and came to the Crowne by Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115430:64"/>
nomination and deſignation, as <hi>Saul, David, Solomon, Jeroboam, Jehu,</hi> and
<hi>Hazael</hi> did: But that all, or moſt did heretofore, or now doe ſo, eſpecially in Pagan
Kingdomes, is a notorious falſhood.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is true, That moſt lawfull Kings in hereditary or elective Kingdomes,
come to their Crownes, and Reigne; though not by Gods immediate nomination,
yet by his ordinary or ſpeciall providence, (though it be untrue of <hi>Vſurpers,</hi> and
<hi>Tyrants</hi> who come to Reigne by Treaſon, Murther, or other unlawfull meanes; and
ſo by Gods<note n="l" place="margin">
                  <hi>See Doctor Willet, Paraeus,</hi> and others on Rom. 13.</note> 
               <hi>permiſſion onely, rather than his providence:</hi> and then the ſenſe of the
place is but this; That Kings receive their Crownes, and Reigne by Gods generall,
or more ſpeciall providence: Which I thinke is the full and proper ſenſe of the place.

or obedience, as the words, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher Powers,</hi>
coupled with the enſuing reaſon, <hi>Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth</hi> (that is, diſobeyeth, or

               <hi>ought
willingly and cheerfully to ſubmit to the higher Powers, not only with our bodies, but
ſoules and ſpirits too:</hi> I may hence cleerly inferre, that the reſiſtance of the higher
Power hee prohibited as contrary to this ſubjection, is not only that which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
and violent by force of armes, as the Objectors gloſſe it; but that likewiſe
which is verball, mentall, ſpirituall in the ſoule it ſelfe without the body, and no
more then a meer paſſive reſiſtance, or not obeying: For not to doe what the higher
Powers enjoyn, is in verity actually to reſiſt, to withſtand them; as not to doe the
will, not to yeeld obedience to the motions, dictates of the Holy Ghoſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
is really to <hi>reſiſt</hi> them, even in Scripture phraſe: Yea, corporall reſiſtance or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
by way of force is only an higher degree of reſiſtance, but not the onely or
proper reſiſtance here prohibited, which relates principally to the Soule and Spirit.
For as corporall forced obedience againſt a mans will which ſtill holds<note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 7.</note> 
               <hi>out, is no

               <hi>principally in the cheerfull ſubmiſſion or activity of the ſoule
or will:</hi> So a forced corporall reſiſtance againſt the mind or conſcience, <hi>is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
no reſiſtance;</hi> and the very malignity, quinteſſence of all inward or outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
diſobedience, reſts only in the mind, ſoule, will; and is here principally
forbidden, as is evident by the 5. verſe; <hi>Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not onely
for wrath</hi> (which relates only to <hi>the body,</hi> which mens wrath can <hi>only harm</hi> in caſe of
<hi>diſobedience, Mat.</hi> 10. 28.) <hi>but alſo FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE,</hi> which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,

by like reaſon are no wayes prohibited, but authorized by it, even forcibly to reſiſt
to our utmoſt power, have we meanes and opportunity ſo to doe, as the Parliament
now hath: That power and proceedings which Chriſtians may lawfully with good
conſcience, yea and are bound to reſiſt with all their ſouls, minds, tongues, they juſtly
may and muſt likewiſe reſiſt with all their corporall <hi>might and ſtrength;</hi> eſpecially
if they have good opportunity, publike encouragements, and meanes to do it, as
<hi>Deut. 6. 12. 1 Pet. 5. 9. Iude 3. 4. Phil. 1. 27, 28. 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 13. compared together,
and with the premiſed Scriptures, fully evidence. But Chriſtians may lawfully with
good conſcience, yea muſt reſiſt with all their ſouls, minds, tongues, the fore-named
violent proceedings of kings, Oppreſſors, ill Counſellors and Cavaleers, and no
wayes ſubmit unto them with their ſouls, minds, tongues, leſt thereby <hi>they ſhould

a <hi>ſhedder of mans blood;</hi> and not content to chide him, he fixed the point of his
Staffe in his breſt, preferring the publike ſcandall of Religion before private
ſociety, not being ignorant, that the Offices of familiarity were one thing, the rights
of Prieſthood another thing, that the wickedneſſes of Lords as well as ſervants
ought to be revenged, nor are Noble-mens crimes to be more partially cenſured,
then ignoble ones: And not content thus to repulſe him, he added an execration
therunto and denounced a ſentence of damnation againſt him in his preſence, ſo as he
left it doubtfull, whether he repulſed him more valiantly with his hand, or voyce.
Hereupon the King conſidering this Act to proceed from zeale and publike ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

forbad any to reſiſt his violence, and patiently underwent, heard both his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe

on old courſe apparell, deſiring rather to teſtifie his ſorrow by the deformity of his
habit, then his contempt by the ſplendor of it. And ſtruck with ſo ſad a ſentence
of the Biſhop, he would not indure to carry about the ornaments of Royall Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence;
but caſting away the enſignes of Regall Majeſty, he put on ſack-cloth
the badge of penitence; putting off his power likewiſe together with his veſtment,

There are two things by which the world is principally governed, The ſacred Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

               </gap>, by how much they are to give an account of kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at the Divine audit: And therefore the kings Majeſty ought to know, that you
ought to depend on their judgement, not they to be regulated according to your will. For
who doubteth that the prieſts of Christ are accounted the FATHERS AND MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STERS
of Kings, Princes, and all faithfull Chriſtians? Is it not known to be apart of
miſerable madneſſe, if the ſon ſhould endeavour to ſubjugate the Father, the ſervant
the master to himſelf? The Canonicall authority of Scriptures testifieth, that diver.
Pontiffs have excommunicated, ſome of them Kings, others Emperours: And if you
require ſomewhat in ſpeciall of the perſons of Princes; Saint <hi>Innocent</hi> ſmote the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Archadius</hi> with the ſword of excommunication, becauſe he conſented that Saint
<hi>John Chryſoſtom</hi> ſhould be violently expelled from his See. Likewiſe <hi>Saint Ambroſe</hi>
Archbiſhop of Millain, for afault which ſeemednot ſo hainous to other priests, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the great: From which ſentence, having first
given condigne ſatisfation, he afterwards deſerved to be abſolved; and many ſuch like
examples may be alleaged, both more certain for time, and nearer for place. Therefore
no Biſhops whatſoever neither may nor ought to be puniſhed by the ſecular Power, if they
chance to offend through humane frailtie: For it is the duty of a good and religious
Prince to honour the Priests of God, and defend them with greatest reverence, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115430:67"/>
of the Pious Prince of most happy memory, <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſaying, when the cauſe

own ſpirituall Eſtates, as the Context reſolves:) Thus and much more this Prelate,
who notwithſtanding this text of the</hi> Romanes, <hi>pleads an exemption of all Biſhops
and Prieſts from the kings ſecular power, by Divine Authority, and arrogates to

and cenſure them for their offences. And to deſcend to later times, even ſince the

Biſhop may upon great and urgent occaſion, if it ſhall be neceſſary to edifie Gods Church,
and there be no other remedy, flee to this last cenſure of Excommunication AGAINST
A WICKED KING? <hi>Making it a thing not queſtionable by our Prelates and

            <p>Secondly, This Text enjoynes no more ſubjection to kings, then to any other

               </gap>bly reſiſted when they actually attempt by
force to ruine Religion, Lawes, Liberties, the republike, as I haue proved, and our
Antagoniſts muſt grant; by the ſelf-ſame reaſon kings may be reſiſted too, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
any thing in this Text, which attributes no more irreſiſtability or authority
to Kings, then unto other Magiſtrates.</p>
            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:115430:68"/>
            <p>Thirdly, Kings are here expreſly called; AN ORDINANCE OF
MAN, not God; as I have formerly proved them to be. If ſo; I then appeal to
the conſciences of our fierceſt Antagoniſts, whether they do beleeve in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
or date take their Oathes upon it; That ever any people or Nation in the
world, or our Anceſtors at firſt, did appoint any Kings or Governours over them, to
ſubvert Religion, Laws, Liberties; or intend to give them ſuch an unlimited uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
Soveraignty over them, as not to provide for their own ſafety, or not to
take up Arms againſt them, for the neceſſary defence of their Laws, Liberties, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Perſons, States, under pain of high Treaſon, or eternall damnation, in caſe they
ſhould degenerate into Tyrants, and undertake any ſuch wicked deſtructive deſigne.
If not (as none can without madneſſe and impudence averre the contrary, it being
againſt all common ſence and reaſon, that any man or Nation ſhould ſo abſolutely,
irreſiſtably inſlave themſelves and their Poſterities to the very luſts and exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Tyrants, and ſuch a thing as no man, no Nation in their right ſences, were they
at this day to erect a moſt abſolute Monarchie, would condeſcend to;) then clearly the
Apoſtle here confirming onely the <hi>Ordinances of men,</hi> and giving no Kings nor Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
any other or greater power then men had formerly granted them (for that had
been to alter, not approve their humane Ordinances) I ſhall infallibly thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre;
That whole States, and Subjects, may with ſafe conſcience reſiſt the unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of their Kings in the foreſaid caſes, becauſe they never gave them any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
irreſiſtably to act them, nor yet deveſted themſelves (much leſſe their poſterity
whom they could not eternally inſlave) of the right, the power of reſiſting them in
ſuch caſes; whom they might juſtly reſiſt before, whiles they were private men, and
as to which illegall proceedings they continue private perſons ſtill, ſince they have no
legall power given them by the people to authorize any ſuch exorbitances.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The ſubjection here enjoyned, is not paſſive, but active, witneſſe <hi>ver.</hi> 15.
<hi>For ſo is the will of God, that by</hi> WELL DOING (to wit, by your actuall cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>ſubmiſſion to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, &amp;c.) you put to ſilence the
ignorance of fooliſh men: as free, and not uſing your liberty, &amp;c.</hi> If then this Text be
meant of active, not paſſive obedience; then it can be intended onely of lawfull
Kings, of Magiſtrates in their juſt commands, whom we muſt actually obey; not of
Tyrants and Oppreſſours in their unjuſt wicked proceedings, whom we are bound in
ſuch caſes actually to diſobey, as our Antagoniſts grant, and I have largely evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced
elſewhere: Wherefore, it directly commands reſiſtance, not ſubjection in ſuch
caſes; ſince actuall diſobedience to unjuſt commands, is actuall reſiſting of them.
And that theſe Texts preſcribing reſiſtance tacitely, ſhould apparantly prohibit it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pain of Treaſon, Rebellion, Damnation, is a Paradox to me.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This Text doth no way prove that falſe conceit of moſt, who hence
conclude: That all Kings are the Supream Powers, and above their Parliaments,
and whole Kingdoms, even by Divine inſtitution: There is no ſuch thing, nor ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of it in the Text.</p>
            <p>For firſt,<note place="margin">I.</note> This Text calls Kings, not a Divine, but <hi>Humane Ordinance;</hi> If
then Kings be the Supreameſt Power, and above their Parliaments, Kingdoms,
it is not by any Divine Right, but by <hi>Humane Ordination</hi> onely, as the Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">II</note> This Text preſcribes not any Divine Law to all or any particular States;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115430:69"/>
nor gives any other. Divine or Civill Authority to Kings and Magiſtrates in any
State then what they had before; for if it ſhould give Kings greater Authority and
Prerogatives then their people at firſt allotted them, it ſhould alter and invade the
ſettled Government of all States, contrary to the Apoſtles ſcope, which was to
leave them as they were, or ſhould be ſettled by the peoples joynt conſent: It doth
not ſay, <hi>That all Kings in all Kingdoms are, or ought to be Supreame; or let them
be ſo henceforth:</hi> no ſuch inference appears therein. It ſpeaks not what Kings
ought to be in point of Power; but onely takes them as they are, (according to
that of <hi>Rom. 13. 2. The Powers that ARE, &amp;c.</hi> to wit, that are, even now every

               <hi>elſewhere</hi> proved: To ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
therefore, We muſt ſubmit to Kings where the people have made them ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> All Kings every where are and ought to be ſupreame <hi>Jure divino;</hi>
(as our <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> hence inferre) is a groſſe abſurdity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">III.</note> This Text doth not ſay, That the King is the ſupreame ſoveraigne
Power, as moſt miſtake; but <hi>ſupreame Governour,</hi> as the next words; or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
&amp;c.</hi> expond it; and the very <hi>Oath of Supremacie, 1. Eliz. Cap.</hi> 1.
which gives our Kings this Title, <hi>Supreame Governour within theſe his Realms.</hi>
Now Kings may be properly called Supreame Magiſtrates or Governours in their
Realms, in reſpect of the actuall adminiſtration of government and juſtice, (all
Magiſtrates deriving their Commiſſions immediately from them, and doing ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
for, and under them:) and yet not be the Soveraign Power, as the <hi>Romane
Emperours,</hi> the <hi>Kings of Sparta, Arragon,</hi> and others; the <hi>German Emperours,</hi>
the <hi>Dukes of Venice</hi> in that State,<note n="c" place="margin">Bodin. <hi>Common-weal</hi> l. 2. c. 5. l. 1. c. 10.</note> and the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> in the <hi>Nether-lands,</hi>

body of many members, not alwayes conſtantly ſitting, may properly be
ſtiled, The <hi>Supreame Courts and Powers;</hi> but not the <hi>Supreame Magistrate</hi> or
<hi>Governour:</hi> As the <hi>Pope</hi> holds himſelf, the <hi>Supreame Head and Governour of the
Militant Church;</hi> and the <hi>Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury</hi> ſtiles himſelf, the <hi>Primate
and Metropolitane of all England;</hi> and ſo other Prelates in their Provinces; yet
they are not the <hi>Soveraigne Eccleſiaſticall Power,</hi> for the King, at leaſt <hi>Generall
Councells</hi> or <hi>Nationall Synods</hi> (which are not properly tearmed <hi>Governours,</hi> but

becauſe they are the higheſt particular Governours and Magiſtrates in their Realms,

not freely choſen and aſſented to by the people. So as all the Argument which can
hence be extracted for the abſolute Soveraigntie and irreſiſtibility of Kings over
their whole Kingdomes and Parliaments, is but this. The King of the <hi>Jews</hi> was
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115430:70"/>
in <hi>Peters</hi> time the Supreame Magiſtrate over that <hi>Nation,</hi> by the Romane Senates

the <hi>Romanes</hi> having conquered the <hi>Jewes</hi> by force, and impoſing this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon them, without their conſents. Therefore the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and
all other Kings are abſolute Soveraigne Monarches, Superiour to their whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
and Kingdomes, collectively conſidered; and may not in point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
be forcibly reſiſted by them, though they endeavour to ſubvert Religion,

            <p>From theſe Scriptures,<note place="margin">Objection II.</note> I deſcend to Reaſons deduced from them, againſt reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,

            <p>Fifthly, This is but the common exploded Argument of the Popiſh Clergy,
<hi>To prove themſelves ſuperiour to Kings, and exempt from all ſecular Juriſdiction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

of parties aſſaulted, nor yet from impriſonment, cenſures, and capitall executions
by Kings and Civill Magiſtrates, in caſe of capitall Crimes; Therefore by like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it can not exempt Kings from the reſiſtance, cenſures of their Parliaments,
Kingdoms, in caſe of tyrannicall invaſions. We deride this Argument in Papiſts

them of all humane means, and poſſibilities of preſervation; and denies them that

            <p>Secondly, The knowledge of a lawfull power in Subjects to reſiſt Tyrants, will
be a good means to keep Princes from Tyrannicall courſes, for fear of ſtrenuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;
which if once taken away, there is no humane bridle left to ſtay the

            <p>For firſt, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in this place ſpeaks not at all of Subjects reſiſting their Princes,

make no forcible reſiſtance at all againſt them with Arms in point of conſcience,

            <p>This is the uttermoſt concluſion which can properly be hence deduced; which

the Biſhop for preferring the ſecular warfare before the ſpirituall, in that he had taken a

Argument that our oppoſites can thence extract, is but this. Prieſts muſt uſe no

<hi>Ergo,</hi> The Prieſts and Miniſters in his Majeſties Armies, who bear Offenſive Arms,
muſt now in conſcience lay them down, and uſe no other reſiſtance, but prayers
and tears againſt the Parliaments forces: where as their former inference againſt

by their command, to defend Religion, Laws, Liberties, againſt his Majeſties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
forces, who intend by force to ſubvert them; is but ridiculous nonſence,
which never once entred into this Fathers thoughts, and can never be extorted
from his words.</p>
            <p>Miniſters of the Goſpel muſt not uſe any Arms, but prayers and tears to reſiſt
a forraigne Enemy: <hi>Ergo,</hi> None elſe may lawfully uſe them to withſtand an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading

Chriſtians both may and muſt reſiſt tyrants by the moſt powerful &amp; effectual means

a Tyrant with their Prayers, Teares, then why not with their Swords? Doth God

Non erat iis pro ſalute pugnare, niſi ſalutem pro ſalute contemnere. <hi>The
ſumme of all theſe Fathers ſayings</hi> (which I have largely cited, becauſe I would
conceale nothing that might be materially objected) is this: That the Chriſtians
in the primitive Church, though they were many in number, and ſufficiently able
to defend themſelves againſt their perſecuters by force of Armes, did yet refuſe to
doe it, yeelding themſelves up to any tortures, puniſhments, deaths, without the
leaſt reſiſtance in word or deed; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Parliament and Kingdome ought now to
make no reſiſtance at all againſt the Kings popiſh Army and Cavaliers, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
themſelves to their cruelties and rapines, without the leaſt reſiſtance in word
or deed.</p>
            <p>Becauſe this objection ſtickes moſt with many Schollars,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Statiſts, and tender
conſciences, I ſhall endeavour to give a ſatisfactory anſwer to it, without any ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evaſions, or queſtioning the truth of <hi>Tertullians,</hi> and <hi>Cyprians aſſertions, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the multitude and ſtrength of the Chriſtians, and their ability to reſist,</hi> which ſome
have taken<note n="e" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> his Anti-cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieriſme, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Armes.</note> great paines to refute.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> then I ſay, that neither of all theſe Fathers ſay, That the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
held it <hi>unlawfull,</hi> muchleſſe <hi>damnable, in point of conſcience for them to reſiſt
their perſecuting enemies,</hi> no ſuch ſyllable in any of them. And <hi>Tertullians, Si non
apud iſtam diſciplinam</hi> MAGIS OCCIDI LICET QUAM OCCIDERE,
by way of neceſſary defence, implies no ſuch thing, but rather proves the contrary,
that reſiſtance is lawfull, becauſe it is lawfull to be ſlaine as a martyr; therefore in
this caſe to ſlay. So as there is nothing in theſe authorities in point of conſcience
to condemne the Parliaments preſent reſiſtance, and defenſive warre, as unlawful:</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> they all ſeeme to grant, that the Chriſtians deemed reſiſtance even by
force of Armes to be lawfull for them, though they uſed it not; no Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
prohibiting, but allowing it, and theſe Fathers producing no one text which
truly condemnes it; this being the very ſumme of their words. That though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:115430:74"/>
Chriſtians were exceeding many in number, <hi>of ſtrength and power abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to defend themſelves in a warlike manner against their perſecuters, and had full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and no reſtraint upon them in point of Conſcience either to withſtand their perſecutors
with Armes, or to withdraw themſelves from under the juriſdiction of their perſecuters
into remote parts, to the great weakning and loſſe of the State: yet ſuch was their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
innocency, and deſire of Martyrdome, that they reſiſted not their Adverſaries with
force, nor retired, nor fled away from under their obedience, but cheerfully without the
leaſt reſiſtance by word, deed, or thought, yeelded up their Bodies, Liberties, Lives, to
the cruelties of their Enemies, to obtaine that Crowne of Martyrdome which they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and to offer up themſelves a voluntary freewill oblation to the Lord, who would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
avenge all their wrongs.</hi> This is the ſum of all theſe Authorities, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
reſiſtance lawfull in it ſelfe, and to theſe Chriſtians too in their owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and reſolutions, though the deſire of Martyrdome made them freely to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
it. Theſe Examples and Authorities therefore abundantly corroborate, and
no wayes impeach our cauſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> their examples of not reſiſting Perſecuters, being rather voluntary, then
enjoyned, out of a longing deſire to be Martyrs, and an aſſurance of divine venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to be executed on their Perſecuters, is no reſtraint nor ground at all for other
Chriſtians, now not to uſe any forcible reſiſtance, it being a groſſe inconſequent to
argue: The Primitive Chriſtians voluntarily refuſed to defend themſelves with
force of Armes againſt their Perſecuters, though they were not bound in point of
Conſcience from ſuch reſiſtance, and had both liberty and power to reſiſt. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
Chriſtians in point of Conſcience ought not to make any forcible reſiſtance againſt
oppreſſing Lords and Perſecuters now: For then this their voluntary choice and
election ſhould deprive all following Chriſtians of that ability of defence which
both themſelves then had, and ſince enjoy by Gods and Natures Law. Yet this is all
the argument which can be ingeniouſly framed from theſe Authorities and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
the abſurdity whereof I ſhall thus further illuſtrate from like Precedents: We

<hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his booke <hi>De fuga in perſecutione.</hi> Will our Oppoſites from hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> it is unlawfull for Chriſtians not onely to reſiſt, but even to flee from
their Perſecuters, or his Majeſties murdering, plundering Forces? Or for them
ſelves to flee, not onely from the Parliaments Forces, but Juſtice too, as many of
them have done, yea, made eſcapes againſt Law to flee therefrom. If the Chriſtians
not fleeing, binde neither them, nor us, not to flee now, why ſhould their not reſiſting
onely doe it? Secondly,<note n="g" place="margin">See <hi>Fox</hi> Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, Vol. 1. <hi>paſſim.</hi>

plementall Ceremonie; as ſoon as they heard how the Emperour had over-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
them, and given out ſpeeches that they had ſacrificed to his Idol, preſently
riſing from the feaſt prepared for them, in a fury, inflamed with zeale and wrath,
ran through the Market place, and cried out openly, Wee are Chriſtians, Wee are
Chriſtians in minde; let all men heare it, and above all, God, to whom we both
live and will alſo die. O Chriſt our Saviour, we have not broken our faith plight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to thee: If our hand hath any way offended, verily our minde followed it not
at all; we are circumvented by the Emperours fraud with whoſe gold we are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
We have put off impiety, we are purged by blood. After which, poſting
ſpeedily to the Emperour, and caſting away their gold, with a generous and ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
minde they exclaimed againſt him in this manner. O Emperour, we have
not received gifts, but are damned with death. We are not called for our honour,
but branded with ignominie. Give this benefit to thy Souldiers, kill and behead
us unto Chriſt, to whoſe Empire onely we are ſubject. Recompence fire for fire;
for thoſe aſhes reduce us into aſhes. Cut off the hands which we have wickedly
ſtretched out; the feet wherewith we have perniciouſly run together. Give gold
to others, who will not afterwards repent they have received it; Chriſt is enough,
and more then ſufficient unto us, whom we account in ſtead of all. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
enraged with this ſpeech, refuſed to ſlay them openly, leſt they ſhould bee
made Martyrs, who as much as in them lay were Martyrs; but onely baniſhed
them, revenging this their contempt with that puniſhment.</q> Will it then follow
from theſe memorable examples, That all true Chriſtians now in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
muſt come thus and offer themſelves voluntarily to the Popiſh Rebels and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(now in Arms to extirpate the Proteſtant Religion in both Kingdoms) or that
the Members of both Houſes muſt go ſpeedily to <hi>Oxford</hi> to the King and his evill
Counſellors, and there let them kill, hang, burne, quarter, ſlay, execute, torture
them, ſubvert Religion, Laws, Liberties, Parliaments, without the leaſt reſiſtance?
Or will our Oppoſites hence conclude (as they may with better Judgement and
Conſcience doe) <hi>Ergo,</hi> all ſuch perſons voted Traitors and Delinquents in any
kinde by both Houſes of Parliament, ought now in point of Conſcience (to avoid
the effuſion of blood and ruine of the Realm, through the civill warres they have
occaſioned) to lay down their Arms, and voluntarily reſigne up themſelves to the
impartiall Juſtice of the Parliament, without any the leaſt reſiſtance for the future:
If no ſuch Doctrinall, or Practicall concluſions may be drawne from theſe their
Precedents of voluntary ſeeking and rendring themſelves up to the Martyrdome
of their Oppoſites; then the unlawfulneſſe of reſiſting cannot be inferred from
this their non-reſiſting. Thirdly, how many cowardly Souldiers in all ages, and
in this too, have voluntarily yeelded up Forts, Caſtles, Ships, Armes, Perſons, to
their invading approaching enemies without fight or reſiſtance? How many
perſons have reſigned up their Purſes to high-way theeves, their Lands to diſſeiſors,
their Houſes, Goods to riotors, their Ships, Eſtates, Perſons, to Turkiſh and other
Pirats, without any reſiſtance, when they might have lawfully and eaſily preſerved
them by reſiſting? Will it therefore follow, that all others muſt do ſo? that we muſt
not ſight againſt invading Enemies, Theeves, Pirats Riotors, becauſe many good
Chriſtians out of fear or cowardiſe, or for other reaſons have not done it in all
ages? I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> admit the Chriſtians then deemed all forcible reſiſtance of perſecuters
ſimply unlawfull in point of Conſcience, as being a thing quite contrary to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
profeſſion and Religion; then as it neceſſarily proves on the one ſide, That
even Chriſtian Kings, Princes, Magiſtrates, muſt in no wiſe forcibly reſiſt the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
Rebellions, Inſurrections, and perſecutions of their Subjects, becauſe
they are Chriſtians as well as Rulers, and in this regard equally obliged with
them not to reſiſt with Armes; much leſſe then their Parliaments Forces lawfully
raiſed for the publike defence. So on the contrary part it follows not, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reſiſtance is either unlawfull in it ſelfe, or that the Parliaments preſent reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is ſo. For firſt, ſuch reſiſtance being no where prohibited (as I have formerly
proved) their bare opinion, that it was unlawfull to them, cannot make it ſo to them,
or us in point of conſcience, ſince God hath not made or declared it ſo. Secondly, the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115430:76"/>
primitive Chriſtians held many things unlawfull in point of Conſcience, which
we now hold not ſo.<note n="z" place="margin">De corona Militis.</note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others informe us, <hi>That the Chriſtians in
his time thought it a hainous ſinne (Nefas) to pray kneeling on the Lords day, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Eaſter and Whitſontide</hi> (and ſo by conſequence to kneele at the Sacrament)
<hi>praying alwayes ſtanding on thoſe dayes in memory of Chriſts reſurrection.</hi> Which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
was ratified alſo by many<note n="a" place="margin">Surius Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. tom. 1. p. 347. tom. 2. p. 1052. tom. 3. p. 324. 277.</note> Councels: Yet then it was lawfull no doubt
in it ſelfe for them to pray kneeling, and we all uſe the contrary cuſtome now. The
Chriſtians then held it unlawfull, to <hi>eat blood in puddings, or any other meats, as</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Apologet.</note> Tertullian,<note n="c" place="margin">Octavius.</note> Minucius Felix <hi>teſtifie, and many</hi>

               <hi>Councels expreſſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
it ſince, as unlawfull:</hi> Yet all Churches at this day deem it lawfull, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
the contrary. The Chriſtians in <hi>Tertullians</hi> dayes, and he himſelfe in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Book, <hi>De fuga in perſecutione,</hi> held it unlawfull to flee in <hi>times of perſecution,
and therefore they voluntarily offered themſelves to martyrdome without flight or reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
Yet we all now hold flying <hi>lawfull,</hi> and all ſorts practiſe it <hi>as lawfull;</hi> yea
many more then they ought to doe. I might give ſundry other inſtances of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
The Chriſtians opinion therefore of the unlawfulneſſe of any armed reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Perſecuters publike or private (held they any ſuch) though ſeconded with
their practice, is no good argument of its unlawfulneſſe, without better evidence,
either then, or at this preſent. Thirdly, the caſe of the Primitive Chriſtians and
ours now is far different; The Emperours, Magiſtrates, and whole States under
which they then lived were all Pagan Idolaters, their Religion quite contrary to
the Laws and falſe Religions ſetled in thoſe States: There were <hi>many</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Tertul. Apolog. Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Socrates, ſcolaſticus, Hiſt. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Laws
and Edicts then in force againſt</hi> Chriſtian Religion, unrepealed: moſt Profeſſors of
Religion were of the loweſt ranke,<note n="f" place="margin">Cor. 1. 26. John 7. 48.</note> 
               <hi>not many wiſe, Noble, mighty men, ſcarce
any great Officer, Magiſtrate, or Senator, was of that profeſſion,</hi> but all fierce ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
againſt it: For Chriſtians, being but private men, and no apparant body of a
State, to make any publike forcible reſiſtance in defence of Religion againſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
Senators, Magiſtrates, Lawes, and the whole State wherein they lived, had
neither been prevalent nor expedient; a great hinderance and prejudice to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and as ſome hold, unlawfull. But our preſent caſe is far otherwiſe; our King,
Parliament, State, Magiſtrates, People, are all Chriſtians in externall profeſſion,
our Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed, Popery excluded, baniſhed by ſundry publike
Lawes; the Houſes of Parliament, and others now reſiſting, are the whole body of
the Realme in repreſentation, and have authority, even by Law, to defend
themſelves and Religion againſt invading Popiſh Forces: In which regards our
preſent reſiſtance is, and may cleerly bee affirmed lawfull, though the primitive
Chriſtians, in reſpect of the former circumſtances, might not be ſo. Secondly,
their reſiſtance, (eſpecially of the Magiſtrates not vulgar rabble) if made, had been
onely, ſingly for defence of their Religion then practiſed but in corners, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
condemned, no where tolerated: Our preſent war is not onely for defence
of our Religion eſtabliſhed by Law, and to keep out Popery, but for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Laws, Liberties, the very eſſence of Parliaments, the ſafety of the Realme,
and that by authority of Parliament, the repreſentative body of the Realme. The
Parliaments defenſive warre, therefore, upon theſe politicke grounds is juſt and
lawfull, though the Primitive Chriſtians, perchance in defence of Religion onely,
as its caſe then ſtood, would not have been ſo: even as the Roman Senators and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115430:76"/>
States reſiſting of <hi>Nero,</hi> or any other Tyrannicall Emperors violations of the Laws,
Liberties, Lives, Eſtates of the Senate, people, were then reputed juſt and lawfull,
though the Chriſtians defence of Religion would not have been ſo eſteemed in thoſe
times. And thus I hope I have ſatisfactorily anſwered this objection without ſhifts or
evaſions, and rectified theſe miſtaken Fathers meanings, with which our Oppoſites have
ſeduced the illiterate over-credulous vulgar.</p>
            <p>I have now (through Gods aſſiſtance) quite run through all Obiections of moment
from Scripture, Reaſon, Fathers, againſt the lawfulneſſe of the Parliaments preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
war, and diſcovered divers groſſe errors, yea, Impoſtures in our Oppoſites
writings, wherewith they have perverted many mens Conſciences, and cheated the
ignorant ſeduced world: I ſhall therefore here adviſe them in the preſence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, as they will anſwer the contrary before his Tribunall at the Day of
Iudgement, ſeriouſly to conſider theſe my anſwers, and publikely to retract thoſe their
Errors, falſe groſſe miſ-interpretations, perverſions of Scriptures, Authors, which I
have here diſcovered. And ſince they pretend <hi>nothing but their ſatisfying and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a good</hi>

of Arms reſiſt and defend both themſelves and other; &amp; not only repulſe this injury, but

THE NOBILITY AND COMMONS IOYN TOGETHER TO DEFEND THEIR
ANCIENT AND ACCVSTOMED LIBERTY, REGIMENT AND LAWS, THEY
MAY NOT WELL BE COVNTED REBELS.</hi> I never denied, but that the People
might preſerve the foundation, freedom, and forme of the Common-wealth, which
they fore priſed when they firſt conſented to have a King: As I ſaid then, ſo I ſay now,
The Law of God giveth no man leave; but I never ſaid, that Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
might not proportion their States, as they thought beſt, by their publike
Laws, which afterward the Princes themſelves may not violate. By ſupertour Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ordained of God, (Rom. 13.) we underſtand not onely Princes, BVT ALL PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITIKE
STATES AND REGIMENTS; ſomewhere the People, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
the Nobles, having the ſame intereſt to the ſword, that Princes have to their
Kingdoms, and in Kingdoms where Princes bear rule by the ſword; we do not mean
<hi>THE PRIVATE PRINCES WILL AGAINST HIS LAWS, BVT HIS PRECEPT
DERIVED FROM HIS LAWES, AND AGREEING WITH HIS LAWES:</hi>
Which though it be wicked, yet may it not be reſiſted of any ſubject, (when derived
from, and agreeing with the Laws) with armed violence. Marry, when Princes
offer their Subjects not Iuſtice, but force, and deſpiſe all Laws to practiſe their luſts,
not every, nor any private man may take the ſword to redreſſe the Prince; but if the
Laws of the Land appoint the Nobles as next to the King to aſſiſt him in doing right,
and withhold him from doing wrong, THEN BE THEY LICENCED BY
MANS LAW, AND NOT PROHIBITED BY GODS, to interpoſe
themſelves for ſafeguard of equity and innoceucy, and by all lawfull AND NEED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FVLL
MEANS TO PROCVRE THE PRINCE TO BE <hi>RE</hi> FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MED,
but in no caſe deprived where the Scepter is Hereditary.</q> 
               <hi>So this learned
Biſhop determines in his authorized Book dedicated to Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blank

            </p>
            <p>But that which ſwayes moſt with me, is not the opinions of private men, byaſſed
oft-times with private ſiniſter ends which corrupt their judgements, (as I dare ſay
moſt of our Oppoſites in this controverſie have writ to flatter Princes, to gain or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
promotions, &amp;c.) But the generall univerſall opinion and practice of all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
Nations in the world from time to time. Never was there any State or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115430:78"/>
under heaven from the beginning of the world till now, that held or reſolved it
to be unlawfull in point of Law or Coſcience, to reſiſt with force of Arms the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their Emperours, Kings, Princes, eſpecially when they openly made war, or
exerciſed violence againſt them, to ſubvert their Religion, Laws, Liberties, State,
Government. If ever there were any Kingdom, State, People of this opinion, or
which forbore to take up Arms againſt their Tyrannous Princes in ſuch caſes, even
for conſcience ſake, <hi>I</hi> deſire our Antagoniſts to name them; for though <hi>I</hi> have dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
ſearched, inquired after ſuch, <hi>I</hi> could never yet finde or hear of them in the

is both iuſt, lawfull, neceſſary, yea, a duty to be undertaken by the generall conſent
