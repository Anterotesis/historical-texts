            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and <hi>Iſſue</hi> of our Affairs, with all the great <hi>undertaking</hi> of the people of God in this Nation, that of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves I hope they will make ſome <hi>paſſage</hi> to the hearts of them, to whom the Inferences from them, ſhall this day be applyed.</p>
            <p>In the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> we haue an account of a great victory that <hi>Aſa,</hi> and the people of <hi>Judah</hi> fighting in faith, and with <hi>prayer</hi> obtained againſt the <hi>huge hoſt</hi> of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> with the abundant ſpoyles which they took, and carried away there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p>In their <hi>Triumphant</hi> return to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſtirs up a <hi>Prophet</hi> to goe out, and meet them, to give them an account of the <hi>riſe,</hi> and <hi>cauſe</hi> of their ſucceſs, and direction for their future de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment under the injoyment of ſuch mercies and deliverances.</p>
            <p>The Lord knows how apt even the beſt of men, are to forget the <hi>spring</hi> of their mercies; how neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in making ſuitable <hi>returns</hi> by a due improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the advantages put into their hands, unto the Lord of all mercies. Therefore are they in all <hi>ſeaſons</hi> to be minded of their proper <hi>intereſt,</hi> and duty; This is done in my <hi>Text</hi> to <hi>Aſa</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> by <hi>Oded,</hi> and I deſire in my <hi>Sermon,</hi> that it may with the ſame <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and the ſame <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> be done by me unto you.</p>
            <p>The words I intend principally to inſiſt on, having the <hi>ſame thing</hi> for ſubſtance <hi>three times</hi> repeated in them, the opening of the firſt <hi>clauſe</hi> with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency of the <hi>whole,</hi> will ſuffice as to their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> and the grounding of that general <hi>propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which I ſhall improve. Two things are then <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally</hi> to be inquired into.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:168412:4"/>
Firſt, what it is for <hi>God to be with any people.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <note place="margin">1.</note> what it is for a people <hi>to be, or abide with,</hi> God; and according to the <hi>Analogie</hi> of theſe two the following <hi>Aſſertions</hi> of <hi>ſeeking</hi> the Lord, and <hi>forſaking</hi> him will be eaſily underſtood. For <hi>though</hi> the words differ in <hi>expreſſion,</hi> yet they are all of the ſame way of <hi>Aſſertion:</hi> They are 3, <hi>hypothetical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi> or promiſſory aſſertions on ſuppoſition. If you <hi>abide</hi> with <hi>the Lord,</hi> he will be with you, if you <hi>ſeek</hi> the Lord, he will be <hi>found</hi> of you, if you <hi>forſake</hi> the Lord, he will forſake you: The ſame matter is <hi>trebled</hi> for the fuller and ſurer confirmation of the thing <hi>Aſſerted.</hi> Only whereas the <hi>laſt</hi> propoſition ſuppoſeth a thing <hi>poſſible,</hi> namely that they might <hi>forſake the Lord;</hi> the firſt ſuppoſes a thing <hi>preſent,</hi> and therefore it is ſo expreſſed, <hi>whilſt you are with him;</hi> becauſe they had <hi>abode</hi> with God in their late <hi>war</hi> and triall.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon the <hi>opening</hi> of the words themſelves, I cannot paſs by the <hi>Earneſt Preface</hi> of the Prophet; <hi>Hear ye me O Aſa:</hi> he ſaw the <hi>people</hi> upon their <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> taken up with many <hi>thoughts,</hi> thinking of many <hi>buſineſſes,</hi> full of many contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, one imagening one thing, another another; all of them (it may be) how they ſhould uſe and improve their <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>ſucceſs</hi> to their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, Intereſt, Profit, or Security. Or the Princes, and Rulers, as it is probable, and uſual in ſuch caſes might be conſidering how to carry on their <hi>victory,</hi> how to make the beſt advantage of it, in their <hi>dealing</hi> with <hi>Neighbour</hi> Princes, and <hi>Nations,</hi> in making peace or warr. In the midſt of theſe <hi>thoughts,</hi> the Prophet meets them and diverts them with all Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, to things quite of another nature, and of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168412:5"/>
unſpeakably greater <hi>importance</hi> and concernment to them. <hi>Here ye me</hi> ſaith he; it is not your own <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> nor your own <hi>valour,</hi> that hath brought about this <hi>great work,</hi> this mighty victory; the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath done it, by his preſence with you. It is not of any <hi>concernment</hi> unto you, what other Nations do, or may do, but the preſence of God <hi>Concerns</hi> you alone to look after. <hi>The great concernment of any</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obs.</note> 
               <hi>People or Nation, is to know, that all their proſperity is from the preſence of God amongſt them, and to attend to that which will give continuance thereunto.</hi> You may tire your ſelves in the imaginations and contrivances of your own hearts, and lay out your thoughts and time about things that will not profit, nor advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage you, this is your intereſt, this is your concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Hear ye me Aſa, and all Judah and Benjamin.</hi> Of this propoſition afterwards.</p>
            <p>For the words <hi>themſelves,</hi> the firſt thing propoſed to be inquired into for their explanation is this; <hi>what it is for God to be with a people?</hi> God may be ſaid to be <hi>with</hi> men, or preſent with <hi>them</hi> in ſundry reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he may be ſaid to be with them in reſpect <note place="margin">1.</note> of the <hi>omnipreſence</hi> of his Eſſence; ſo he is <hi>naturally,</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> preſent with all creatures; <hi>indiſtant</hi> from them, <hi>preſent</hi> with them. The <hi>ubiquity</hi> and immenſity of his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> will not allow that he ſhould be <hi>diſtant</hi> from any thing to which he hath given a beeing. <hi>The heavens, even the heaven of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens cannot contain him. 1 Kings</hi> 8. 27. Doth he <hi>not fill heaven</hi> and earth? Is he a <hi>God at hand only,</hi> and not afar off, as to the ends of the Earth? This preſence of God with all things <hi>David emphatically</hi> declares. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. But it is not that, that is here intended: that is <hi>univerſal</hi> to all Creatures,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168412:5"/>
               <hi>natural,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary,</hi> this <hi>eſpecial</hi> to ſome, <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and of mercy; that of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>eſſence,</hi> this of Will and Operation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God may be ſaid to be with one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <note place="margin">2.</note> of <hi>perſonal union,</hi> ſo he was <hi>with,</hi> and <hi>only with</hi> the man Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 38. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>God was with him,</hi> that is, in <hi>perſonal union;</hi> the humane nature being taken into <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> with the ſon of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God is <hi>preſent,</hi> or <hi>with</hi> any in reſpect of <note place="margin">3.</note> the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> He is with them to be their God in Covenant, the Tenor whereof is, that he will not <hi>leave</hi> them, nor ſhall they <hi>forſake</hi> him, he will be <hi>for</hi> them, and they ſhall be <hi>for</hi> him, and not for another. He is <hi>with them</hi> for all the ends of <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, love, kindneſs, pardon, ſalvation,</hi> that are <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> and exhibited in it: But neither is this the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of God here intended, though this be <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> that flows from it, and does <hi>attend</hi> it: for,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that <hi>preſence</hi> of God with his people hath <note place="margin">1.</note> not ſuch a <hi>conditional</hi> eſtabliſhment, as this <hi>here</hi> mentioned: it ſtands on other <hi>terms,</hi> and better ſecurity than that here propoſed; it hath received an <hi>Eternal</hi> ratification in the bloud of Chriſt; is founded in the <hi>immutable purpoſe</hi> of Grace, and is not left to the <hi>conditionality</hi> here expreſſed, as we ſhall ſee afterwards.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>preſence</hi> here mentioned, reſpects <note place="margin">2.</note> the whole <hi>body</hi> of the people; all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> in their <hi>national ſtate,</hi> and conſideration, unto whom, as ſuch, the effectual <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace was never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; <hi>For they were not all Iſrael who were of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>preſence</hi> here promiſed reſpects im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <note place="margin">3.</note>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:168412:6"/>
the peculiar end of bleſſing the <hi>whole people</hi> with ſucceſs in their <hi>wars</hi> and undertakings; ſo the <hi>occaſion</hi> of the words, and the <hi>Context,</hi> with regard to the following diſcourſe do undeniably evince; It is not then this <hi>preſence</hi> of God only that is intended, though, as it will afterward appear, it is not to be ſeparated from it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there is <hi>a preſence</hi> of God in reſpect of <note place="margin">4.</note> 
               <hi>providential diſpenſations,</hi> and this is twofold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>General;</hi> Ordering, diſpoſing, guiding, <note place="margin">1.</note> ruling all things, according to his own <hi>wiſdome,</hi> by his own <hi>power,</hi> unto his own glory; Thus he is alſo <hi>preſent</hi> with <hi>all</hi> the world; He diſpoſes of all the <hi>affairs</hi> of all the ſons of men as he pleaſeth; <hi>ſets</hi> up <hi>one</hi> and <hi>pulls</hi> down another: changes <hi>times,</hi> ſeaſons, <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> bounds of Nations, as ſeems good to him. The <hi>help</hi> that is given to any he doth it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The <hi>ſhields</hi> of the Earth belong unto God; He works <hi>deliverance</hi> in the Earth, even among them that knows him not.</p>
            <p>And the Evills, <hi>deſolations</hi> and deſtruction, that the Earth is full of, are but the effects of his <hi>wrath</hi> and Indignation, revealing its ſelf againſt the ungodlineſs of men. He is thus preſent with <hi>every</hi> perſon in the world, holds his breath, and all his wayes in his <hi>hand;</hi> diſpoſes of his <hi>life,</hi> death, and all his <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> as he pleaſeth: He is preſent in <hi>all</hi> Nations, to ſet them up, <hi>pluck</hi> them down, <hi>alter, turne,</hi> change, weaken, eſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, enlarge their bounds as he ſees good; and the day is comming, when all his works will praiſe him: Neither is this here intended: It is neceſſary, and belongs to God, as God; and cannot be promiſed to any; It is a branch of Gods naturall <hi>dominion,</hi> that every Creature be ruled and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168412:6"/>
diſpoſed of, agreeably to its <hi>nature,</hi> unto the <hi>end</hi> whereunto it is appointed.</p>
            <p>Secondly <hi>ſpeciall;</hi> attended with <hi>peculiar love,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <note place="margin">2.</note> good will; ſpeciall care towards them, with whom he is ſo preſent: Soe <hi>Abimelech</hi> obſerved that he was with <hi>Abraham.</hi> Gen. 21. 22. <hi>God is with thee in all that thou doeſt:</hi> with thee, to <hi>guide</hi> thee, <hi>bleſſe</hi> thee, <hi>preſerve</hi> thee, as we ſhall ſee afterwards: So he promiſed to be with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Chap. 1. 5. and ſo he was with <hi>Gideon.</hi> Judges 6. 12. to <hi>bleſſe</hi> him in his great undertaking; and ſo with <hi>Jeremie,</hi> Chap. 15. 20. This is fully expreſſed <hi>Eſa. 43. 1, 2, 3. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed thee, I have called thee by thy Name, thou art mine: when thou paſſeſt thorow the water, I will be with thee, and thorow the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee;</hi> and this is the <hi>preſence</hi> of God here intimated; his <hi>preſence</hi> with the People, as to <hi>ſpeciall</hi> providentiall diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as is manifeſt from the whole <hi>diſcourſe</hi> of the <hi>Prophet;</hi> and wherein this <hi>conſiſts,</hi> ſhall be afterwards at large declared.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What is a Peoples <hi>abiding</hi> with God? <note place="margin">2.</note> There is a <hi>twofold</hi> abiding with God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In <hi>perſonall obedience,</hi> according to the <hi>tenor</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> This is not here <hi>intended,</hi> but <hi>ſuppoſed:</hi> There is no <hi>abiding</hi> in any thing with God, where there is not an abiding in this thing: yet this, as I ſaid, is not here <hi>principally</hi> intended, but ſuppoſed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further is intended: for as hath been <hi>declared,</hi> it is <hi>National</hi> work, and <hi>Nationall</hi> abiding, that is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; ſo that</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is an abiding with God in <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> 
               <hi>Adminiſtrations:</hi> this is a <hi>fruit</hi> of the other, in thoſe who are called to them; And that this is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally here intended, is <hi>evident,</hi> from that uſe that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168412:7"/>
               <hi>Aſa</hi> made of this Information, and Exhortation of the <hi>Prophet:</hi> He did not onely <hi>look</hi> to his <hi>perſonall</hi> walking thereupon; but alſo immediately ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the work of <hi>ordering</hi> the whole affairs of the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> ſo as God might be glorified thereby; how this may be effected ſhall at large afterward be declared; what hath already been ſpoken may ſuffice for a foundation of that <hi>propoſition,</hi> which I ſhall this day inſiſt upon: and it is this. <hi>The preſence</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ob.</note> 
               <hi>of God with a people in ſpecial providential diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for their good, depends on their obediential preſence with him, in national adminiſtrations to his Glory:</hi> The Lord is with you, whilſt you are with him.</p>
            <p>For the Explication of this <hi>propoſition</hi> ſome few things are to be <hi>premiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, the <hi>preſence</hi> of God with his people, as to <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>ſpecial grace</hi> in the Covenant; and his <hi>preſence</hi> with them, as to ſpecial <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> in providence, proceed on very <hi>different</hi> accounts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they have a very different <hi>Riſe:</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <note place="margin">1.</note> and principal Law of ſpecial grace <hi>diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> in the Covenant is this; that ſome <hi>ſinned,</hi> and another was <hi>puniſhed.</hi> So it is laid down expreſly Iſa. 53. 6. <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath made to meet on him the iniquity of us all</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>He was made ſin for us, that we might become the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Gal. 3. 13. 14. a Curſe for us that the bleſſing of faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> might come on them that beleeve. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. This is the <hi>great</hi> and ſoveraign <hi>principle</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, that a <hi>Commutation</hi> ſhould be made of <hi>perſons,</hi> as to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and rewards; that <hi>ſinners</hi> ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of a <hi>ſubſtitute;</hi> one that ſhould undergoe the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168412:7"/>
               <hi>puniſhment</hi> due to them, that <hi>they</hi> might goe free and <hi>procure</hi> a reward for them who could procure none for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Supreme,</hi> and ſoveraign <hi>Law</hi> of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential diſpenſations is utterly divers and alien from this of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace. This you have aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ezek. 18. 20. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall die: one ſhall not bear the iniquity of another: the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the righteous ſhall be upon him, and the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the wicked ſhall be upon him:</hi> Take this for a Law of Univerſal Right and indiſpenſable, extend it to the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, and it is abſolutely <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive</hi> of the <hi>Subſtitution</hi> and ſatisfaction of Chriſt. But it is the Ground, Rule, and Law, of <hi>providential diſpenſations,</hi> that God is there treating about; and vindicating his <hi>dealing</hi> with any people as to his <hi>preſence</hi> with them, and acting towards them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; which is <hi>divers,</hi> as you ſee from the <hi>foundation</hi> of the Covenant before mentioned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As the <hi>foundations</hi> are divers, ſo is the <note place="margin">2.</note> Rule of their <hi>Continuance.</hi> What is the Rule and <hi>meaſure</hi> of Gods continuance with his <hi>people</hi> in the Covenant of Grace? plainly this; that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>forſake</hi> them; and on that account will take care that they ſhall never <hi>forſake</hi> him, but abide with him for ever. It is not <hi>whilſt</hi> they do ſo, and ſo, he will <hi>abide</hi> with them, and when they <hi>Ceaſe</hi> ſo to doe, he will forſake them, as to his <hi>foederal</hi> and Covenant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: there is not ſuch a <hi>ſandie</hi> foundation left us, of our abiding with God in Chriſt. See the tenor of the Covenant, <hi>Jer. 31. 33. Chap.</hi> 32. 38, 39, 40. The ſum is, that God will be <hi>with them,</hi> and take care that they <hi>alwayes</hi> abide with him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath he provided for all <hi>interveniences</hi> imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168412:8"/>
that nothing ſhall <hi>violate</hi> this Union: God lays his <hi>unchangableneſs</hi> as the foundation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 6. and he therein makes us <hi>unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi> not <hi>abſolutely</hi> ſo, for we <hi>change</hi> every moment; but with reſpect to the <hi>termes</hi> and bounds of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; He hath undertaken, that <hi>we</hi> ſhall never <hi>leave</hi> him. The <hi>Law</hi> of Gods preſence in reſpect of providential diſpenſations, and all <hi>ſpecial priviledges</hi> attending it, is quite of another <hi>importance:</hi> it is purely <hi>conditional,</hi> as you may ſee in my <hi>Text.</hi> The tenor of it is expreſſed to the <hi>height:</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 30. <hi>I ſaid indeed that thy houſe and the houſe of thy Father ſhould walk before me for ever: but now the Lord ſaith, that be farr from me, for them that honour me, I will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and they that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> Here is no alteration of <hi>Counſel,</hi> or <hi>purpoſe</hi> in God: but meerly an <hi>explanation</hi> of the Rule, Law, and Tenor of <hi>providential diſpenſations;</hi> no interpretation of the <hi>Covenant of Grace; Eli</hi> held not the <hi>prieſthood</hi> by that Covenant; but an explication of the tenor of a priviledge <hi>given</hi> in eſpecial providence. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 32, 33. Hence is that <hi>variety</hi> of Gods dealings with men mentioned in the Scripture which yet are alwayes <hi>righteous,</hi> according to <hi>one</hi> or other of theſe Rules, and Laws. Iſa. 43. 23. 24. ſays God of his people; <hi>Thou haſt not called upon me, O</hi> Jacob, <hi>but thou haſt been weary of me, O</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Thou haſt not brought me the ſmall cattel of thy burnt-offerings, neither haſt thou honoured me with thy ſacrifices: Thou haſt bought me no ſweet cane with money, neither haſt thou filled me with the fat of thy ſacrifices: but thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt wearied me with thy iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> What then ſhall be done with this <hi>people? de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi> from them, <hi>deſtroy</hi> them, let them dye; No,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168412:8"/>
               <hi>verſe 25. I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> So alſo Chap. 57. ver. 17. <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs I was wroth, and ſmote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</hi> Surely now God will <hi>utterly</hi> conſume them, <hi>root,</hi> and <hi>branch,</hi> as perſons incorrigible, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable: No, the Caſe is quite otherwiſe <hi>verſes 18, 19. I have ſeen his way, and will heal him, I will lead him alſo and reſtore comfort to him:</hi> I will pity him, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, ſave, ſanctify him, and fill him with Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Goe now to <hi>Ezekiel Chap. 33. 18. When the righteous turns from his righteouſneſs;</hi> what then? God will <hi>heal</hi> him and reſtore comforts unto him, as it was in the <hi>places</hi> before <hi>mentioned.</hi> Noe, Noe! He <hi>ſhall die;</hi> he ſhall be <hi>cut off:</hi> what is the reaſon of this diverſity? Why! in the firſt place God ſpeaks of his dealings unto their <hi>ſouls</hi> as to his <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace,</hi> and all the mercies of it; in this <hi>laſt,</hi> as to his dealing with their <hi>perſons,</hi> and their <hi>outward concernments,</hi> in the diſpenſations of his providence. And the not heeding hereof hath made ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>inconſiderately,</hi> the Covenant of Grace to be <hi>meerely conditional;</hi> becauſe they finde many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and priviledges ſpoken of under ſuch a <hi>Notion;</hi> not conſidering that all thoſe <hi>propoſals</hi> belong to the Law of <hi>outward providence,</hi> and not to the nature of the <hi>Covenant of promiſe</hi> eſtabliſhed in the bloud of Chriſt. And unleſs this be allowed, nothing can be more <hi>contrary</hi> to my Text, than that promiſe, and (ſuch as that) which we have <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 9. where proviſion is made for Gods <hi>abiding with his people</hi> notwithſtanding all their <hi>backſlidings,</hi> and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he will ſo far <hi>heal,</hi> as that he may not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168412:9"/>
forſake them; and this is firſtly to be obſerved, that we doe not in the conſideration of Gods <hi>preſence</hi> and <hi>withdrawings,</hi> as to <hi>providential diſpenſations,</hi> caſt any <hi>reflection</hi> on the ſtability, and unchangableneſs of the <hi>Covenant of Grace. David</hi> hath fully ſtated this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. ſaith he, <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ordered in all things and ſure, for this is all my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow: David</hi> had a promiſe for the <hi>proſperity</hi> of his houſe: he had alſo an ingagement of the <hi>ſure mercies</hi> of the Covenant. The different tenour of theſe engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as to their ſucceſs and eſtabliſhment, he gives us this account of. The Covenant is <hi>abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable,</hi> that is, <hi>ordered in all things and ſure:</hi> the proſperity of his houſe depends on another <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> that is, ſubject to Aleration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Obſerve the <hi>nature</hi> of this dependance <note place="margin">2.</note> of Gods preſence on our <hi>abiding</hi> with him: it doth not <hi>depend</hi> upon it, as the <hi>Effect</hi> upon its <hi>proper cauſe,</hi> as though it were <hi>procured</hi> by it, merited by it; we enjoy not the <hi>leaſt morſel</hi> of bread on any ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, much leſs ſuch eminent <hi>priviledges</hi> as attend Gods ſpecial providential preſence; we <hi>deſerve</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the hand of God, and therefore if he ſhould take us in the middeſt of the <hi>choyſeſt obedience,</hi> and fill us with the fierceſt of miſeries, he did us no wrong; and therefore the Lord does <hi>ſo deal</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with his; and that not only with particular <hi>perſons,</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> but alſo with his <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in general, as <hi>Pſal, 44. 17, 18, 19. All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſely in thy Covenant. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps declined from thy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168412:9"/>
way. Though thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and covered us with the ſhadow of death.</hi> Though he requires our <hi>duty</hi> at our hands, yet he is not tyed to any ſuch <hi>preſent</hi> reward. This is all: it ordinarily <hi>depends</hi> upon it as a Conſequent upon an Antecedent, which allows an interpoſition of <hi>grace,</hi> and mercy, as <hi>Nehemioh 9. 19. Nevertheleſſe thou being mercifull for ſookeſt them not;</hi> ſo elſewhere, that good man prayes <hi>remember me for good, and ſpare me according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thy Mercies:</hi> For the glory of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and of his <hi>wayes</hi> in the world, God hath Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his people ſhall <hi>walk</hi> with him, when he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides eminently and conſpicuouſly in a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Obſerve, that <hi>our abiding with God,</hi> even in <note place="margin">3.</note> Nationall adminiſtrations, is the proper <hi>Effect</hi> of his <hi>preſence</hi> with us in Covenant <hi>diſpenſations;</hi> ſo that all in the <hi>Iſſue</hi> is of <hi>mere</hi> Mercy, and grace; though the Condition ſeems to be <hi>impoſed</hi> on us, yet it is from him alone that we have <hi>ſtrength</hi> for its performance. It is in this, and ſuch like <hi>caſes,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaid it was with them, at their <hi>dedicating</hi> their <hi>ſilver,</hi> and gold for the building of the Temple; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of <hi>thine own, Lord have we given unto thee;</hi> we doe but returne him his <hi>own,</hi> we give him but the fruits of his <hi>own grace,</hi> and <hi>without it,</hi> we can make no returne what ever.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being <hi>premis'd,</hi> I ſhall give <hi>the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſome <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and ſo deſcend to the due <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe I need not goe for proof, beyond the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> of the conſtant <hi>tenor</hi> of Gods <hi>Proceedings</hi> with his People of old. When did he not deale thus with them? what inſtance can be given of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:168412:10"/>
this <hi>Rule?</hi> Is the whole <hi>story</hi> of the Nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> any thing but the <hi>illuſtration</hi> of this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſome <hi>ruled well,</hi> and ſought the Lord, and the Lord was <hi>with</hi> them; and proſpered them in all their wayes; ſome <hi>fell from him,</hi> and walked according to their owne imaginations, and the Lord <hi>cut them</hi> ſhort on that account. Yea, ſometimes the ſame man, as <hi>Solomon, Aſa, Uzziah,</hi> experienced both theſe ſtates, and conditions. Hath not the ſtate of all <hi>nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſince they came into the power of men <hi>profeſsing</hi> the knowledge of him, been the ſame? look on the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> did it not <hi>flouriſh</hi> under the <hi>hand of men</hi> who rul'd with God, and were faithfull with the Saints? Is not the preſent diſtraction of it under the fury and cruelty of <hi>Turke</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> the Iſſue of the violence, unrighteouſneſſe, <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Luxury and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of ill Governours? Doth not the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of all Gods people in the world, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof in particular, might be inſiſted on as the <hi>Ground and Reaſon</hi> of the Truth inſiſted on, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that it ſhould be thus? <hi>Leviticus</hi> 26. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole Book of <hi>Deutronomy,</hi> are Sermons on this Text, and every verſe almoſt in them, would afford a <hi>new confirmation</hi> of the truth in hand, I ſhall need rather then to <hi>Caution</hi> from miſtakes, then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Confirme</hi> the Propoſition. For this end, take theſe enſuing Obſervations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, all outward flouriſhing, or <hi>proſperitie</hi> of <note place="margin">1.</note> a People, doth not alwayes argue the <hi>ſpeciall</hi> preſence of God with them. There are <hi>ſundry things</hi> required to make <hi>ſucceſs</hi> and <hi>proſperitie</hi> an Evidence of the preſence of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the <hi>People</hi> themſelves proſpered, bee <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>his People,</hi> his peculiar. How many <hi>wicked nations</hi> are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:168412:10"/>
there in the world, that for a long ſeaſon, have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved bleſſings (as it were) and ſucceſſe in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings? Is the Lord amongſt them by his <hi>ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?</hi> not at all: He is uſing them indeed for his <hi>own end,</hi> and purpoſes, to <hi>breake others,</hi> or <hi>fill</hi> up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their own <hi>iniquities;</hi> that their deſtruction may be an evident demonſtration of his vengeance, and righteous Judgements to all the World, but preſent with them in the ſenſe contended about; he is not. The caſe is ſtated. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 2. as you may ſee in <hi>thoſe Chapters</hi> at large. It is the ſame caſe with the <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Nations in the world at this day: Their <hi>proſperity</hi> is no evidence of Gods preſence, becauſe <hi>themſelves</hi> are his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Other bottomes, reaſons, and grounds there are of their <hi>ſucceſſes;</hi> Gods <hi>owning</hi> of them, is none of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the whole <hi>worke</hi> be good, and <note place="margin">2.</note> have a tendency to <hi>Gods glory;</hi> wherein they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. <hi>Davids</hi> Counſel for the <hi>killing</hi> of <hi>Uriah</hi> proſpered, and took effect, yet was not God with him therein; the work ingaged in, muſt be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his <hi>minde:</hi> and</p>
            <p>Thirdly, made uſeful and <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to his glory: <note place="margin">3.</note> when the hearts of a people can ſecure <hi>themſelves</hi> in theſe things, then may they rejoyce in their <hi>proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> as a <hi>pledge</hi> of Gods preſence with them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Even great <hi>Afflictions,</hi> eminent <hi>diſtreſſes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> long <hi>perplexities,</hi> may have a conſiſtency with Gods <hi>special preſence;</hi> Though the <hi>wheele</hi> goes on, yet it may have a <hi>croſs wheele</hi> in it, that may cauſe <hi>rubs</hi> and diſturbances. The Rule of Gods acting in his <hi>preſence,</hi> is his own wiſdome, and our good in the Iſſue, not our <hi>partial</hi> ſelf-deſtroying deſires. Had
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:168412:11"/>
the beſt people in the world, all their own <hi>deſires,</hi> they would be every way ruined. When God is <hi>nigh</hi> to us he knows what is beſt for us. Security from <hi>deſtroying evils,</hi> not trying evils, he gives to <hi>them</hi> with whom he is.</p>
            <p>And this is all that I ſhall <hi>offer</hi> for the Explication, Confirmation, and Cautioning of the <hi>propoſition</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, what remains further to be <hi>opened,</hi> will fall in under the <hi>Uſes</hi> of it: which now enſue.</p>
            <p>This <hi>ſpecial preſence</hi> of God, being (as you have <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> heard) the great and only <hi>concernment</hi> of any people, the <hi>tenure,</hi> or condition thereof being our <hi>abiding</hi> with him, let our firſt <hi>Uſe</hi> be to inſtruct us particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what this <hi>ſpecial preſence</hi> of God is, and <note place="margin">1.</note> wherein it doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what <hi>it is for us</hi> to abide with God, <note place="margin">2.</note> ſo as we may enjoy it. For the full <hi>diſcovery</hi> of the firſt, I ſhall conſider it in that eminent <hi>inſtance,</hi> wherein of old he did grant his preſence to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The <hi>bottome</hi> of that ſtupendous undertaking of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in leaving <hi>Egypt,</hi> and journeying through the <hi>wilderneſs</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> lay in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of this <hi>preſence</hi> of God with them: <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 10, 11, 12, On this one conſideration, their whole un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking and affair turned; to this iſſue it is put by <hi>Moſes</hi> Exod. 33. 15. <hi>If thy preſence goe not with us, carry us up not hence.</hi> They will not move <hi>one step without him;</hi> and <hi>with him</hi> they care not whither they goe. Now this preſence of God with them, <hi>Symbolically</hi> did conſiſt in, or rather was repreſented by, two things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the <hi>pillar</hi> of the <hi>cloud,</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> which was <note place="margin">1.</note> with them <hi>ordinarily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:168412:11"/>
Secondly, the <hi>Appearance of his Glory</hi> which they en-joyed on extraordinary Occaſions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt,</hi> with the <hi>firſt</hi> uſe of it is mentioned Exod. <note place="margin">2.</note> 13. 21, 22. <hi>And the Lord went before them by day in the pillar of a cloud, to lead them in the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, to goe by day and night: he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day; nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is mention <hi>here,</hi> as if it were of <hi>two pillars,</hi> one <hi>by day,</hi> and another <hi>by night,</hi> but it ſeems to have been the <hi>ſame pillar</hi> with ſeveral <hi>properties:</hi> for Chap. 14. 19, 20. the <hi>ſame pillar</hi> at the ſame time, performs both theſe <hi>offices,</hi> in reſpect of ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; to ſome it was on the <hi>one ſide a cloud,</hi> and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to others bright, and <hi>ſhining</hi> as fire. <hi>The pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and ſtood behinde them; and it came between the Camp of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, and the Camp of Iſrael, and it was a cloud of darkneſſe to them, and it gave light by night to theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this when the <hi>Arke</hi> was made, and the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> erected, this <hi>cloud,</hi> which untill then, went before the <hi>Camp,</hi> came, and covered the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi> night and day, as it ſtood in the midſt of the Camp, or the Congregation; as a cloud it was by day and as a pillar of fire by night. <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38. and there it <hi>continued</hi> with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all the while they were in the <hi>wilderneſs. Nehem.</hi> 9. 19. This being the firſt eminent pledge of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, with that people, let us conſider what was <hi>indulged</hi> or granted to them thereby.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they had <hi>hereby conſtant direction</hi> in all their <note place="margin">1.</note> journeyings, and undertakings, they were by this <hi>pillar</hi> directed in their way; ſo at large it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:168412:12"/>
               <hi>Numbers</hi> 10. 33. as alſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. God by this pledge of his <hi>preſence,</hi> was the beginning of all their <hi>reſt,</hi> and <hi>motion:</hi> the guide, and directour of all their undertakings: ſo that they moved, acted, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, proceeded, according to <hi>his will</hi> and Counſel; he <hi>guided them by his Eye, and led them by his Counſel. Pſal.</hi> 32. 18. Sometimes perhaps they would be <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> they would be up, <hi>acting, doing,</hi> their hearts are <hi>full</hi> of deſires; and they are impatient of delay. If it be not according to his minde, he will cauſe <hi>a Cloud</hi> to abide on <hi>their Tabernacle,</hi> or their Aſſemblies and meetings; a Cloud that ſhall <hi>darken</hi> them, and diſtract them in their <hi>Conſultations,</hi> that they ſhall not be able to take one <hi>ſtep</hi> forward. Though their <hi>deſires</hi> be great, their <hi>intentions</hi> good, yet the <hi>cloud</hi> ſhall be upon them, and they ſhall not <hi>know</hi> their way.</p>
            <p>Sometimes perhaps they are <hi>heavie, fearful, ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> there is a <hi>Lion</hi> in the way, <hi>Gyants</hi> are in the land, <hi>difficulties,</hi> and perplexities lie in the way before them in ſuch and ſuch <hi>undertakings,</hi> they have no heart to them, the <hi>way</hi> is long, and perilous, better <hi>return</hi> than go forward. Would <hi>God</hi> now have them <hi>paſs</hi> on, and engage? the <hi>cloud</hi> ſhall <hi>break</hi> up, and goe before them, they ſhall ſee ſo far on their way, as to goe forth with chearfulneſs. Only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this! that when the <hi>cloud</hi> was taken up, they knew they were to <hi>goe on</hi> in the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were, and journeyed accordingly; yet they know not <hi>whither</hi> they ſhould goe, nor what would be the <hi>end</hi> of their journey: And therefore it is ſaid, that when they journeyed the <hi>Arke went before them to ſeek out a reſting place for them</hi> Numb. 10. 33. It was carried <hi>on,</hi> to ſee where the <hi>pillar,</hi> or <hi>cloud of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:168412:12"/>
direction</hi> would ſtay, and there they reſted where ever it were. When God gives a <hi>people</hi> ſo much direction, as that they ſee it is their <hi>duty</hi> to go on, and to truſt him in ſo doing, though they <hi>ſee</hi> not the <hi>end,</hi> nor know what their reſting place will be, yet it is a <hi>pledge</hi> of Gods preſence with them. I ſuppoſe in <hi>your Aſſembly</hi> you have had the <hi>cloud</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, as to your engagements in ſome underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, concerning which you are to truſt, that the <hi>Ark of Gods preſence,</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> will find you out a reſting place, which as yet appears not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
            <p>What a full <hi>Experience</hi> have we had of this kind of proceeding among us? In the laſt <hi>Aſſembly of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> How many had no <hi>leſs real</hi> intentions to be at worke for God, than now? God ſaw that it would not be for the <hi>advantage</hi> of the people that they ſhould proceed: hence the <hi>cloud</hi> reſted on that <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> that they could not ſee how to take <hi>one ſtep</hi> forward. He was ſtill <hi>preſent</hi> with us, but it was by a <hi>darkning cloud,</hi> that we could not journey towards our reſt. Nor is it the <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>counſel</hi> of man, but of God, that is to be looked to in theſe things. We now hope the <hi>cloud is up,</hi> and we are journeying towards our reſt. The Great <hi>Angel of his</hi> preſence will find a <hi>reſt</hi> for us in the good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.</p>
            <p>This then <hi>lies</hi> in Gods <hi>ſpecial preſence,</hi> He is with us to give us <hi>direction</hi> in all our undertakings; to take away <hi>darkneſs,</hi> perplexities, <hi>difficulties</hi> from our Councels, or to cauſe us to <hi>reſt</hi> and ceaſe from what-ever may come into <hi>our hearts,</hi> that is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>minde;</hi> The Lord give us evermore of this his <hi>preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:168412:13"/>
I cannot ſtay to ſhew you the ſeveral <hi>wayes</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God now communicates <hi>direction</hi> to a people, how he <hi>inclines</hi> their hearts <hi>inſenſibly,</hi> yet <hi>powerfully;</hi> fixes the <hi>bent</hi> of their <hi>ſpirits effectually,</hi> (their hearts being in his hand as the rivers of water, which he turns as he pleaſeth,) ſupplys them with <hi>reaſonings</hi> and <hi>conſultations</hi> beyond the verge of their own <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> propoſes, occaſions, invitations, <hi>provocations;</hi> gives them Spirit and <hi>courage,</hi> beyond their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral frames, and tempers; enlarges them in prayer, or ſhuts them up; makes <hi>walls</hi> on the one hand, and open <hi>pathes</hi> on the other, with innumerable ſuch wayes, and means as in his <hi>infinite wiſdome</hi> he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make effectual for their guidance. It ſuffices, that in the <hi>uſe of means,</hi> through patience and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, they ſhall be <hi>directed</hi> to that which is <hi>pleaſing</hi> to him: ſo is he with them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>uſe</hi> of this pillar was, to give them <note place="margin">2.</note> 
               <hi>protection</hi> and defence in <hi>all their way.</hi> So <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 19, 20. 24. This protected them from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and from thence God troubled their <hi>Enemies;</hi> out of the pillar, that is from his eſpecial preſence. This <hi>uſe</hi> of it is inſiſted on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 5. 6. The <hi>cloud</hi> that was as <hi>ſmoke</hi> by day, and as <hi>fire</hi> by night; was alſo a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> a <hi>place of refuge,</hi> and a <hi>covert:</hi> in one word: a <hi>protection,</hi> or a <hi>defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is a <hi>ſecond</hi> thing, which is in Gods ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preſence; He will protect, or defend them with whom he is ſo preſent. He is their dwelling place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. then when in this world they had none; their <hi>refuge</hi> in the <hi>time of trouble.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 4. 26. 1. 31. 4. promiſes, and <hi>inſtances</hi> to make this good abound; they are known to all: The time would <hi>fail</hi> me to inſiſt upon them. I might go over all the <hi>Cauſes,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:168412:13"/>
means, and wayes of the <hi>fears, dangers,</hi> ruines of ſuch a people, and ſhew you how a <hi>defence</hi> is provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them all.</p>
            <p>Are their fears from <hi>themſelves,</hi> becauſe of their <hi>folly,</hi> weakneſſe, and diviſion, or from <hi>pretended friends,</hi> becauſe of their envy and deſertion, or from open enemies; becauſe of their <hi>Power,</hi> Cruelty, Malice, and Revenge, a defence is provided on every account, heat, raine, tempeſts, ſtormes, adverſitie, proſperitie, all are provided againſt where God is preſent. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 1, 2. And if any people in the world have <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of this truth, we have it this day. Had not the <hi>Lord</hi> been with us, who had not deſtroyed us? Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, friends, abroad, at home, our own follyes, all, any of them had done the worke, had not the Lord himſelf been with us.</p>
            <p>Onely obſerve, that the <hi>preſence</hi> of God, as to theſe effects, may ſometimes in ſome perticulars be <hi>eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> and the <hi>Effects</hi> themſelves, for ſome ſeaſon be intangled, though there be not an <hi>utter breach</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his People. How often did the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> attempt things without his <hi>direction?</hi> how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten did he breake in upon them to their <hi>woe</hi> and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? yet for the maine, he <hi>forſooke</hi> them not, untill the great work <hi>intended</hi> by them was accompliſhed. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 19. It is not every <hi>intanglement,</hi> every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, every defeat, that argues Gods depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to his ſpeciall preſence. It may be good for us ſometimes to be in ſuch a Condition, and then that deſertion that carries into it, is from the <hi>preſence</hi> of God; We are now grown to that, that if <hi>every</hi> thing immediately ſurmount not our <hi>imagination,</hi> ſay ſome, <hi>God is gone from them,</hi> not becauſe <hi>it is</hi> ſo, but becauſe they <hi>would have it ſo,</hi> but he <hi>is Mercifull</hi> with whom
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:168412:14"/>
we have to doe, and will not caſt off his People for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The People with whom God was, had <note place="margin">2.</note> the <hi>Glory of Jehovah,</hi> as a pledge of his <hi>preſence</hi> with them; this appeared only <hi>at extraordinary</hi> ſeaſons, ſo it did at the <hi>giving of the Law. Exod.</hi> 24. 16. ſo alſo at the <hi>ſetting</hi> up of the Tabernacle. It differed from the <hi>cloud,</hi> for when the <hi>cloud</hi> was <hi>upon</hi> the Tabernacle, the <hi>glory of the Lord</hi> filled it. It appeared again to to all the <hi>People, Levit.</hi> 9. 23. I ſhall not now enquire what was this <hi>viſible repreſentation</hi> of the Majeſtie of God, it ſufficeth as to the <hi>purpoſe in hand,</hi> that when God gives his preſence to a People, at extraordinary ſeaſons, he affords them <hi>extraordinary</hi> manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Glory. So in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion of thoſe dreadfull wheeles of Providence, the <hi>glory</hi> of the Lord is ſaid to <hi>appeare</hi> in the Temple; and as his <hi>Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall preſence</hi> departed from the Temple, and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſo the <hi>glory</hi> by ſeverall degrees <hi>departed</hi> alſo. <hi>Chap. 2. 10. 18, 19. Chap.</hi> 11. 23.</p>
            <p>Eminent, and glorious appearances <hi>with,</hi> and for a People in extraordinary ſeaſons, is then <hi>another</hi> thing that accompanies Gods ſpeciall providentiall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with them; when they are at an <hi>utter</hi> loſs in their <hi>Counſels,</hi> at a <hi>ſtand</hi> in their Motions, diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their undertakings, deſerted in their enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, preſſed on every ſide above meaſure; or called to ſome <hi>extraordinary worke,</hi> ſo that their Ordinary <hi>direction</hi> and <hi>protection</hi> will not carry them on, nor beare them up; then will God relieve them by ſome <hi>eſpeciall</hi> appearance of his Glory. In the <hi>Mount will the Lord be ſeen.</hi> This will give a reliefe, when all is at a loſſe. And in this lies the moſt <hi>diſcriminating</hi> evidence of ſpeciall Providence. Glorious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168412:14"/>
in <hi>great ſtreights</hi> are eminent teſtimonies of Gods regard. Could I now inſiſt on ſome of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> that might be given, of this kind of dealing with us in <hi>England,</hi> in the purſuit of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> we have in hand, it would make us <hi>aſhamed of</hi> all our unworthineſſe, carnall fears, and unbeliefe.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>ſecond Evidence</hi> of Gods preſence. He is with a People to <hi>direct</hi> them, to <hi>protect,</hi> to manifeſt his glory amongſt them; His glory in <hi>ballancing</hi> the Iſſues of Providence one in reſpect of another; ſo that all ſhall acknowledge that of a truth the Lord is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. <hi>Bleſſed is the People, that is in ſuch a Caſe; yea, bleſſed is the People whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> What would you have more? here is <hi>eaſe</hi> of all cares, <hi>a remedy</hi> for all ſores, ſecuritie in the midſt of <hi>troubles,</hi> Reſt, and Peace, and aſſured dwelling pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, though the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhould bee in the Land.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what is this great <hi>Concernment</hi> of any People: Let us now conſider the <hi>tenure</hi> of this <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs:</hi> on what account it is to be obteined, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed: now this is, <hi>our abiding with God;</hi> This then is nextly to be <hi>conſidered,</hi> what it is for a <hi>People,</hi> what it is for you, and us ſo to abide with God, as that <hi>wee may</hi> in all our affaires, enjoy his <hi>preſence</hi> in the wayes before deſcribed.</p>
            <p>Now ſomething is hereunto previouſly required: ſomething it conſiſts in.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, That we may <hi>abide with God,</hi> this is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably <note place="margin">1.</note> required? that wee may have <hi>Peace</hi> with him in Jeſus Chriſt. If we are <hi>never</hi> with him, we cannot <hi>abide</hi> with him; no man <hi>can abide,</hi> where he never comes. The acceptance of our <hi>perſons,</hi> lies at the bottome of the <hi>acceptance</hi> of our duties. As the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168412:15"/>
               <hi>ſpeciall preſence</hi> of God with any, is <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>by</hi> Chriſt, and no otherwiſe: ſo is our <hi>abiding</hi> with God, in, and <hi>through</hi> him. <hi>God with us,</hi> is the name of Chriſt: Our <hi>beeing with</hi> God, is in him who is our Peace. <hi>Two can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walke together, unleſſe they be ſo agreed. Amos.</hi> 3. 3. Now becauſe this is not to be <hi>expected</hi> from all the <hi>individualls</hi> of a Nation: yet this thing is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured.</p>

               <hi>That the Rulers of it be ſuch as have this Intereſt.</hi> I do not diveſt of a ſhare in <hi>Government,</hi> thoſe who have no <hi>ſhare</hi> in Chriſt, if lawfully called thereunto. But I ſay, when God gives <hi>Governours,</hi> whom he intends to make a <hi>bleſsing</hi> unto a People, they ſhall be <hi>ſuch</hi> as are bleſſed of him in Chriſt. And if ever the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Nation, in this preſent <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> ſuppoſe it the moſt exactly framed, and ballanced, in the ſeverall parts of it, for the furtherance of Publick Good, be devolved into the hands of men, not inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed in God by Chriſt, Though the <hi>conſtitution</hi> may be <hi>abſolutely</hi> good, yet the <hi>Government</hi> will not be bleſſed, and the Nation will be ruined: for <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>glory</hi> will depart. <hi>Micah.</hi> 5. 5, 6. It is <hi>Chriſt</hi> that is our <hi>Peace,</hi> even in outward <hi>troubles?</hi> They are <hi>ſeven Shepherds under him,</hi> and <hi>Eight principall men,</hi> accepted with him, that are to be our releife.</p>
            <p>It is true, for ſome particular <hi>actions,</hi> or workes, a wicked man may be anointed particularly; as <hi>Jehu,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Joaſh:</hi> But you have no <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> that ever God was with a People to <hi>bleſſe</hi> them indeed, in a courſe of <hi>ſpecial providence,</hi> when wicked men by their <hi>own conſent</hi> were their Rulers; where the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and <hi>Relation,</hi> between them and the people is conſiderable. I confeſſe unto you, I never think of the <hi>State of Englnnd,</hi> but my heart trembles at this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168412:15"/>
thing; Namely, that thoſe who <hi>have,</hi> and it is fit <hi>ſhould have</hi> ſo great a <hi>Share</hi> in the Government of this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Weale,</hi> ſhould have their <hi>riſe</hi> from the <hi>body</hi> of the People, that is <hi>darke,</hi> and <hi>profane,</hi> and full of <hi>Enmitie</hi> againſt the Remnant; did not God <hi>over-rule</hi> men contrary to their own inward <hi>principles,</hi> and luſts, How ſoon would <hi>ruine,</hi> and deſolation breake in upon that hand. And give me leave to ſay, that God in his ſoveraigne Providence, having called ſo many at this <hi>time</hi> to the place of <hi>Rule,</hi> and Authoritie, who indeed (as we beleeve) love the Lord Jeſus in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it ſeems to me, to look as your <hi>Duty,</hi> to conſider all wayes and means whereby the <hi>Power</hi> of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be in <hi>ſucceeding ſeaſons,</hi> devolved on men of the like <hi>ſpirit</hi> and Condition.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not interpoſe in that, which by ſome is ſo much ſpoken of; <hi>The reigne of the Saints;</hi> I am ſure the <hi>means</hi> uſed, and attempted by ſome, to ſet upon, and to ſet up ſuch a <hi>rule</hi> and dominion, have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>ſobermen,</hi> much leſſe Saints of Chriſt; yet this I muſt <hi>ſay,</hi> and in the <hi>ſaying</hi> of it, I dare ſay, <hi>Heare ye me Aſa, and all Judah, and Benjamin;</hi> If ever God ceaſe to call <hi>Saints,</hi> that is, men intereſſed <hi>perſonally</hi> in Chriſt, to places of <hi>Chief Authoritie</hi> in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or commit the power of it into other hands; and when thoſe <hi>called</hi> to Power, ceaſe to exert it in a <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviencie</hi> to the Kingdome of Chriſt, for the true <hi>ſpirituall advantage</hi> of his people, there will <hi>be an end of Englands glory and happineſs.</hi> I ſay, heare ye this all ye People.</p>
            <p>This I have delivered <hi>long ago,</hi> and many times in this place, this I ſay ſtill, and in this <hi>perſwaſion</hi> hope to live, and die.</p>
            <p>The Lord guide you in this thing: however we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168412:16"/>
ſhall live on the good <hi>providence</hi> of our God, who hath hitherto taken care for us.</p>
            <p>This then I ſay, is prerequired, as a <hi>qualification</hi> of any perſon, to the performance of this duty of <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding</hi> with God. It is the Pſalmiſt's advice. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Let this <hi>principle</hi> be alwayes own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt you: by it, honor Chriſt in the world; give him the <hi>preheminence,</hi> it is the Fathers will he ſhould have it in all things. Expect not the <hi>preſence</hi> of God, but upon this account. Beare Teſtimony herein againſt the <hi>world of profane</hi> men, who deſpiſe theſe things. Seing then it cannot be expected, to have this qualification <hi>diffuſed univerſally</hi> as yet through the body of the People, let the <hi>Rulers</hi> take care, that they <hi>be</hi> not the Cauſe of Gods departure from us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What is it now for ſuch <hi>perſons</hi> to abide <note place="margin">2.</note> with God; ſo as they may expect <hi>Comfortably</hi> the continuance of his preſence with them, which is their <hi>all,</hi> that they <hi>need</hi> or deſire.: I ſhall name ſome few things that are ſignally required thereunto.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that they <hi>enquire</hi> of God, <hi>aske</hi> Counſel at <note place="margin">1.</note> his hand, look to him for <hi>direction</hi> in all their Affairs. He is <hi>preſent</hi> with them to give them direction; not to <hi>ſeek</hi> for it at his hand, is exceedingly to deſpiſe him, it muſt ariſe from one of theſe two <hi>apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> either he <hi>cares</hi> not <hi>for us,</hi> or he <hi>knows</hi> not how to direct us. When he gave direction by the <hi>cloud</hi> on the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> the people being reproved for their carnall feares, and unbelief, upon the return of the <hi>Spies;</hi> ſome of them would needs <hi>inſtantly</hi> into the <hi>Mountaine,</hi> and fight with the <hi>Canaanites:</hi> but ſayes the holy Ghoſt, the <hi>Arke abode in the Campe;</hi> They went without <hi>Gods Direction,</hi> and proſpered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168412:16"/>
With what contempt doth God ſpeake of the <hi>wiſedome,</hi> and Counſells of the ſonnes of men, when they will adhere unto them? How <hi>does</hi> he make it his <hi>glory</hi> to turne all their <hi>Conſultations</hi> into folly? and to make them <hi>erre</hi> in their wayes, like a drunken man? how doth he bid them take <hi>Counſell</hi> together, when he intends to <hi>deſtroy</hi> them? what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may be given of all <hi>good</hi> and proſperous <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> of old, of their <hi>ſeeking</hi> direction from God? what <hi>Promiſes</hi> of a ſucceſſe, and a bleſſed Iſſue in ſo doing are there? The words of my <hi>Text</hi> will ſuffice, as an inſtance in every kind.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay; how ſhall we enquire of God? the <hi>Nations</hi> had their <hi>Oracles,</hi> whereby they <hi>deluded</hi> themſelves. The People of God had their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> their <hi>Prophets</hi> and Oracle. Bring hither the <hi>Ephod,</hi> and enquire of God, was the word with them? but alaſs! what is all this to the <hi>advantage</hi> we have of ſeeking Counſell of God; and taking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from him? We have an <hi>High Prieſt</hi> alwayes preſent <hi>with</hi> us, by whom we may <hi>enquire.</hi> Our <hi>High Prieſt</hi> is the Angel of <hi>Gods Preſence,</hi> the mighty <hi>Counſellor,</hi> the power, and eternall wiſedome of God himſelf? and where is he? he <hi>appears</hi> in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God</hi> for us, in the holy place, not made with hands, having made a <hi>new</hi> and living way for us to come within the <hi>Vaile,</hi> to enquire of the <hi>Oracle.</hi> What would we have more? he is our <hi>Captaine,</hi> our <hi>Leader,</hi> our <hi>High Prieſt, Urim,</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> our <hi>Oracle,</hi> our <hi>Arke,</hi> on whom the cloud of direction reſts, and abides for ever.</p>
            <p>Would you then be <hi>with</hi> God? take <hi>direction</hi> from him by Chriſt in all your undertakings; ſo doe <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> and not in <hi>word,</hi> or profeſſion onely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:168412:17"/>
I hope, I need not ſtay to give you <hi>directions,</hi> how this duty is to be performed, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> will teach it you, and your <hi>fellowſhip,</hi> I hope, is with the Father, and with his Son Chriſt Jeſus; Onely now take theſe few words with you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Captivate</hi> all your deſires to his glory: ſet <note place="margin">1.</note> your hearts on nothing, but with this expreſſe <hi>reſerve,</hi> if it is conſiſtent with, and <hi>expedient</hi> unto the Glory of Chriſt, and his Kingdome. Be not <hi>ſick</hi> of your owne violent Deſires, but lay all your <hi>aymes</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes at his feet alwayes; becoming as weaned Children before him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Beare before him <hi>a reall ſenſe</hi> of your <note place="margin">2.</note> owne <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and folly both ſeverally, and joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not <hi>directed</hi> by him; that in his <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>Compaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he may relieve you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Keep your <hi>hearts</hi> in that integritie, that you <note place="margin">3.</note> may alwayes preſſe and <hi>urge</hi> him with his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in all your <hi>Affaires,</hi> this is a thing that none but <hi>upright</hi> hearts can doe uprightly.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Actually enquire by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4.</note> what is his will and mind; doe it <hi>ſeverally,</hi> and <hi>joyntly;</hi> doe it <hi>privately, publickly;</hi> doe it <hi>every</hi> day, and in dayes ſet apart for that purpoſe; he will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly be found of you. You know how <hi>eaſie</hi> it were to exemplifie all theſe things, by teſtimonies, and <hi>inſtances,</hi> but time will not permit.</p>
            <p>If in ſtead of theſe things, you beare your ſelves up on the <hi>wings</hi> of your own Wiſedome, and <hi>contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,;</hi> though you may ſeem for a ſeaſon to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a faire <hi>pitch</hi> and <hi>flight;</hi> you will be <hi>entangled,</hi> and brought down in the <hi>midſt</hi> of your Courſe with ſhame and ſorrow; for the Lord will not be with you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:168412:17"/>
Secondly, Another <hi>thing</hi> wherein we are to <hi>be with God</hi> is by truſting in him for protection. O! <hi>truſt in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah, there is everlaſting ſtrength. This man made the Lord his refuge. He that truſteth in the Lord ſhall be as Monnt Sion, that ſhall never be removed. Commit your wayes to the Lord, roll your burthen on him, ſtand ſtill and ſee his ſalvation.</hi> What glorious things are ſpoken of this <hi>truſting</hi> to the Lord for <hi>protection,</hi> you all know. It were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to inſiſt on <hi>Commands</hi> and promiſes to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and to ſingle out <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> were but to <hi>weaken</hi> the Cauſe in hand, ſeeing hereunto the whole <hi>Scriptures</hi> bear witneſs. I ſhall only ſhew you <hi>what it is</hi> ſo to do, in ſome few particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is to <hi>ſtrengthen,</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> your hearts <note place="margin">1.</note> in difficult affairs, a comfortable Iſſue whereof, you cannot on viſible cauſes conjecture, on the account of Gods <hi>engagement</hi> for your good. To omit the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Aſa, Jehoſaphat,</hi> and many others; take that <hi>ſignal one of David</hi> in his great diſtreſs at <hi>Ziglak 1 Sam.</hi> 30. You know the ſtory: His <hi>habitation was burnt</hi> and <hi>ſpoiled,</hi> his <hi>wives</hi> and <hi>children</hi> captiv'd, his <hi>people</hi> conſulting to ſtone him, ſo that he was <hi>greatly diſtreſſed,</hi> the <hi>enemy numerous,</hi> and without his <hi>reach;</hi> all means of <hi>relieving</hi> his condition and bringing it to a comfortable iſſue, farr removed; But what courſe did he now take? did he <hi>deſpond?</hi> did he give over? did he <hi>reſt</hi> on his own Counſel and ſtrength, No, ſaith the holy Ghoſt; But <hi>David en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi> Have you any Affair that <hi>lies</hi> before you that is <hi>good,</hi> and honeſt, but yet <hi>dreadful, difficult,</hi> entangled? your hearts are ready to faint, when ever you think of it; it is almoſt beyond your Imaginations, to contrive a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:168412:18"/>
               <hi>comfortable</hi> Iſſue: In ſuch a ſeaſon if you will be <hi>with God,</hi> he will be with you; if you <hi>ſo truſt him</hi> as to <hi>encourage</hi> your hearts on the account of his <hi>wiſdome, goodneſs,</hi> power; that he can <hi>finde</hi> out, and <hi>bring</hi> about a comfortable glorious end; this is to truſt him for <hi>protection.</hi> Pſal. 46. is this Doctrine delivered to the full.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To <hi>truſt</hi> God for <hi>protection,</hi> is to <hi>wait</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> under diſcouragements, and <hi>diſappointments</hi> for a deſired Iſſue, of the affairs we commit to him. <hi>He that beleeveth will not make haſt.</hi> Iſa. 28. 16. This the Lord pleads for <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 3, 4. Men will have their deſires preciſely accompliſhed this <hi>year,</hi> this <hi>moneth,</hi> this <hi>week,</hi> or they will wait no longer; theſe, ſayes God are <hi>proud men,</hi> their hearts are <hi>lifted up</hi> in them, they truſt not me for protection. Men love to <hi>truſt God</hi> (as they profeſs) for what they have in their <hi>hands,</hi> in <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> or what lies in an eaſie view; place their deſires <hi>afarr</hi> of, carry their accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment behinde the <hi>clouds,</hi> out of their ſight, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>difficulties,</hi> and perplexities, their hearts are inſtantly <hi>ſick,</hi> they cannot <hi>wait</hi> for God; they doe not truſt him, nor ever did. Would you have the <hi>preſence</hi> of God with you; learn to <hi>wait quietly</hi> for the ſalvation you expect from him. Then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is he <hi>glorified,</hi> when he is <hi>truſted</hi> in a ſtorme; when he is <hi>waited for</hi> under long perplexities, and diſtreſſes. Want of <hi>this,</hi> ruined the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſs; their <hi>work</hi> was long, their <hi>difficulties,</hi> and intanglements many, they would have had an <hi>immediate end</hi> of their troubles. What! <hi>more</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, more <hi>hardſhips,</hi> nay then let us <hi>choſe a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and go down again into Egypt;</hi> we know the worſt of that, where this will end we know not. This laid
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:168412:18"/>
their <hi>carkaſſes</hi> in the wilderneſs, and deprived them of enjoying the good land.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is to <hi>commit your affairs</hi> to the Lord <note place="margin">3.</note> with <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to his will, as to their Iſſue, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment. Truſt reſpects <hi>protection,</hi> but it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes not, as to perticular <hi>Events.</hi> It is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our <hi>Affairs</hi> to God, with thoughts of his <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom, ſoveraignty</hi> and goodneſs; with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereupon, that the product of his <hi>will,</hi> is that which will be <hi>good,</hi> be <hi>beſt</hi> for us, though it ſhould not at all fall in with our <hi>preſent</hi> deſires. It is true the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſayes, <hi>Commit your wayes unto the Lord, truſt alſo in him, he ſhall bring it to paſs.</hi> Pſalm 37. 5. and ſo he <hi>ſhall</hi> and <hi>will</hi> in all ſuch caſes, as that there particularly inſiſted on by the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> wherein his <hi>own Glory</hi> is particularly engaged. But this preſcribs not, as to all <hi>caſes</hi> that we ſhould cry, <hi>give me this child or I die.</hi> The rule is known; Abide in this <hi>frame,</hi> and we ſhall have that <hi>we deſire,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> which is better for us; but I muſt not abide in theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> See <hi>Pſal. 37. 3, 4, 5. Pſal.</hi> 73. 23, 24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>And theſe are <hi>ſome</hi> of thoſe wayes wherewith we abide with God, as to our <hi>truſting</hi> of him in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>ſpecial</hi> protection.</p>
            <p>A third thing I ſhould fix upon is, a peoples <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal owning of Gods concernments in the world.</hi> His preſence with them is, <hi>his owning</hi> their concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and certainly he expects that they abide with him in the owning of his. Gods <hi>concernment</hi> in the world, is his <hi>people</hi> as inveſted with the <hi>priviledges</hi> purchaſed for them by Chriſt <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 9. The <hi>Lords portion is his people.</hi> This is that which the <hi>Lord</hi> has perticularly <hi>Kept</hi> to himſelf. The <hi>Vineyard</hi> that he has choſen out of all the <hi>foreſts</hi> of the world; the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:168412:19"/>
               <hi>handful</hi> that he hath taken to himſelf, his <hi>Sons,</hi> and <hi>Daughters,</hi> his Family; Theſe he expects that you <hi>abide</hi> by, if you would have him <hi>abide</hi> by you; Yea it is moſt <hi>certain,</hi> as your reſpect, and regard ſhall be to them and their intereſt, as his people; ſo will his reſpect, and regard be to <hi>you,</hi> and your intereſt, as the people of this Nation. But I have formerly ſpoken <hi>hereof</hi> unto you, and therefore, though it be a matter of the <hi>greateſt importance,</hi> I ſhall not further inſiſt upon it.</p>
            <p>And theſe are ſome of the Conditions of Gods ſpecial preſence with you, <hi>pleaſant conditions,</hi> their performance, is your glory, your reſt, your bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not your bondage, not your burthen; Not one <hi>duty</hi> doth God on this account require of you, but it is alſo your <hi>reward.</hi> O <hi>bleſſed</hi> termes of peace, and agreement. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> be the great peace-maker, curſed be the <hi>breakers</hi> of this <hi>bleſſed</hi> Agreement. Is this all indeed that is required, that we may have the ſpecial preſence of God with us for ever? O how <hi>inexcuſable</hi> ſhall we be, if we <hi>neglect</hi> theſe termes? how juſt will be our ruine? Behold, I have ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> this day. The <hi>life,</hi> or <hi>death</hi> of theſe Nations. O chooſe <hi>life,</hi> ſeeing it may be had on ſuch <hi>eaſie,</hi> ſuch <hi>bleſſed</hi> termes: Termes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in doing <hi>good</hi> to others, you will alſo doe <hi>good</hi> to your own ſouls; you will give peace to the <hi>Nation,</hi> and have <hi>peace,</hi> and reſt in your own ſouls.</p>
            <p>Look on this <hi>preſence</hi> of God as your <hi>main con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> This is that which the <hi>Prophet</hi> calls for in the words of the <hi>Text;</hi> ſo the <hi>Pſalmiſt, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſay, who will ſhew us any good? Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</hi> Pſal. 4. Let other
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:168412:19"/>
men make what <hi>enquiries</hi> they pleaſe, look for <hi>good,</hi> for <hi>reſt,</hi> for <hi>peace</hi> in what they beſt <hi>fancy; Acquieſce</hi> you in this, that the <hi>light</hi> of Gods countenance, a <hi>pledge</hi> of his preſence with you, is that alone which you are to <hi>enquire</hi> after. I remember ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of theſe <hi>laſt wonderful dayes,</hi> how often we have thought our <hi>ſelves</hi> utterly ruin'd; if <hi>ſuch</hi> alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations <hi>come,</hi> we are <hi>undone;</hi> if <hi>ſuch</hi> men <hi>dye, fall off, oppoſe,</hi> there is little hope of the carrying on the <hi>work</hi> wherein we are ingaged. If ſuch <hi>ſhakings,</hi> ſuch <hi>diviſions</hi> befall us, our <hi>ruine</hi> is at hand; If we breake with <hi>ſuch,</hi> and <hi>ſuch forraign Nations,</hi> what hope remaineth: But alaſs we have found by <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> that our <hi>Affairs</hi> have turned on none of theſe things; our <hi>proſperity</hi> hath been built on none of thoſe principles: ſuch <hi>deſertions,</hi> as we feared, have <hi>happened;</hi> ſuch <hi>Alterations,</hi> ſuch diviſions have befallen us; we have been <hi>ſometime</hi> almoſt reduced to <hi>Gideons</hi> number; ſuch <hi>breaches</hi> with <hi>forragin Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> have enſued; one <hi>party,</hi> that was <hi>with</hi> us have gone off, and asked, what will ye now do? And then <hi>another party</hi> hath gone off, and asked us what will ye doe now? And no <hi>ſooner</hi> do any fall off, but inſtantly they expect, and foretell <hi>deſtruction</hi> to them that do abide; as though they were <hi>God</hi> and <hi>not man,</hi> or as though God were bound to <hi>follow them</hi> with his preſence in all their <hi>paſſions,</hi> in all their wandrings. It would I confeſs be more deſirable unto <hi>me</hi> than <hi>life</hi> it ſelf, to ſee all thoſe, at leaſt who <hi>ſtick</hi> to the Cauſe of God in its <hi>greateſt difficulties,</hi> and trialls, and then when it <hi>Ceaſed</hi> to be carried on in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>paths</hi> of Nations, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> again in the ſame <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt;</hi> to ſee their <hi>paſſions,</hi> and prejudices cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
