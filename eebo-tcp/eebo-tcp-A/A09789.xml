            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thus much of cuſtome, vſe, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and inſtitution: now is occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to ſpeake ſomwhat of nouriſhing of infantes.

And for that cauſe, to euery liuing beaſt that brings for the young, hathe nature graunted and giuen, the power to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe their yong, with their owne milke. And the prouidence of GOD by great wiſdom hath giuen to wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two breſts, that if it ſhould happen, that they at one birth ſhould be deliuered of two twins, they ſhould haue two fountaines of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment. Beſides this, mothers are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to their children with a greater good wil, and a more affectuous loue, and that not incongruently: for the coniunction in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and bringing vp togither, is cauſe of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> increaſe of beneuole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: for brute beaſts deuoide of reaſon, (if they be diſioyned and diſſeuered from thoſe, with whome they were brought vp,) they be deſyrous of them.

As therfore (for now I will come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to my talke from whence I am digreſſed) I haue counſeled and exhorted to flée and eſchue a diuerſe &amp; changeable coloured oration, and loftie and tragicall talke: ſo agayn I do alſo perſuade them, to auoyde a thinne exile, and a leane ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for a ſwelling and turbulent ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lacketh ciuilitie, and a hungry leane oration doth not ſmite nor greatly moue the hearers minds. And as in a body on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incolumitie is not laudable, but alſo a firme and luſtie diſpoſition of the body is requiſite: ſo is it likewiſe expedient, that an oracion or talke ſhoulde not be ſickely, weake, and imbecill, but ſtrong, firme, and rigorous: for that, that is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and eaſie, is onely commendable, and doth alone merite prayſe, but that, that is behedged with dangers and with ſtudious labour atcheued, bringeth admi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration. Now haue I to ſpeke and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, how the mind ought to be affected,
<pb facs="tcp:10982:30"/>
which muſt not be temerous, raſh, and aduenturous, neither cowardous, timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſoone affrighted and abiect: for as <note place="margin">What is decent and vndece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the affects of the minde.</note> too much confidence &amp; boldneſſe ſhewes foorth an impudent and vnſhamefull minde, ſo doth timiditie &amp; feare drawe and moue the mind into ſeruilitie and bondage. An artificiall thing it is in all things moſt diligently &amp; rightly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the mean way and kéepe it. * A gret vertue it is to vſe moderation and not to bruſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liſts of mediocritie. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> And to open my opinion more largely, and to touch this education more narowly, <note place="margin">The harping of one ſtring only is odious, and the likenes of talk is irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome but vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and change delightſull and pleaſant.</note> firſt I thinke that kinde of talke which is euer like if ſelfe, and neuer variable, to be the moſt certayn token of a blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh brayne, of a dull wit, indocible, and very hard to be taught. Secondarily, I déeme it not fit for any exerciſe, whiche ſoone conceiueth, &amp; not long retayneth. One ſong always, and the iarring and chaunting vpon one onely corde and ſtring, in all things is yrkeſome, tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and vnpleaſant to the ears: but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and chaungeable tunes (as in all other things innumerous, ſo in thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:10982:30"/>
things which be heerd and ſéen) be moſt delectable, pleaſant &amp; delightfull. * Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie is alwayes odious, but to do all things fayre and ſoftly, and in their time, hath great grace. Euen as that Muſitian is moleſtuous to all men, which among the ſelfe ſame men dothe ſing the ſelfe ſame ſong, and ſtil twan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vpon one ſtring: ſo he that with one onely kinde of ſpeach, harping vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one onely matter, doth gréeue the ſame men with his importunity loſeth ciuility, breaketh the limits of curteſie, &amp; is thought a very importune felow.

For the continuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byding in anger, and the harde recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement of fauour is a great ſigne, and manifeſt token of a minde alienated from children, and hatefull towards them.

(that is blindneſſe and deafneſſe which <note place="margin">Parents muſt ſometime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens faults.</note> follow olde age) (as it were) not to ſée certayn things which they ſee their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do, nor to heare certaine things which they heare.

And parents muſt endeuour to prepare them wiues,
<pb facs="tcp:10982:65"/>
which can not reſiſte vayne pleaſures, nor abide bitter rebukes, when they <note place="margin">At what time yongmen muſt be giuen to ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage, &amp; what wiues muſt be choſen for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> heare of their faults.

But to draw to an end, and to leaue off this gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of precepts, before all other things it is requiſite and moſte neceſſarye, that parents liue an inculpable life, in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Parents muſt be a liuely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and as a glade of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, to their yongmen and children of ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſt life.</note> offending, and do thoſe things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whiche be honeſt, iuſt and lawfull: And to ſhew them ſelues a lyuely and manyfeſt example to their children, that beholding their honeſt and modeſt lyues, as in a glaſſe, may ſhunne the woorks and woords which be diſhoneſt, fylthie and vnlawfull.
