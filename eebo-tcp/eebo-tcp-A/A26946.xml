            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMong the other Church-troubling Controverſies of theſe times, we find it is one, and not the leaſt, <hi>How far Mans Reaſon hath to do in matters of Religion:</hi> And deep accuſations we find brought againſt each other on this account; ſome ſuſpecting others of Socinianiſme, as over-magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Reaſon, and others inſimulating ſuch as they ſeem to differ from, as guilty of making Religion ſeem unreaſonable; and ſome (who go over the Hedge where it is low) do lay this charge of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs, in ſpecial, on the <hi>Non-conformiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We, who do verily believe that this ſcandalous Contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from Mens unskilfulneſs in the Art of framing, and expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the notions of that ſame matter which they commonly hold, and that really not only <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> and <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> but alſo all <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Parties are herein of one mind, though ſome think otherwiſe, who neither underſtand their Brethren, nor are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood themſelves, do therefore take it, as Peacemakers, to be our duty to give our Reaſons of this our Judgement, that if it may be the Preachers of Truth, and Peace may not tempt the People into unchriſtian diſaffection, by perſwading them that we ſo widely differ, when really we are all, or generally agreed.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>Whether underſtanding Charity can ſee any real difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Conformiſts, and Non-conformiſts, or any other Partiss of true Proteſtants, about the intereſt and uſe of Reaſon in Religion; that is, about Gods Doctrine of Faith, and his Laws for Mens Deſires, and their Practice,</hi> Neg.</p>
            <p>For the due handling of this, it is requiſite that we firſt explain our words, and then truly ſtate the Queſtion, and then prove the Negative; and laſtly, add ſome applicatory Conſectaries.</p>
            <p n="1">I. By [<hi>underſtanding Charity</hi>] we mean [a Perſon indued with <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>Charity ſo far as he uſeth them in this Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64664:3"/>By [a <hi>Real difference</hi>] we mean not <hi>real miſunderſtanding</hi> of one another, or <hi>real contending about words</hi>; but <hi>a difference in Judgement about the very matter of Doctrine it ſelf,</hi> when intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly opened, and each Party is underſtood.</p>
            <p>By [<hi>Religion</hi>] we mean only that which is <hi>truly Divine,</hi> and not about what <hi>Man</hi> may ſuperadd, (though on the by we may ſpeak ſomewhat of that;) and as the Church hath ever ſummed it up in the <hi>Sacramental Covenant,</hi> and explained the parts of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the three ſummaries, the <hi>Creed, Lords Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Decalogue,</hi> ſo do we here mean. 1. The <hi>Articles of Faith.</hi> 2. The matter of <hi>Holy Love,</hi> or <hi>Deſire.</hi> 3. And of <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By [<hi>Conformiſts,</hi> and <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi>] we mean <hi>qua tales,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be any part of the Controverſies which denominate them; And <hi>ex abundante</hi> even <hi>Qui tales,</hi> whether they that are <hi>Meerly Non-conformiſts,</hi> differ from the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> herein, the queſtion not extending to Quakers, Seekers, Papiſts, Antinomians, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Sect which are more than <hi>Meer Non-conformiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By [<hi>Proteſtants</hi>] we mean thoſe that make <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Scriptures, their Religion, proteſting againſt the Corruptions, and Additions of Popery; who are now commonly known by that Name, and diſtinguiſhed unhappily by their By-opinions, into Lutherans, Calviniſts, and other Names.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We deny not that all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> differ greatly from the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who reject the Doctrine of the Trinity, though found in Scripture, becauſe they think that it is againſt <hi>Reaſon,</hi> (though in that they err.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. We deny not that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> herein differ from <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> or true Fanaticks, who pretend <hi>Revelations</hi> which <hi>Reaſon</hi> cannot prove to be what they pretend them to be, and are <hi>contrary</hi> to true <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf; and who think that the ſecret impulſes of their diſeaſed Phantaſies, and Paſſions, are ſuch motions of Gods Spirit as <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt give place to.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We deny not but <hi>Proteſtants</hi> differ from the <hi>great Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme of Popery</hi>; which both buildeth <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>exerciſeth Religion</hi> upon the moſt ſtupendious Fiction of Miracles, againſt <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64664:3"/>
               <hi>Common ſenſe,</hi> that ever (to our knowledge) was entertained by any Sect, or Hereſie in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. In their holding that a Pope, and his Council (called General) are the Infallible Judges of the Churches Faith, from whoſe Authority it muſt be received, though the Pope ſhould be himſelf an <hi>ignorant Lad,</hi> or a <hi>Heretick,</hi> and moſt of the Biſhops in Council ſhould not before underſtand the matter which they vote for: As if God by Miracles taught the <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,</hi> and <hi>erroneous</hi> to vote contrary to their former Opinions, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their underſtanding; and their miraculous Enthuſiaſm, and Infallibility were the Foundation of the Common Faith. As if God would enable a Pope, and Council that underſtood not <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Hebrew,</hi> Infallibly to Tranſlate the Bible out of <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> into their Native Tongues.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And they pretend that all the Prieſts in their Church (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many ſcore thouſands) can work Miracles at their pleaſure, and do ſo in every Maſs which they Celebrate, even to the making <hi>Bread</hi> to be no <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to be no <hi>Wine, nor any ſenſible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>; and all the Sences of the World, that <hi>ſee, taſt, touch</hi> them to be utterly deceived; which is farr greater Miracle-working than ever Chriſt, or his Apoſtles wrought! And to the Belief of this, and this renunciation of all common Senſe, all Chriſtians on pain of damnation muſt ſubmit; and Princes muſt exterminate thoſe that will not, or elſe their Dominions muſt be given to another by the Pope. We ſay not that Proteſtants do either exalt <hi>Reaſon</hi> as the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> or renounce it as either of theſe two Sects of <hi>true Fanaticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By [<hi>Judging</hi>] we mean, 1. <hi>Diſcerning</hi> our ſelves. 2. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> to others.</p>
            <p>By [<hi>Reaſon</hi>] We mean, I <hi>Ex parte objecti</hi>; ſuch evidence of <hi>Truth</hi> which humane <hi>Reaſon</hi> may diſcern.</p>
            <p>This is three-fold, I. <hi>Evidence</hi> of the <hi>Thing it ſelf,</hi> which is either, 1. <hi>Senſible Evidence,</hi> as the very thing is objected to the Senſes, and ſo as <hi>Senſate</hi> repreſented to the Intellect. 2. <hi>Evidence</hi> immediately intelligible, by which the thing it ſelf is objected to the Intuition of the Mind; ſo ſome ſay, with <hi>Ockam,</hi> that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect knoweth its own Acts, and Spirits, ſee Spirits. II. Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64664:4"/>
of the <hi>Medium,</hi> from whence, by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> we may inferr the <hi>Verity</hi> of the Thing. And this is, 1. Of an <hi>ordinary Natural Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> (as a Natural Cauſe is known by the Effects, and the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects by the Cauſe: <hi>e. g.</hi> There is a Sun, <hi>ergo</hi> there is Motion, Light, and Heat:] or [<hi>There is Motion, Light, and Heat</hi>; ergo <hi>there is Fire.</hi>] 2. Or of a <hi>Supernatural Medium,</hi> ſuch as is <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation</hi> by Viſion, Inſpiration, miraculous Atteſtation. III. There is Evidence of <hi>Conſequence,</hi> that the Concluſion certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth the Premiſes. Of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> in theſe Senſes we may have occaſion to ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Ex parte ſubjecti vel Agentis</hi>; And ſo <hi>Reaſon</hi> is taken, 1. For the <hi>reaſoning Faculty.</hi> 2. For the <hi>mental Exerciſe, or Act</hi> in the actual Reaſoning of the Mind. 3. For a <hi>Habit</hi> of Facility, and Promptitude in Reaſoning. 4. For <hi>expreſſive Reaſoning</hi> by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, or diſcourſe, by Word, or Writing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>reaſoning Faculty</hi> is conſidered in Man, I. As <hi>in ſtatu infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato vel inſtituto.</hi> II. <hi>In ſtatu def<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. In the ſtate of <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Innocency,</hi> Mans <hi>Reaſon</hi> was, 1. <hi>Sound in Faculty,</hi> before its Acts. 2. Acted by degrees as Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were preſented to him: And ſo as Chriſt himſelf increaſed in Wiſdome, as to <hi>Acts,</hi> or <hi>Exerciſe</hi> (for his Infant ſtate was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch Action as his Adult) ſo did <hi>Adam.</hi> 3. Habitually more prompt to Act upon ſuch Acting.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In the ſtate of <hi>Sin, Reaſon</hi> was (and ſtill is in the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,) 1. Privatively blind, or undiſpoſed to the right, and ſaving diſcerning of things Spiritual, Holy, and Heavenly; partly through its own corruption, and partly by the <hi>Wills</hi> unhappy inclination, which is the <hi>exercitij principium:</hi> And alſo diſpoſed (by both) to falſe judging, eſpecially to practical errour. 2. It is <hi>actually</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and erroneous, and prejudiced againſt ſaving Faith, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Good, and holy Practice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is by Cuſtome in ſuch ſinful Acts, <hi>habitually</hi> more, and

            <p n="1">1. The Common are, 1. That Light, or Common Knowledge and Belief, which is preparatory to ſaving Light. 2. That Light of edifying benefits, by which Men are made uſeful to others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Light of <hi>ſpecial ſaving Grace</hi> is, 1. Initial in Vocation for the firſt ſaving Faith, and Repentance. 2. Increaſed in Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by ſuch a degree as kindleth in the Soul predominant Love. 3. More increaſed in Growth unto the end.</p>

            <p>Theſe things premiſed, the Queſtion is not whether Socinians, Papiſts, Antinomians, Quakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> differ from us? nor whether any odd Perſon, or Perſons, called Proteſtants, have Ignorace e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to entangle them in an error in this Point? nor whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haſty Judges, that are not skilled in diſcuſſing the ambiguity of words, or for want of well digeſted Studies, can neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand others, nor ſpeak diſtinctly, and intelligibly themſelves; or in uncharitable Factious, paſſionate humour, are diſpoſed to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand their Brethren, or to put a ſiniſter Interpretation on their words; we ſay, it is not whether ſuch ignorant contenders do think that Men differ farther than they do? nor whether any have uſed unmeet expreſſions juſtly blameable? nor whether there are any that Write againſt, or accuſe each other on this account, and would make the World believe that we are of contrary minds? nor is it whether our Reaſons really differ about the ſenſe of ſome Texts of Scripture, or Points of Religion? nor is it whether Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants differ about the extent of Humane Authority, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of their Wills, or Canons.</p>
            <p>But the ſenſe of the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether it be a diſtance between
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64664:5"/>
Conformiſts and Non-conformists, Lutherans and Calviniſts, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by-named Parties of Proteſtants; whether, and how farr we must have, or give Reaſon for all our Religion, or Exerciſe Reaſon in diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and in propagating, and defending it by Proof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we ſhall prove the Negative, I. By thoſe <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of the ſeveral Churches, and Parties, which notifie their Judgements. In all the <hi>Corpus Confeſſionum</hi> there is no Article on this Subject which is not commonly conſented to by the reſt of the Proteſtant Churches. And as for the <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> and <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> they conſent to Subſcribe to all the <hi>ſame Doctrinal Articles</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (though they differ about ſome <hi>other Subſcriptions, Declarations, Covenants, or Promiſes of Conformity</hi>; and ſome <hi>Oaths, and Modes of Diſcipline, and Worſhip.</hi>) Beſides that, we all Subſcribe to the ſame Creed, and the ſame Canonical Scriptures. And either the Point about the Intereſt of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in Religion is in the Creed, Bible, or Articles of Religion, or not. If not, it is no part of our Religion, nor neceſſary. If it be, then we Subſcribe our agreement in it.</p>
            <p>There is no <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> no <hi>Writing</hi> of <hi>either Party,</hi> Conformiſts, or Non-conformiſts, (<hi>Conſented to</hi> by the <hi>Party</hi>) which ſignifies any diſagreement in this Point, or contradiction of what both ſides conſent in. Let them that will prove a difference, cite any ſuch Book, or Profeſſion of either Party, if they can.</p>
            <p>We deny not but ſome Non-conformiſts, and Conformiſts did caſt out their ſuſpitions of two very Learned rational Men, Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> as if they had favoured <hi>Socinianiſme,</hi> becauſe they ſo much uſed, and Aſcribed to Reaſon, in Judging of matters of Religion; And <hi>Knot</hi> the Jeſuite would have <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> therefore taken to be a <hi>Socinian.</hi> But it was but particular Men, and not a Party that was <hi>ſuſpected</hi>: and it was but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Men that did ſuſpect them: Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> aſperſion of Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> was not the Churches Judgement: And in all Parties there will be ſome ſuſpicious uncharitable Men, and ſome that will ſpeak evil of what they underſtand not; and take it as a neer way to get the reputation of being <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Orthodox,</hi> by accuſing others of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64664:5"/>
and error, than by long, and diligent well ordered Studies.</p>
            <p>Object. 1. <hi>But though they all Subſcribe the ſame Bible, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; they all underſtand them not alike.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. No, nor any two Perſons in the World; It is as probable that any two Men have <hi>ſpoken</hi> none but the very ſame <hi>words,</hi> as that they have had none but the very ſame thoughts. 2. Let any difference be ſhown, as to the Point in queſtion, And ſuch as is not equally managed by Conformiſts againſt Conformiſts, as by them againſt any particular Non-conformiſts.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>You agree not whether the Reaſon of the Rulers, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops may make, and impoſe any Form of Churches, National, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal, or Provincial, which Chriſt never made; or any new Offices, or Ceremonies of Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This is nothing to the Point in queſtion, but of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. 2. We are all agreed that <hi>circa ſacra</hi> there are many undetermined Particulars, and Circumſtances, which ſome call Ceremonies; for which, Scripture giveth only a general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and Rule, (as, <hi>Let all be done decently, in order, to edification, in Unity,</hi> &amp;c.) which humane Reaſon (in <hi>Rulers</hi> where it is their part, and in <hi>Conſenters</hi> where it is left to <hi>conſent</hi>) may, and muſt <hi>determine:</hi> And that they that have Power <hi>de rebus extrinſecis circa ſacra,</hi> may make humane Offices for ſuch humane Works, (as Door-keepers, Church-wardens, Magiſtrates, to keep Church-peace, and Order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And if they will call any Lawful Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Paſtors, or orderly Aſſociations, by the Name of (hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane) Churches, ſo they will but diſtinguiſh them from Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of proper Divine Inſtitution, and take away none of thoſe Rights from ſuch as Chriſt hath given them in Scripture; we know no Party of Proteſtants that differ <hi>de re</hi> againſt them, though many wiſh that the Name [<hi>Churches</hi>] were not made common to thoſe of <hi>Divine,</hi> and of <hi>Humane</hi> Inſtitution, leſt it obſcure the great difference of the things named; and leſt, as in the Papacie, <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties</hi> and <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Divine Inſtitution</hi> ſhould be thought to ſtand in a direct <hi>Subordination</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Humane Inſtitution</hi>; and the Churches which Chriſt hath Inſtituted ſhould be thought to be but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64664:6"/>
as Pariſhes to a County, Streets, or Houſes to a City, Cities to a Kingdom, meer <hi>ſimilar</hi> parts of the <hi>Churches of Mans making</hi>; which conceit is the ſtrength of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom, called a Church.</p>
            <p>Object. 3. <hi>But ſome ſay that only the Spirit can aſſure us that the Scriptures are the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> So we ſay all; not excluding, but including the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Evidence,</hi> and <hi>Uſe of Reaſon,</hi> That is, 1. The Spirit in Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and Prophets hath Imprinted Gods Image of Power, Wiſdome, and Love on the Sacred Scriptures; which is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Evidence. 2. And the ſame Spirit by that Word doth <hi>Powerfully, Wiſely,</hi> and <hi>Gratiouſly</hi> Imprint an anſwerable Image on our Hearts. 3. And he helpeth us by this effect, and impulſe, to diſcern that it is Gods Word that did it; And giveth us (as the new born Babe to his Milk) a diſcerning of, and Appetite to this holy Word, as Connatural, or ſuitable to our Souls: The Spirit giveth us ſuch <hi>Reaſons</hi> for our Religion, as elſe we ſhould not have; and alſo helpeth our <hi>Reaſon</hi> actually to underſtand it; and alſo maketh us <hi>Habitually more Rational</hi> herein. And do not all agree in this?</p>
            <p>Object. 4. <hi>But ſome ſay that the Scripture is known</hi> propria luce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> So ſay all, but not by that alone: <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt diſcern the Divinity of Scripture partly by the <hi>evident Impulſes</hi> of Divinity which are in it, which are its <hi>proper Light</hi>; and partly by <hi>extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick atteſtations,</hi> in the due uſe of the means which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Reaſon</hi> to make uſe of,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Our ſecond Proof of our Common Agreement ſhall be by an <hi>Induction</hi> of the <hi>particular Points</hi> which we are <hi>all agreed in,</hi> where if the enumeration be ſufficient, our Proof will be clear. And if we ſeem to over-do, in naming more than needs; it is to avoid the charge of an inſufficient enumeration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are all agreed that all true Religion, <hi>objectively</hi> taken, is the effect of <hi>Gods Wiſdome</hi>; and, <hi>ſubjectively</hi> taken, alſo is the <hi>Gift</hi> of the Father of Lights.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are agreed, that as Gods <hi>Wiſdome</hi> is the <hi>firſt efficient,</hi> ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64664:6"/>
the <hi>Impreſs</hi> of <hi>Divine Wiſdome,</hi> by which it is eminently <hi>wiſe and reaſonable,</hi> is its very <hi>Conſtitutive Cauſe</hi>; its <hi>Form,</hi> and the <hi>proper Light,</hi> by which it is to be known.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are agreed that <hi>objective Religion</hi> is to be received by Mans <hi>Reaſonable Intellect,</hi> and is, when ſo received, the light and guide, the advancement and perfecting of our <hi>Reaſon.</hi> And the <hi>moſt Religious,</hi> are the <hi>moſt</hi> truly, and nobly <hi>rational.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We are agreed that it hath <hi>Intelligible evidence,</hi> which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to <hi>be of God,</hi> and <hi>true.</hi> And that Mans <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt by <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this evidence,</hi> know its <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>truth.</hi> Seeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is an <hi>Object</hi> of the Intellect, but by <hi>Intelligible evidence</hi>; as nothing is an Object of ſight, but Light; and things by Light, made viſible.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And as our own <hi>receiving</hi> it, is by <hi>receiving</hi> the ſaid <hi>evidence,</hi> and knowing its Divinity, and truth thereby; ſo our <hi>Teaching</hi> it to others, and <hi>proving</hi> it againſt Gain-ſayers by defence, muſt be by our <hi>manifesting</hi> the <hi>ſame evidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The Reaſon, or Intellect of Man in <hi>Innocency,</hi> was <hi>apt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand</hi> both the natural, and ſupernatural manifeſtations of Gods governing Will, and ſo to be <hi>Actively Religious,</hi> and to increaſe herein by exerciſe, and Divine help.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Reaſon of <hi>fallen Man</hi> before gratious Illumination, is ſtill the ſame <hi>eſſentially</hi> in the <hi>Faculty</hi>; but is <hi>diſpoſitively depraved</hi> (called Blindneſs) diſpoſed to Judge carnally, falſly, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly of things ſpiritual, and holy; and undiſpoſed to diſcern, <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly,</hi> the truth, and goodneſs of Religion.</p>
            <p n="8">8. There are found in all Man-kind, at Age, ſome <hi>Natural noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which are an advantage to the Reception of Religion, and make Men more capable of it, than otherwiſe they would be: And Grace giveth Men uſually a <hi>common</hi> ſort of <hi>external,</hi> aad <hi>internal Light,</hi> which is preparatory to that which is ſpecially ſaving.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Chriſtian Religion conſiſting of things partly naturally, and partly ſupernaturally revealed; the natural part of it hath its <hi>natural evidence</hi> (either <hi>Rei ipſius,</hi> or <hi>Medij naturalis,</hi>) by which, without <hi>ſupernatural Revelation,</hi> it may be known; but is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64664:7"/>
Gods <hi>illuminating Grace, effectually, and ſavingly known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. The <hi>natural</hi> part of Revelation, or objective Religion is in order of <hi>Time</hi> before the ſupernatural part; and natural evidence and Religion is more common than ſupernatural: We are Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are Chriſtians in order of Nature at leaſt.</p>
            <p n="11">11. There is no Contradiction between the natural, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelation, or parts of Religion; for God contradicteth not himſelf. He therefore that thinketh that he findeth a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, is deceived; and muſt Correct the error of his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and not accuſe the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Things equally <hi>true</hi> are not equally <hi>evident,</hi> and revealed, and ſure to us: ſome things in <hi>Nature</hi> are much clearer than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and ſome parts of Scripture farr more intelligible than ſome others, and ſo more evident to us.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Ceteris paribus,</hi> things <hi>ſenſible,</hi> and the <hi>Common Natural no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices</hi> have <hi>greater evidence to us; and are of eaſier belief</hi> than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Revelations: But <hi>ſome ſupernatural</hi> Revelations have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally, and intrinſecally, more aſcertaining evidence than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Natural Revelations,</hi> or <hi>Verities</hi>; no ſmall Number of <hi>theſe</hi> are very obſcure.</p>
            <p n="14">14. When the Underſtanding once diſcerneth a thing to be <hi>a Divine Revelation,</hi> it hath therein a certain <hi>Medium,</hi> from which it may infer the thing revealed to be <hi>true</hi>: All known Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations are ſo far aſcertaining, as they are known; For God <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Lye: Divine Veracity</hi> is the <hi>formal Object</hi> of <hi>Divine Belief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. If we <hi>doubt</hi> of the <hi>evidence</hi> of any Revelation, Natural, or Supernatural, whether it be indeed Divine; we muſt hold that with the ſtrongeſt affiance, or belief, which hath the cleareſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring evidence that it is Divine.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Prophets, and Inſpired Seers had ſuch Internal ſatiſfying evidence, (whether by Intuition, or abſtract <hi>Species,</hi> or internal Senſe) which no Man can formally, and clearly conceive of, but he that hath it; But the Reaſon of others may know it by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and concomitant, or conſequent Proofs.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Thoſe that heard the Voice, and ſaw the Miracles of Chriſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64664:7"/>
and his Apoſtles, had ſenſible evidence thereof: And thoſe at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place, or time that ſaw them not, may have certain infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible evidences of the Hiſtorical truth, or report <hi>de facto</hi> that ſuch things, indeed, were <hi>ſaid,</hi> and <hi>done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. There are (as is aforeſaid) <hi>Characters of Divine Authority</hi> in Religion, and in the Sacred Scriptures; which are their <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent evidence,</hi> or <hi>propria Lux,</hi> even the Impreſs of Gods Power, Wiſdome, and Love.</p>
            <p n="19">19. There are evident <hi>unimitable effects of</hi> the Chriſtian Faith, which prove it to be of God; even the <hi>Spirits ſanctifying</hi> Work, on Man; which may, by thoſe that have it not, be partly diſcerned in the holy Lives of Believers; eſpecially in the Sanctity of the <hi>Church,</hi> that it ſhould be holy, in Compariſon of the unholy World, (that is, all ſound Believers which are the real ſpiritual living Church;) for, if one <hi>Letter</hi> might be made without <hi>Reaſon</hi> by <hi>chance,</hi> yet ſo cannot a <hi>Learned Book</hi>: And if an <hi>individual Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> might by chance be holier than Infidels, yet ſo could not all true Believers. But he that hath this Sanctification, or Spirit in himſelf, hath clearer, and more aſſuring evidence; and thoſe moſt that have the greateſt degree of holineſs: Theſe all have the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in themſelves.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The Spirit of Chriſt thus ſent <hi>from</hi> him, as his <hi>Agent,</hi> and <hi>Advocate</hi> in Mens Souls, is the Author, both of <hi>Common preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and of <hi>Special ſaving Illumination,</hi> inlightening the Mind to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the things of God; and (as is aforeſaid) giving the ſanctified <hi>Will</hi> a new <hi>Reliſh</hi> to them, as congruous and good: And this <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Faith objectively,</hi> and <hi>ſubjectively</hi> is the gift of God, or a Beam from Chriſt, the Light of the redeemed World.</p>
            <p>But to ſome the ſame Spirit giveth far greater meaſures of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Faith, than to others; and thoſe are likeſt to receive moſt of that Grace, who are moſt ſincere, and diligent in the Study of Gods Word, and the uſe of all other holy means; and not the idle, negligent preſumers.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Neither corrupted, no, nor ſound <hi>Reaſon</hi> can diſcern things without <hi>Supernatural evidence,</hi> which <hi>Natural evidence</hi> doth not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64664:8"/>
declare: Therefore thoſe that never hear the Goſpel cannot know the Miſteries of Chriſtianity (without a Miracle) though they may know much of <hi>God</hi> as <hi>merciful and just,</hi> by his Mercies, and Government of the World.</p>
            <p n="22">22. The Spirit is not given to ordinary Chriſtians (though it be to Prophets) to bring them, from God, new <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or <hi>Laws</hi>; nor to make any <hi>ſupplements</hi> to the Goſpel already revealed, as if it was not ſufficient in its kind; nor yet to reveal the matter of Chriſts Goſpel, immediately, to the Intellect, or phantaſie within, by way of <hi>Inſpiration, Viſions,</hi> or <hi>Intuitions,</hi> without an <hi>external</hi> Word, or Revelation; nor yet to cauſe them to work Miracles themſelves, But he is given to enable, diſpoſe, and help us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, believe, love, and practiſe the Doctrine, and Law, already, by the ſame Spirit given to the Church, by ſanctifying our <hi>Power,</hi> our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and our <hi>Wills,</hi> by holy <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> And as Chriſt is the Interceſſor <hi>without</hi> us, by <hi>whom</hi> we muſt <hi>receive all Mercies</hi> from God, and ſend up all our <hi>duties</hi> to God; ſo his Spirit is the <hi>Interceſſour</hi> within us, on Chriſts part, as his Advocate, and Witneſs, pleading his Cauſe againſt our unbelief, and other ſin, and working all Gods Graces in us; and on our part, <hi>teaching, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and <hi>quickening</hi> us in all the Prayers, and Praiſes which we ſend up to God, in the Name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Illuminating, and ſanctifying, is not making us Prophets, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; nor equal to them, as not being called to their Works.</p>
            <p n="23">23. We muſt uſe our beſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> in diligent Meditation, and Judgement, to ſearch the <hi>Works</hi> of God in Nature, to know which are the true Canonical Scriptures, to diſcern true <hi>Copies,</hi> and <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> where the Copies differ, to <hi>expound</hi> the Text, to Tranſlate it truly, to diſcern the <hi>Order</hi> of ſacred Verities that are diſperſed through all the Scriptures, to gather them into <hi>Catechiſmes,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions</hi> of Faith, diſcerning things more neceſſary from the leſs needful, and the more clear from the more obſcure; to Compoſe our Sermons, Prayers, and Praiſes of God, according to his Word: To gather juſt, and certain Inferences from Scripture Aſſertions: To apply general Rules to particular Caſes, in matters of Doctrine,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64664:8"/>
Worſhip, Diſcipline, and ordinary Practice, prudently to diſcern thoſe Duties, which are but generally commanded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and left to be diſcerned by us, in particular, according to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining Accidents, Circumſtances, and Occurrences, which muſt be conſidered, and compared. And when Parents, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Paſtors, Tutors, or Maſters, ſhall ſo determine of ſuch particulars in the Government of their Inferiours, which belong to their ſeveral Relations, or Offices to determine of, according to Gods general Laws, or Rules, Inferiours muſt obey them in ſuch determinations; and in ſo doing, they do obey Gods General Laws, and obey God conſequentially, in obeying ſuch Laws of his Officers as he authorizeth them to make.</p>
            <p>For we are all agreed, that there are ſome parts of Scripture which contain more <hi>neceſſary Doctrine,</hi> than other parts; and ſome <hi>great Duties</hi> of Prime neceſſity, which are the end of many lower Duties; and conſequently, a <hi>Rule</hi> to them as <hi>means,</hi> and as <hi>ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi>; and Actions otherwiſe Good, become Evil when they croſs theſe great final regulating Duties: ſuch a <hi>Canon</hi> is the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the <hi>New Creature,</hi> and <hi>Unity therein,</hi> as to Circumciſion, or Uncircumciſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. and 6.15. And ſuch a <hi>Canon</hi> is the <hi>Love, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> of Chriſtians, in <hi>ſo much as they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,</hi> while they ſeek after more, <hi>Phil,</hi> 3.16. ſuch a Canon is <hi>Edification</hi> (and order) as to ſeveral Modes of Worſhip, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Acts, and Diſcipline, 1. Cor. 14.5.12.26. 2. Cor. 10.8. and 12.19. and 13.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. And the right ordering of a Chriſtian Converſation doth much conſiſt in diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by true Reaſon when circumſtantiated Actions are <hi>ſubſervient,</hi> or <hi>croſs</hi> to theſe final regulating (<hi>Canonical</hi>) Duties, that we may know whether <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> they are Duties, or Sins; Becauſe affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precepts bind not, <hi>ad ſemper</hi> (though no Sin muſt at any time be done) leſſer Duties when inconſiſtent with the greater (at that time) are no Duties, but Sins: And means are no means, when they loſe their tendency to the end, or are againſt it. So did Chriſt teach Men to difference between <hi>Tything Mint, Aniſe,</hi> and <hi>Cumine,</hi> and the <hi>great things of the Law</hi>; and between the <hi>leaſt,</hi> and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64664:9"/>
               <hi>great Commandments</hi>; and to judge of obſerving the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Reſt, and <hi>Converſing with Publicans, and Sinners,</hi> by this Rule, <hi>I will have mercy and not Sacrifice, Mat.</hi> 9.13. and 12.7. And to <hi>leave our gift at the Altar,</hi> and <hi>go firſt and be reconciled to our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>then come and offer our gift, Mat.</hi> 5. And to <hi>caſt firſt the Beam out of our own Eyes,</hi> before we take the <hi>Mote out of our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Mat.</hi> 6. Thus to try circumſtantiated Actions, by their <hi>ends,</hi> and <hi>greater Canon-duties</hi>; and to try what Accidents do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate for the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> is the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>hourly Work</hi> of <hi>Prudent Reaſon</hi>; and of exceeding great uſe to our daily innocency, and peace.</p>
            <p n="24">24. The more the Underſtanding of a Chriſtian diſcerneth the <hi>Evidences, and true Reaſons</hi> of all things in Religion, the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advantage his <hi>Will</hi> hath for the <hi>Love of it,</hi> and fixed <hi>Reſolution</hi> never to <hi>forſake</hi> it; and for ſeriouſneſs, and conſtancie in a holy ſelf-denying Life; and for patience in ſufferings, and joyful hopes of Heavenly Glory: for Grace worketh on Man, as Man; that is, as a Rational free Agent, whoſe <hi>Will</hi> muſt be guided by the light of his Underſtanding. And he muſt needs be the loweſt and looſeſt Chriſtian, that hath leaſt Knowledge, and Intellectual apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (explicite, or implicite) <hi>why</hi> he is a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p n="25">25. It is a great cauſe of the ſlight ſuperficial Religion, and weakneſs of all Grace which abounds among us, that too many taking the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of their Religion too much on the <hi>truſt</hi> of thoſe that educate them, or with whom they live, do labour <hi>only to build upward</hi> on ſuch an ill-laid Foundation; when (<hi>as Trees</hi> grow <hi>downward</hi> in the Roots as well as upward) they ſhould be all their days ſtill growing <hi>downward</hi> in the confirmation of their Faith, and in the clearer and more orderly diſcerning of their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, and the Evidences of them; It being an <hi>increaſed ſight of Evidence of Truth, intenſively,</hi> and <hi>extenſively (in depth and clearneſs of perception,</hi> as well as <hi>material Evidences</hi>) which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the true <hi>increaſe of Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi>: And the ableſt Chriſtians ſhould be (not <hi>queſtioning,</hi> but) as long as they live, <hi>growing clearer,</hi> and <hi>ſtronger</hi> in the Knowledge of God, the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality

of the Soul, and reality of the future Life, and Miſteries of Redemption, and Sanctification; where holy Reaſon will find the moſt neceſſary, great and fruitful Work.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Objective Religion being the thing which <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, it is as vain to ask, whether <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, as to ask whether we ſhould, in ſeeing, preferr the <hi>Eye,</hi> or the <hi>Light,</hi> or the <hi>material Objects</hi>; which muſt all Concur to make one Act? And they that ask, <hi>Whether Reaſon, and Religion be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray</hi>? muſt know, 1. That the <hi>Faculty</hi> of Reaſon, as ſuch, is no more contrary to Religion, than the viſive Faculty to the Light, or Object. 2. That ſo far as Reaſon hath any pravity in <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> or <hi>Act, privative,</hi> or <hi>poſitive,</hi> ignorance or errour in the matters of Religion; ſo far it is <hi>contrary</hi> to Religion. 3. That ſo far as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is <hi>ſound in Act,</hi> and <hi>Habit,</hi> it is <hi>agreeable</hi> to <hi>Religion.</hi> 4. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>worſe</hi> any Mans Underſtanding is, the more it is <hi>againſt Religion.</hi> And not only the <hi>Learnedſt, and Wiſest</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo the <hi>Holieſt, and beſt,</hi> having but an <hi>imperfect Illumination</hi> in this Life, hath ſtill ſome <hi>remnants,</hi> in him, of that which is <hi>contrary</hi> to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and every Man ſo far as his blindneſs, and pravity, is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. 5. But as to the <hi>Objective</hi> parts themſelves, it is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that none of them are contrary: The Common Principles, or <hi>Notices of Nature,</hi> have nothing contrary to them in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> There is nothing in the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity, Incarnation,</hi> or <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> contrary to any Natural Verity; nor any thing which <hi>true illuminated Reaſon,</hi> by <hi>true Divine Revelation,</hi> cannot prove.</p>
            <p n="27">27. The bleſſed in <hi>Glory,</hi> whoſe <hi>Intellects are perfected,</hi> will ſee, for ever, ſuch <hi>Reaſons</hi> for all the parts of Religion; even the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Incarnation,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> as will delight them everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, as ſeeing the admirable Harmony of all the ſacred Truths, and Works of God; and the tranſcendant Wiſdome of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in all: And Chriſt, who is now both <hi>eſſentially</hi> in himſelf, and <hi>o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="28">28. As the <hi>Devils believe, and tremble,</hi> ſo it is probable that the <hi>Judge</hi> of all the World will convince <hi>the wicked, and Infidels,</hi> at laſt, that it was a <hi>Reaſonable</hi> Goſpel which they rejected, and a <hi>Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Faith, and Service</hi> which God required of them; and that they <hi>lived againſt Reaſon</hi> in their unbelief, and ſinning againſt God: For the <hi>Spirit doth reprove the World of ſin, becauſe they believed not in Chriſt, John,</hi> 16.8. And he that will <hi>come, in flaming Fire, to take vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and will puniſh them with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and the Glory of his Power; and will come to be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that believe, in that day, even becauſe they believed,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9, 10. Will ſure convince Men, that Faith was a <hi>reaſonable,</hi> and <hi>Infidelity</hi> an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable</hi> thing.</p>
            <p>In all theſe particulars we have reaſon to believe that not only <hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> but all <hi>true Proteſtants</hi> are agreed.</p>
            <p>And they agree in the <hi>Renunciation</hi> of theſe contrary Opinions, (though we cannot ſay that any Man living is ſo perfect, as to hold nothing that hath ſome remote Contrariety to the Truths which he doth profeſs, not diſcerning the Contrariety.)</p>
            <p n="1">I. They all reject the Infidels Opinions, who think that the Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Chriſtianity, and the Goſpel are not to be believed, at leaſt, as certain; becauſe <hi>Reaſon without ſupernatural Revelation</hi> cannot know them: or who hold that the Goſpel hath no <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. They all reject their error, who take <hi>ſome part</hi> of Gods ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelation to be falſe; and will judge what <hi>is true,</hi> and what <hi>is falſe,</hi> by the Conjectures of their Reaſon, which ought to ſee the Truth and Concord of all: And that ſuppoſing falſly a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, do ſet up one part of Gods own Word againſt the reſt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. They all reject their error, who will not believe the <hi>difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of Faith, upon the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Proof</hi> of <hi>Gods Veracity, and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; unleſs the thing revealed be <hi>evident in it ſelf,</hi> and may be proved by <hi>Natural</hi> Proof alone.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64664:10"/>IV. They reject the <hi>proud</hi> conceits of thoſe, who when they find paſſages in Gods Word, which they cannot reconcile, or think not probable, are readier to accuſe, or ſuſpect Gods Word, than their dark, and erring underſtandings.</p>
            <p n="5">V. We all reject their impudent errour, who feign Miracles where there was none, or put falſe Conſtructions on the Text, yea, on the Articles of Faith; and charge their own errours by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding on Gods Word, even when thoſe errours are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the common Notices of Nature, or the greateſt, cleareſt, and moſt evident Doctrines; and then tell Men that they muſt either deny thoſe <hi>great Doctrines,</hi> as croſs to Gods Word, or elſe that <hi>both</hi> muſt be believed, as of God, even the <hi>Canon Verities,</hi> and theſe Mens <hi>inconſiſtent errours</hi>: And we reject their Method that will try many plain, great, certain truths, and Texts, by ſuch as are more <hi>rare,</hi> and more <hi>obſcure,</hi> and of <hi>ſmaller moment.</hi> Much more their ſcandalous abuſes, who perſwade Men that we can be no ſurer of the truth of Chriſtianity it ſelf, than we are of every <hi>Lection, Tranſlation,</hi> or <hi>Expoſition,</hi> when they are doubtful, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or contrary; And who tempt Men to Infidelity by obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their own <hi>Forgeries, and Contradictions</hi> to be believed, as the Word of God, and of equal Verity with the eſſentials of our Faith.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. We all reject their errour, who make every <hi>Circumſtance</hi> of Religion unlawful, which hath not a particular Command in Scripture; as if <hi>Reaſon</hi> might not regulate ſuch by the <hi>General Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>; As if Reaſon might not without expreſs particular Precept, chooſe a <hi>Text, Method, Words,</hi> and <hi>Notes</hi> for remembrance in Preaching; or might not <hi>Tranſlate</hi> the Scriptures, or turn the <hi>Pſalms</hi> into <hi>Metre,</hi> and put <hi>Tunes</hi> on each; and many ſuch things.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. We all reject the Fanatick, or Enhuſiaſtical Opinion of them that pretend a neceſſity of immediate inſpiration, inſtead of Scriptures, to teach Men inwardly, Doctrines which they never outwardly heard, or <hi>more</hi> than is before revealed in the Word; And who thus equal their Revelations to thoſe of the Apoſtles, or feign this <hi>Immediate Light,</hi> or <hi>Revelation</hi> to be the <hi>chief Rule</hi> to all Men of their Religion; As if objectively there wereas <hi>many
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64664:11"/>
Religions</hi> in the World, as there are Men of different degrees of Light within! that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as there are Men. And that pretend that none are farther bound to believe the Goſpel than they either ſee Miracles themſelves to confirm it, or elſe have this <hi>immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration</hi> before deſcribed, to atteſt it.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. We all agree in rejecting the fore-deſcribed <hi>Papal Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſme,</hi> which maketh the Pope and Council, though ne're ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or erroneous, to be ſecured of the gift of Infallibility, as if it were by Miracle, in judging of that which their Reaſons are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet for, and they do not underſtand; eſpecially their foreſaid feigned World of Miracles by the (ſottiſheſt) Prieſts in Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. And eſpecially their perſecuting all that are not as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable renouncers of common Senſe and Reaſon, and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Temporal Lords that will not exterminate them. And their requiring all Chriſtians to reſolve their Faith into the Authority of this Fanatick Church, as being bound to take that, and only that, for the Articles of their Faith, and Word of God, which they aſſert to be ſo; and as needing no other Proof than the Pope, and his Councils aſſertion. (And on whoſe Authority then doth the Pope, and Council, themſelves believe it?)</p>
            <p n="9">IX. All Proteſtants diſclaim that inhumane, atheiſtical aſſertion, that in Religion, <hi>Inferiours</hi> muſt believe all that their <hi>Superiours</hi> aſſert, and do all that they ſhall command, and avoid all that they ſhall forbid them, without uſing their own <hi>Reaſon</hi> to diſcern <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio privato</hi> whether it be agreeable, or contrary to the Laws of God: As if all Subjects muſt be of the Soveraigns Religion, be it Heathen, Mahometan, Jewiſh, or Chriſtian, Popiſh, Socinian, or what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: Or as if Man were above God, from whom he receiveth all his power, and might Command Men to blaſpheme him, or ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; or forbid all to confeſs, and worſhip him; and God muſt ask Men leave whether he ſhall be God, or be obeyed, or worſhipped! And as if it were in the Rulers power whether any of the Subjects ſhall be Religious, or be ſaved? or as if Subjects were not <hi>reaſonable</hi> Creatures, or <hi>could</hi> obey without the uſe of <hi>Reaſon</hi> diſcerning <hi>whom</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>how far</hi> to obey? If they have not a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64664:11"/>
               <hi>judicium diſcretionis</hi> how ſhall they know their King whom they muſt obey, honour, and protect, from an Uſurper, or Traytor, whom they muſt diſown, and oppoſe.</p>
            <p n="10">X. And we hope all true Proteſtants are agrreed againſt that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Opinion, that if an Inferiour be <hi>uncertain,</hi> or <hi>doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the matter</hi> be <hi>Lawful,</hi> or <hi>Sinful,</hi> he muſt do it if his Governour Command it, and forbear it if his Governour forbid it; <hi>becauſe an uncertainty muſt give place to a certainty:</hi> and <hi>we are certain that the Ruler is to be obeyed, but not that the thing forbidden is duty, nor that the thing commanded is ſin.</hi> 1. For we ſuppoſe all agreed that it muſt go with a <hi>caeteris paribus.</hi> 2. And that we are certain that no Ruler can oblige us to ſin; and therefore we are not certain that he is to be obeyed, where we fear, upon good reaſon, that it is ſin which he Commandeth; For if I am juſtly fearful that it is ſin that is Commanded, I muſt be fearful that it is ſin to obey by ſinning: And to be <hi>certain</hi> that I ſhould obey, and fearful that I ſin in obeying, are contradictory. 3. And we doubt not but all Proteſtants are agreed, that if all the Subjects (or any) can but be ignorant enough as to be <hi>uncertain</hi> whether there be a God, a Chriſt, or a Life to come; or that it is a duty to relieve the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will not therefore, by any Mans prohibition, ceaſe to be all their duty to love, or obey God, or worſhip him, or to relieve the Poor? Or if Men be ſo ſottiſh as to be <hi>uncertain</hi> whether Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, Idolatry, Perſecution, Murder, Adultery, Perjury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be ſins, we all agree that no Mans Command can make it the duty of thoſe uncertain Perſons to commit them, nor make them to be no ſin; (whatever any Man, of violence, may ſay to the contrary, in paſſion.)</p>
            <p>We conclude upon this <hi>Induction,</hi> that till ſome omitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance be produced, this <hi>Enumeration</hi> of our <hi>Agreements</hi> will prove that, not only, Conformiſts, and Non-conformiſts, but all true Proteſtants are agreed really of the Intereſt, and uſe of Reaſon in matters of Faith, or of Religion.</p>
            <div type="statement_of_agreement">

               <head>Conſectaries.</head>
               <p n="1">I. HEnce we ſee then that Divines have great cauſe to take heed of ſetting Chriſtians together by the Ears, by feigned diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences where there are none; and ſo deſtroying Love and Concord, and tempting the ignorant to hate and falſly accuſe their Brethren, to the trouble of the Church, and the hazard of their Salvation: And therefore that while Men have not attained a through acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the matter, and in diſcuſſing ambiguities of Speech, and diſtinguiſhing Verbal Controverſies, from real, if they forbear not their Cenſures, and publique Controverſies, till they attain a more ripe diſtinct underſtanding, they may greatly ſerve Satan, while they think that they are ſerving Chriſt. And how little the Church is beholden to thoſe Men, that either through <hi>factious worldly deſigns,</hi> or ignorant Zeal againſt error, have made the World believe by Pulpit invectives and voluminous Controverſies, that Chriſtians differ really, when it is but verbally, experience might have ſatisfied us long ere this.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Thoſe that have been guilty of ſuch feigning of difficulties, and wronging the Church, ſhould make repairation by open repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and all Chriſtians ſhould ſtudy the difference between mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and expreſſive art, and words; and be deſirous and skilful for the narrowing of differences, as others are in widening them.</p>
               <p>We are not in Love with the Spirit and Practiſe of Incendiaries, Love-killers, or Dividers: We find too many contending in this caſe, as if they thought the difference real; but not any <hi>Party</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, (many Conformiſts, as well as Non-conformiſts, being jealous of giving too much to humane Reaſon.) But we ſuppoſe we have fully proved a real Concord among us all, though
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64664:12"/>
unskilful, word-warriours diſcern it not. If any will be a diſſenter, he muſt be a ſtragler from all the Proteſtant Churches. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in his Declaration of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs expreſſed his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of ſuch as pretended that the <hi>Church-doctrine needed refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> as if in Doctrine we were not agreed. Seeing we all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the ſame Scripture, and Articles of Religion, and all agree in the twenty eight Concluſions, and ten Rejections before expreſs'd; if any yet proceed in their Accuſations, we deſire them, for our Conviction, to ſtate the Caſe in which, they ſuppoſe, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, and prove their Charge; and to remember what it is to <hi>ſtrive about words,</hi> and what have been, and yet are, the effects; and that the <hi>Wiſdome from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, and without partiallity and hypocriſie; and that the Fruit of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſown in peace,</hi> and that <hi>bleſſed are the peacemakers, for theirs is the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We, whoſe Names are Subſcribed, (not undertaking that no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Perſon is otherwiſe minded,) do, our ſelves, believe the real Concord of Proteſtants, as it is here expreſſed.</p>
