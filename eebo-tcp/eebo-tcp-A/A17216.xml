            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therfore wyl we now geue no anſwere out of our ſelues, but ſet forth holy Paul, &amp; let hym anſwere, that the anſwere maye be the more ſure, &amp; the better eſtemed. Paul in the .iii. chapter to the Galathians wryteth after this maner Deare brethren, I will ſpeake after the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of men, whan a mans teſtament is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmed, no man doth lightely regarde or deſpyſe it, ner addeth oughte therto. Now were the promiſes made vnto Abraham and to hys ſede, He ſayeth not: In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, as in many, but as in one: And in thy ſede, which is Chriſt. All theſe are Pauls wordes, and the meanyng of them is: For aſmoche as the teſtamentes or wor
<pb facs="tcp:11958:33"/>
kes of men, are of ſuche reputacion in the worlde, that whan they are made, ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confyrmed, no man darre adde oughte to them, or mynyſhe any thyng fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, but euery man muſte let them be as they are of them ſelues: It is muche more reaſon that gods Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or bequeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne<note place="margin">Gods Te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtament.</note> ſtyll, and that nothyng be added to it, or taken from it. Now dyd God make a teſtament or bequeſt wyth Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and promiſed hym therin, that he woulde geue hym a ſede, in whom he &amp; hys childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhuld be ſaued. And the ſame ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dyd he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly appoynte in one, and not in many. Wherfore we muſt adde nothynge vnto gods bequeſt, ſeyng he hath promyſed vs ſaluation in Chriſt only, and not in many (that is to ſaye, in no creature, not in our owne power and workes of the law) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we thinke, that the law was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde added to the intent as thoughe Chryſte were not able to ſaue vs, or as though we myghte opteyne ſaluation by oure owne workes oute of the lawe. For thus foloweth it in Paull word to word: Thys teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I ſaye) whych afore was confyrmed to Chriſtward, is not dyſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or made of none effecte by the Lawe (whyche was geuen beyonde foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares ther after). For yf the enheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce be gotten by the Lawe, then is it not geuen by the promes. But God gaue it frely vnto Abraham by promes. Theſe are Pauls wordes, out of the which euery man maye vnderſtande, that to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion

               <p>But here myght one aſke: Seyng that<note place="margin">Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the ſaluation is clearly ynough expreſſed afore the law, and is aſcribed onely vnto the grace of God, why woulde God then adde the lawe? why was he not contente wyth the Teſtament alone? Therfore fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth<note place="margin">Anſwere,</note> it nowe in Paull. Why then ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the lawe? It was added bycauſe of tranſgreſſion, tyll the ſede came that was promiſed. Theſe are Pauls wordes why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are thus to be vnderſtande. The lawe was not geuen becauſe of the promes to make it of none effecte, and to teache that men are ſaued by workes, and not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the grace and free lyberalyte of God: but it was geuen becauſe of tranſgreſſion that is to ſaye, becauſe that the people of God in Egypte hadde tranſgreſſed the<note place="margin">why the lawe was geuen.</note> waye and truethe of theyr Fathers, and knewe nomore what was ſynne, ryghte or vnryghte, wherein ſtode ſaluacion or dampnation: for they were corrupte tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the longe dwellynge amonge the Ydolaters of Egypte. Therfore dyd God ordeyne them the Lawe, oute of the why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they myghte lerne the wyll of God, what Synne, ryghte or vnryghte is,
<pb facs="tcp:11958:34"/>
and to know them ſelues, to go in to them ſelues, and to conſydre, how that the holy workes wyche God requyreth, are not in theyr owne power, for the whych cauſe all the worlde haue greate nede of a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure. And thus the lawe was geuen to furthur the promes, namely that we tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the lawe myghte be led onely vnto Chryſte. For thus folowethe it in Pauls wordes. And it was geuen of Aungels by the hande of the mediatoure. A mediatour is not a Mediatour of one onely, but god is one. Is the lawe then agaynſte the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſes of God? God forbyd. Howbeit yf there had bene geuen a law whych coulde haue geuen lyfe, then no doute ryghteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſhulde come of the law. But the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſhutte vp all vnder ſynne, that the promiſe ſhoulde come by the faythe on Jeſus Chryſte, geuen vnto them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue. Before fayth came (that is to ſay, Je<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in whome we beloue) we were kepte and ſhutte vp vnder the lawe, vnto the fayth whyche ſhulde afterwarde be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Thus was the lawe oure ſcolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vnto Chryſt, that we myght be made ryghteous by fayth. &amp;c. By theſe wordes of Paul may euery man vnderſtande now for what cauſe the lawe was geuen, and howe it is not contrary to the promes of the foreſayd ſede, but rather bryngeth vs from oure ſelues and from all creatures only vnto Jeſus Chriſt. The law therfore confyrmeth the fyrſte promes concernyng, the bleſſed ſede, &amp; teacheth that we opteyne

all ſaluacion in hym onely. Howbeit it is<note place="margin">The lawe is the rule to lyue by</note> alſo a rule of oure lyfe, enfourmynge vs what we ought to do, and what we ought to leaue vndone.

               <p>God alſo amonge hys people wrought many thynges, wherby he ſet the cauſe of Jeſus Chriſte clearly a fore the eyes of the people, as it is expreſſed afore by the lande of the Paſſeouer.

Where as doutleſſe the out<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward beholdynge of the braſen ſerpent, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not them that were poyſoned: but it was God, whiche wolde ſo declare, that hys ſonne ſhulde be hanged vpon a croſſe, to the intent that euery one whiche were poyſoned and defyled by the olde ſerpente and ſynne, ſhulde beleue in the ſonne of god, and lyue in hym. For ſo is it written, Sapien. xvi. They had a token of health<note place="margin">The bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> accordinge to the commaundemente. For who ſo conuerted, was not made whole by the outwarde thynge whiche he ſawe, but (by the) whiche art the reſtorer of health &amp; Sauiour of all. And yet ſaieth Chriſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re clearly. Joh. iii. And lyke as Moſes ſet vp the ſerpent in the wilderneſſe eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo muſt

the ſonne of man belifte vp, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beleueth in hym, ſhulde not periſhe, but haue eternall lyfe.</p>
               <p>And as touchyng thys, the holy Apoſtle Paul bringeth in another ſentence .i.
