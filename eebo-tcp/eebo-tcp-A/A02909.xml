            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>A.

Prince good: and the reason is, for that one euill man or disposition, is more easily amended by the example or perswasion of many good, then many euill by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of one good may become bettered: for instance whereof, <hi>Saul</hi> was a wicked King; yet by the Counsell of <hi>Samuel</hi> did he those things, which otherwise he would not haue done: on the other side, there is no Prince so good, that may not be seduced by wicked Counsellors.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Question. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N what part of the yeere (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the coniectures of the learned) was the world created?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> Concerning the resolution of this question, much controuersie hath arisen, as well betwixt seuerall Nations, as men: As among the Hebrewes, the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, the Arabians, the Egyptians, the Greekes and Latines: some conceiuing it to be created in the Summer, others in the Spring, others in Autumne; to which (as say some) <hi>Moses</hi> seemes to assent, where it is said in <hi>Genesis, Let the earth bring forth the greene herbe, and trees bring forth fruit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their kinde.</hi> The Egyptians thinke it was created in Summer; most in the Spring. Likewise they vary about the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and what houses they were created
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:28854:73"/>
in: some thinke when the Sunne was in <hi>Leo,</hi> the Moone in <hi>Cancer,</hi> and so of the rest. Which may be somewhat more confirmed by this necessary rule following, for the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Easter day, which is, As vpon the 10 day of the first moneth from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which is March, at the coniunction of the Sunne and the Moone, next the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall; the Paschall Lambe was chosen out of the flocke, and kept till the 14. day, or full Moone: so the tenth day of the first moneth, being Palm sunday, our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our entred into <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the 14 day suffered his passion; so as the next Sunday after the 14. day of the Moone or full Moon in the moneth of March is alwayes Easter day, and probable to confirme the former supposition.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But of this what shall I determine?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That by the wisedome, mercy, and goodnesse of God it was created, in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of time, in what part his wisedome thought most meet: the admirable compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and frame whereof, that wee daily contemplate and behold with the eyes of our vnderstanding, with the diuersity and distinction of all the creatures therein; they and all these for the seuerall vses and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:28854:73"/>
of man, and man onely for the seruice of God.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Wherefore then, since the world was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made for man, (for man onely knowes the vs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>on earth, contracted from the length of many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits to a span-long, in comparison of the trebled date and extension of bruit beasts, senslesse and irrationall creatures; as the Hart, the Daw, the Oake, Rauens, Rockes, and such like, most of which haue trebled dates beyond the short pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of mans life? For concerning the Hart, one of the most doubtfull, of whons notwithstanding Hist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from the graue of the wombe, to the wombe of the graue, cut downe like a flower, as these ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses seeme to import</hi>:

                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore this inequality considered, may it not be thought iniustice and wrong to man in this disposure? and if not, by what consequent or reason may he settle his appeasement?</hi> For as the Poet:
<q>
                        <l>If death destroy vs quite; we haue great wrong,</l>
                        <l>Since for our seruice al things else were wrought,</l>
                        <l>That Dawes, and Trees, and Rockes, should last so long,</l>
                        <l>When we must at an instant turne to naught.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By this, Because the wise Creator fore-saw that these in their dislolution, though neuer so long protracted, should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together perish, but man at his end should but renew a better, nay an immortall life: and therefore what he is abridged of here, he hath amends for hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Wherein consists the naturall life of man,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:28854:74"/>
that it so soone doth cease, and so quickly wheele off from the thing of so vnstable continuance?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In heat and moisture, which daily wasting themselues to keep life afoot, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine daily replenished in vs by our meat and drinke; for by our meat is our naturall heat maintained, and by our drinke the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall moisture daily replenished.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why should the Epicure then say,</hi> Let vs eate and drinke, for to morrow wee shall dye, <hi>when by eating and drinking, our life is strengthened and renewed? and why may not the life of man by this moderate and seasonable supplie, be preserued continually, at least-wise the life of our fore-fathers</hi>?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because as the Sea hath bounds which it cannot passe, so is there to euery life a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod set, <hi>Hitherto shalt thou come, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>: which though it may be shortened, as it is in the Psalme, <hi>The bloud-thirsty and deceitfull man shall not liue forth halfe his daies,</hi> yet can it in no wise be prolonged further, at leastwise prorogued euer: for set all other aduersaries aside, Time it selfe shall at last bring in age, whose antipathy shalbe such, that it shal quench thy heat, and dry vp thy moisture; for be thou neuer so well fenced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comes death at last, and with a little pinne
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:28854:75"/>
bores thorow thy Castle wall, and farewell man: But of this formerly more at large.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What were the opinions of the Egyptian Sages and Philosophers concerning the longitude or breuity of mans life? and whereupon did they ground their reasons?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They were conceited that men did liue according to the increasing or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the heart, some thinking the heart to grow and increase till 50. yeers, and that it did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> augment euery yeere 2. drachmes weight; &amp; grown to the full bignes, did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain diminish euery yeere as much, vntil it came to nothing, whereupon ensued death.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the opinions of some more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Physicians for the naturall length or short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof, vpon the dependencie of Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion either good or euill?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Some thinke that the more better complexion, as those of the Sanguine, bee long in growing old, because they haue much heat and humidity.</p>
                  <p>That the melancholy waxeth soone old, because they be cold and dry; and as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the feminine sex, they become sooner old then the masculine. <hi>Hipocrates</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that female children, in their mothers wombes are formed in seuen moneths, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:28854:75"/>
then after grow slowlier then men; but borne, grow faster, and become sooner wise, and sooner old, for the feeblenesse of their body and manner of life, being for the most part idle, is an inducement to old age.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Whether are the tall or low of stature, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the coniectures of some learned, of longest health or life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Some thinke the shortest statures, because their vitall spirits are more strong and nimble, imparting their liuelihood with more vigor in their shorter circuit, then in the more spacious compasse: others again that they are more durable, because the Cedar many times is sooner blasted with a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pest then the shrubs; others are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, that the taller limbes haue the more temperate humours and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that fumes not so much do offend the braine, because the stomacke and it are more separate: but howsoeuer we conclude these arguments of small validity, because Death lookes not so high, that hee passeth by the low, nor so low, that hee passeth by the high, but leuels equally at both alike, as that more high Prouidence guides the hand from which there is no euasion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:28854:76"/>Q. <hi>Whether were the yeeres of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
