         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vnequall shapes are a great head to a little necke, a
bigge bodie to a thinne buttocke, a large limbe to a
little foote, or any of these contraries, or where any
member suites not with the whole proportion of the

cleane drie Oates, or two parts Oates, and one

him betwixt fiue and sixe in the Morning, water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

eleauen: in the afternoone you shall dresse betwixt

prouender till sixe, then litter at eight, and giue foode
for all night. The night before he is ridden, you shall
at nine of the clocke at night take away his hay from
him, at foure of the clocke in the morning giue him a
handfull or two of Oats, which being eaten, turne him
vpon his snaffle, rubbe all his body and legs ouer with
dry clothes, then saddle him, and make him fit for
his exercise. Soone as he is cal'd for to be ridden,
wash his bit in faire water, and put it into his mouth
with all other things necessarie, draw vp his girths,
and see that no buckles hurt him: then lead him forth,
and as soone as he hath beene ridden, all sweating as

you shall euer when he hath beene ridden and

stable, and first rub him downe with cleane wisps, then
taking off his saddle, with a sword-blade whose edge
is rebated, you shall stroake his necke and body cleane
ouer, leauing no sweate nor filth that can be gotten
out; then clothe him vp &amp; set on the saddle, and walke
him forth as afore-said: after, order and diet him as
you doe other trauelling horses: dry Oates is his best
prouender if he be fat and full, and Oates and Beanes,
if he be poore, or subiect to loose his flesh quickely.</p>
                     <p>For your trauelling Horse,<note place="margin">Ordering of trauelling Horses.</note> you shall feede him
with the finest Hay in the Winter, and the sweetest
Grasse in Summer; his prouender would be dry Oates,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12310:20"/>
Beanes, Pease or Bread, according to his stomacke: in
the time of rest, halfe a pecke at a watring is sufficient;
in the time of his labour, as much as he will eate with
a good stomacke. When you trauaile him, water two
houres before you ride, then rubbe, dresse, and lastly
feede, then bridle vp, and let him stand a quarter of
an houre before you take his backe. Trauaile mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
in the morning, till his winde be rack'd, and his
limbes warmed, then after doe as your affaires re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
Be sure at night to water your Horse two miles
before you come to your iournyes end; then the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
you bring him to his Inne the better: walke not
nor wash not at all, the one doth beget colds, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
foundering in the feete or body, but set him vp
warme, well stopt, and soundly rubbed with cleane lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
giue no meat whilst the outward parts of your
Horse are hot or wet with sweate, as the eare roots,
the flanckes, the necke, or vnder his chaps, but being
dry, rubbe and feede him according to the goodnesse
of his stomacke. Change of foode begetteth a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
so doth the washing of the tongue or nostrils
with vinegar, wine and salt, or warme vrine. Stop not

If he be very fat scoure oft, if of reasonable state
scoure seldome, if leane then scoure but with a sweet

course, and let his foode be the finest, lightest, and
quickest of digestion that may be: the sweats are most

most naturall which is before he come into the stable.
Keepe his limbes with coole oyntments, and by no

well buckled together in euery member, short ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

                     <p>Now for the shape of your Bull;<note place="margin">The shape of the Bull.</note> he would be of a
sharpe and quicke countenance, his hornes the larger
the better, his necke fleshie, his belly long, straight and
slender, his members in generall long and large, his
forehead broad and curled, his eyes blacke and large,
his eares rough within, &amp; hayre like veluet, his muzell
large and broad at the vpper lip, but narrow and small
at the neather, his nosthrill crooked within, yet wide
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12310:37"/>
and open, his dew-lap extending from his neather lip
downe to his fore-boothes, large, side, thinne, and
hairy; his breast round and bigge, his shoulders large,
broad and deepe, his ribs broad and wide, his backe
straight and flat, euen to the setting on of his tayle,
which would stand high, his huckle-bones round and
fayre appearing; making his buttocks square, his thighs
round, his legs straight and short ioynted; his knees
round and big, his hooues or clawes long and hollow,
his tayle long and bush-haired, and his pyzell round,
and also well haired. These Bulles as they are for
breed,<note place="margin">The vse of the Bull.</note> so they are excellently good for the draught,
onely they naturally draw better single, like horses,
then in the yoake, like Oxen: the reason as I suppose
being, because they can very hardly be match't in an
equall manner.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Cow, you shall chuse her of the same
country with your Bull, and as neare as may be of one
peece and colour,<note place="margin">Of the Cow &amp; her shape.</note> onely her bagge or vdder would
euer be white, with foure teats and no more, her belly
would be round and large, her forehead broad and
smooth, and all her other parts such as are before
shewed in the male kinde.</p>
                     <p>The vse of the Cow is twofold,<note place="margin">Of her vse.</note> either for the Darie,
or for breed. The red Cow giueth the best milke, and
the blacke Cow bringeth forth the goodliest Calues.
The young Cow is the best for breed, yet they indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
old are not to be refused. That Cow which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
milke the longest is best for both purposes, for
she which goes long drie looseth halfe her profit,
and is lesse fit for teeming: for commonly they are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:12310:38"/>
subiect to feede, and that straineth the wombe or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix.</p>
                     <p>Now for Calues: there are two wayes of breeding
them:<note place="margin">Of Calues, and their nourishing.</note> the one, to let them runne with their Dams
all the yeere, which is best, and maketh the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
beast: the other, to take them from their Dams,
after their first sucking, and so bring them vp on the
fingar, with flotten Milke, the colde onely being taken
away and no more; for to giue a young Calfe hot
Milke is present death, or very dangerous. If your
Calfe bee calued in the fiue dayes after the change,
which is called the <hi>Prime,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> doe not reare it, for most
assuredly it will haue the Sturdie, therefore preserue
it onely for the Butcher; also, when you haue preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
those male Calues, which shall be Buls, then g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ld
the rest for Oxen, and the yonger they are guelt the
better. The best time for rearing of Calues, is from
<hi>Michaelmasse</hi> till <hi>Candlemasse.</hi> A Calfe would be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
with Milke twelue weekes, onely a fortnight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you weane it from Milke, let the Milke bee mixt
with water, after your Calfe hath drunke Milke one
moneth, you shall take the finest, sweetest, and softest
Hay you can get, and putting little wispes into clouen
stickes, place them so as the Calfe may come to them
and learne to eate Hay. After our <hi>Ladies</hi>-day, when
the weather is faire, you may turne your Calues to
grasle, but by no meanes let it be ranke, but short and
sweet, so that they may get it with some labour.</p>
                     <p>Now of the Oxe:<note place="margin">Of the Oxe, and his vse.</note> You shall vnderstand that the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
are the best and most profitable, both for draught
or feeding: for hee is the strongest to indure labour,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12310:38"/>
and best able to containe both flesh and tallow. Now
for his shape, it differeth nothing from that of the
Bull, onely his fare would bee smoth, and his belly
deeper. That Oxe is fittest for the yoake, which is
of gentlest nature, and most familier with the man. In
matching your Oxen for the yoake: let them as neare
as may be, be of one height, spirit and strength, for the
stronger will euer wrong the weaker, and the duller
will iniure him that is of free spirit, except the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be carefull to keepe the dull Oxe to his labour.
Oxen for the yoake, would by no meanes be put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their ordinarie pace: for violence in trauell
heats them, heate breeds surfet, and surfet those dise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which makes them vnapt to feed, or for any other
vse of goodnesse. Your Oxe for the yoake will labour
well with Barly-straw,<note place="margin">Of his food for labour.</note> or Pease straw, and for blend
fodder, which is Hay and Straw mixed together, hee
will desire no better feeding.</p>
                     <p>Now for your Oxe to feede,<note place="margin">Oxen to feed for the Butcher.</note> hee would as much as
might be, be euer of lusty and yong yeeres, or if old,
yet healthfull and vnbrused, which you shall know by
a good taile and a good pyzel, for if the haire of one
or both be lost, then hee is a waster and will be long in
feeding. If you see an Oxe doth licke himselfe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
it is a good signe that hee is market-able and will
feede, for it showes foundnesse, and that the beast ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a ioy in himselfe: yet whilst he so doth licke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
he feedeth not; for his owne pride hindereth him,
and therefore the husband-man will lay the Oxes
owne dung vpon his hide, which will make him leaue
licking and fall to his foode. Now if you goe to chuse
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12310:39"/>
a fat beast you shall handle his hindmost ribbe, and if
it be soft and loosel, ike downe, then it shewes the Oxe
is outwardly well fed; so doth soft huckell bones,
and a bigge nach round and knotty, if his cod be big
and full, it shewes hee is well tallowed, and so doth
the fat croppe behinde the shoulders: if it be a Cow,
then handle her nauell, and if that be bigge, round
and soft, sure shee is well tallowed. Many other obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations
there are, but they be so well knowne, and
common in mans vse, that they neede no curious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</p>
                     <p>Now for the preseruation of these Cattell in good
and perfect health.<note place="margin">To preserue Cattell in health.</note> It shall be meete that for the yong

                     <p>THese Barbs or Paps which grow vnder the tongues
of Cettell, and being inflamed doe hinder them

I am to write much in a

onely to my Countrymen the English, who desire to
know and learne their owne profit. Know then, that
whosoeuer will stocke himselfe with good Sheepe, must
looke vnto the nature of the Soyle in which he liueth:
for Sheepe, according to the Earth and Ayre in
which they liue, doe alter their natures and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
the barraine Sheepe becomming good in good
soiles, and the good Sheepe barraine in euill soiles.
If then you desire to haue Sheepe of a curious fine
Staple of Wooll,<note place="margin">Of staples of wooll.</note> from whence you may draw a thread
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12310:48"/>
as fine as silke, you shall see such in <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Lempster</hi> side, and other speciall parts of that
Countrie; in that part of <hi>Worstershire,</hi> ioyning vpon
<hi>Shropshire,</hi> and many such like places, yet these Sheep
are very little of bone, blacke faced, and beare a very
little burthen. The sheepe vpon <hi>Cotsall</hi> hils are of
better bone, shape and burthen, but their Staple is
courser and deeper. The Sheepe in that part of
<hi>Worstershire,</hi> which ioyneth on <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts of <hi>Warwickeshire,</hi> all <hi>Leycestershire, Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamshire,</hi>
most part of <hi>Northamptonshire;</hi> and that
part of <hi>Nottinghamshire</hi> which is exempt from the
Forrest of Sherwood, beareth a large boned Sheepe,
of the best shape and deepest Staple; chiefly if they
be Pasture Sheep; yet is their wooll much courser
then those of <hi>Cotsall. Lincolneshire,</hi> especially in the
Salt Marshes, haue the largest sheepe, but not the
best Wooll, for their legges and bellies are long and
naked, and their Staple is courser then any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
the Sheepe in <hi>Yorkeshire</hi> and so Northward, are
of reasonable bigge bone, but of a staple, rough and
hairy; and the <hi>VVel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they are both little and of worse staple; and indeed,
are praised onely in the dish, for they are the sweetest
Mutton.</p>
                     <p>If now, knowing the natures and properties of the
sheepe of euery Countrie,<note place="margin">Of the choice of Sheepe.</note> you goe about to stocke
your ground, bee sure to bring your Sheepe from a
worser Soyle to a better, and not from a better to a
worse. The Leare,<note place="margin">Of the Leare.</note> which is the earth on which a
Sheepe lyeth, and giueth him his colour, is much
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12310:49"/>
to bee respected: the red Leare is held the best, the
Duskish, inclining to a little rednesse, is tollerable, but
the white or durtie Leare starke naught. In the
choyce therefore of your Sheepe, chuse the biggest
boned, with the best wooll; the staple being soft, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
well curled, and close together, so that a man shall
haue much adoe to part it with his fingers. These
Sheepe, besides the bearing of the best burthen, are
alwayes the best Butchers ware, and goe soonest
away in the Market. Therefore, in the choyse of Sheep
for your breed, haue a principall respect to your
Rammes, for they euer marre or make a flocke: let
them then, as neere as you can, haue these properties
or shapes.<note place="margin">The shape of a Sheepe.</note> First, large of body in euery generall

beene seene to kill those Sheepe which haue the largest
hornes and best wrinkled: a Sheepe would haue a
large vpright necke, somewhat bending like the necke
of a Horse, a very broad backe, round buttockes, a
thicke taile, and short iointed legges, small, cleane
and nimble; his wooll would be thicke, and deepe,
couering his body and belly all ouer; also, all his

feed or take their rest, which they please: this
chasing, first, beateth away mill-dewes, and all other
dewes from the earth, as also those webbes, kelles,
and flakes which lying on the earth, and a sheepe-licking

stirreth vp that naturall heate in a sheepe, which drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vp, and wasteth the abundance of moysture,
which else would turne to rottennesse. Besides, a
sheepe being thus chased and wearied, will fall to his
food more deliberately, and not with such greedinesse
as otherwise he would, and also make choyce of
that meat which is best for his health. If a shepheard
once in a moneth, or alwaies when he hath occasion
to handle his sheepe, rubbe their mouthes with <hi>Bay

they will goe in places of the greatest danger. The

which is an excellent restoratiue, &amp; their Kids which

of winter, for that will make the shee Goate cast her
Kidde, or bring it forth vntimely. They loue Mast
well, but yet you must giue them other food to mixe
with it. The best time to let the male and female goe
together, is about the beginning of <hi>December.</hi> If you
house Goates in the winter, let them haue no litter to

many Sowes in a yard is not good for their increase,

which they will bring forth: for I haue knowne one

how many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

best, the rest cast away, or put to other Sowes which
want, yet giue sucke. A Sow will bring Pigs from one
yeere old till she be seauen yeeres old: The Pigs which
you reare after you haue chosen the best for Bores or
Sowes, to breed on, geld the rest both males and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males:
the males will make goodly Hogs, which are
excellent Bacon or Porke, and the females which are
called spayd-guilts, will doe the like; and breed a

comes that the Husbandman esteems onespayd Guilt

                     <p>Now for the preseruation of Swine, it is contayned
in their gouernment and food, and is all that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to the office of the Swineheard. The order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
feeding of Swine is (when you keepe them, but
in good state of body, and not seeke to fat them) in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12310:61"/>
the Morning earely when you vnstie them is to giue
them Draffe, Pulse, or other garbage, with swillings, in
their troughes, and when they haue eaten it, to driue
them to the field, where they may graze and roote for
their food: and of grounds the soft marish and moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
grounds are the best, where they may get the roots
of Sedge, Reeds, Rushes, Knot-grasse, and such like,
which is wholesome for Swine: and at the fall of the
Leafe it is good to driue them to hedges, where they
may get Hawes, Heps, Sloes, Crabs, or such like
fruit, which is also very wholesome: and the poorer
sort will gather these fruits, and keepe them safe to feed
their Swine with all the Winter. When Euening com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
you shall driue your Swine home, and then fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their troughes with Draffe and Swilling, let them
fill their bellies, and then stye them vp, so shall you
keepe them from doing other hurt or iniuries. If
once in a fortnight you mixe with your Swillings
some <hi>Radle,</hi> or red <hi>Oaker,</hi> it will preserue them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
from Meazels and all inward infections. And
thus much for the generall discourse of Swine: Now

is a great enemy to their breeding. A Henne
doth sit twenty one daies iust, and then hatcheth, but
Peacocks, Turkies, Geese, Ducks, and other water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowle
sit thirty: so that if you set your Henne, as you
may doe vpon any of their egges, you must set her
vpon them nine daies before you set her on her owne.
A Henne will couer nineteene egges well, and that is

together: It is good when you lay your egges first vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

then to watch the Henne, to see if she busie her selfe to
turne them from one side to the other, which if you

vnder her, be new and sound,<note place="margin">Choyse of Egges.</note> which you may know
by their heauinesse, fulnesse, and cleerenesse, if you
hold them vp betwixt the sunne and your eye-sight;
you must by no meanes, at any time raise your Henne
from her nest, for that will make her vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it.</p>
                     <p>Now, for helping a Henne to hatch her Egges, or
doing that which should be her office, it is vnnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
&amp; shalbe much better to be forborne then any way
vsed; or to make doubt of bringing forth, or to thinke
the Henne sitteth too long (as many foolish curious
housewifes doe) if you be sure you set her vpon sound
Egges, is as friuolous, but if you set her vpon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound
Egges, then blame your selfe, both of the losse
and iniurie done to the Henne in her losse of labour.
A Henne will be a good sitter from the second yeere
of her laying, to the fift, but hardly any longer: you
shall obserue euer when your Henne riseth from her
nest, to haue meate and water ready for her, least
strayning too far to seeke her foode, she let her Egges
coole too much, which is very hurtfull. In her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
you shall stirre vp the straw of her nest, and
make it soft and handsome, and lay the Egges in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as she left them: doe not in the election of your
Egges, chuse those which are monstrous great, for they
many times haue two yolks, and though some write,
that such Egs wilbring out two Chickens, yet they are
deceiued, for if they bring forth two, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
most abortiue and monstrous. To perfume the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12310:71"/>
nest with Brimstone is good, but with Rosemary is
much better. To set Hens in the winter time in stowes
or ouens is of no vse with vs in <hi>england,</hi> &amp; though they
may by that meanes bring forth, yet will the Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
be neuer good nor profitable, but like the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Lemon and Pomegranate trees, the fruit will
come a great deale short of the charges. When your
Henne at any time is absent from her nest, you must
haue great care to see that the Cocke come not to sit
vpon the Egges, (as he will offer to doe) for hee will
endanger to breake them, and make her loue her
nest worse.</p>

Chickins would haue no meate for two dayes) and
some shels being harder then other, they will take so
much distance of time in opening: yet vnlesse the
Chickins be weake, or the Henne rude, it is not amisse
to let them alone vnder her, for she will nourish them
most kindely: after two dayes is past, the first meat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

goe abroad with the Henne to worme, for that is very
wholesome: to choppe greene Chyues amongst your
Chickens meate will preserue them from the Rye, and
other diseases in the head; neither must you at any
time let your Chickens want water, for if they bee
forc'd to drinke in puddles, it will breede the Pippe:

very fat vnder their Dams: but if you will haue fat
cram'd Chickens, you shall coope them vp when the
Dame forsaketh them, and the best crammes for
them is Wheat-Meale and Milke, made into dough,
and then the crammes steeped in Milke, and so thrust
downe their throats; but in any case, let the crams
be small, and well wet, for choaking. Foureteene

them putrifie: and others will lay them in Salt, but
that makes them waste and diminish: the best way

leaue in the nest but the nest Egge, and no more; and
that would euer be in the after-noone when you haue

Hennes will by their cackling tell you when they haue

Cocke-chicken, you shall vnderstand, that the best
time to carue or gueld him, is, assoone as the Dame
haue left them, (if the stones become downe) or
else assoone as they beginne to crowe: for the Art of
caruing it selfe, it is both common and easie, yet much
sooner to bee learned by seeing one carued, then by
any demonstration in writing.</p>
                     <p>These Capons are of two vses:<note place="margin">A Capon to leade Chickens.</note> the one is, to lead
Chickens, Ducklings, young Turkies, Peahens, Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants
and Partridges, which hee will doe altogether,
both naturally and kindely, and through largenesse
of his body will brood or couer easily thirtie or thirty
and fiue; hee will lead them forth safely, and defend
them against Kites or Buzzards, more better then the
Hennes: therefore the way to make him to take to
them, is, with a fine small Briar, or else sharpe Nettles
at night, to beate and sting all his brest and neather
parts, and then in the darke to seate the Chickens vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, whose warmth taking away his smart, hee
will fall much in loue with them, and when so euer
hee proueth vnkinde, you must sting or beat him
againe,<note place="margin">Of feeding or cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</note> and this will make him hee will neuer forsake
them.</p>
                     <p>The other vse of Capons is, to feede for the Dish,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12310:72"/>
as eyther at the Barne dores, with craps of Corne
and the chauings of pulse, or else in Pennes in the
house, by cramming them, which is the most dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
The best way then to cramme a Capon (setting all
strange inuentions apart) is to take Barley-meale, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
sifted, and mixing it with new Milke, make it
into a good stiffe dough; then make it into long crams,
biggest in the midst, and small at both ends, and then
wetting them in lukewarme Milke, giue the Capon a
full gorgefull thereof three times a day, Morning,
Noone, and Night, and he will in three weekes bee as
fat as is fit for any man to eate. As for mixing their
cram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es with sweet Worte, Hogges-grease, or Sallet-Oyle,
they are by experience found to breede loath
in the Birds, and not to feede at all; onely keepe this
obseruation, not to giue your Capon new meat till
the first bee put ouer; and if you finde your Capon
hard of digestion, then you shall sift your meale finer,
for the finer your meale is, the sooner it will passe
through their bodies. And thus much for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.

For indeede, the infirmity is nothing else but a stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
vp of the nares, by meanes whereof the Hawke
not being able to cast and auoyde the corruption of
her head, it turnes to putrifaction, and in short space
kils the Hawke: and this disease is a great deale more
incident to short-wing'd Hawkes then to long. The
signes whereof are apparant by the stopping of the
nares. And the cure is to let your Hawke tyer much
vpon sinewie and bony meat, as the rumps of Mutton
(the fat being taken away) or the pynions of the wings
of fowle, either being well lapt in a good handfull of
<hi>Parsely,</hi> and forcing her to straine hard in the tearing
of the same, and with much diligence to cleanse and
wash her beake cleane with water after her feeding,
especially if her meate were warme and bloudie.</p>

To speake then first of the
nature of Bees; it is a creature gentle, louing, and
familiar about the man which hath the ordering of
them, so he come neate, sweet, and cleanely amongst
them; otherwise, if hee haue strong, and ill smelling
sauours about him, they are curst and malicious, and
will sting spitefully, they are exceeding industrious
and much giuen to labour: they haue a kinde of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
amongst themselues, as it were a well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
common-wealth: euery one obaying and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
their King or Commander, whose voyce (if
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:12310:90"/>
you lay your eare to the Hiue) you shall distinguish
from the rest, being louder and greater, and beating
with a more solemne measure. They delight to liue
amongst the sweetest Hearbs and Flowers that may
be; especially, Fenell, and Walgilly-flowers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their best dwellings are in Gardens: and in these
Gardens, or neere adioyning thereunto, would be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Fruit trees growing, chiefely Plumbe trees, or
Peach trees, in which, when they cast, they may knit,
without taking any farre flight, or wandering to finde
out their rest: this garden also would be well fenced,
that no Swine nor other Cattell may come therein,
as well for ouerthrowing their Hiues, as also for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them with other ill sauours. They are also very
tender, and may by no meanes endure any colde:
whence you must haue a great respect to haue their
houses exceeding warme, close, and tight, both to
keepe out the frosts and snowes, as also the wet and
raine; which, if it once enter into the Hiue, it is a
present destruction.</p>
                     <p>To speake then of the Bee-hiue, you shall know
there bee diuers opinions touching the same,<note place="margin">Of the Bee-Hiue.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the customes and natures of Countries; for
in the Champaine Countries, where there is very little
store of woods, they make their Hiues of long Rye-straw,
the roules being sowed together with Briers;
and these Hiues are large and deepe, and euen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
like a Sugar-loafe, and crosse-bard within,
with flat splints of wood, both aboue and vnder the
middest part: in other Champaine Countries, where
there wanteth Rie-straw, they make them of Wheat-straw,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:12310:90"/>
as in the West countries: and these Hiues are of
a good compasse, but very low and flat, which is
nought: for a Hiue is euer better for his largenesse,
and keepeth out rayne best, when it is sharpest. In the
wood-Countries they make them of clouen hassels
watteld about broad splints of Ash, and so formed
as before I said, like a <hi>Sugar-loafe.</hi> And these Hiues
are of all other the best, so they be large and smooth
within; for the straw Hiue is subiect to breed Mice,
and nothing destroyeth Bees sooner then they, yet
you must be gouerned by your ability, and such
things as the soyle affoords.</p>
                     <p>Now for the wood-Hiue,<note place="margin">The trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Hiue.</note> which is the best, you shall
thus trimme and prepare it for your Bees: you shall
first make a stiffe morter of Lime, and Cow-dung,
mixed together; and then hauing crosse-barred the
Hiue within, dawbe the outside of the Hiue with the
morter, at least three inches thicke, downe close vnto
the stone, so that not the least ayre may not come in:
then taking a Rye-sheafe, or Wheat-sheafe that is new
thresh't, and binding the eares together in one lumpe,
put it ouer the Hiue, and so as it were thach it all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and fixe it close to the Hiue with an old hoope, or
garth, and this will keepe the Hiue inwardly as warme
as may be: also before you lodge any Bee in your
Hiue, you shall perfume it with <hi>Iuniper,</hi> and rubbe it
all within with <hi>Fenell, Isop,</hi> and <hi>Time-flowers,</hi> and also
all the stone vpon which the Hiue shall stand.</p>
                     <p>Now for the placing of your Hiues,<note place="margin">The placing of Hiues.</note> you shall take
three long thicke stakes, cut smooth, and plaine vpon
the heads, and driue them into the earth triangular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:12310:91"/>
so that they may be about two foote aboue the
ground: then lay ouer them a broad smooth pauing-stone,
which may extend euery way ouer the stakes
about halfe a foot, and vpon that stone set your Hiue,
being lesse in compasse then the stone by more then six
inches euery way; and see that the dore of your Hiue
stand directly vpon the rising of the Morning-Sunne
inclining a little vnto the South-ward: and be sure to
haue your Hiues well sheltred from the North-winds,
and generally from all tempestuous weather: for which
purpose if you haue sheds to draw ouer them in the
Winter, it is so much the better. And you shall place
your Hiues in orderly rowes one before another,
keeping cleane Allies betweene them euery way,
so as you may walke and view each by it selfe seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>

                        </gap>are after
Sunne-set to the Hiue, and if you heare the Master-Bee
aboue all the rest, in a higher and more solemne note,
or if you see them lye forth vpon the stone, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get into the Hiue; then be sure that stocke will
cast within few houres after. As soone as you perceiue
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12310:91"/>
the Swarme to rise, and are got vp into the ayre
(which will commonly be in the height and heat of
the Sunne) you shall take a brasse Bason, Pan, or Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticke,
and make a tingling noyse thereupon, and
they are so delighted with Musicke, that by the sound
thereof, they will presently knit vpon some branch
or bough of a tree. Then when they are all vpon one
cluster, you shall take a new sweet Hiue well drest, and
rub'd with <hi>Hony</hi> and <hi>Fenell,</hi> and shake them all into
the Hiue, then hauing spread a fayre sheete vpon the
ground, set the Hiue thereon, and couer it all cleane
ouer close with the sheete, and so let it stand till after
Sunne-set, at which time the Bees being gathered vp
to the top of the Hiue (as their nature is) you shall
set them vpon the stone (hauing rubd it well with <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi>)
and then dawbe it close round about with <hi>Lime</hi>
and <hi>Dung</hi> mixt together, and onely leaue them a dore
or two to issue out, and in at. There be some stockes
which will cast twice or thrice, and foure times in a
yeere, but it is not so good, for it will weaken the stocke
too much, therefore to keepe your stockes in strength
and goodnesse, it is good not to suffer any to cast aboue
twice at the most. Again, you shal with pieces of bricke
or other smooth stones, raise the stocke in the night
three or foure inches from the stone, and then dawbe
it close againe, and the Bees finding house-roome will
fall to worke within, and not cast at all; and then
will that stocke be worth two others; and in the same
manner, if you had the yeere before any small
swarmes, which are likely to cast this yeere; or if you
haue any earely Swarmes this yeere, which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12310:92"/>
to cast at the latter end of the yeere: both which
are often found to be the destruction of the stockes: in
either of these cases, you shall inlarge the Hiue as
is before said, by raysing it vp from the stone, and
it will not onely keepe them from casting, but make
the stocke better, and of much more profit, for that
Hiue euer which is of the most waight is of the
best price.</p>

touching the making of them, you shall vnderstand
that the grounds most fit to bee cast into Fish-ponds
are those which are either marish, boggie, or
full of Springs, and indeede most vnfit either for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
or any other vse of better profit. And of these
grounds, that which is full of cleare Springs will yeeld
the best water: that which is marish will feede Fish
best, and that which is boggy will best defend the Fish
from stealing. Hauing then such a piece of waste

part which you meane to make the head of your Pond,
which although it be the lowest part in the true leuell
of the ground, yet you must make it the highest to the
eye; you shall first cut the trench for your Flood-gate,
so as the water may haue a swift fall, when you
meane at any time to let it out; and then on each side
of the trench driue in great stakes of sixe foote in
length, and sixe inches in square, of Oake, Ashe, or
Elme, but Elme is the best: and these you must driue
in rowes within foure foote one of the other, at least
foure foot into the earth as broad, &amp; as farre off each
side the Floud-gate as you intend the head of your
Pond shall goe: then begin to dig your Pond of such
compasse as your ground will conueniently giue you
leaue, and all the earth you dig out of the Pond, you
shall carry &amp; throw amongst the stakes, and with strong
rammers ramme the earth hard betweene them till
you haue couered all the stakes; then driue in as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

then ramme more earth ouer and about them also;
and thus doe, with stakes aboue stakes, till you haue
brought the head and sides to such a conuenient

it is a most approued experiment, that if you take
bottles made of Hay, and greene Oziers, or Willow
mixt together, and sincke them downe into the midst
of your Pond, or by the banke sides, and so let them
rest two or three dayes, hauing a corde so fastened
vnto them that you may twitch them vpon land at

which are in the Pond will come into those Bottles,
and you shall take them most abundantly: and if
you please to bayte those bottles, by binding vp
Sheepes guttes, or other garbage of beasts within
them, the Eeles will come sooner, and you may then
draw them oftner, and with better assurance. There
be other wayes besides these to take Eeles, as with
Weeles, with the Eele-speare, or with bobbing for
them with great wormes; but they are so generally
knowne and practised, and so much inferiour to this
already shewed, that I hold it a needlesse and vaine
