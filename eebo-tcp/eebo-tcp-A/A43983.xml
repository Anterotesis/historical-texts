            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have heard exceeding highly commended a kinde of thing which I do not well understand, though it be much talkt of, by such as have not otherwise much to do, by the name of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> And the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by others as much despised and derided. So that I cannot tell whether it be good or ill, nor what to make of it, though I see many other men that thrive by it.</p>

               <p>I doubt not, but what so many do so highly praise must be very admirable, and what is derided and scorn'd by many, foolish and ridiculous. The honour and scorn fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth finally not upon Philosophy, but upon the Professors. Philosophy is <hi>The knowledge of Natural Causes.</hi> And there is no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but of Truth. And to know the true
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93813:5"/>
Causes of things, was never in contempt, but in admiration. Scorn can never fasten upon Truth. But the difference is all in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Teachers. Whereof some have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther studied, nor care for it, otherwise than as a Trade to maintain themselves or gain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; and some for Fashion, and to make themselves fit for ingenious Company: and their study hath not been meditation, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescence in the Authority of those Authors whom they have heard commended. And some (but few) there be, that have studied it for Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity, and the delight which commonly men have in the acquisition of Science, and in the mastery of difficult and subtil Doctrines. Of this last sort I count <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and a few others of the Ancients, and some few Moderns: and to these it is that properly belong the Praises which are given to Philosophy.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>If I have a minde to study (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Natural Philosophy) must I then needs read <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or some of those that now are in request?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>There's no necessity of it. But if in your own meditation you light upon a difficulty, I think 'tis no loss of time, to enquire what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men say of it, but to rely onely upon Reason. For though there be some few Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Nature (especially concerning the Heavens) whereof the Philosophers of old time have assigned very rational Causes, such
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93813:5"/>
as any man may acquiesce in, as of Eclipses of the Sun and Moon by long observation, and by the Calculation of their visible Motions; yet what is that to the numberless and quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature? Who is there amongst them or their Successors, that has sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied you with the Causes of Gravity, Heat, Cold, Light, Sense, Colour, Noise, Rain, Snow, Frost, Winds, Tides of the Sea, and a thousand other things which a few mens lives are too short to go through, and which you and other curious Spirits admire (as quotidian as they are) and fain would know the Causes of them, but shall not finde them in the Books of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalists; and when you ask what are the Causes of any of them, of a Philosopher now, he will put you off with mere words; which words, examined to the bottom, signifie not a jot more than I cannot tell, or Because it is: Such as are Intrinsecal quality, Occult quality, Sympathy, Antipathy, Antiperistasis, and the like. Which pass well enough with those that care not much for such wisdom, though wise enough in their own ways; but will not pass with you that ask not simply what's the Cause, but in what manner it comes about that such Effects are produced.</p>

               <p>That's Cozening. What need had they of that? When began they thus to play the <hi>Charletants?</hi>

               <p>Need had they none. But know you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93813:6"/>
not that men from their very birth, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, scramble for every thing they covet, and would have all the world, if they could, to fear and obey them? If by fortune or indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry one light upon a Secret in Nature, and thereby obtain the credit of an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knowing man, should he not make use of it to his own benefit? There is scarce one of a thousand but would live upon the charges of the people as far as he dares. What poor Geometrician is there, but takes pride to be thought a Conjurer? what Mountebank would not make a living out of a false opinion that he were a great Physician? And when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them are once engaged in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of an Errour, they will joyn together for the saving of their Authority to decry the Truth.</p>

               <p>If we may give Credit to old Histories, the first that studyed any of the Natural Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were the Astronomers of <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> My Author is <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> accounted a very faithful Writer, who begins his History as high as is possible, and tells us that in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> were the first Astronomers; and that for their Predictions of Eclipses, and other Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Aspects of the Planets, they obtained of their King not onely Towns and Fields to a third part of the whole Land, but were also
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93813:6"/>
in such veneration with the People, that they were thought to have discourse with their Gods, which were the Stars; and made their Kings thereby to stand in awe of them, that they durst not either eat or drink but what and when they prescribed; no nor live, if they said the Gods commanded them to die. And thus they continued in subjection to their false Prophets, till by one of their Kings, called <hi>Ergamenes,</hi> (about the time of the <hi>Ptolemies)</hi> they were put to the Sword. But long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of <hi>Ergamenes,</hi> the Race of these Astrologers (for they had no Disciples but their own Children) was so numerous, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of them (whether sent for or no I cannot tell) transplanted themselves into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and there also had their Cities and Lands allowed them, and were in request not onely for Astronomy and Astrologie, but also for Geometry. And <hi>Egypt</hi> was then as it were an University to all the world, and thither went the curious Greeks, as <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Thales,</hi> and others, to fetch Philosophy into <hi>Greece.</hi> But long before that time, abundance of them went into <hi>Assyria,</hi> and had their Towns and Lands assigned them also there; and were by the <hi>Hebrews</hi> called <hi>Chaldies.</hi>

               <p>Why so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell; but I finde in <hi>Martinius</hi> Lexicon they were called <hi>Chasdim,</hi> and <hi>Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim,</hi> and (as he saith) from one <hi>Chesed</hi> the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93813:7"/>
son of <hi>Nachor;</hi> but I finde no such man as <hi>Chesed</hi> amongst the issue of <hi>Noah</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Nor do I finde that there was any certain Country called <hi>Chaldaea;</hi> though a Town where any of them inhabited were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led A Town of the <hi>Chaldies. Martinius</hi> saith further, that the same word <hi>Chasdim</hi> did signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie also <hi>Demons.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>By this reckoning I should conjecture they were called <hi>Chusdim,</hi> as being a Race of <hi>Ethiopians.</hi> For the Land of <hi>Chus</hi> is <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> and so the name degenerated first into <hi>Chul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim,</hi> and then into <hi>Chaldim;</hi> so that they were such another kinde of people as we call <hi>Gypsies;</hi> saving that they were admired and feared for their Knavery, and the Gypsies counted Rogues.</p>

But the <hi>Greeks</hi> that travelled (you say) into <hi>Egypt,</hi> what Philosophy did they carry home?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The Mathematiques and Astronomy. But for that sublunary Physiques, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> I have not read of any Nation that studied it earlier than the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from whom it proceeded to the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93813:7"/>
                  <hi>Romans.</hi> Yet both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were more addicted to Moral than to Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy; in which kinde we have their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but loosly and incoherently, written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other Principles than their own Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Presumptions, without any respect to the Laws of Common-wealth, which are the ground and measure of all true Morality. So that their Books tend rather to teach men to censure than to obey the Laws. Which has been a great hinderance to the Peace of the Western world ever since. But they that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously applied themselves to Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy were but few, as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whose Works we have; and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> whose Doctrine we have in <hi>Lucretius.</hi> The Writings of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolaus</hi> and many other curious Students being by fire or negligence now lost: though the Doctrine of <hi>Philolaus</hi> concerning the Motion of the Earth have been revived by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> and explained and confirmed by <hi>Galileo</hi> now of late.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But methinks the Natural Philosophy of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the rest, should have been cultivated and made to flourish by their Disciples.</p>

               <p>Whom do you mean, the Successors of <hi>Plato, Epicurus, Aristotle,</hi> and the other first Philosophers? It may be some of them may have been learned and worthy men. But not long after, and down to the time of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93813:8"/>
and his Apostles, they were for the most part a sort of needy, ignorant, impudent chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fellows, who by the profession of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of those first Philosophers, got their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. For at that time, the name of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy was so much in fashion and honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst great persons, that every rich man had a Philosopher of one Sect or another to be a Schoolmaster to his Children. And these were they that faining Christianity, with their disputing and readiness of talking got them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into Christian Commons, and brought so many Heresies into the Primitive Church, every one retaining still a tang of what they had been us'd to teach.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But those Heresies were all condemned in the first Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>

               <p>Yes. But the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie for a long time flourished no less than the <hi>Roman,</hi> and was upheld by divers Emperours, and never fully extinguished as long as there were <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> in Christendom. Besides, there arose daily other Sects, opposing their Philosophy to the Doctrine of the Councils concerning the Divinity of our Saviour; as, how many Persons he was, how many Natures he had. And thus it continued till the time of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> when he and Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the third divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Power of the Empire into Temporal and Spiritual.</p>

               <p>A very unequal division.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Why? Which of them think you had the greater share?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt, the Emperour: For he onely had the Sword.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>When the Swords are in the hands of men, whether had you rather command the Men or the Swords?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I understand you. For he that hath the hands of the Men, has also the use both of their Swords and strength.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The Empire thus divided into Spiritual and Temporal, the freedom of Philosophy was to the power Spiritual very dangerous. And for that cause it behoved the Pope to get Schools set up not onely for Divinity, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for other Sciences, especially for Natural Philosophy. Which when by the power of the Emperour he had effected, out of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Metaphysicks with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, there arose a new Science called <hi>School-Divinity;</hi> which has been the principal Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of these <hi>Western</hi> parts from the time of <hi>Charlemain</hi> till of very late.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But I finde not in any of the Writings of the School-men in what manner, from the causes they assigne, the Effect is naturally and necessarily produced.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You must not wonder at that. For you enquire not so much, when you see a change of any thing, what may be said to be the cause of it, as how the same is generated; which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93813:9"/>
generation is the entire progress of Nature from the efficient cause to the Effect produced. Which is always a hard Question, and for the most part impossible for a man to answer to. For the alterations of the things we perceive by our five Senses are made by the motion of Bodies (for the most part) either for distance, smalness, or transparence, invisible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But what need had they then to assigne any cause at all, seeing they could not shew the Effect was to follow from it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The Schools (as I said) were erected by the Pope and Emperour, but directed by the Pope onely, to answer and confute the Heresies of the Philosophers. Would you have them then betray their Profession and Authority, that is to say, their Livelihood, by confessing their ignorance? Or rather uphold the same, by putting for causes, strange and unintelligible words; which might serve well enough not onely to satisfie the people whom they relied on, but also to trouble the Philosophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to finde a fault in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Seeing you say that Alteration is wrought by the Motion of <hi>Bodies,</hi> pray tell me first what I am to understand by the word <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is a hard Question, though most men think they can easily answer it, as that it is whatsoever they can see, feel, or take notice of by their Senses. But if you will know indeed what is body, we must enquire first what there
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93813:9"/>
is that is <hi>not Body.</hi> You have seen (I suppose) the Effects of Glasses, how they multiply and magnifie the Object of our sight; as when a Glass of a certain Figure will make a Counter or a Shilling seem twenty, though you be well assured there is but one. And if you set a mark upon it, you will finde the mark upon them all. The Counter is certainly one of those things we call Bodies: Are not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers so too?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>No, without doubt. For looking through a Glass cannot make them really more than they are.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What then be they but fancies, so many fancies of one and the same thing in several places?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis manifest they are so many Idols, mere Nothings.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>When you have look'd upon a Star or Candle with both your eyes, but one of them a little turn'd awry with your finger, has not there appeared two Stars, or two Candles? And though you call it a deception of the sight, you cannot deny but there were two I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the Object.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, and observed by all men. And the same I say of our faces seen in Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses, and of all Dreams, and of all Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of dead mens Ghosts; and wonder, since 'tis so manifest, I never thought upon't before, for it is a very happy encounter, and such as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93813:10"/>
being by every body well understood, would utterly destroy both Idolatry and Superstition, and defeat abundance of Knaves that cheat and trouble the world with their devices.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But you must not hence conclude that whosoever tells his Dream, or sometimes takes his direction from it, is therefore an Idolater, or Superstitious, or a Cheater. For God doth often admonish men by Dreams of what they ought to do; yet men must be wary in this case that they trust not Dreams with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their lives further than by the Laws of their Country is allow'd: For you know what God says, Deut. 13. <hi>If a Prophet or a Dreamer of Dreams give thee a signe or a wonder, and the signe come to pass, yet if he did thee serve other Gods, let him be put to death.</hi> Here by serving other Gods (since they had chosen God for their King) we are to understand revolting from their King, or disobeying of his Laws. Otherwise I see no Idolatry nor Superstition in following a Dream, as many of the Patriarches (in the Old Testament) and of the Saints (in the New Testament) did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes: Their own Dreams. But when another man shall dream, or say that he has dream'd, and require me to follow that, he must pardon me if I ask him by what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, especially if he look I should pay him for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But if commanded by the Laws you live
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93813:10"/>
under, you ought to follow it. But when there proceed from one Sound divers Echoes, what are those Echoes? And when with fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers cross'd you touch a small Bullet, and think it two; and when the same Herb or Flower smells well to one and ill to another, and the same at several times, well and ill to your self, and the like of Tastes, what are those Echoes, Feelings, Odours, and Tastes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis manifest they are all but Fancies. But certainly when the Sun seems to my eye no bigger than a Dish, there is behinde it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where somewhat else (I suppose a real Sun) which creates those fancies, by working (one way or other) upon my eyes, and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of my Senses, to cause that diversity of Fancy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You say right; and that is it I mean by the word Body, which briefly I define to be any thing that hath a Being in it self, without the help of Sense.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> (I think) meaneth by Body, <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Subjectum,</hi> wherein Colour, Sound, and other Fancies are (as he says) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent. For the word Essence has no affinity with <hi>Substance.</hi> And <hi>Seneca</hi> says, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands it not. And no wonder: for Essence is no part of the Language of mankinde, but a word devised by Philosophers out of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of two names, as if a man having two Hounds could make a third (if 'twere need) of ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Tis just fo. For having said in themselves (for example) <hi>A Tree is a Plant,</hi> and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well enough what is the signification of those Names, knew not what to make of the word <hi>Is</hi> that couples those Names; nor daring to call it a Body, they called it by a new name, (derived from the word <hi>est) Essentia,</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia,</hi> deceived by the Idiome of their own Language. For in many other Tongues, and namely in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> there is no such Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative. They thought the Names of things sufficiently connected, when they are placed in their natural consequence; and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never troubled with Essences, nor other Fallacy from the Copulative <hi>Est.</hi>

               <p>THis History of the old Philosophers has not put me out of love, but out of hope of Philosophy from any of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.

               <p>Your desire (you say) is to know the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93813:11"/>
Causes of the Effects or <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature; and you confess they are Fancies, and (conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) that they are in your self; so that the Causes you seek for onely are without you, and now you would know how those external Bodies work upon you to produce those <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena.</hi> The beginning therefore of your enquiry ought to be at <hi>What it is you call a Cause,</hi> I mean an <hi>Efficient Cause:</hi> For the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers make four kindes of Causes, whereof the <hi>Efficient</hi> is one. Another they call the Formal Cause, or simply the form or essence of the thing caused; as when they say, Four equal Angles and four equal Sides are the Cause of a Square Figure, or that Heaviness is the Cause that makes heavie Bodies to descend. But that's not the Cause you seek for, nor any thing but this: <hi>It descends because it descends.</hi> The third is the Material Cause, as when they say, The Walls and Roof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of a house, are the cause of a House. The fourth is the Final Cause, and hath place onely in Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>We will think of Final Causes upon some other occasion; of Formal and Material not at all: I seek onely the Efficient, and how it acteth from the beginning to the production of the Effect.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I say then, that in the first place you are to enquire diligently into the nature of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the variations of Fancies, or (which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93813:12"/>
is the same thing) of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have all of them one Universal Efficient Cause, namely the variety of Motion. For if all things in the world were absolutely at rest, there could be no variety of Fancy, but living Creatures would be without sense of all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which is little less than to be dead.</p>

               <p>What if a Childe new taken from the Womb should with open eyes be exposed to the Azure-Sky, do not you think it would have some sense of the Light, but that all would seem unto him Darkness?</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, if he had no memory of any thing formerly seen, or by any other sense perceived (which is my supposition) I think he would be in the dark. For Darkness is Darkness, whether it be black or blue, to him that cannot distinguish.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Howsoever that be, it is evident enough that whatsoever worketh is moved: for Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Motion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Having well considered the nature of Motion, you must thence take your Principles for the foundation and beginning of your Enquiry.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Explain as fully and as briefly as you can what you constantly mean by Motion; which will save your self as well as others from being seduced by Aequivocation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Then I say, Motion is nothing but change
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93813:12"/>
of place: For all the Effect of a Body upon the Organs of our Senses is nothing but Fancy. Therefore we can fancy nothing from seeing it moved, but change of place.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis right. But you must then tell me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so what you understand by <hi>Place:</hi> For all men are not yet agreed on that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Well then; seeing we fancy a Body, we cannot but fancy it somewhere. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think Place is the fancy of <hi>Here</hi> or <hi>There.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That is not enough. <hi>Here</hi> and <hi>There</hi> are not understood by any but your self, except you point towards it. But pointing is no part of a Definition. Besides, though it help him to finde the Place, it will never bring him to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But seeing Sense is Fancy, when we fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy a Body, we fancy also the Figure of it, and the space it fills up. And then I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Place to be <hi>The precise space within which the Body is contained.</hi> For <hi>Space</hi> is also part of the Image we have of the Object seen.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>And how define you Time?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>As Place is to a Body, so (I think) is Time to the Motion of it; and consequently I take <hi>Time</hi> to be our fancy or Image of the Motion. But is there any necessity of so much niceness?</p>

               <p>Yes. The want of it is the greatest, if not the onely cause, of all the discord amongst Philosophers, as may easily be perceived by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93813:13"/>
their abusing and confounding the names of things that differ in their nature; as you shall see when there is occasion to recite some of the Tenets of divers Philosophers.</p>

               <p>I will avoid Aequivocation as much as I can. And for the nature of Motion, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I understand it by the Definition. What is next to be done?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You are to draw from these Definitions, and from whatsoever Truth else you know by the light of Nature, such general Consequences as may serve for Axiomes, or Principles of your Ratiocination.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That is hard to do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I will draw them my self, as many as for our present discourse of Natural Causes we shall have need of; so that your part will be no more than to take heed I do not deceive you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I will look to that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>My first Axiome then shall be this:</hi> Two Bodies, at the same Time, cannot be in one Place.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That's true: For we number Bodies as we fancy them distinct, and distinguish them by their Places. You may therefore adde, <hi>Nor one Body at the same time in two Places.</hi> And Philosophers mean the same, when they say, <hi>There is no penetration of Bodies.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But they understand not their own words: For penetration signifies it not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:93813:13"/>
My second Axiome is, That <hi>nothing can begin, change, or put an end to its own Motion.</hi> For supposing it begin just now, or being now in Motion, change its Way or Stop; I require the Cause why <hi>now</hi> rather than <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after,</hi> having all that is necessary to such Motion, Change, or Rest, alike at all times.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I do not doubt but the Argument is good in Bodies inanimate; but perhaps in Voluntary Agents it does not hold.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>How it holds in Voluntary Agents we will then consider when our Method hath brought us to the Powers and Passions of the minde.</p>
               <p>A third Axiome shall be this: <hi>Whatsoever Body being at Rest is afterwards moved, hath for its Immediate Movent some other Body which is in Motion and toucheth it.</hi> For, since nothing can move it self, the Movent must be external. And because Motion is change of place, the Movent must put it from its place, which it cannot do till it touch it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That is manifest, and that it must more than touch it, it must also follow it. And if more parts of the Body are moved than are by the Movent touched, the Movent is not Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate. And by this reason, a continued Body though never so great, if the first Superficies be prest never so little back, the Motion will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed through it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think that to be impossible? I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93813:14"/>
will prove it from your own words: For you say that the Movent does then touch the Body which it moveth. Therefore it puts it back; But that which is put back, puts back the next behinde, and that again the next; and so onward to any distance, the body being continued. The same is also manifest by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, seeing one that walks with a Staff can distinguish (though blinde) between Stone and Glass; which were impossible, if the parts of his Staff between the ground and his hand made no resistance. So also he that in the silence of the night lays his Ear to the ground, shall hear the treading of mens feet further than if he stood upright.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>This is certainly true of a Staff or other hard Body, because it keeps the Motion in a straight Line from diffusion. But in such a Fluid Body as the Air, which being put back must fill an Orb, and the further it is put back, the greater Orb, the Motion will decrease, and in time, by the resistance of Air to Air, come to an end.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That any Body in the world is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at Rest, I think not true: But I grant, that in a space filled every where with Body, though never so Fluid, if you give Motion to any part thereof, that Motion will by resistance of the parts moved, grow less and less, and at last cease; but if you suppose the space utterly void, and nothing in it, then whatsoever is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93813:14"/>
once moved shall go on eternally: Or else that which you have granted is not true, <hi>viz. That nothing can put an end to its own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But what mean you by resistance?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Resistance is <hi>the Motion of a Body in a way wholly or partly contrary to the way of its Movent, and thereby repelling or retarding it.</hi> As when a man runs swiftly, he shall feel the Motion of the Air in his face. But when two hard Bodies meet, much more may you see how they abate each others Motion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound from one another. For in a space alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy full, the Movent cannot, in an instant, be communicated through the whole depth of the Body that is to be moved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What other Definitions have I need of?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>In all Motion, as in all Quantity, you must take the beginning of your reckoning from the least supposed Motion. And this I call the <hi>first Endeavour of the Movent;</hi> which <hi>Endeavour,</hi> how weak soever, is also Motion. For if it have no Effect at all, neither will it do any thing though doubled, trebled, or by what number soever multiplied: For Nothing, though multiplied, is still Nothing. Other Axiomes and Definitions we will take in, as we need them, by the way.</p>

               <p>Is this all the preparation I am to make?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No, you are to consider also the several kinds and properties of Motion, <hi>viz.</hi> when a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93813:15"/>
Body being moved by one or more Movents at once, in what way it is carried, straight, circular, or otherwise crooked; and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of swiftness; as also the action of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, whether Trusion, Vection, Percussion, Reflexion, or Refraction; and further you must furnish your self with as many experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (which they call <hi>Phaenomenon)</hi> as you can. And supposing some Motion for the Cause of your <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> try if by evident Consequence, without contradiction to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifest truth or experiment, you can derive the Cause you seek for from your Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. If you can, 'tis all that is expected (as to that one Question) from Philosophy. For there is no Effect in Nature which the Author of Nature cannot bring to pass by more ways than one.</p>

               <p>What I want of Experiments you may supply out of your own store, or such Natural History as you know to be true; though I can be well content with the knowledge of the Causes of those things which every Body sees commonly produced.

               <p>We will begin with that which is the most universal, the Universe, and enquire in the first place, if any place be absolutely <hi>empty,</hi> that is to say in the language of Philosophers, whether there be any <hi>Vacuum</hi> in Nature.</p>

               <p>'TIs hard to suppose, and harder to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Infinite and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Creator of all things should make a work so vast as is the world we see, and leave a few little spaces with nothing at all in them; which put altogether in respect of the whole Creature, would be insensible.</p>

               <p>Why not? For in so great an Agitation of Natural Bodies, may not some small parts of them be cast out, and leave the places em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty from whence they were thrown?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Because he that created them is not a Fancy, but the most real substance that is; who being Infinite, there can be no place em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty where he is, nor full where he is not.</p>

               <p>'Tis hard to answer this Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I do not remember that there is any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the maintenance of <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the writings of Divines: Therefore I will quit that Argument, and come to another. If you take a Glass Vial with a narrow neck, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

suckt it, dip it presently at the neck into a bason of water, you shall manifestly see the water rise into the Vial. Is not this a certain signe that you had suckt out some of the Air, and consequently that some part of the Vial was left empty?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No: For when I am about to suck, and have Air in my mouth, contracting my Cheeks I drive the same against the Air in the Glass, and thereby against every part of the sides of the hard Glass. And this gives to the Air within an Endeavour outward, by which (if it be presently dipt into the water) it will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate and enter into it. For Air if it be prest will enter into any Fluid, much more into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Therefore there shall rise into the Vial so much water as there was Air forced into the Bason.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>From many, and such as to almost all men are known and familiar. If two hard Bodies,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93813:16"/>
flat and smooth, be joyned together in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Superficies parallel to the Horizontal Plain, you cannot without great force pull them asunder, if you apply your force perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly to the common Superficies: But if you place that common Superficies erect to the Horizon, they will fall asunder with their own weight. From whence I argue thus: Since their Contiguity, in what posture soever, is the same, and that they cannot be pull'd asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by a perpendicular force without letting in the ambient Air in an instant, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible; or almost in an instant, which is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult: and on the other side, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Superficies is erect, the weight of the same hard Bodies are able to break the Contiguity, and let in the Air successively, it is manifest that the difficulty of Separation proceeds from this, that neither Air nor any other Body can be moved to any (how small soever) distance in an instant; but may easily be moved (the hardness at the sides once mastered) successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So that the Cause of this difficulty of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is this, that they cannot be parted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Air or other matter can enter and fill the space made by their diremption. And if they were infinitely hard, not at all. And hence also you may understand the Cause why any hard Body, when it is suddenly broken, is heard to crack; which is the swift Motion of the Air to fill the space between.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:93813:17"/>
Another Experiment, and commonly known, is of a Barrel of Liquor, whose Tap-hole is very little, and the Bung so stopt as to admit no Air; for then the Liquor will not run: but if the Tap-hole be large it will, because the Air prest by a heavier Bodie will pierce through it into the Barrel. The like reason holds of a Gardeners Watering-pot, when the holes in the bottom are not too great. A third Experiment is this: Turn a thin Brass kettle the bottom upwards, and lay it flat upon the Water. It will sink till the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rise within to a certain height, but no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Yet let the bottom be perforated, and the Kettle will be full and sink, and the Air rise again through the water without. But if a Bell were so laid on, it would be fill'd and sink, though it were not perforated, because the weight is greater than the weight of the same bulk of water.</p>

               <p>By these Experiments, without any more, I am convinced, that there is not actually in Nature any <hi>Vacuum;</hi> but I am not sure but that there may be made some little place empty, and this from two Experiments, one whereof is <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricellius</hi> his Experiment, which is this: Take a Cylinder of Glass, hollow throughout, but close at the end, in form of a Sack.</p>

               <p>As broad as you will, so it be broad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to pour into it Quicksilver.

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Quicksilver will descend in the Cylinder, not till it be level with that in the Bason according to the nature of heavie Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids, but stay and stand above it at the height of 29 inches or very neer it, the bottom being now uppermost that no Air can get in.</p>

               <p>What do you infer from this?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That all the Cavitie above 29 inches is fill'd with <hi>Vacuum.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very strange that I, from this same Experiment, should infer (and I think evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently) that it is fill'd with Air. I pray, tell me, when you had inverted the Cylinder, full as it was, and stopt with your finger, dipt into the Bason, if you had then removed your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whether you think the Quicksilver would not all have fallen out?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:93813:18"/>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>No sure. The Air would have been prest upward through the Quicksilver it self: For a man with his hand can easily thrust a Bladder of Air to the bottom of a Bason of Quicksilver.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is therefore manifest that Quicksilver can press the Air through the same Quicksil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis manifest; and also it self rise into the Air.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What cause then can there be, why it should stand still at 29 inches above the level of the Bason, rather than any place else?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis not hard to assigne the cause of that. For so much Quicksilver as was above the 29 inches, will raise the first level of that in the bason, as much as if you had pour'd it on; and thereby bring it to an Aequilibrium. So that I see plainly now, that there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of <hi>Vacuum</hi> from this Experiment. For I considered onely that naturally Quicksilver cannot ascend in Air, nor Air descend in Quicksilver, though by force it may.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Nor do I think that <hi>Torricellius</hi> or any other Vacuist thought of it more than you. But what is the second Experiment?</p>

               <p>There is a Sphere of Glass, which they call a Recipient, of the Capacity of three or four Gallons. And there is inserted into it the end of a hollow Cylinder of Brass above a foot long; so that the whole is one Vessel,

and the bore of the Cylinder three inches Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter. Into which is thrust by force a solid Cylinder of Wood, covered with leather so just, as it may in every point exactly touch the Concave Superficies of the Brass. There is also to let out the Air which the wooden Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder as it enters (called the Sucker) drives before it, a Flap to keep out the External Air while they are pulling the Sucker. Besides, at the top of the Recipient there is a hole to put into it any thing for Experiment. The Sucker being now forc'd up into the Cylinder, what do you think must follow?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I think it will require as much strength to pull it back, as it did to force it in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That is not it I ask, but what would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the Recipient.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I think so much Air as would fill the place the Sucker leaves, would descend into it out of the Recipient; and also that just so much from the External Air would enter into the Recipient, between the Brass and the Wood, at first very swiftly, but, as the place increased, more leasurely.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why may not so much Air rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into the place forsaken, and leave as much <hi>Vacuum</hi> as that comes to, in the Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient? For otherwise no Air will be pumpt out; nor can that wooden Pestle be called a Sucker.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That's it I say. There is no Air either pumpt or sucked out.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>How can the Air pass between the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Brass, or between the Leather and the Wood being so exactly contiguous, or through the Leather it self?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I conceive no such exact contiguity, nor such fastness of the Leather: For I never yet had any that in a storm would keep out either Air or Water.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But how then could there be made in the Recipient such strange alteration both on animate and inanimate Bodies?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you how: The Air descends out of the Recipient, because the Air which the Sucker removeth from behinde it self as it is pulling out, has no place to retire into without. And therefore is driven into the Engine between the wood of the Sucker and the brass of the Cylinder, and causes as much Air to come into the place forsaken by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring Sucker; which causeth by oft repetition of the force, a violent circulation of the Air within the Recipient, which is able quickly to kill any thing that lives by respiration, and make all the alterations that have appeared in the Engine.</p>

               <p>'Tis true; and 'tis the Doctrine of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus.</hi> But I cannot yet conceive by what one Motion this Circle can be described other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than we are taught by <hi>Euclid.</hi> And then I am sure that all the Diameters shall cross one another in the Centre, which in this Figure is A.</p>

               <p>I do not say that the Diameters of a Sphere or Circle can be parallel; but that if a Circle of a lesser Sphere be moved upon the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of a great Circle of a greater Sphere, that the streight Lines that are in the lesser Sphere may be kept parallel perpetually to the places they proceed from.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Take into your hand any streight Line, (as in this Figure) the Line L A M, which we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be the diameter of the Suns Body; and moving it parallelly, with the ends in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, so as that the end M may withal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a small Circle, as M <hi>a.</hi> It is manifest that all the other points of the same Line L M will by the same Motion, at the same time, describe equal Circles to it. Likewise if you take in your hand any two Diameters fastened toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the same Parallel-motion of the line L M, shall cause all the points of the other Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make equal Circles to the same M <hi>a.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis evident; as also that every point of the Suns body shall do the like. And not onely so, but also if one end describe any other Figure, all the other points of the Body shall describe like and equal Figures to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You see by this, that this Parallel-motion is compounded of two Motions, one Circular upon the Superficies of a Sphere, the other a streight Motion from the Centre to every point of the same Superficies, and beyond it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It follows hence, that the Sun by this Motion must every way repel the Air; and since there is no empty place for retiring, the Air must turn about in a Circular stream; but slower or swifter according as it is more or less remote from the Sun, and that according to the nature of Fluids, the Particles of the Air must continually change place with one another; and also that the stream of the Air shall be the contrary way to that of the Motion, for else the Air cannot be repelled.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>All this is certain.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Well. Then if you suppose the Globe of the Earth to be in this stream which is made by the Motion of the Suns Body from East to West, the stream of Air wherein is the Earths Annual Motion will be from West to East.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis certain.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Well. Then if you suppose the Globe of the Earth, whose Circle is moved Annually, to be <hi>l m,</hi> the stream of the Air without the Ecliptick falling upon the Superficies of the Earth <hi>l m</hi> without the Ecliptick, being slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the stream that falleth within swifter, the Earth shall be turned upon its own Centre proportionally to the greatness of the Circles; and consequently their Diameters shall be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel; as also are other streight Lines corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I deny not but the streams are as you
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93813:21"/>
say; and confess that the proportion of the swiftness without, is to the swiftness within, as the Suns Ecliptick to the Ecliptick of the Earth; that is to say, as the Angle HAB to the Angle <hi>m</hi> B <hi>b.</hi> And I like your Argument the better, because it is drawn from <hi>Copernicus</hi> his foundation. I mean the compounded Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Streight and Circular.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I think I shall not offer you many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of Physical conclusions that are not derived from the Motions supposed or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Copernicus.</hi> For those Conclusions in Natural Philosophy I most suspect of falshood, which require most variety of Suppositions for their demonstrations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The next thing I would know, is how great or little you suppose that Circle <hi>a</hi> M.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I suppose it less than you can make it: For there appears in the Sun no such Motion sensible. 'Tis the first Endeavour of the Suns Motion. But for all that, as small as the Circle is, the Motion may be as swift, and of as great strength as 'tis possible to be named. 'Tis but a kinde of trembling that necessarily happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in those Bodies, which with great resistance press upon one another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I understand now from what Cause pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the Annual Motion: Is the Sun the Cause also of the Diurnal Motion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Not the immediate Cause. For the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal Motion of the Earth is upon its own
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93813:22"/>
Centre, and therefore the Suns Motion cannot describe it. But it proceedeth as a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence from the Annual Motion. For which I have both experience and demonstration. The Experiment is this: Into a large Hemisphere of Wood, spherically Concave, put in a Globe of Lead, and with your hands hold it fast by the brim, moving your hands circularly, but in a very small compass, you shall see the Globe circulate about the Concave Vessel, just in the same manner as the Earth doth every year in the Air; and you shall see withal, that as it goes, it turns perpetually upon its own Centre, and very swiftly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I have seen it: And 'tis used in some great Kitchins to grinde Mustard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Is it so? Therefore take a Hemisphere of Gold (if you have it) the greater the better, and a Bullet of Gold, (and without Mustard) you shall see the same Effect.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I doubt it not. But the of it Cause is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For any Spherical Body being in Motion upon the sides of a Concave and hard Sphere, is all the way turned upon its own Centre by the resistance of the hard Wood or Metal. But the Earth is a Bullet without weight, and meeteth onely with Air, without any harder body in the way to resist it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think the Air makes no resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, especially to so swift a Motion as is the Annual Motion of the Earth? If it do
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93813:22"/>
make any resistance, you cannot doubt but that it shall turn the Earth circularly, and in a contrary way to its Annual Motion; that is to say, from East to West, because the Annual Motion is from West to East.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I confess it. But what deduce you from these Motions of the Sun?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I deduce (first) that the Air must of necessity be moved both circularly about the Body of the Sun according to the Ecliptick, and also every way directly from it. For the Motion of the Suns Body is compounded of this Circular Motion upon the Sphere L M, and of the streight motion of its Semi-diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Centre A to the Superficies of the Suns Body, which is LM. And therefore the Air must needs be repelled every way, and also continually change place to fill up the places forsaken by other parts of the Air, which else would be empty, there being no <hi>Vacuum</hi> to retire unto. So that there would be a perpetual stream of Air, and in a contrary way to the Motion of the Suns Body, such as is the Motion of Water by the sides of a Ship under sail.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But this Motion of the Earth from West to East, is onely Circular, such as is described by a Compass about a Centre; and cannot therefore repel the Air as the Sun does. And the Disciples of <hi>Copernicus</hi> will have it to be the Cause of the Moons monthly motion about the Earth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:93813:23"/>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>And I think <hi>Copernicus</hi> himself would have said the same, if his purpose had been to have shewn the Natural Causes of the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Stars. But that was no part of his designe; which was onely from his own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, and those of former Astronomers, to compute the times of their Motions; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to foretel the Conjunctions, Oppositions, and other Aspects of the Planets; and partly to regulate the times of the Churches Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals. But his followers, <hi>Kepler</hi> and <hi>Galileo,</hi> make the Earths Motion to be the Efficient Cause of the Monthly motion of the Moon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Earth; which without the like Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that of the Sun in LM, is impossible. Let us therefore for the present take it in as a necessary Hypothesis; which from some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment that I shall produce in our following discourses, may prove to be a certain truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But seeing A is the Centre both of the Suns Body and of the Annual Motion of the Earth, How can it be (as all Astronomers say it is) that the Orb of the Annual Motion of the Earth should be Excentrique to the Suns Body? For you know that from the Vernal Aequinox to the Autumnal, there be 187 days; but from the Autumnal Aequinox to the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, there be but 178 days. What Natural Cause can you assigne for this Excentricity?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kepler</hi> ascribes it to a Magnetique vertue, <hi>viz.</hi> that one part of the Earths Superficies has
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93813:23"/>
a greater kindness for the Sun than the other part.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I am not satisfied with that. It is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical rather than Natural, and unworthy of <hi>Kepler.</hi> Tell me your own opinion of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I think that the Magnetical vertue he speaks of, consisteth in this: that the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth is for the greatest part Sea, and that the greatest part of the Northern Hemisphere is dry Land. But how it is possible that from thence should proceed the Excentricity (the Sun being neerest to the Earth, when he is in the Winter-Solstice) I shall shew you when we come to speak of the Motions of Air and Water.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That's time enough: For I intend it for our next meeting. In the mean time I pray you tell me what you think to be the Cause why the Equinoctial (and consequently the Solstitial) points are not always in one and the same point of the Ecliptique of the Fixt Stars. I know they are not, because the Sun does not rise and set in points diametrally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite: For if it did, there would be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Seasons of the year.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>The cause of that can be no other, than that the Earth (which is <hi>l m)</hi> hath the like Motion to that which I suppose the Sun to have in L M, compounded of streight and circular from West to East in a day, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Motion hath in a year; so that (not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93813:24"/>
reckoning the Excentricity) it will be moved through the Ecliptiques one Revolution (as <hi>Copernicus</hi> proveth) about one degree. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose then the whole Earth moved from H to I, (which is half the year) circularly, but fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from I to <hi>i</hi> in the same time about 30 minutes, and as much in the other Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere from H to <hi>k;</hi> then draw the line <hi>i k,</hi> which will be equal and parallel to H I, and be the Diameter of the Aequator for the next year. But it shall not cut the Diameter of the Ecliptick B Z in A, which was the Equinoctial of the former year, but in <hi>o</hi> 36 seconds from the first degree of <hi>Aries.</hi> Suppose the same done in the Hemisphere under the Plain of the paper, and so you have the double of 36 seconds, that is 72 seconds, or very neer, for the progress of the Vernal Equinox in a year. The cause why I suppose the Arch I <hi>i</hi> to be half a degree in the Ecliptique of the Earth, is, that <hi>Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> and other Astronomers, and Experience, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, that the Aequinoctial points pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the order of the Signes, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Taurus, Gemini,</hi> &amp;c. from West to East every 100 year one degree or very neer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>In what time do they make the whole Revolution through the Ecliptique of the Sky?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That you may reckon. For we know by Experience that it hath proceeded about one degree, that is 60 minutes constantly a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93813:24"/>
long time in a hundred years. But as 100 years to one degree, so is 36000 years to 360 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Also as 100 years to one degree, so is one year to the hundred part of one degree or 60 minutes; which is 60/100, or 36 seconds for the progress of one year; which must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than a degree according to <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> who, <hi>lib. 3. cap.</hi> 2. saith, That for 400 years before <hi>Ptolomie</hi> it was one degree almost constantly. Which is well enough as to the Natural Cause of the Precession of the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial points, which is the often-said com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Motion, though not an exact Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical Calculation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>And 'tis a great signe that his Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is true. But what is the Cause that the Obliquity of the Ecliptique, that is, the distance between the Aequinoctial and the Solstice, is not always the same?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The necessity of the Obliquity of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptique is but a consequence to the Precessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Aequinoctial points. And therefore if from C the North-Pole you make a little Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle C <hi>u</hi> equal to 15 minutes of a degree upon the Earth, and another <hi>u s</hi> equal to the same, which will appear like this Figure 8, that is (as <hi>Copernicus</hi> calls it) a Circle twined, the Pole C will be moved half the time of the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial points, in the arc C <hi>u,</hi> and as much in the alternate arc <hi>u s</hi> descending to <hi>s.</hi> But in the arc <hi>s u,</hi> and its alternate rising to C. The
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93813:25"/>
cause of the twining is the Earths Annual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the same way in the Ecliptique, and makes the four quarters of it; and makes also their revolution twice as slow as that of the Aequinoctial points. And therefore the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is the same compounded Motion which <hi>Copernicus</hi> takes for his Supposition, and is the cause of the Precession of the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial points, and consequently of the variation of the Obliquity, adding to it or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from it somewhere more, somewhere less; so as that one with another the addition is not much more, nor the substraction much less than 30 minutes. But as for the Natural Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause of this compounded Motion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Sun, or the Earth, or any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body, it can be none but the immediate hand of the Creator.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>By this it seems that the Poles of the Earth are always the same, but make this 8 in the Sphere of the fixt Stars neer that which is called <hi>Cynosura.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No: 'Tis described on the Earth, but the Annual Motion describes a Circle in the Sphere of the fixed Stars. Though I think it improper to say a Sphere of the fixt Stars, when 'tis so unlikely that all the fixt Stars should be in the Superficies of one and the same Globe.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Nor I, since they may seem less one than another, as well by their different distances, as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93813:25"/>
by their different magnitudes. Nor is it likely that the Sun (which is a fixt Star) is the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Cause of the Motion of those remoter Planets, <hi>Mars, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Saturn;</hi> seeing the whole Sphere, whose Diameter is the distance between the Sun and the Earth, is but a point in respect of the distance between the Sun and any other fixed Star. Which I say onely to excite those that value the knowledge of the Cause of Comets, to look for it in the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of some other Sun than that which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Earth. For why may not there be some other fixed Star, neerer to some Planet than is the Sun, and cause such a light in it as we call a Comet?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>As how?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You have seen how in high and thin Clouds above the Earth, the Sun-beams pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them have appeared like a Beard; and why might not such a Beard have appeared to you like a Comet, if you had lookt upon it from as high as some of the fixed Stars?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But because it is a thing impossible for me to know, I will proceed in my own way of enquiry. And seeing you ascribe this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Motion to the Sun and Earth, I would grant you that the Earth (whose Annual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from West to East) shall give the Moon her Monthly-motion from East to West. But then I ask you whether the Moon have also that compounded Motion of the Earth, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93813:26"/>
with it a Motion upon its own Centre, as hath the Earth? For seeing the Moon has no other Planet to carry about her, she needs it not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I see reason enough, and some necessity, that the Moon should have both those Motions. For you cannot think that the Creator of the Stars, when he gave them their Circular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did first take a Centre, and then describe a Circle with a Chain or Compass, as men do? No; he moved all the parts of a Star together and equally in the Creation: And that's the reason I give you. The necessity of it, comes from this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> that the Moon doth turn one and the same face towards the Earth: Which cannot be by being moved about the Earth parallelly, unless also it turn about its own Centre. Besides, we know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the Motion of the Moon doth adde not a little to the Motion of the Sea: Which were impossible if it did not adde to the Stream of the Air, and by consequence to that of the Water.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>If you could get a piece of the true and intimate Substance of the Earth, of the bigness of a Musquet-bullet, do you believe that the Bullet would have the like compounded Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that which you attribute to the Sun, Earth, and Moon?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes truly; but with less strength, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its magnitude; saving that by its
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93813:26"/>
Gravity falling to the Earth, the activity of it would be unperceived.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I will trouble you no more with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Celestial appearances. But I pray you tell me by what art a man may finde what part of a Circle the Diameter of the Suns Body doth subtend in the Ecliptique Circle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kepler</hi> says it subtends 30 minutes, which is half a degree. His way to finde it is by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Sun-beams into a close room through a small hole, and receiving the image of it upon a plain perpendicularly. For by this means he hath a Triangle, whose sides and angles he can know by measure; and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Angle he seeks for, and the substance of the arc of the Suns Body.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But I think it impossible to distinguish where the part illuminate toucheth the part not illuminate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Another way is this: Upon the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial-day, with a Watch that shews the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes standing by you, observe when the lower brim of the Suns setting first comes to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and set the Index to some minute of the Watch; and observe again the upper brim when it comes to the Horizon: then count the minutes, and you have what you look for. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way I know none.</p>

               <p>I Have considered, as you bad me, this compounded Motion with great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. First, it is that which makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Continuum</hi> and <hi>Contiguum,</hi> which till now I never could distinguish. For Bodies that are but Contiguous, with any lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle force are parted; but by this compounded Motion (because every point of the body makes an equal Line in equal time, and every Line crosses all the rest) one part cannot be separated from another, without disturbing the Motion of all the other parts at once. And is not that the Cause, think you, that some Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies when they are prest or bent, as soon as the force is removed, return again of themselves to their former figure?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes sure; saving that it is not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that they return, (for we were agreed that nothing can move it self) but it is the Motion of the parts which are not prest, that delivers those that are. And this restitution the Learned now call the <hi>Spring</hi> of a Body. The <hi>Greeks</hi> called it <hi>Antitypia.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>When I considered this Motion in the Sun
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93813:27"/>
and the Earth and Planets, I fancied them as so many Bodies of the Army of the Almighty in an immense field of Air, marching swiftly, and commanded (under God) by his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Officer the Sun, or rather forced so to keep their order in every part of every of those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as never to go out from the distance in which he had set them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But the parts of the Air and other Fluids keep not their places so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>No. You told me that this Motion is not natural in the Air, but received from the Sun.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>True. But since we seek the Natural Causes of Sublunary Effects, where shall we begin?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I would fain know what makes the Sea to ebbe and flow at certain Periods, and what causeth such variety in the Tides.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Remember that the Earth turneth every day upon its own Axis from West to East; and all the while it so turneth, every point thereof by its compounded Motion makes other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clings, but not on the same Centre, which is (you know) a rising in one part of the day, and a falling in the other part. What think you must happen to the Sea, which resteth on it, and is a Fluid Body?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think it must make the Sea rise and fall. And the same happeneth also to the Air, from the Motion of the Sun.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Is not there a great Sea that reacheth from the Straight of <hi>Magellan</hi> Eastward to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and thence to the same Straight again? And is not there a great Sea called the <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Sea that runneth Northward to us? and does not the great South-Sea run also up into the Northern Seas? But I think the <hi>Indian</hi> and the South-Sea of themselves to be greater than all the rest of the Surface of the Globe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>How lieth the water in those two Seas?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>East and West, and rises and falls a little, as it is forc'd to do by this compounded Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a kind of succussion of the Earth, and fills both the <hi>Atlantick</hi> and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Seas.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>All this would not make a visible diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between High and Low water, because this Motion being so regular, the unevenness would not be great enough to be seen. For though in a Bason the water would be thrown into the Air, yet the Earth cannot throw the Sea into the Air.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. The Bason, if gently moved, will make the water so move, that you shall hardly see it rise.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It may be so. But you should never see it rise as it doth, if it were not checkt. For at the Straight of <hi>Magellan,</hi> the great South-Sea is checkt by the shore of the Continent of <hi>Peru</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:93813:28"/>
and <hi>Chily,</hi> and forced to rise to a great height, and made to run up into the Northern Seas on that side by the coast of <hi>China;</hi> and at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn is checkt again and forced through the <hi>Atlantick</hi> into the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Seas. And this is done every day. For we have supposed that the Earths Motion in the Ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptique caused by the Sun is Annual; and that its Motion in the Aequinoctial, is Diurnal. It followeth therefore from this compounded Motion of the Earth, the Sea must Ebb and Flow twice in the space of Twenty four hours, or thereabout.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Has the Moon nothing to do in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. For she hath also the like Motion. And is, though less swift, yet much neerer to the Earth. And therefore when the Sun and Moon are in Conjunction or Opposition, the Earth, as from two Agents at once, must needs have a greater Succussion. And if it chance at the same time the Moon also be in the Ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptique, it will be yet greater, because the Moon then worketh on the Earth less obliquely.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But when the Full or New Moon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be then when the Earth is in the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial points, the Tides are greater than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. Why is that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Because then the force by which they move the Sea, is at that time, to the force by which they move the same at other times,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93813:29"/>
as the Aequinoctial Circle to one of its Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels, which is a lesser Circle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis evident. And 'tis pleasant to see the Concord of so many and various motions, when they proceed from one and the same Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis. But what say you to the stupendious Tides which happen on the Coasts of <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> on the East, and in the River of <hi>Severn</hi> on the West?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The cause of that, is their proper Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the Current of the Ocean through the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, and the Current of the South-Sea through the Northern Seas meeting together, raise the water in the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Seas a great deal higher than ordinary. Therefore the mouth of the <hi>Severn</hi> being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opposite to the Current from the <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Sea, and those Sands on the Coast of <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> directly opposite to the Current of the <hi>German</hi> Sea, those Tides must needs fall furiously into them, by this Succussion of the water.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Does, when the Tide runs up into a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the water all rise together, and fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when it goes out?</p>
               <p>No: One part riseth and another falleth at the same time; because the Motion of the Earth rising and falling, is that which makes the Tide.</p>

The water there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore falls at <hi>Greenwich</hi> whilst it riseth all the way to <hi>London.</hi> But except the top of the water went up, and the lower part downward, it were impossible.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis certain. It is strange that this one Motion should salve so many apparences, and so easily. But I will produce one Experiment of water, not in the Sea, but in a Glass. If you can shew me that the cause of it is this compounded Motion, I shall go neer to think it the Cause of all other Effects of Nature hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto disputed of. The Experiment is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and described by the Lord Chancellour <hi>Bacon,</hi> in the third page of his Natural Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Take</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Glass of water, and draw your finger round about the lip of the Glass, pressing it somewhat hard; after you have done so a few times, it will make the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter frisk up into a fine Dew.</hi> After I had read this, I tried the same with all diligence my self, and found true not onely the frisking of the water to above an inch high, but also the whole Superficies to circulate, and withal to make a pleasant sound. The Cause of the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sking he attributes to a tumult of the inward parts of the Substance of the Glass striving to free it self from the pressure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I have tried and found both the Sound
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93813:30"/>
and Motion; and do not doubt but the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the parts of the Glass was part of the Cause. But the Motion of my finger about the Glass was always parallel; and when it chanced to be otherwise, both Sound and Motion ceased.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I found the same. And being satisfied, I proceed to other questions. How is the water (being a heavie Body) made to ascend in small particles into the Air, and be there for a time sustained in form of a Cloud, and then fall down again in Rain?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I have shewn already, that this compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Motion of the Sun, in one part of its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlation, drives the Air one way, and in the other part, the contrary way; and that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not draw it back again, no more than he that sets a stone a flying can pull it back. The Air therefore, which is contiguous to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being thus distracted, must either leave a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or else some part of the water must rise and fill the spaces continually forsaken by the Air. But, that there is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> you have granted. Therefore the water riseth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air, and maketh the Clouds; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are very small and invisible parts of the water, are (though naturally heavie) ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily carried up and down with the Wind, till, meeting with some Mountain or other Clouds, they be prest together into greater drops, and fall by their weight. So also it is forced up in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93813:30"/>
moist ground, and with it many small Atomes of the Earth, which are either twisted with the rising water into Plants, or are carried up and down in the Air incertainly. But the greatest Quantity of Water is forced up from the great South and <hi>Indian</hi> Seas, that lie under the Tropique of <hi>Capricorn.</hi> And this Climate is that which makes the Suns <hi>Perigaeum</hi> to be always on the Winter-Solstice. And that is the part of the Terrestrial Globe which <hi>Keple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> says is kinde to the Sun; whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Globe (which is almost all dry land) has an Antipathy to the Sun. And so you see where this Magnetical vertue of the Earth lies. For the Globe of the Earth having no Natural Appetite to any place, may be drawn by this Motion of the Sun a little neerer to it, together with the water which it raiseth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Can you guess what may be the Cause of Wind?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I think it manifest that the unconstant Winds proceed from the uncertain Motion of the Clouds ascending and descending, or meeting with one another. For the Winds after they are generated in any place by the descent of a Cloud, they drive other Clouds this way and that way before them, the Air seeking to free it self from being pent up in a straight. For when a Cloud descendeth, it makes no wind sensible directly under it self.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93813:31"/>
But the Air between it and the Earth is prest and forced to move violently outward. For it is a certain Experiment of Mariners, that if the Sea go high when they are becalmed, they say they shall have more Wind than they would; and take in their Sails all but what is necessary for steering. They know (it seems) that the Sea is moved by the descent of Clouds at some distance off: Which presseth the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and makes it come to them in great Waves. For a Horizontal Wind does but curl the Water.</p>

                  <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> says, there is a River, and in it a Lake, upon the top of Mount <hi>Cenis</hi> in <hi>Savoy;</hi> and will therefore have the Springs to be ingendred in the Caverns of the Earth by Condensation of the Air.</p>

               <p>I wonder he should say that. I have pass'd over that Hill twice since the time I read that in <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and found that River as I pass'd, and went by the side of it in plain
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93813:31"/>
ground almost two miles. Where I saw the water from two great Hills, one on one side, the other on the other, in a thousand small Rillets of melting Snow fall down into it. Which has made me never to use any Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment the which I have not my self seen. As for the conversion of Air into Water by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation, and of Water into Air by Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (though it be the doctrine of the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetiques)</hi> it is a thing incogitable, and the words are insignificant. For by <hi>Densum</hi> is signified onely frequencie and closeness of parts; and by <hi>Rarum</hi> the contrary. As when we say a Town is thick with houses, or a Wood with trees, we mean not that one house or tree is thicker than another, but that the spaces between are not so great. But (since there is no <hi>Vacuum)</hi> the spaces between the parts of Air are no larger than between the parts of Water, or of any thing else.</p>

               <p>What think you of those things which Mariners that have sailed through the <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Sea called <hi>Spouts,</hi> which pour down wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough at once to drown a great Ship?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>'Tis a thing I have not seen. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can say nothing to it; though I doubt not but when two very large and heavie Clouds shall be driven together by two great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds, the thing is possible.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think your reason good. And now will propound to you another Experiment.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93813:32"/>
I have seen an exceeding small Tube of Glass with both ends open set upright in a Vessel of Water, and that the Superficies of the Water within the Tube was higher a good deal than of that in the Vessel; but I see no reason for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Was not part of the Glass under Water? Must not then the Water in the Vessel rise? Must not the Air that lay upon it rise with it? Whither should this rising Air go, since there is no place empty to receive it? It is therefore no wonder if the Water, press'd by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Glass which is dipt into it, do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rise into a very small Pipe, than come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a longer way into the open Air.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very probable. I observed also that the top of the inclosed Water was a concave Superficies; which I never saw in other Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The Water hath some degree of tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though not so great but that it will yield a little to the Motion of the Air; as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the Bubbles of water, where the conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is always towards the Air. And this I think the cause why the Air and Water mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Tube make the Superficies towards the Air concave, which it cannot do to a Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id of greater tenacity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>If you put into a Bason of Water a long rag of Cloth, first drenched in water, and let the longer part of it hang out, it is known by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93813:32"/>
Experience, that the Water will drop out as long as there is any part of the other end un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Water.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The cause of it is, that water (as I told you) hath a degree of tenacity. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being continued in the rag till it be lower without than within, the weight will make it continue dropping, though not onely because it is heavie (for if the rag lay higher without than within, and were made heavier by the breadth, it would not descend) but 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all heavie Bodies Naturally descend with proportion of swiftness duplicate to that of the time; whereof I shall say more when we talk of Gravity.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>

               <p>How then can you infer your heat from the Sense of Feeling? Your walking may have made you hot: Is Motion therefore hot?

               <p>I shewed you yesterday in discoursing of Rain, how by this compounded Motion of the Suns Body, the Air was every way at once thrust off West and East; so that where it was contiguous, the small parts of the water were forced to rise, for the avoiding of <hi>Vacuum.</hi> Think then that your hand were in the place of water so exposed to the Sun. Must not the Sun work upon it as it did upon the Water? Though it break not the skin, yet it will give to the inner Fluids and looser parts of your hand, an Endeavour to get forth, which will extend the skin, and in some climates fetch up the bloud, and in time make the skin black. The Fire also will do the same to them that often sit with their naked skins too neer it. Nay, one may sit so neer (without touching it) as it shall blister or break the skin, and fetch up both spirits and bloud mixt into a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid oyly matter sooner, than in a Furnace Oyl can be extracted out of a Plant.</p>

               <p>No. For it cannot. But the Motion of the parts of the Kettle which are caused by the Fire, shall dissipate the Water into Vapour till it be all cast out.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is not any other Body but that of the shining coal; which coal, though extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Water, is still the same Body.

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No. For flame is nothing but a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sparks, and Sparks are but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of the Fewel dissipated by the incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble swift Motion of the Movent, which makes every Spark to seem a hundred times greater than it is, as appears by this; That when a man swings in the Air a small stick fired at one end (though the Motion cannot be very swift) yet the Fire will appear to the eye to be a long, streight, or crooked Line. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a great many sparks together flying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, must needs appear unto the sight as one continued Flame. Nor are the sparks striken out of a Flint any thing else but small particles of the stone, which by their swift Motion are made to shine. But that Fire is not a substance of it self, is evident enough by this, that the Sun-beams passing through a Globe of Water will burn as other fire does. Which beams, if they were indeed Fire, would be quenched in the passage.</p>

               <p>This is so evident, that I wonder so wise men as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his followers, for so long a time could hold it for an Element, and one of the primary parts of the Universe. But the Natural heat of a man or other living Creature, whence proceedeth it? Is there any thing within their Bodies that hath this <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Motion?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>At the breaking up of a Deer I have seen it plainly in his Bowels as long as they were warm. And it is called the <hi>Peristaltique</hi> Motion, and in the Heart of a Beast newly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his Body; and this Motion is called <hi>Systole and Diastole.</hi> But they are both of them this compounded Motion, whereof the former causeth the food to Winde up and down through the guts, and the later makes the Circulation of the Blood.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What kind of Motion is the Cause of Cold? Methinks it should be contrary to that which causeth Heat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>So it is in some respect. For seeing the Motion that begets Heat, tendeth to the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the parts of the Body whereon it acteth, it stands with reason, that the Motion which maketh Cold, should be such as sets them closer together. But contrary Motions are (to speak properly) when upon two ends of a Line two Bodies move towards each other, the Effect whereof is to make them meet. But each of them (as to this Question) is the same.</p>

               <p>Do you think (as many Philosophers have held and now hold) that Cold is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a privation of Heat?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No. Have you never heard the Fable of the Satyre that dwelling with a Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and seeing him blow his fingers to warm them, and his Pottage to cool it, was so scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized, that he ran from him, saying he would no longer dwell with one that could blow both Hot and Cold with one breath? Yet the Cause is evident enough. For the Air which had gotten a Calefactive power from his vital parts, was from his mouth and throat gently diffused on his fingers, and retained still that power. But to cool his Pottage he streigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened the passage at his lips, which extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the Calefactive Motion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think Wind the general Cause of Cold? If that were true, in the greatest Winds we should have the greatest Frosts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I mean not any of those uncertain Winds which, I said, were made by the Clouds, but such as a Body moved in the Air makes to and against it self. For it is all one Motion of the Air, whether it be carried against the Body, or the Body against it. Such a Wind as is constant (if no other be stirring) from East to West made by the Earth turning dayly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its own Centre. Which is so swift, as (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be kept off by some hill) to kill a man, as by Experience hath been found by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93813:35"/>
those who have passed over great Mountains, and specially over the <hi>Andies</hi> which are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the East. And such is the Wind which the Earth maketh in the Air by her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Motion, which is so swift, as that (by the Calculation of Astronomers) to go Sixty miles in a minute of an hour. And therefore this must be the Motion which makes it so cold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Poles of the Ecliptique.</p>

               <p>Does not the Earth make the Wind as great in one part of the Ecliptique as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. But when the Sun is in <hi>Cancer,</hi> it tempers the Cold, and still less and less, but least of all in the Winter-Solstice, where his beams are most oblique to the Superficies of the Earth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I thought the greatest Cold had been about the Poles of the Aequator.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>And so did I once. But the reason com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly given for it is so improbable, that I do not think so now. For the Cause they render of it, is onely, that the Motion of the Earth is swiftest in the Aequinoctial, and slowest about the Poles; and consequently (since Motion is the Cause of Heat, and Cold is but (as 'twas thought) a want of the same) they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd that the greatest Cold must be about the Poles of the Aequinoctial. Wherein they miscounted. For not every Motion causeth Heat, but this agitation onely, which we call
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93813:36"/>
compounded Motion; though some have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged Experience for that opinion; as that a Bullet out of a Gun will with its own swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness melt. Which I never shall believe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a common thing with many Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers to maintain their Fancies with any rash report, and sometimes with a Lye. But how is it possible that so soft a Substance as water should be turned into so hard a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance as Ice?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>When the Air shaves the Globe of the Earth with such swiftness, as that of Sixty miles in a minute of an hour, it cannot (where it meets with still water) but beat it up into small and undistinguishable bubbles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve it self in them as in so many bladders or skins of Water. And Ice is nothing else but the smallest imaginable parts of Air and Water mixt; which is made hard by this compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Motion, that keeps the parts so close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as not to be separated in one place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disordering the Motion of them all. For when a Body will not easily yield to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of an external Movent in one place without yielding in all, we call it Hard; And when it does, we say 'tis Soft.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why is not Ice as well made in a moved as in a still water? Are there not great Seas of Ice in the Northern parts of the Earth?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and perhaps also in the Southern parts. But I cannot imagine how Ice can be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93813:36"/>
made in such agitation as is always in the open Sea made by the Tides and by the Winds. But how it may be made at the Shoar, it is not hard to imagine. For in a River or Current, though swift, the water that adhereth to the banks is quiet, and easily by the Motion of the Air driven into small insensible bubbles; and so may the water that adhereth to those bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and so forwards till it come into a stream that breaks it, and then it is no wonder though the fragments be driven into the open Sea, and freeze together into greater lumps. But when in the open Sea, or at the Shoar, the Tide or a great Wave shall arise, this young and tender Ice will presently be washt away. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it evident, that as in the <hi>Thames</hi> the Ice is first made at the banks where the Tide is weak or none, and broken by the stream comes down to <hi>London,</hi> and part goes to the Sea floating till it dissolve, and part (being too great to pass the Bridge) stoppeth there and sustains that which follows, till the River be quite frozen over: So also the Ice in the Northern Seas begins first at the banks of the Continent and Islands which are scituated in that Climate, and then broken off, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up and down, and one against another, till they become great Bodies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But what if there be Islands, and narrow Inlets of the Sea, or Rivers also about the Pole of the Aequinoctial?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:93813:37"/>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If there be, 'tis very likely the Sea may also there be covered all over with Ice. But for the truth of this, we must stay for some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discovery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>When the Ice is once made and hard, what dissolves it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The Principal Cause of it, is the weight of the water it self; but not without some abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Stream of the Air that hardned it; as when the Sun-beams are less oblique to the Earth, or some contrary Wind resisteth the stream of the Air. For when the impediment is removed, then the nature of the water on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worketh, and (being a heavie Body) down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I forgot to ask you, Why two pieces of Wood rub'd swiftly one against another, will at length set on fire.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Not onely at length, but quickly, if the Wood be dry. And the Cause is evident, <hi>viz.</hi> the compounded Motion which dissipates the external small parts of the Wood. And then the inner parts must of necessity (to preserve the Plenitude of the Universe) come after; first the most Fluid, and then those also of greater consistence, which are first erected, and (the Motion continued) made to flie swiftly out; whereby the Air driven to the Eye of the beholder, maketh that fancie which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. I remember you told me before,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93813:37"/>
that upon any strong pressure of the Eye, the resistance from within would appear a <hi>Light.</hi> But to return to the enquiry of Heat and Cold, there be two things that beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put me into admiration. One is the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of kindling in Gunpowder. The other is the freezing of Water in a Vessel (though not far from the fire) set about with other water with Ice and Snow in it. When Paper or Flax is flaming, the flame creeps gently on; and if a house full of Paper were to be burnt with putting a Candle to it, it will be long in burning; whereas a spark of fire would set on flame a mountain of Gunpowder in almost an instant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Know you not Gunpowder is made of the powder of Charcole, Brimstone, and Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter? Whereof the first will kindle with a spark, the second flame as soon as toucht with fire; and the third blows it, as being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of many Orbs of Salt fill'd with Air, and as it dissolveth in the flame, furiously blowing increaseth it. And as for making Ice by the fire side. It is manifest that whilst the Snow is dissolving in the external vessel, the Air must in the like manner break forth, and shave the Superficies of the inner vessel, and work through the water till it be frozen.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I could easily assent to this, if I could conceive how the Air that shaves (as you say) the outside of the Vessel, could work through
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93813:38"/>
it. I conceive well enough a pail of water with Ice or Snow dissolving in it, and how it causeth Wind. But how that Wind should communicate it self through the vessel of wood or metal, so as to make it shave the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the water which is within it, I do not so well understand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I do not say the inner Superficies of the vessel shaves the water within it. But 'tis manifest that the Wind made in the Pail of water by the melting Snow or Ice presseth the sides of the Vessel that standeth in it; and that the pressure worketh clean through, how hard soever the Vessel be; and that again worketh on the water within, by restitution of its parts, and so hardeneth the water by degrees.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I understand you now. The Ice in the Pail by its dissolution transfers its Hardness to the water within.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You are merry. But supposing, as I do, that the Ice in the Pail is more than the water in the Vessel, you will finde no absurdity in the Argument. Besides, the Experiment, you know, is common.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I confess it is probable. The <hi>Greeks</hi> have the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (whence the <hi>Latins</hi> have their word <hi>Frigus)</hi> to signifie the curling of water by the Wind; and use the same also for Horrour, which is the passion of one that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth suddenly into a cold Air, or is put into
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93813:38"/>
a sudden affright, whereby he shrinks, and his hair stands upright. Which manifestly shews that the Motion which causeth Cold, is that which pressing the Superficies of a Body, sets the parts of it closer together. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in my Quaeries. Monsieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> who (you know) hath written somewhere, that the noise we hear in Thunder, proceeds from brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Ice in the Clouds; What think you of it? Can a Cloud be turned into Ice?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Why not? A Cloud is but Water in the Air.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But how? For he has not told us that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You know that 'tis onely in Summer, and in hot weather, that it Thunders; or if in Winter, it is taken for a Prodigie. You know also, that of Clouds, some are higher, some lower, and many in number, as you cannot but have oftentimes observed, with spaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Therefore, as in all Currents of water, the Water is there swiftest where it is streightned with Islands, so must the Current of Air made by the Annual Motion be swiftest there, where it is checkt with many Clouds through which it must (as it were) be strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and leave behinde it many small particles of earth, always in it, and in hot weather more than ordinary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>This I understand, and that it may cause Ice. But when the Ice is made, how is it broken? And why falls it not down in shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:93813:39"/>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The particles are inclosed in small Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns of the Ice; and their Natural Motion being the same which we have ascribed to the Globe of the Earth, requires a sufficient space to move in. But when it is imprisoned in a less room that that, then a great part of the Ice breaks: And this is the Thunder-clap. The Murmur following is from the settling of the Air. The Lightening is the fancie made by the recoiling of the Air against the Eye. The fall is in Rain, not in Shivers; because the prisons which they break are extreme narrow, and the shivers being small, are dissolved by the Heat. But in less Heat they would fall in Drops of Hail, that is to say, half frozen by the shaving of the Air as they fall, and be in a very little time (much less than Snow or Ice) dissolved.</p>

               <p>Will not that Lightning burn?</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No. But it hath often kill'd men with Cold. But this extraordinary swiftness of Lightning consisteth not in the Expansion of the Air, but in a straight and direct stream from where it breaks forth; which is in many places successively, according to the Motion of the Cloud.</p>

me by the Supposition of one onely Motion, and commonly known, and the same with that of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> whose Opinion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all the Learned; and because you have not used any of these empty terms, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, Antipathy, Antiperistasis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cause, as the old Philosophers have done to save their credit. For though they were many of them wise men, as <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Seneca,</hi> and others, and have written excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently of Morals and Politiques, yet there is very little Natural Philosophy to be gathered out of their Writings.</p>

               <p>COncerning this Cover of the Earth, made up of an infinite number of parts of different natures, I had much ado to finde any tolerable method of enquiry. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved at last to begin with the Questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Hard</hi> and <hi>Soft,</hi> and what kinde of Motion it is that makes them so. I know that in any pulsion of Air, the parts of it go innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable and inexplicable ways; but I ask only if every point of it be moved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No. If you mean a Mathematical point, you know it is impossible. For nothing is movable but Body. But I suppose it divisible (as all other Bodies) into parts divisible. For no Substance can be divided into Nothings.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why may not that Substance within our Bodies, which are called Animal spirits, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind of Body, and more subtile than the common Air?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I know not why, no more than you or any man else knows why it is not very Air, though purer perhaps than the common Air, as being strained through the blood into the Brain and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93813:40"/>
Nerves. But howsoever that be, there is no doubt, but the least parts of the common Air, (respectively to the whole) will easilier pierce (with equal Motion) the Body that resisteth them, than the least parts of water. For it is by Motion onely that any mutation is made in any thing; and all things standing as they did, will appear as they did. And that which changeth <hi>Soft</hi> into <hi>Hard,</hi> must be such as makes the parts not easily to be moved without being moved all together; which cannot be done but by some Motion compounded. And we call <hi>Hard,</hi> that whereof no part can be put out of order without disordering all the rest; which is not easily done.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>How Water and Air beaten into extreme small Bubbles is hardned into Ice, you have told me already, and I understand it. But how a soft Homogeneous Body, as Air, or Water, should be so hardned, I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>There is no hard Body that hath not also some degree of Gravity; and consequently, being loose, there must be some Efficient Cause, that is, some Motion, when it is severed from the Earth, to bring the same to it again. And seeing this compounded Motion gives to the Air and Water an Endeavour from the Earth, the Motion which must hinder it, must be in a way contrary to the compounded Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth. For whatsoever, having
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93813:41"/>
been asunder, comes together again, must come contrary ways, as those that follow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go the same way, though both move up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Line.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I have seen a drop of glass like that of the second Figure, newly taken out of the furnace, and hanging at the end of an Iron rod, and yet Fluid, and let fall into the water and hardned. The Club-end of it A A co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming first to the water, the tail B C following it. 'Tis proved before, that the motion that makes it is a compounded Motion, and gives an Endeavour outward to every part of it; and that the Motion which maketh Cold, is such as shaving the Body in every point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, and turning it, gives them all an Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour inward. Such is this Motion made by the sinking of the hot and fluid glass into the water. 'Tis therefore manifest that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which hardneth a <hi>Soft</hi> Body, must in every point of contact be in the contrary way to that which makes a hard body Soft. And further, that slender tail B C shall be made much more hard than common Glass. For towards the upper end, in C, you cannot easily break it, as small as it is. And when you have broken it, the whole Body will fall into dust, as it must do, seeing the bending is so difficult. For all the parts are bent with such force, that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93813:41"/>
upon the breaking at D, by their sudden resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to their liberty, they will break toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the cause why the tail B C, being so slender, becomes so hard, is, that all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in the great part A B, is propagated to the small part B C, in the same manner as the force of the Sun-beams is derived almost to a point by a Burning-glass. But the Cause why, when it is broken in D, it breaks also in so many other places, is, that the Endeavour in all the other parts (which is called the <hi>Spring)</hi> unbends it; from whence a Motion is caused the contrary way, and that Motion continued bends it more the other way and breaks it, as a Bow over-bent is broken into shivers by a sudden breaking of the string.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I conceive now how a Body which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been Hard and softned again, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardned; but how a Fluid and meer Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Body, as Air or Water, may be so, I see not yet. For the hardning of water is making a hard Body of two Fluids, whereof one (which is the water) hath some tenacity; and so a man may make a Bladder hard with blowing into it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>As for meer Air, which hath no Natural Motion of it self, but is moved onely by other Bodies of a greater consistence, I think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be hardned. For the parts of it so easily change places, that they can never be fixt by any Motion. No more I think can

               <p>It is the opinion of many learned men, that Ice (in long time) will be turned into Christal; and they alleadge Experience for it. For they say that Christal is found hanging on high Rocks in the <hi>Alps</hi> like Isicles on the Eaves of a house, and why may not that have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been Ice, and in many years have lost the power of being reduced?</p>

               <p>If that were so, it would still be Ice, though also Christal: Which cannot be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christal is heavier than Water, and therefore much heavier than Ice.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. I have seen such things, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly I saw at <hi>Rome</hi> in a Stone-cutters work-house a Billet of Wood, as I thought it, partly covered with bark, and partly with the grain bare, as long as a mans Arm, and as thick as the Calf of a mans Leg; which handling I found extreme heavie, and saw a small part of it which was polished, and had a very fine Gloss, and thought it a substance between Stone and Metal, but neerest to Stone. I
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93813:42"/>
have seen also a kind of Slate painted natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Forest-work. And I have seen in the hands of a Chymist of my acquaintance at <hi>Paris,</hi> a broken Glass, part of a Retort, in which had been the Rozin of Turpentine, wherein though there were left no Rozin, yet there appeared in the piece of Glass many Trees; and Plants in the ground about them, such as grow in Woods; and better designed than they could be done by any Painter; and continued so for a long time. These be great wonders of Nature, but I will not undertake to shew their causes. But yet this is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that nothing can make a hard Body of a Soft, but by some Motion of its parts. For the parts of the Hardest Body in the world can be no closer together than to touch; and so close are the parts of Air and Water, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently they should be equally Hard, if their smallest parts had not different Natural Motions. Therefore if you ask me the Causes of these Effects, I answer, They are different Motions. But if you expect from me how and by what Motions, I shall fail you. For there is no kind of Substance in the World now, that was not at the first Creation, when the Creator gave to all things what Natural and special Motion he thought good. And as he made some Bodies wondrous great, so he made others wondrous little. For all his works are wondrous. Man can but guess, nor
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93813:43"/>
guess further, than he hath knowledge of the variety of Motion. I am therefore of opinion, that whatsoever perfectly Homogeneous is Hard, consisteth of the smallest parts (or, as some call them, Atomes) that were made Hard in the beginning, and consequently by an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cause; and that the hardness of the whole Body is caused onely by the contact of the parts by pressure.</p>

               <p>What Motion is it that maketh a hard Body to melt?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The same compounded Motion that heats, namely, that of Fire, if it be strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. For all Motion compounded is an Endeavour to dissipate (as I have said before) the parts of the Body to be moved by it. If therefore hardness consist onely in the pressing Contact of the least parts, this Motion will make the same parts slide off from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the whole to take such a figure as the weight of the parts shall dispose them to, as in Lead, Iron, Gold, and other things mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Heat. But if the small parts have such figures as they cannot exactly touch, but must leave spaces between them filled with Air or other Fluids, then this Motion of the fire, will dissipate those parts some one way, some another, the Hard part still hard; as in the burning of Wood or Stone into Ashes or Lime. For this Motion is that which maketh Fermentation, scattering dissimilar parts, and congregating similar.</p>

               <p>Why do some hard Bodies resist breaking more one way than another?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The Bodies that do so, are for the most part Wood, and receive that quality from their generation. For the heat of the Sun in the Spring-time draweth up the moisture at the Root, and together with it the small parts of the Earth, and twisteth it into a small twig by its Motion upwards to some length, but to very little other dimensions, and so leaves it to dry till the Spring following; and then does the same to that, and to every small part round about it; so that upward the strength is doubled, and the next year trebled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these are called the grain of the Wood, and but touch one another, like sticks with little or no binding, and therefore can hardly be broken across the grain, but easily all-along it. Also some other hard Bodies have this quality of being more fragile one way than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as we see in quarrels of a Glass-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, that are aptest many times to break in some crooked Line. The cause of this may be, that when the glass, hot from the Furnace, is poured out upon a Plain, any small stones in or under it will break the stream of it into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers lines, and not onely weaken it, but also cause it falsly to represent the Object you look on through it.</p>

               <p>What is the Cause why a Bow of Wood or Steel, or other very hard Body, being bent,

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I have told you already, how the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest parts of a hard Body have every one (by the generation of hardness) a Circular, or other compounded Motion; such Motion is that of the smallest parts of the Bow. Which Circles in the bending you press into narrower figures, as a Circle into an Ellipsis, and an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsis into a narrower but longer Ellipsis with violence; which turns their Natural Motion against the outward parts of the Bow so bent, and is an Endeavour to stretch the Bow into its former posture. Therefore if the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be removed, the Bow must needs reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its former Figure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>'Tis manifest; and the cause can be no other but that, except the Bow have Sense.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Not because the nature of the Air varies, but because there are in the Air drawn, or rather, beaten up by the Sun, many little
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93813:44"/>
Bodies, whereof some have such Motion as is healthful, others such as is hurtful to the life of man. For the Sun (as you see in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Plants) can fetch up Earth as well as Water; and from the driest ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of Body that lieth loose, so it be small enough, rather than admit any Emptiness. By some of these small Bodies it is that we live; which being taken in with our breath, pass into our blood, and cause it (by their compounded Motion) to circulate through the Veins and Arteries; which the blood of it self (being a heavie Body) without it cannot do. What kind of substance these Atomes are, I cannot tell. Some suppose them to be Nitre. As for those infectious creatures in the Air, whereof so many die of the Plague, I have heard that Monsieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> a very ingenious man, was of opinion, that they were little Flies. But what grounds he had for it, I know not, though there be many Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that invite me to believe it. For first, we know that the Air is never universally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected over a whole Country, but onely in or neer to some populous Town. And therefore the cause must also be partly ascribed to the multitude thronged together, and constrained to carry their Excrements into the fields round about and neer to their habitation. Which in time fermenting breed Worms, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in a month or little more, naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93813:45"/>
Flies; and though engendred at one Town, may flie to another. Secondly, in the beginning of a Plague, those that dwell in the Suburbs, that is to say, neerest to this corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, are the poorest of the people, that are nourished for the most part with the Roots and Herbs which grow in that corrupted dirt; so that the same filth makes both the blood of poor people, and the substance of the Fly. And 'tis said by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that every thing is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the matter whereof it is generated. Thirdly, when a Town is infected, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and those that live on wholsomest food, scarce one of Five hundred die of the Plague. It seems therefore, whatsoever creatures they be that invade us from the Air, they can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their proper nourishment, and do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the mouth and nostrils with the breath of every man alike, as they would do if they were inanimate. Fourthly, a man may carry the infection with him a great way into the Country in his Clothes, and infect a Village. Shall another man there draw the Infection from the Clothes onely by his breath? Or from the Hangings of a Chamber wherein a man hath died? It is impossible. Therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever killing thing is in the Clothes or Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it must rise and go into his mouth or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils before it can do him hurt. It must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be a Fly, whereof great numbers get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the blood, and there feeding and breeding
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93813:45"/>
Worms, obstruct the Circulation of the blood, and kill the man.</p>

               <p>I would we knew the palate of those lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Animals; we might perhaps finde some medicine to fright them from mingling with our breath.

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is neither Fly nor venim, but the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a flameless glowing fire, which dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates those Atomes that maintain the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood; so that for want of it, by degrees they faint, and being asleep cannot remove, but in short time, there sleeping die, as is evident by this, that being brought into the open Air (without other help) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Two Books written by two learned men concerning <hi>Gravity.</hi> I brought them with me, because they furnish me with some material Questions about that Doctrine; though of the nature of Gravity, I finde no more in either of them than this, That Gravity is an Intrinsecal Quality by which a Body so qualified descendeth perpendicularly towards the Superficies of the Earth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Did neither of them consider that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending</hi> is <hi>local Motion,</hi> that they might have called it an intrinsecal <hi>Motion</hi> rather than an intrinsecal quality?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. But not how Motion should be intrinsecal to the special individual Body mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For how should they, when you are the first that ever sought the differences of Qualities in local Motion, except your autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Philosophy were greater with them than it is? For 'tis hard for a man to conceive (except he see it) how there should be Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within a Body, otherwise than as it is in living creatures.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But it may be they never sought, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired of finding what natural Motion could make any inanimate thing tend one way ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>So it seems. But the first of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no further than, Why so much water (being a heavie Body) as lies perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on a Fishes back in the bottom of the Sea, should not kill it. The other (whereof the Author is Dr. <hi>Wallis)</hi> treateth universally of Gravity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Well. But what are the Questions which from these Books you intend to ask me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Author of the first Book tells me, that Water and other Fluids are Bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and act (as to Gravity) as a piece of Ice would do of the same Figure and quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Is that true?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That the Universe (supposing there is no place empty) is one entire Body, and also, as he saith it is, a continual Body, is very true. And yet the parts thereof may be contiguous, without any other cohesion but Touch. And it is also true, that a Vessel of Water will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend in a <hi>medium</hi> less heavie (but Fluid) as Ice would do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But he means that water in a Tub would have the same Effect upon a Fish in the bottom of the Tub, as so much Ice would have.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That also would be true, if the water were frozen to the sides of it. Otherwise the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93813:47"/>
Ice (if there be enough) will crush the Fish to death. But how applies he this, to prove that the water cannot hurt a Fish in the Sea by its weight?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It plainly appears that Water does not Gravitate on any part of it self beneath it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It appears by Experience, but not by this Argument, though instead of Water the Tub were fill'd with Quicksilver.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I thought so. But how it comes to pass that the Fish remains uncrush'd, I cannot tell.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The Endeavour of the Quicksilver downward, is stopt by the resistance of the hard bottom. But all Resistance is a contrary Endeavour; that is, an Endeavour upwards, which gives the like Endeavour to the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver, which is also heavie, and thereby the Endeavour of the Quicksilver is diverted to the sides round-about; where stopt again by the resistance of the sides, it receives an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour upwards, which carries the Fish to the top, lying all the way upon a soft bed of Quicksilver. This is the true manner how the Fish is saved harmless. But your Author, I believe, either wanted age, or had too much business, to study the doctrine of Motion; and never considered that Resistance is not an impediment onely, or privation, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Motion; and that when a man claps two pieces of Wax together, their contrary
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93813:47"/>
Endeavour will turn both the pieces into one Cake of Wax.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know not the Author; but it seems he has deeplier considered this Question than other men. For in the Introduction to his Book, he saith,</hi> That men have pre-engaged themselves to maintain certain Principles of their own invention, and are therefore unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive any thing that may render their labour fruitless: <hi>and</hi> That they have not strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough considered the several interventions that abate, impede, advance, or direct the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of Bodies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>This is true enough; and he himself is one of those men, in that he considered not, that Resistance is one of those interventions, which abate, impede, and direct Gravitation. But what are his Suppositions for the Question he handles?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>His first is, That as in a Pyramide of Brick, wherein the Bricks are so joyned, that the uppermost lies every where over the joynt or Cement of the two next below it, you may break down a part, and leave a Cavity, and yet the Bricks above will stand firm and sustain one another by their cross posture: So also it is in Wheat, Hail-shot, Sand, or Water; and so they arch themselves, and thereby the Fish is every way secured by an arch of water over it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That the cause why Fishes are not crusht
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93813:48"/>
nor hurt in the bottom of the Sea by the weight of the water, is the waters arching it self, is very manifest. For if the uppermost Orb of the water should descend by its Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, it would tend toward the Centre of the Earth, and place it self all the way in a less and lesser Orb; which is impossible. For the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the same Body are always equal. But that Wheat, Sand, Hail-shot, or loose Stones should make a firm arch, is not credible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Author therefore (it seems) quits it: And taketh a second Hypothesis for the true Cause, though the former (he saith) be not useless, but contributes its part to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I see, though he depart from his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, he looks back upon it with some kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. What is his second Hypothesis?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It is, That Air and Water have an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Motion upward, downward, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, obliquely, and every way. For Air (he saith) will come down his chimney, and in at his door, and up his stairs.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and mine too; and so would Water if I dwelt under water, rather than admit of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum.</hi> But what of that?</p>

               <p>Why then it would follow, that those several tendencies or Endeavours would so abate, impede, and correct one another, as none of them should Gravitate. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, the Fish can take no harm. Wherein I finde one difficulty. Which is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93813:48"/>
this: The Water having an Endeavour to Motion every way at once, methinks it should go no way, but lie at rest; which, he saith, was the opinion of <hi>Stevinus,</hi> and rejecteth it, saying, it would crush the Fish into pieces.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I think the Water in this case would neither rest nor crush. For the Endeavour being (as he saith) intrinsecal, and every way, must needs drive the water perpetually outward, that is to say (as to this Question) upwards; and seeing the same Endeavour in one individual Body cannot be more ways at once than one, it will carry it on perpetually without limit, beyond the fixed Stars; and so we shall never more have rain.</p>

               <p>What are Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> his Suppositions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He goes upon Experiments. And first he alleadgeth this, That Water left to it self without disturbance, does naturally settle it self into a Horizontal Plain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>He does not then (as your Author and all other men) take Gravity for that Quality whereby a Body tendeth to the Centre of the Earth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, he defines Gravity to be a Natural propension towards the Centre of the Earth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Then he contradicteth himself. For if all heavie Bodies tend naturally to one Centre, they shall never settle in a Plain, but in a Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93813:49"/>
Superficies. But against this, That such an Horizontal Plain is found in water by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, I say it is impossible. For the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment cannot be made in a Bason, but in half a mile at Sea, Experience visibly shews the contrary. According to this, he should think also that a pair of Scales should hang paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He thinks that too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Let us then leave this Experiment. What saies he further concerning Gravity?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He takes for granted (not as an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, but an Axiome) that Nature worketh not by election, but <hi>ad ultimum virium,</hi> with all the power it can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I think he means (for 'tis a very obscure passage) that every inanimate Body by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture worketh all it can without election; which may be true. But 'tis certain that men (and beasts) work often by election, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without election; as when he goes by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and falls without it. In this sence I grant him, that Nature does all it can. But what infers he from it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That naturally every Body has every way (if the ways oppose not one another) an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Motion. And consequently, that if a Vessel have two holes, one at the side, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the bottom, the water will run out at both.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Does he think the Body of water that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93813:49"/>
runs out at the side, and that which runs out at the bottom is but one and the same Body of water?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>No sure. He cannot think but that they are two several parts of the whole Water in the Vessel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What wonder is it then, if two parts of water run two ways at once, or a thousand parts a thousand ways? Does it follow thence that one Body can go more than one way at once? Why is he still medling with things of such difficulty? He will finde at last that he has not a Genius either for Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy or for Geometry. What other Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions has he?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>My first Author had affirmed, that a lighter Body does not Gravitate on a heavier; against this Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> thus argueth: Let there <note place="margin">Fig. 3.</note> be a Siphon A B C D filled with Quicksilver to the level A D. If then you pour Oyl up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on A as high as to E, he asketh if the Oyl in A E (as being heavie) shall not press down the Quicksilver a little at A, and make it rise a little at D, suppose to F. And answers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that certainly it will. So that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Experiment nor an Hypothesis, but onely his opinion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Whatsoever it be, it is not true; though the Doctor may be pardoned, because the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary was never proved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Can you prove the contrary?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:93813:50"/>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. For the Endeavour of the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver both from A and D downward, is stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than that of the Oyl downward. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Endeavour of the Quicksilver were not resisted by the bottom B C, it would fall so, by reason of the acceleration of heavie Bodies in their descending, as to leave the Oyl, so that it should not onely not press, but also not touch the Quicksilver. It is true in a pair of Scales equally charged with Quicksilver, that the addition of a little Oyl to either Scale, will make it praeponderate. And that was it deceiv'd him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis evident. The last Experiment he cites is the weighing of Air in a pair of Scales, where 'tis found manifestly that it has some little weight. For if you weigh a Bladder, and put the weight into one Scale, and then blow the Bladder full of Air, and put it into the other Scale, the full Bladder will outweigh the empty. Must not then the Air Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It does not follow. I have seen the Experiment just as you describe it, but it can never be thence demonstrated that Air has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weight. For as much Air as is prest down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the weight of the blown Bladder, so much will rise from below, and lay it self Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically at the altitude of the Center of gravity of the Bladder so blown. So that all the Air within the Bladder above that Centre, is carried
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93813:50"/>
thither imprisoned, and by violence: And the force that carries it up, is equal to that which presseth it down. There must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be allowed some little counterpoise in the other Scale to ballance it. Therefore the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment proves nothing to his purpose. And whereas they say there be small heavie Bodies in the Air, which make it Gravitate, do they think the force which brought them thither cannot hold them there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I leave this Question of the Fish, as cleerly resolved, because the water tending e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way to one point (which is the Centre of the Earth) must of necessity arch it self. And now tell me your own opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Cause of Gravity, and why all Bodies descend or ascend not all alike. For there can be no more Matter in one place than another if the places be equal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I have already shewed you in general, that the difference of Motion in the parts of several Bodies makes the difference of their Natures. And all the difference of Motions consisteth either in swiftness, or in the way, or in the duration. But to tell you in Special, why Gold is heaviest, and then Quicksilver, and then (perhaps) Lead, is more than I hope to know, or mean to enquire: for I doubt not but that the Species of heavie, hard, Opaque, and Diaphanous, were all made so at their creation, and at the same time separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93813:51"/>
from different Species. So that I cannot guess at any particular Motions that should constitute their natures, further than I am gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Experiments made by fire or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>You hope not then to make Gold by Art?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No, unless I could make one and the same thing heavier than it was. God hath from the beginning made all the Kindes of Hard, and Heavie, and Diaphanous Bodies that are, and of such Figure and magnitude as he thought fit; but how small soever, they may by accretion become greater in the Mine, or perhaps by generation, though we know not how. But that Gold, by the art of man should be made of not Gold, I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand; nor can they that pretend to shew how. For the heaviest of all Bodies, by what mixture soever of other Bodies, will be made lighter; and not to be received for Gold.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why, when the Cause of Gravity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in Motion, should you despair of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is certain, that when any two Bodies meet, as the Earth and any heavie Body will, the Motion that brings them to or towards one another, must be upon two contrary ways; and so also it is when two Bodies press each other in order to make them Hard. So that one contrariety of Motion might cause both
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93813:51"/>
Hard and Heavie. But it doth not. For the hardest Bodies are not always the heaviest. Therefore I finde no access that way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Causes of different Endeavours of heavie Bodies to descend.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But shew me at least how any heavie Body that is once above in the Air, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to the Earth, when there is no visible movent to thrust or pull it down.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis already granted, that the Earth hath this compounded Motion supposed by <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> and that thereby it casteth the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Air from it self every way round-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Which Air so cast off, must continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by its nature, range it self in a Spherical Orb. Suppose a Stone (for instance) were taken up from the ground, and held up in the Air by a mans hand, what shall come into the place it fill'd when it lay upon the Earth?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>So much Air as is equal to the Stone in magnitude, must descend and place it self in an Orb upon the Earth. But then I see that to avoid <hi>Vacuum,</hi> another Orb of Air of the same magnitude must descend, and place it self in that, and so perpetually to the mans hand; and then so much Air as would fill the place must descend in the same manner, and bring the Stone down with it. For the Stone having no Endeavour upward, the least Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Air (the hand being removed) will thrust it downward.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:93813:52"/>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis just so. And further, the Motion of the Stone downward shall continually be accelerated according to the odde numbers from Unity; as you know hath been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by <hi>Galileo.</hi> But we are nothing the nearer by this, to the knowledge of why one Body should have a greater Endeavour down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than another. You see the Cause of Gravity is this compounded Motion with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It may be 'tis the Figure that makes the difference. For though Figure be not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it may facilitate Motion, as you see commonly the breadth of a heavie Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardeth the sinking of it. And the cause of it is, That it makes the Air have further to go laterally, before it can rise from under it. For suppose a Body of Quicksilver falling in the Air from a certain height, must it not (going as it does towards the Centre of the Earth) as it draws neerer and neerer to the Earth, become more and more slender, in the form of a Solid Sector? And if it have far to go, divide it self into drops? This Figure of a Solid Sector is like a Needle with the point downward, and therefore I should think that facilitating the Motion of it does the same that would be done by increasing the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Do not you see that this way of facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating is the same in Water, and in all other
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93813:52"/>
Fluid heavy Bodies. Besides, your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be applicable to the weighing of Bodies in a pair of Scales (which it is not, for there they have no such Figure) it should also hold in the comparison of Gravity in Hard and Fluid Bodies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I had not sufficiently consider'd it. But supposing now (as you do) that both heavy and hard Bodies, in their smallest parts, were made so in the Creation; yet, because Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver is harder than Water, a drop of Water shall in descending be prest into a more slender Sector than a drop of Quicksilver, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Earth shall more easily cast off any quantity of Water than the same quantity of Quicksilver.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>This one would think were true; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that of simple Fluid Bodies, those whose smallest parts, naturally, without the force of Fire do strongliest cohere, are generally the heaviest. But why then should Quicksilver be heavier than Stone or Steel? Fluidity and hardness are but degrees between greater Flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and greater hardness. Therefore to the knowledge of what it is that causeth the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, in different Bodies, of their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour downward, there are required (if it can be known at all) a great many more Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than have been yet made. It is not difficult to find why Water is heavier than Ice, or other Body mix'd of Air and Water. But
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93813:53"/>
to believe that all Bodies are heavier or lighter according to the quantity of Air within them, is very hard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I see by this, that the Creator of the World, as by his Power he ordered it, so by his Wisdom he provided it should be never disordered. Therefore leaving this Question, I desire to know whether if a heavy Body were as high as a fixt Star, it would return to the Earth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis hard to try. But if there be this compounded Motion in the great Bodies so high, such as is in the Earth, it is very likely that some heavy Bodies will be carried to them. But we shall never know it till we be at the like height.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What think you is the reason why a drop of Water (though heavy) will stand upon a Horizontal Plain of dry or unctuous Wood, and not spread it self upon it? For let A B (in the <hi>6th</hi> Figure) be the dry Plain, D the drop of Water, and D C perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to A B. The drop D (though higher) will not descend and spread it self upon it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The reason I think is manifest. For those Bodies which are made by beating of Water and Air together, shew plainly that the parts of Water have a great degree of Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. For the skin of the Bubble is Water, and yet it can keep the Air (though moved) from getting out. Therefore the whole drop
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93813:53"/>
of Water at D, hath a good deal of Cohesion of parts. And seeing A B is an Horizontal Plain, the way from the contact in D either to A or B is upwards, and consequently there is no endeavour in D either of those ways, but what proceeds from so much weight of Water as is able to break that Cohesion, which so small a drop is too weak to do. But the Cohesion being once broken, as with your Finger, the Water will follow.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Seeing the descent of a heavy Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth according to the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the aggregates of those num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>viz.</hi> of 1 and 3; and 1 and 3 and 5; and of 1 and 3 and 5 and 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are square numbers, namely 4. 9. 16, the whole swiftness of the descent will be, I think, to the aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of so many swiftnesses equal to the first Endeavour, as square numbers are to their sides, 1, 2, 3, 4. Is it so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, you know it hath been demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Galileo.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Then if (for instance) you put into a pair of Scales equal quantities of Quicksilver and Water, seeing they are both accelerated in the same proportion, why should not the weight of Quicksilver to the weight of Water be in duplicate proportions to their first En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Because they are in a pair Scales. For there the Motion of neither of them is accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93813:54"/>
And therefore it will be, as the first Endeavour of the Quicksilver to the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of the Water, so the whole weight to the whole weight. By which you may see, that the Cause which takes away the Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Liquid Bodies from Fish or other lighter Bodies within them, can never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the weight.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I have one Question more to ask con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gravity. If Gravity be (as some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it) <hi>an intrinsecal quality, whereby a Body descendeth towards the Center of the Earth,</hi> how is it possible that a piece of Iron that hath this intrinsecal quality, should rise from the Earth, to go to a Loadstone? Hath it also an intrinsecal quality to go from the Earth? It cannot be. The Cause therefore must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal. And because when they are come together in the Air, if you leave them to their own nature, they will fall down together, they must also have some like extrinsecal Cause. And so this magnetique vertue will be such another vertue as makes all other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Bodies to descend (in this our World) to the Earth. If therefore you can from this your Hypothesis of compounded Motion, by which you have so probably salved the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of Gravity, salve also this of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, I shall acknowledge both your Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis to be true, and your Conclusion to be well deduced.</p>

               <p>I think it not impossible. But I will proceed no further in it now, than (for the facilitating of the demonstrations) to tell you the several proprieties of the Magnet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am to shew the causes. As first, That Iron, and no other Body, at some little distance (though heavy) will rise to it. Secondly, That if it be laid upon a still Water in a float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vessel, and left to it self, it will turn it self till it lye in a Meridian, that is to say, with one and the same Line still North and South. Thirdly, If you take a long slender piece of Iron, and apply the Loadstone to it, and (according to the position of the Poles of the Loadstone) draw it over to the end of the Iron, the Iron will have the same Poles with the Magnet, so it be drawn with some pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; but the Poles will lye in a contrary Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; and also this long Iron will draw other Iron to it as the Magnet doth. Fourthly, This long Iron, if it be so small as that poiz'd upon a Pin, the weight of it have no visible Effect, the Navigators use it for the Needle of their Compass, because it points North and South; saving that in most places by particular accidents it is diverted; which diversion is called the variation of the Horizontal Needle. Fifthly, The same Needle placed in a Plain perpendicular to the Horizon, hath another Motion called the Inclination. Which that you may the better conceive, draw a fourth <note place="margin">Fig. 4.</note>

Figure; wherein let there be a Circle to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the <hi>Terrella,</hi> that is to say, a Spherical Magnet.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Let this be it, whose Center is A, the North Pole B, the South Pole C.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Join B C, and cross it at right Angles with the Diameter D E.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis done.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Upon the point D set the Needle paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to B C, with the cross for the South Pole, and the Barb for the North; and describe a Square about the Circle B D C E, and divide the arch D B into four equal parts in <hi>a, b, c.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Then place the middle of the Needle on the points <hi>a, b, c,</hi> so that they may freely turn; and set the Barb which is at D toward the North, and that which is at C towards the South. You see plainly by this, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of Inclination through the Arch D C taken all together, are double to a Right Angle. For when the South point of the Needle, looking North, as at D, comes to look South, as at C, it must make half a Circle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That is true. And if you draw the Sine of the Arch D <hi>a</hi> (which is <hi>d a)</hi> and the Sine of the Arch B <hi>a</hi> (which is <hi>a c)</hi> and the Sine of the Arch D <hi>b</hi> (which is <hi>b f)</hi> and the Sine of the Arch B <hi>c</hi> (which is <hi>c g)</hi> the Needle will lye upon <hi>b f</hi> with the North-point down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93813:55"/>
so that the Needle will be parallel to A D. Then from <hi>a</hi> draw the line <hi>a h,</hi> making the Angle <hi>e a h</hi> equal to the Angle D A <hi>a.</hi> And then the Needle at <hi>a</hi> shall lye in the line <hi>a h</hi> with the South point toward <hi>h.</hi> Finally, draw the line <hi>c h,</hi> which (with <hi>c g)</hi> will also make a quarter of a right Angle; and therefore if the Needle be plac'd on the point <hi>c</hi> it will lye in <hi>c h</hi> with the South point toward <hi>h.</hi> And thus you see by what degrees the Needle inclines or dips under the Horizon more and more from D till it come to the North Pole at B; where it will lye parallel to the Needle in D; but with their Barbs looking contrary ways. And this is certain by experience, and by none contradicted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You see then why the degrees of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatory Needle in coming from D to B are double to the degrees of a Quadrant. It is found also by experience, that Iron both of the Mine and of the Furnace put into a Vessel so as to float, will lay it self (if some accident in the Earth hinder it not) exactly North and South. And now I am, from this compounded Motion supposed by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> to derive the causes why a Loadstone draws Iron; why it makes Iron to do the same; why naturally it placeth it self in a parallel to the Axis of the Earth; why by passing it over the Needle it changes its Poles; and what is the cause that it inclines. But it is your part to remember

               <p>I Come now to hear what Natural Causes you can assign of the vertues of the Magnet; and first, why it draws Iron to it, and only Iron.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You know I have no other cause to assign but some local Motion, and that I never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of any argument drawn from Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Influence, Substantial Forms, or Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real <hi>Effluvia.</hi> For I am not, nor am accounted by my Antagonists for a Witch. But to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer this Question, I should describe the Globe of the Earth greater than it is at B in the first Figure, but that the <hi>Terrella</hi> in the fourth Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure will serve our turn. For 'tis but calling B and C the Poles of the Earth, and D E the Diameter of the Aequinoctial Circle, and making D the East, and E the West. And
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93813:56"/>
then you must remember that the Annual Motion of the Earth is from West to East, and compounded of a straight and circular Motion, so as that every point of it shall describe a small Circle from West to East, as is done by the whole Globe. And let the Circles about <hi>a b c</hi> be three of those small Circles.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Before you go any further, I pray you shew me how I must distinguish East and West in every part of this Figure. For wheresoever I am on Earth (suppose at <hi>London)</hi> and see the Sun rise (suppose in <hi>Cancer)</hi> is not a straight line from my Eye to the Sun termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the East?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis not due East, but partly East, partly South. For the Earth (being but a point compared to the Sun) all the parallels to D E the Aequator, such as are <hi>e a, f b, e g,</hi> if they be produced, will fall upon the Body of the Sun. And therefore A <hi>b</hi> is North-East; A <hi>a</hi> East North-East; And A <hi>c</hi> North North-East.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Proceed now to the Cause of Attraction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose now that the Internal parts of the Loadstone had the same Motion with that of the Internal parts of the Sun which make the Annual Motion of the Earth from West to East, but in a contrary way, for otherwise the Loadstone and the Iron can never be made to meet. Then set the Loadstone at a little distance from the Earth, marked with <hi>z;</hi> and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93813:57"/>
the Iron marked with <hi>x</hi> upon the superficies of the Earth. Now that which makes <hi>x</hi> rise to <hi>z,</hi> can be nothing else but Air; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing touches it but Air. And that which makes the Air to rise, can be nothing but those small circles made by the parts of the Earth (such as are at <hi>a b c,)</hi> for nothing else touches the Air. Seeing then the Motion of each point of the Loadstone is from East to West in Circles, and the motion of each point of the Iron from West to East; it follows, that the Air between the Loadstone and the Iron shall be cast off both East and West; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the place left empty, if the Iron did not rise up and fill it. Thus you see the Cause that maketh the Loadstone and the Iron to meet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Hitherto I assent. But why they should meet when some Heterogeneous Body lyes in the Air between them, I cannot imagine. And yet I have seen a Knife, though within the Sheath, attract one end of the Needle of a Mariners Compass; and have heard it will do the same though a Stone-wall were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Such Iron were indeed a very and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Loadstone. But the Cause of it is the same that causeth Fire or hot Water (which have the same compounded Motion) to work through a Vessel of Brass. For though the Motion be altered by restraint within the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93813:57"/>
Heterogeneous Body, yet being continued quite through it restores it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What is the Cause why the Iron rub'd over by a Loadstone will receive the vertue which the Loadstone hath of drawing Iron to it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Since the Motion that brings two Bodies to meet must have contrary ways, and that the Motions of the Internal parts of the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net and of the Iron are contrary; the rubbing of them together does not give the Iron the first Edeavour to rise, but multiplies it. For the Iron untouch'd will rise to a Loadstone; but if touch'd, it becomes a Loadstone to other Iron. For when they touch a piece of Iron they pass the Loadstone over it only one way, <hi>viz.</hi> from Pole to Pole; not back again, for that would undo what before had been done; also they press it in passing, to the very end of the Iron, and somewhat hard. So that by this pressing Motion all the small Circles about the points <hi>a b c,</hi> are turned the contrary way. And the halves of those small Circles made on the Arch D B will be taken away, and the Poles changed, so as that the North-Poles shall point South, and the South Poles North, as in the Figure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But how comes it to pass, that when a Loadstone hath drawn a piece of Iron, you may add to it another, as if they begat one another? Is there the like Motion in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Animals?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:93813:58"/>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I have told you that Iron of it self will rise to the Loadstone. Much more then will it adhere to it when it is armed with Iron, and both it and the Iron have a plain Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies. For then not only the points of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact will be many (which make the coherence stronger) but also the Iron wherewith it is armed is now another Loadstone, differing a little (which you perhaps think) as Male and Female. But whether this compounded Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confrication causeth the generation of Animals, how should I know, that never had so much leasure as to make any observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which might conduce to that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>My next Question is, seeing you say the Loadstone, or a Needle touch'd with it, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally respecteth the Poles of the Earth, but that the variation of it proceedeth from some accidents in the Superficies of the Earth; what are those accidents?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose there be a Hill upon the Earth (for example) at <hi>r;</hi> then the stream of the Air which was between <hi>z</hi> and <hi>x</hi> Westward, coming to the Hill, shall go up the Hills side, and so down to the other side, according to the crooked Line which I have mark'd about the Hill by points; and this infallibly will turn the North-point of the Needle, being on the East side, more toward the East, and that on the other side more towards the West, than if there had been no Hill. And where
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93813:58"/>
upon the Earth are there not Eminencies and depressions, except in some wide Sea, and a great way from Land?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But if that be true, the Variation in the same place should be always the same. For the Hills are not removed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The Variation of the Needle at the same place is still the same: but the Variation of the Variation is partly from the Motion of the Pole it self, which by the Astronomers is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Motus trepidationis;</hi> and partly from that, that the Variation cannot be truly observ'd: for the Horizontal Needle and the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Needle incline alike, but cannot incline in due quantity. For whether set upon a Pin or an Axis, their Inclination is hindred in the Horizontal Needle by the Pin it self. If upon an Axis, if the Axis be just, it cannot move; if slack, the weight will hinder it. But chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because the North Pole of the Earth draws away from it the North Pole of the Needle. For two like Poles cannot come together. And this is the cause why the Variation in one place is East, and another West.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>This is indeed the most probable reason why the Variation varies, that ever I heard given. And I should presently acknowledge that this parallel Motion of the Axis of the Earth in the Ecliptick, supposed by <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> is the true Annual Motion of the Earth, but that there is lately come forth a Book
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93813:59"/>
called <hi>Longitude found,</hi> which makes the Magnetical Poles distant from the Poles of the Earth eight Degrees and a half.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I have the Book. 'Tis far from being demonstrated, as you shall find if you have the patience to see it examined. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever his demonstration is true, the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (if rightly inferred) will be this, that the Poles of the Loadstone and the Poles of the Earth are the same. And where on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary his demonstrations are fallacies, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sometimes he fancieth the Lines he hath drawn, not where they are; sometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he mistakes his station; and sometimes because he goes on some false Principle of Natural Philosophy; and sometimes also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knoweth not sufficiently the Doctrine of Spherical Triangles.</p>

               <p>I find first <hi>(Pag.</hi> 4.) that the ground of his Argument are the two observations made by Mr. <hi>Burroughs;</hi> one at <hi>Vaygates,</hi> in 1676, where the Variation from the Pole of the Earth he found to be 11 deg. 15 min. East; the other at <hi>Lime-house</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> in 1580, where the Variation from the Pole of the Earth was 8 deg. 38 min. West.

               <p>In 70 Degrees of North Latitude, the difference of Longitude between <hi>London</hi> and it being 58 Degrees.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The Longitude of places being yet to seek, how came he to know this difference of 58 Degrees, except the Poles of the Magnet and the Earth be the same?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I believe he trusted to the Globe for that. For the distance between the places is not above 2000 Miles the nearest way. But we will pass by that, and come to his Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and to his Diagram, wherein L is <hi>London,</hi> P the North-Pole of the Earth, V <hi>Vaygates.</hi> So that L P is 38 deg. 28 min. P V 20 deg. the Angle L P V 58 deg. for the difference between the Longitudes of <hi>Vaygates</hi> and <hi>London.</hi> This is the Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But before I come to the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have an Inference to draw from these observations, which is this. Because in the same year the Variation at <hi>London</hi> was 11 deg. 15 min. East, and at <hi>Vaygates</hi> 8 deg. 38 min. West; If you substract 11 deg. 15 min. from the Arc L P; and 8 deg. 38 min. from the Arc L V, the Variation on both sides will be taken away; so that P V being the Meridian of <hi>Vaygates,</hi> and L P the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of <hi>London,</hi> they shall both of them meet in P the Pole of the Earth. And if the Pole of the Magnet be nearer to the Zenith of <hi>London</hi> than is the Pole of the Earth, it shall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93813:60"/>
be just as much nearer to the Zenith of <hi>Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates</hi> in the Meridian of <hi>Vaygates</hi> which is P V; as is manifest by the Diurnal Motion of the Earth.</p>

               <p>All this I conceive without difficulty. Proceed to the Demonstration.</p>

               <p>Mark well now. His words are these, <hi>(Pag. 5.) From P L V substract 11 deg. 15 min. and there remains the Angle V L M.</hi> Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der now which is the Angle P L V, and which is the remaining Angle V L M, and tell what you understand by it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He has mark'd the Angle P L V with two numbers, 11 deg. 15 min. and 21 deg. 50 min. which together make 33 deg. 5 min. And the Angle 11 deg. 15 min. being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from P L V, there will remain 21 deg. 50 min. for the Angle V L M. I know not what to say to it. For I thought the Arc P V, which is 20 deg. had been the Arc of the Spherical Angle P L V; and that the Arc L V had been 58 deg. because he says the Angle L P V is so; and that the Arc L M had been 46 deg. because the Angle L P M is so; and lastly, that the Angle P L M had been 8 deg. 30 min. because the Arc P M is so.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>And what you thought had been true, if a Spherical Angle were a very Angle. For all Men that have written of Spherical Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles take for the ground of their calculation (as <hi>Regiomontanus, Copernicus,</hi> and <hi>Clavius,)</hi>

that the Arch of a Spherical Angle is the side opposite to the Angle. You should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered also that he makes the Angle V P M 12 deg. but sets down no Arc to answer it. But that you may find I am in the right, look into the Definitions which <hi>Clavius</hi> hath put down before his Treatise of <hi>Spherical Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles,</hi> and amongst them is this; <hi>The Arc of a Spherical Triangle is a part of a great Circle intercepted between the two sides drawn from the Pole of the said great Circle.</hi>

               <p>The Book is nothing worth; for it is impossible to substract an Arc of a Circle out of a Spherical Angle. And I see besides that he takes the Superficies that lyeth between the sides L P and L M for an Arch, which is the quantity of an Angle; and is a Line, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken out of a Superficies. I wonder how any Man that pretends to Mathematicks could be so much mistaken.</p>

               <p>'Tis no great wonder. For <hi>Clavius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self striving to maintain that a right Angle is greater than the Angle made by the Diameter and the Circumference, fell into the same errour. A corner (in Vulgar Speech,) and an Angle (in the Language of Geometry) are not the same thing. But it is easie even for a learned Man sometimes to take them for the same, as this Author now has done; and proceeding he saith, <hi>Substract 8 deg. 38 min. from the Angle P V L, and there remains the Angle L V M.</hi>

               <p>The same misunderstanding of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Spherical Angle. Which appears further in this, that when he knew the Arc V P was part of a great Circle, he thought V M (which he maketh 8 deg. 30 min.) were also parts of a great Circle; which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly false. For two great Circles (because they pass through the Center) do cut each other into halves. But P V is not half a Circle. He sure thought himself at <hi>Vaygates,</hi> and that P M V was equal to P V, although in the same Hemisphere.</p>

               <p>Thus. <hi>We have in two Triangles, P L M and P V M, two sides and one Angle included, to find P M the distance of the Magnetical Pole from the Pole of the Earth 8 deg. 30 min.</hi>

               <p>Is that all? 'Tis very short for a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of two so difficult Problems, as the quantity of 8 deg. 30 min. and of the place of the Magnetical Pole. But he has proved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing till he has shew'd how he found it. And though P M be 8 deg. 30 min. it follows not that M is the Magnetical Pole.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Nor is it true. For if P M be 8 deg. 30 min. and V M 8 deg. 38 min. the whole Arc P M V will be 17 deg. 8 min. which should be 20 deg. Besides, whereas the Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

               <p>I am satisfied that the Magnetical Poles and the Poles of the Earth are the same. But thus much I confess, that if they were not the same, the Longitude were found.

                  <hi>The Earth being a solid Body, and the Magnetick Sphere that encompasseth the Earth being a substance that hath not solidity to keep pace with the Earth, looseth in its Motion. And that may be the Cause of the Motion of the Magnetick Poles from East to West.</hi>

               <p>This is very fine, and unexpected. The Magnetick Sphere (which I took for a Globe made of a Magnet) has not solidity to keep pace with the Earth, though it be one of the hardest Stones that are. <hi>It encompasseth the Earth;</hi> yet I thought nothing had encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Earth but Air in which I breath and move. By this also the whole Earth must be a Loadstone. For two Bodies cannot be in one place. So that he is yet no further than Dr. <hi>Gilbert</hi> whom he sleights. And if the Sphere be a Magnet, then the Earth and Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone have the same Poles.

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>None at all. For the Magnet lying upon the Earth, can have no Motion at all but what the Earth and the Air give it. And because it is always at 8 deg. 30 min. distance from the Pole of the Earth, the Earth can give it no other Motion than what it gives to its own Poles by the precession of the Aequinoctial points. Nor can the Air give it any Motion but by its Stream; which must needs vary when the Stream varieth. But what a vast difference does he make between the period of the Motion of the Aequinoctial points, which are about or near 36000 years accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Copernicus (Lib. 3. Cap.</hi> 6.) which makes the Annual precession to be 36 seconds, and the period of the Magnetical Poles Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is but 600 years.</p>

               <p>He comes now <hi>(Pag.</hi> 15.) to the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory Needle upon a Spherical Loadstone. Where he shews, by Diagram, that the Needle and the Instrument together moved toward the Magnetical Pole, make the sum of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations equal to two Quadrants, setting the North-point of the Needle Southward. Which I confess is true. But (in the same Page) he ascribeth the same Motion to the Earth in these words: <hi>As the Horizontal Needle hath a double Motion about the Round Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone or Terrulla, so also the Inclinatory Needle hath a double Motion about the Earth.</hi> What is this, but a confession that the Poles of the Magnet and of the Earth are the same?</p>

               <p>Besides, seeing he placeth the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Pole at M in the Meridian of <hi>Vaygates,</hi> the Needle being touch'd shall Incline to the Pole of the Earth which is P, as well there as at <hi>London,</hi> and make the North-Pole of the Earth point South.</p>

               <p>'Tis certain, because he puts both the Magnetical Pole and the Pole of the Earth in the same Meridian of the Earth.

               <p>I think they are in the Superficies of the Magnet, as the Pole of the Earth is in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Earth.

Which is by some Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Cause in the Earth; and their Motion, as I formerly said, is a forced Motion, and not Natural.</hi>

               <p>He has clearly overthrown his main Doctrine.

what he had said of <hi>Normans</hi> Invention of the Inclinatory Needle by the inclining of the Horizontal Needle, <hi>Pag.</hi> 11.

Suppose A <hi>c</hi> to be the Needle, shall it not incline, as well here as at D <hi>a,</hi> and the Variation B <hi>c</hi> be Easterly? Again, D <hi>a</hi> is 11 deg. 15 min. and the Needle in D parallel to A B, and at <hi>a</hi> inclining also 11 deg. 15 min. Westerly.

               <p>But the West-Indies are not in this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere B C D E. The Variation therefore will proceed in an Arc of the opposite Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere, which is Westerly.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I think it can never be done by the Art of Man. For as I said of Hard and Heavy Bodies in the Creation, so I think of Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, that the very same Individual Body which was not Transparent then, shall never be made Transparent by Humane Art.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Do not you see that every day Men make Glass, and other Diaphanous Bodies not much inferior in beauty to the fairest Gems?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is one thing to make one Transparent of many by mixture, and another to make Transparent of not Transparent. Any very hard Stone, if it be beaten into small Sands,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93813:65"/>
such as is used for Hour-Glasses, every one of those Sands, if you look upon it with a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscope, you will find to be Transparent; and the harder and whiter the Sone is, so much the more Transparent, as I have seen in the Stone of which are made Milstones, which Stone is here called Greet. And I doubt not but the Sands of white Marble must be more Transparent. But there are no Sands so Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent that they have not a scurf upon them as hard, perhaps, as the Stone it self; which they whose profession it is to make Glass, have the Art to scour and wash away. And therefore I think it no great wonder to bring those Sands into one Lump, though I know not how they do it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I know they do it with Lie made with a Salt extracted from the Ashes of an Herb, of which Salt they make a strong Lie, and mingle it with the Sand, and then bake it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Like enough. But still it is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of two Transparent Bodies, whereof one is the Natural Stone, the other is the Morter. This therefore doth not prove, that one and the same Body, of not Transparent can be made Transparent.</p>

And, it may be the true Chrystal of the Mountain, which is found in great pieces in the <hi>Alps,</hi> is but a compound of many small ones, and made by the Earths Annual Motion. For it is a very swift Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Suppose now that within a very small Cavern of those Rocks whose smallest Atomes are Chrystal, and the Cavity fill'd with Air; and consider what a tumult would be made by the swift reciprocation of that Air; whether it would not in time separate those Atomes from the Rock, and jumbling them together make them rub off their scruf from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by little and little to touch one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in polish'd plains, and consequently stick together, till in length of time they become one lump of clean Chrystal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I believe that the least parts of created substances lay mingled together at first, till it pleased God to separate all dissimilar natures, and congregate the similar, to which this <hi>Annual Motion</hi> is proper. But they say that Chrystal is found in the open Air hanging like Icicles upon the Rocks. Which (if true) defeats this supposition of a narrow Cavern. And therefore I must have some further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it before I make it my opinion. But howsoever, it still holds true that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93813:66"/>
Bodies of all sorts, in their least parts, were made by God in the beginning of the World. But it may be true, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Icicles. For the force of the Air that could break off those Diaphanous Atomes in a Cavern, can do the same in the open Air. And I know that a less force of Air can break some Bodies into small pieces, not much less hard than Chystal, by corrupting them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That which you now have said is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what. But I deny not the possibility, but only doubt of the Operation. You may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pass to some other Question.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I will ask you then a Question about Refraction. I know already that for the Cause of Refraction (when the Light falleth through a thinner Medium upon a thicker) you assign the resistance of the thicker Body; but you do not mean there by <hi>Rarum</hi> and <hi>Densum,</hi> two Bodies whereof in equal spaces one has more substance in it than the other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No. For equal spaces contain equal Bodies. But I mean by <hi>Densum</hi> any Body which more resisteth the Motion of the Air, and by <hi>Rarum</hi> that which resisteth less.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But you have not declared in what that resistance consisteth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I suppose it proceedeth from the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But from thence it will follow, that all Transparent Bodies that equally refract are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93813:67"/>
equally Hard. Which I think is not true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Refraction of Glass is not greater (at least in comparison of their Hardnesses) than that of Water.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I confess it. Therefore I think we must take in Gravity to a Share in the production of this Refraction. For I never considered Refraction but in Glass; because my business then was only to find the Causes of the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of Telescopes and Microscopes. Let therefore A B (in <hi>Fig.</hi> 7.) be a hard, and consequently, a heavy Body. And from above (as from the Sun) let C A be the line of Incidence, and produced to D. And draw A E perpendicular to A B. It is manifest that the Hardness in A B shall turn the stream of the Light inwards toward A E, suppose in the line A <hi>e.</hi> It is also evident that the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in B, which is (being heavy) down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, shall turn the stream again inward, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards A E as in A <hi>b.</hi> Thus it is in Refracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Sun downwards. In like manner, if the light come from below, as from a Candle in the point D, the line of Incidence will be D A, and produced will pass to C. And the resistance of the Hardness in A will turn the stream A C inward, suppose into B <hi>l,</hi> and make C <hi>l</hi> equal to D <hi>e.</hi> For passing into a thinner Medium, it will depart from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular in an Angle equal to the Angle D A <hi>e,</hi> by which it came nearer to it in A <hi>e.</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:93813:67"/>
So also the resistance of the Gravity in the point A shall turn the stream of the Light into the line A <hi>i,</hi> and make the Angle <hi>l</hi> A <hi>i</hi> equal to the Angle <hi>e</hi> A <hi>b.</hi> And thus you see in what manner, though not in what proportion Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Gravity conjoyn their resistance in the Causing of Refraction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But you proved yesterday, that a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Body does not Gravitate upon a Body equally heavy. Now this A B has upper parts, and lower parts; and if the upper parts do not Gravitate upon the lower parts, how can there be any Endeavour at all downward to contribute to the Refraction?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I told you yesterday, that when a heavy Body was set upon another Body heavier or harder than it self, the Endeavour of it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was diverted another way, but not that it was extinguished. But in this case, where it lyeth upon Air, the first endeavour of the lowest part worketh downward. For neither Motion nor Body can be utterly extinguished by a less than an Omnipotent power. All Bodies as long as they are Bodies, are in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one way or other, though the farther it be communicated, so much the less.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But since you hold that Motion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated through all Bodies, how hard or heavy soever they be, I see no Cause but that all Bodies should be Transparent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>There are divers Causes that take away
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93813:68"/>
Transparency. First, if the Body be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Homogeneous, that is to say, if the smallest parts of it be not all precisely of the same nature, or do not so touch one another as to leave no <hi>Vacuum</hi> within it; or though they touch, if they be not as hard in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact as in any other line. For then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractions will be so changed both in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and in their strength, as that no Light shall come through it to the Eye; as in Wood and ordinary Stone and Metal. Secondly, The Gravity and hardness may be so great, as to make the Angle refracted so great, as the second Refraction shall not direct the beam of light to the Eye; as if the Angle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction were D A E, the Refracted line would be perpendicular to A B, and never come to the line A D, in which is the Eye.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>To know how much of the Refraction is due to the Hardness, and how much to the Gravity, I believe it is impossible, though the Quantity of the whole be easily measured in a Diaphanous Body given. And both you and Mr. <hi>Warner</hi> have demonstrated, that as the Sine of the Angle Refracted in one Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to the Sine of the Angle Refracted in another Inclination, so is the Sine of one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the Sine of the Angle of the other Inclination. Which Demonstrations are both published by <hi>Mersennus</hi> in the end of the first Volume of his <hi>Cogitata Physico-Mathematica.</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:93813:68"/>
But since there be many Bodies, through which though there pass Light enough, yet no Object appears through them to the Eye, what is the reason of that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You mean Paper. For Paper-Windows will enlighten a Room, and yet not show the Image of an Object without the Room. But 'tis because there are in Paper abundance of pores, through which the Air passing moveth the Air within; by the Reflections whereof any thing within may be seen. And in the same Paper there are again as many parts not Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent, through which the Air cannot pass, but must be reflected first to all parts of the Object, and from them again to the Paper; and at the Paper either reflected again or transmitted, according as it falls upon Pores or not Pores; so that the Light from the Object can never come together at the Eye.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>There belongs yet to this Subject the Causes of the diversity of Colours. But I am so well satisfied with that which you have written of it in the <hi>24th</hi> Chapter of your Book <hi>de Corpore,</hi> that I need not trouble you further in it. And now I have but one Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion more to ask you, which I thought upon last night. I have read in an antient Historian that Living Creatures after a great deluge were produced by the Earth, which being then very soft, there were bred in it (it may be by the rapid Motion of the Sun) many Blisters,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93813:69"/>
which in time breaking, brought forth (like so many Eggs) all manner of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures great and small, which since it is grown hard it cannot do. What think you of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is true that the Earth produced the first living Creatures of all sorts but Man. For God said, <hi>(Gen. 1. vers. 24.) Let the Earth produce every living Creature, Cattle, and creeping thing,</hi> &amp;c. But then again <hi>(ver.</hi> 25.) it is said that <hi>God made the Beast of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. So that it is evident that God gave unto the Earth that vertue. Which vertue must needs consist in Motion, because all Generation is Motion. But Man, though the same day, was made afterward.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why hath not the Earth the same vertue now? Is not the Sun the same it was? Or is there no Earth now soft enough?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. And it may be the Earth may yet produce some very small Living Creatures: And perhaps Male and Female. For the smallest Creatures which we take notice of, do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender, though they do not all by conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; therefore if the Earth produce living Creatures at this day, God did not absolutely rest from all his Works on the seventh day, but (as it is <hi>Cap. 2. ver. 2.) he rested from all the work he had made.</hi> And therefore it is no harm to think that God worketh still, and when and where and what he pleaseth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, 'tis very hard to believe, that to produce
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93813:69"/>
Male and Female, and all that belongs thereto, as also the several and curious Organs of Sense and Memory, could be the work of any thing that had not understanding. From whence, I think we may conclude, that whatsoever was made after the Creation, was a new Creature made by God no therwise than the first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were, excepting only Man.</p>

               <p>They are then in an Errour that think there are no more different kinds of Animals in the World now, than there were in the Ark of <hi>Noah.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes doubtless. For they have no Text of Scripture from which it can be proved.</p>

               <p>The Questions of Nature which I could yet propound are innumerable. And since I cannot go through them, I must give over somewhere, and why not here? For I have troubled you enough, though I hope you will forgive me.</p>

               <p>So God forgive us both as we do one another. But forget not to take with you the Demonstration of a straight Line equal to an Arc of a Circle.</p>
