         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe Iſle of Great Britain is Bounded on the South with <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> upon the Eaſt with <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> upon the Weſt with <hi>Ireland</hi> and the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, and upon the North with the vaſt <hi>Deucalidon</hi> Seas.</p>
               <p>The ancient Government of Great Britain was at firſt rather after the manner of an <hi>Ariſtocratie,</hi> that is by certain great Nobles and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men, or Petty Kings, ſo <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe found the ſtate of Britain.</p>
               <p>The Glorious Romans that were become Lords of the world, were the firſt that ſet foot with diſplayed Enſign for the Conqueſt of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the firſt that Aſſayed this was <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> from the coaſts of <hi>Gallia.</hi> But this Jewel which was ſo much deſired and had been kept with as great Care, after 500. years claim was now laid at ſtake to the that could win it, and thus was Britain abandoned by the Romans.</p>
               <p>The next Actors upon Britains ſtage were the <hi>Saxons,</hi> a People of <hi>Germany</hi> fierce, bold, and irreligious, theſe infeſted the coaſts of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by Piracies.</p>
               <p>But Britain being through Tumultuous uprores much waſted by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> Ancient Enemies, and albeit the ſtone wall that was raiſed athwart the whole continent to impeach their inroads, yet that availed little, their aſſaults were ſo great whereupon the <hi>Saxons</hi> were ſent for, and in their firſt ſervice freed the Britains from thoſe raging <hi>Picts,</hi> and undertook the Lands defence, and the inhabitants conſented to maintaine the charge which was received thankfully whilſt it was giving onely; for they emptied faſter then the Britains could fill, and ever complained they had not enough, till at laſt by ſurprize they got the whole poſſeſſion, and then was the Britiſh Iſle devided into an Heptarchie, or of one Imperial Crown they had ſeven Diadems to adorne their own heads; which were not long worne, without inteſtine warrs, each ſtriving to in large his own.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Egbert</hi> forbad the Iſlands old name, and commanded theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces to be called <hi>Anglia.</hi> Yet almoſt as ſoon as this was accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a ſavage Nation the <hi>Danes</hi> ſucceed, which endeavoured all they could to impoveriſh where they had poſſeſſion for five and twenty years. Theſe Danes were a People deſcended from the Scythians, as <hi>Andrew Velley</hi> a Daniſh Writer reporteth but <hi>Dudo</hi> of Saint <hi>Quintin</hi> wil have them come from <hi>Scandia</hi> an Iſland ſcituate Northward, not far from the continent of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Normans</hi> a people fierce and valorous; <hi>William</hi> the Baſtard, won the Engliſh Crown from King <hi>Harold,</hi> that held it in a bloody field at battail in <hi>Suſſex.</hi> And by changing laws, diſinheriting of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and beſtowing the Lands revenues upon his, he laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of a glorious Monarchy; His two younger ſucceſſively wearing it, to the prejudice of their elder; <hi>Stephen</hi> having no right, but ſuch as intruders pretend.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Henry Plantagenet</hi> placed on the Throne. 331 years taken up in the Reigns of 14 Kings of his line; but theſe branches were torn down by home-bred broyls, till <hi>Teuder</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> with <hi>Plantagenet</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> gave them ſap by marriage, whereby the long dead ſtem began to bud forth, and five renowned Princes of that name ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>The firſt of them, the richeſt and wiſeſt King of this Weſtern world; <hi>viz. Henry</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, the wonder of the Papal Authority; <hi>Henry</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>The third, the hopefulleſt in pious actions; <hi>Edward</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>The fourth, fervent for <hi>Romes</hi> Religion; Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>

               <p>The fifth renowned, Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> under whoſe Reigns one hundred and ſixteen years did compleatly run.</p>
