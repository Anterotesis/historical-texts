            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS <hi>Deſcription</hi> of the <hi>King's Palace,</hi> and <hi>Gardens</hi> at <hi>Loo,</hi> was moſt of it written at the Command of our late moſt <hi>Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Queen, of ever Glorious Memory,</hi> who was not diſpleaſed with the Sight of it; and who, though ſhe Honoured this <hi>Royal Fabrick</hi> with the laying its <hi>firſt Stone,</hi> yet could never have the Pleaſure of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it Perfected: The <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Good Queen</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence being, during the War, moſt Neceſſary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Kingdom, whilſt His <hi>Majeſty</hi> expoſed His <hi>Royal Perſon</hi> in the Field, for the Preſervation of us all, and for the Benefit of Mankind; and did ſo eminently ſignalize himſelf abroad, that all the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Virtues</hi> which are reported in Hiſtory to have belong'd unto any the moſt Renowned of the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Grecian Heroes,</hi> have been evidently conſpicuous, and United together in His <hi>Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since this <hi>Deſcription</hi> was firſt written, it has been Corrected and Enlarged, by the frequent Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities I have had, of walking over the <hi>Gardens,</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:101429:3"/>the five Years time that I had the Honour to wait upon His <hi>Majeſty</hi> abroad. And the Reading it muſt give ſome Diverſion to the Curious, as the Writing it was pleaſing to me. Alſo <hi>Perſons</hi> of <hi>Quality,</hi> and Great Fortunes, may here find many things to <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,</hi> and alſo to <hi>Imitate,</hi> if they pleaſe, when they are taking their Summer Diverſions at their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Seats.</p>
            <p>As for what I add, in the <hi>Account</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> I ſhall only tell you, I conſidered that a <hi>Deſcription</hi> cannot poſſibly repreſent things with that pleaſure and advantage, as they are Seen upon the Place; and I thought a few <hi>Common Obſervations</hi> I made in <hi>Holland,</hi> and which I have recollected upon the <hi>Printing</hi> this <hi>Deſcription,</hi> would not be unacceptable to ſome Perſons, for <hi>Variety ſake;</hi> though I have been guilty of many Omiſſions, rather than I would be tedious, by <hi>Conſulting Authors,</hi> or reciting any of their <hi>Obſervations,</hi> who have taken Pains upon this Subject, and been more large and accurate in their Performances.</p>

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> indeed have beſtowed their Muniſicence chiefly in laſting Monuments of their Piety, in erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abundance of the Nobleſt <hi>Cathedrals</hi> that can any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where be ſeen.

               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Majeſty</hi> is poſſeſſed of many Noble and Stately <hi>Palaces</hi> both at home and abroad. <hi>Kenſington</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> are too well known to be more than

I cannot but wiſh this laſt were nearer to <hi>London,</hi> or were thereby better ſituated for His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>'s Convenience.

And others have aſſured me, that in Fifty Years paſt, there have not died above four or five of that Excellent Seminary of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and moſt of thoſe too by Violent Accidents, not by Epidemical Diſeaſes. The which is a Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worthy of the thoughts of ſuch Parents, who would do their utmoſt to preſerve their Poſterity, and are deſirous to breed their Children in the <hi>beſt School</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>

The <hi>Royal Palace</hi> and <hi>Gardens</hi> at <hi>Loo</hi> are the Subject of the enſuing Diſcourſe. I will only mention <hi>Dieren,</hi> an Ancient Seat of the moſt <hi>Illuſtrious Houſe</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> five Leagues from <hi>Loo; Honſlaer-Dike,</hi> two Leagues from the <hi>Hague; Soeſtdike,</hi> not far from <hi>Utrecht;</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Breda,</hi> made much more Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious of late by His <hi>Majeſly; Ryſwick</hi> the auſpicious Place of Treaty of Peace, and now rendred everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly famous by the concluſion of a <hi>Peace</hi> ſo Happy and ſo Honourable to the greateſt part of <hi>Europe.</hi> All
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101429:8"/>which <hi>Palaces</hi> (except the laſt, where the King has never reſided, it being ſo near the <hi>Hague</hi>) do remain nobly furniſhed for His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s reception, and have <hi>Gardens</hi> belonging to them that might merit a diſtinct Deſcription.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Buildings</hi> or themſelves, howſoever Noble and Great, do appear very deficient without the Ornament and Conveniencies of a <hi>Garden. Italy,</hi> the <hi>Garden</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and the great Repoſitory of Rarities and Antiquities, does now as much glory and pride her ſelf in the Pomp, and Ornaments, and Conveniencies belonging to her <hi>Gardens,</hi> as in any of her ſo much celebrated Curioſities. It is certainly one of the moſt innocent and ſweeteſt Diverſions that can be deſired; it gives eaſy opportunities for Retirement and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and conduces to the obtaining a chearful tranquillity of mind, and to the preſervation of a healthful temper of Body. It is a delight and ſatisſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to which ſome of the <hi>Greateſt Princes</hi> and <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in all Ages have had recourſe, after they had been ſatiated and cloy'd with the pleaſures and Vanities of the World, or had been tired with the Croſſes and Diſappointments, the Vexations and Troubles, which do neceſſarily attend all Conditions of Life. And if there be any tolerable ſhare of <hi>Happineſſ</hi> and <hi>Content</hi> to be any where enjoyed by an Innocent Man, out of the hurry and noiſe of the World, a compleat and ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Garden,</hi> furniſhed with variety of <hi>Walks</hi> and <hi>Groves,</hi> and adorned with <hi>Fountains, Caſcades, Grottoes,</hi> &amp;c. muſt do very much towards the obtaining even a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> upon Earth.</p>
               <p>The Gardens of <hi>Loo</hi> are become ſo famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable to all the <hi>Provinces</hi> near them, that Curious Perſons from divers Parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> as well as out

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101429:9"/>at the end of this Treatiſe, in the Seventh Chapter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>New Palace,</hi> lately built by His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> is near unto the <hi>Old Hoof,</hi> or <hi>Old Court,</hi> which is a <hi>Caſtle</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a broad Moat, and purchaſed about 12 or 14 Years ago from the <hi>Seigneur de Laeckhuyſen,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of this Country. They are ſeparated from one another only by ſome of the <hi>Gardens,</hi> which lye on the Weſt-ſide of the <hi>New Palace.</hi> The <hi>Gardens</hi> are moſt Sumptuous and Magnificent, adorned with great variety of moſt Noble <hi>Fountains, Caſcades, Parterres, Gravel Walks,</hi> and <hi>Green Walks, Groves, Statues, Urns, Paintings, Seats,</hi> and pleaſant Proſpects into the Country.</p>
               <p>Before the <hi>Gate</hi> that enters into the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> there is a broad Green <hi>Walk</hi> between a double row of Oaks, half a mile long; and at the end of this Walk next to the <hi>Heath,</hi> there is a <hi>Gate</hi> of Iron Rails between double Stone <hi>Pillars</hi> of an <hi>Ancient</hi> Model, the <hi>Pillars</hi> being about a yard diſtant from each other, and joined at the top by a <hi>Crown Work</hi> on each ſide, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is cut His <hi>Majeſty's Cypher,</hi> and at the bottom by a Stone Ground-work, or <hi>Supporters.</hi> The <hi>Golumns</hi> are of a good heighth. Before this Gate there are <hi>three Walks</hi> between <hi>Trees</hi> for a Mile, or more, farther into the <hi>Heath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the South-ſide of the <hi>Palace</hi> we do enter through a large <hi>Gate</hi> of Iron Bars, painted Blew and Gildel, into a <hi>Quadrangular Court,</hi> of which the whole Sought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide hath Iron Rails alike Painted and Gilded. The Rails are placed on a low Brick Wall that is covered with Free-ſtone the whole length, five Inches above the Brick. Among theſe Iron Rails, which do riſe above eight Foot higher than the Wall, there are at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101429:10"/>due diſtance eight and twenty <hi>Pilaſters,</hi> every one of them of <hi>one entire Stone.</hi> The Eaſt-ſide of the <hi>Court</hi> does contain Offices and Chambers for the <hi>Officers</hi> and Servants of His <hi>Majeſty's Houſhold.</hi> On the Weſt-ſide of the <hi>Court</hi> are the <hi>King's Stables,</hi> and in theſe are kept <hi>Horſes</hi> for His <hi>Majeſty's own riding.</hi> And at the end of this <hi>Stable,</hi> adjoining to the Rails before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, there is another <hi>double Stable</hi> for His <hi>Majeſty's other Horſes,</hi> and for thoſe of ſome of his Servants, extended Weſtward about eighty Paces on the Road that comes from <hi>Utrecht.</hi> At the other end of the Rails, or adjoining to the Eaſt-ſide of the <hi>Court,</hi> upon the Road, there is another Row of <hi>Building,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the <hi>Stables,</hi> containing a Guard-houſe, a large <hi>Orangery,</hi> or Green-houſe, the <hi>King's Coach-houſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the <hi>Court</hi> there is a <hi>Fountain,</hi> whoſe Baſin conſiſts of a wrought blew Stone, and whoſe Stone-work is raiſed two Foot and a half high. In the middle of this <hi>Fountain</hi> there are four Marble <hi>Dolphins,</hi> out of whoſe Mouths do fall four Sheets of Water, to the Eaſt, Weſt, North and South. The <hi>Dolphins</hi> are placed upon a Marble Pedeſtal; their Tails are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſted, and turned upward in the middle of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal. But this <hi>Fountain</hi> has been ordered to be changed into a Noble <hi>Caſcade,</hi> in a octangular Baſin, ſeven yards <hi>diameter.</hi> Next unto the Walk that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſes this <hi>Fountain,</hi> there are in this <hi>Court</hi> four <hi>Gazons,</hi> or Green Plots, with Walks on every ſide pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Brick.</p>
               <p>On the North-ſide of the <hi>Court</hi> in the <hi>King's Palace,</hi> to which we aſcend by nine broad Stone-ſteps. The <hi>Palace</hi> is built of Brick, and had the Honour to have its firſt Stone laid by the hands of the moſt <hi>Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101429:10"/>and <hi>Beſt</hi> of <hi>Queens,</hi> her late <hi>Majeſty</hi> of ever Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Memory. From the <hi>Front,</hi> or <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> each <hi>Wing</hi> does ſtretch out in two <hi>Pavilious</hi> towards the two ſides of the <hi>Court,</hi> until the <hi>Wings</hi> and <hi>Sides</hi> do come to unite. Beſides the <hi>Gate</hi> in the middle of the <hi>Front,</hi> there are two others in the two outmoſt <hi>Pavilious.</hi> Over the Gate of the Front, and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Gate, and over the two outmoſt <hi>Pavilions,</hi> there are <hi>Frontiſpieces,</hi> or <hi>Relievos</hi> on high, with Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions relating to <hi>Hunting.</hi> The <hi>Pilaſters</hi> of all the Gates or Doors, the <hi>Frize,</hi> and the <hi>Corniſhes</hi> of the Windows, do conſiſt of Free-ſtone. The <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Palace</hi> is Leaded above, and adorned with Balliſters; and it has large Shaſh-windows throughout. The <hi>Hall</hi> we do firſt enter into, is paved with very large Black and White Marble. The <hi>Dining-room</hi> below is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable throughout, and eſpecially in its <hi>Marble</hi> and Military <hi>Devices,</hi> and glorious <hi>Gilding.</hi> The <hi>Great Room</hi> above, that we do firſt enter into from the <hi>Stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,</hi> and in the middle of the Apartments, is not only adorned with large <hi>Landskips,</hi> as well as the <hi>Stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,</hi> but is very reſplendent with its <hi>Gilding</hi> on every ſide, and throughout all the <hi>Cieling.</hi> The <hi>Rooms</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and the <hi>Bed-chambers,</hi> and other <hi>Chambers,</hi> are all provided and furniſhed after the Nobleſt manner, for the entertainment and reception of <hi>Great Perſons.</hi> But the <hi>Antichamber</hi> to His <hi>Majeſty's Bed-chamber</hi> has moſt excellent <hi>Hangings,</hi> repreſenting the Functions or Duties of <hi>Cavalry,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Incampment</hi> of <hi>Horſe,</hi> their <hi>Foraging,</hi> their making of <hi>Faſcines,</hi> and the <hi>Firing</hi> it ſelf of two Parties of <hi>Horſe</hi> in an Engagement, moſt lively and naturally expreſt, in four ſeveral Pieces. The <hi>Chappel</hi> is handſomely Wainſcoted, and the whole ſo compleatly finiſhed, that nothing can be ſaid to be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101429:11"/>wanting, and no Coſt ſpared in order to render the <hi>Houſe Magniſcient,</hi> as well as the <hi>Gardens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we have gone through the <hi>Hall</hi> of the <hi>Palace,</hi> and advanced between a very large <hi>Stair-caſe</hi> on either hand, we do come to the <hi>garden-Gate,</hi> which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly before the Entrance, and conſiſts of Iron Bars coriouſly wrought and painted.</p>
               <p>But before I deſcribe particularly any of the <hi>Gardens,</hi> it may not be amiſs to take a ſhort and general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them, as alſo to name ſome of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>Fountains</hi> and <hi>Caſcades</hi> in them, that thereby the whole may in ſome of its Particulars be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly comprehended.</p>
               <p>On the North-ſide of the <hi>Palace,</hi> there is a large and moſt <hi>Magniſicent Garden,</hi> the which is divided into two Parts, the <hi>Lower Garden,</hi> and the <hi>Upper:</hi> the two Diviſions being ſeparated by <hi>Canals,</hi> by a low Wall, and a broad Croſs-walk, in the which Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk there are on each ſide a double row of tall Oaks; but in the middle of this Walk a Conſiderable ſpace is left open, without Trees, for the more convenient view of all the <hi>Fountains,</hi> the <hi>Porticoes,</hi> and the <hi>Caſcades,</hi> that are beyond the ſaid Walk, from the <hi>Garden-Gate</hi> of the <hi>Palace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt partition of this <hi>Garden,</hi> called the <hi>Lower Garden,</hi> has a <hi>Terras Walk</hi> on three ſides of it; and here we behold ſtraight before us the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and beyond it another <hi>Fountain</hi> of a young <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi> In the Croſs-walk that goes between thoſe two Fountains, there is on the right hand a Fountain of a <hi>Celeſtial Globe,</hi> and on the left ſuch another <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Globe.</hi> And at the end of the ſame Walk on the right hand, upon the ſide of one Terras Walk, there is the <hi>Caſcade</hi> of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> as alſo on the left,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101429:11"/>upon the ſide of the oppoſite Terras Walk, the <hi>Caſcade</hi> of <hi>Galatea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Upper Garden</hi> we behold a moſt Noble Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with a Baſin of a vaſt extent, and with <hi>three and thirty Spouts,</hi> that in the middle of all throwing up the Water <hi>five and forty foot high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little beyond this, we ſee another Fountain, wherein the Water riſes in the form of a <hi>Peacock's Tail,</hi> under which as alſo beyond it, are divers <hi>Caſcades.</hi> We do likwiſe here behold two large <hi>Porticoes,</hi> or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircular <hi>Cloiſters,</hi> with Rails over them, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported on divers Pillars.</p>
               <p>On the Weſt-ſide of the <hi>Palace</hi> there is a <hi>Garden</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der His <hi>Majeſty's</hi>'s Apartments, and called the <hi>King's Garden.</hi> This has a noble <hi>Fountain</hi> in the middle of it, and adjoining to it there is a large <hi>Bowling-green.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beyond this <hi>Garden</hi> Weſtward, there is another cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> or <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> ſome of whoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains may be ſeen, as alſo Statues in it, and Painting, from His <hi>Majeſty's Bed-chamber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the Eaſt-ſide of the <hi>Palace</hi> there is another <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> under the Apartments appointed for the <hi>Queen,</hi> and called the <hi>Queen's Garden.</hi> This bears a juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with that of the <hi>King</hi>'s, and hath ſuch another noble <hi>Fountain.</hi> And adjoining to this <hi>Garden</hi> fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, there are divers <hi>Arbor Walks,</hi> with five Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in the middle of Parterres.</p>
               <p>Beyond the Wall of the <hi>Queen's Garden,</hi> Eaſtward, there is another handſom <hi>Garden</hi> for retirement, or a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> anſwering the other, with Fountains, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Walks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the Croſs Walk that divides the <hi>Upper</hi> from the <hi>Lower Garden,</hi> behind the <hi>Palace,</hi> we go through Gates into the <hi>Voliere,</hi> or <hi>Fowl Garden,</hi> weſt from thoſe

                  <p>Containing the Deſcription of the <hi>Great Garden,</hi> next behind the <hi>Palace;</hi> and firſt of that part of it called the <hi>Lower Garden.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>SO ſoon as we have paſs'd through the <hi>Place,</hi> we do enter upon a very broad <hi>Terras-walk,</hi> extended on the right and left the whole breadth of this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the which is continued forwards by a Brick-wall, and by other Terras-walks on the right and left ſides of it. The firſt Terras-walk is paved with Brick four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen yards forwards, between the Garden Gate and the Stone-ſteps, by which we are to deſcend into the Garden. It is alſo paved with Brick thirty paces both to the right and left. From the ſaid paving, this Terras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk is continued to the Garden Walls on each ſide, in a green and gravel Walk. The middle part of this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101429:12"/>Walk is Green about ſiſteen foot, and on each ſide of the Green there is a Gravel-walk, each of them ten foot broad.</p>
               <p>At both ends of this firſt Terras-walk we do aſcend by ſeven Steps unto the ſide Terras-walks, which are raiſed higher than the former, for the better placing of thoſe Noble Stone-ſabricks that compoſe the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades</hi> of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> and <hi>Galatea.</hi> Theſe Terras-walks do, like the former, conſiſt of a Green-walk in the middle, and a Gravel-walk on each ſide of the Green. In the middle of theſe ſide Terras-walks, behind the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades,</hi> there are <hi>Seats</hi> next to the Walls, and painted Green.</p>
               <p>From the <hi>firſt Terras-walk,</hi> near the <hi>Garden-gate</hi> of the <hi>Palace,</hi> there is a very large deſcent into the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> firſt by three Semicircular Stone-ſteps, and after a little ſpace by fifteen Steps more, all of a very large circumference, the lowermoſt of thoſe fifteen Steps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>twenty eight yards round.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the right ſide of the foreſaid Steps, upon the Terras-walk, there is a large <hi>Stone-Statue,</hi> with a <hi>Hart</hi> behind it, and on the left ſuch another great <hi>Statue,</hi> both lying or leaning on a diſtinct <hi>Baſis,</hi> and both holding under one Arm a Stone-veſſel. Theſe <hi>two Statues</hi> and intended to repreſent two great <hi>Rivers,</hi> the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Iſſel,</hi> between the which Rivers, the <hi>Veluwe,</hi> and <hi>Loo</hi> are ſituate. Out of thoſe Stone-veſſels there runs Water, which makes an <hi>unexpected Caſcade</hi> on both ſides of the <hi>Steps</hi> adjoining to the Wall. Theſe <hi>Caſcades</hi> are made from the ſaid Stone-veſſels, on each ſide, into ſeven double Baſins, one below another, beſides an eighth large ſingle Baſin, which receives the Water of all the reſt, at the bottom of the Steps. All theſe Baſins are of a blew Stone. The one half of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101429:13"/>theſe double Baſins is raiſed two or three Inches, in order to retain the Water, and the other half is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſunk or made lower, that the ſheet of Water may fall from the upper into the lower Baſins.</p>
               <p>From all the three Terras-walks there is a Green ſlope, reaching from thoſe Walks above unto a low Brick-wall below, that is only two foot high; at the four corners of theſe Slopes, in this Garden, there are broad Steps for deſcending from the Walks above. And at the upper part of the <hi>Green Slopes</hi> there are abundance of little Pipes of water, about a foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one from the other. Each of them hath a Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per head, wherein there are four ſmall holes, through which the water is made to play, in order to water the <hi>Slopes,</hi> and to preſerve them always <hi>Green.</hi> In the Summer Evenings they are made frequently to rain a ſmall ſhower for the end aforcſaid.</p>
               <p>In the low Walk below the Green Slopes, at every four yards diſtance, there are white Stones, each of them above a foot and a half ſquare, on every one of which there are <hi>Urns</hi> and noble <hi>Flowerpots</hi> placed, or to be placed, as on Baſes: And ſome of them have repreſentations of divers <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> carved upon them.</p>
               <p>And all along the Wall of the <hi>Lower Garden,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which ſeparates the firſt Terras Walk from the <hi>King's,</hi> and <hi>Queen's Garden,</hi> or thoſe that ſeparate the higher Terras-walks from the two <hi>Wilderneſſes,</hi> thoſe Walls have ſuch white ſquare Stones near about the ſame diſtance from one another, and for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>On the top of the ſaid green <hi>Slopes</hi> there do grow many <hi>Pyramidal Juniper-trees,</hi> with other curious Shrubs intermixed among them. The <hi>Slope</hi> from the firſt Terras-walk to the low Walk at bottom is about
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101429:13"/>eleven foot: but the Slopes from the ſide Terras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walks to the ſaid low Wall have a deſcent of about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen foot, theſe being raiſed higher than the former Walk, on the account of the <hi>Caſcades</hi> before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>When we have deſcended into the <hi>Garden</hi> by the foreſaid eighteen Stone-ſteps, we do enter upon a broad Gravel Walk, into which advancing forty ſive paces from the Steps, we come to a Noble <hi>Fountain,</hi> in the middle of whoſe <hi>Baſin</hi> is a Marble Statue of <hi>Venus</hi> at full length, and another of <hi>Cupid</hi> under her left hand, he holding a gilded Bow. This <hi>Statue</hi> is ſupported on a ſmall <hi>Whale</hi> for its <hi>Pedeſtal,</hi> with four great gilded <hi>Tritons</hi> behow it, a large gilded <hi>Shell</hi> being between each of the <hi>Tritons,</hi> and each <hi>Triton</hi> blowing in a large <hi>Trumpet</hi> in one hand, their other hand being diſpofed in different poſtures. At the end of each <hi>Trumpet</hi> the water runs out in a broad ſheer, incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling a great part of the broad end of the <hi>Trumpet.</hi> Alſo about the <hi>Tritons</hi> there are many gilded Ruſhes, and Water-lilly Flowers, which do all contribute to the ornament of this <hi>Magnificent Fountain.</hi> On the right and left of this <hi>Statue,</hi> Within the ſame <hi>Baſin,</hi> as alſo before and behind the <hi>Statue,</hi> there are four Gilded <hi>Swans,</hi> which do ſpout the water in broad ſheets towards the <hi>Statue;</hi> and all the <hi>Swans</hi> are raiſed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above the water. The <hi>Baſin</hi> is bordered with a blew Stone about ſixteen inches breadth. It has four Angles, but on the four ſides where the <hi>Swans</hi> are placed, it has a circumflexion or ſemicircular cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Walks, in form of four <hi>Half-moons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On either ſide of this <hi>broad Walk,</hi> next to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terres, both before we come to the foreſaid Fountain, and alſo on the ſides of the Walk beyond the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, there are <hi>Spouts</hi> at proper diſtances in a diſtinct
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101429:14"/>
                  <hi>Canal;</hi> and there are <hi>ſix Spouts</hi> in each of them, which do throw up the water about a yard, though of late thoſe Spouts are now always ſtopt, to avoid the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the waters being blown on the Walk, or on the Parterres. Theſe <hi>Canals</hi> are walled with Free-ſtone, and bordered with the ſame three inches breadth. They are each of them about eighty foot long, and a foot and a half broad, but in thoſe parts where the <hi>Spouts</hi> are placed, the <hi>Canals</hi> are widened unto three foot and a half ſqure every way, in order to avoid the Winds blowing the water either on the Walk, or Parterres. Theſe <hi>Canals</hi> are paved, after the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick</hi> manner, with Pebbles of a dark colour, but the Figures that are made by the Pebbles, and which run along the middle of the <hi>Canals,</hi> and eſpecially about the <hi>Spouts,</hi> are made in a long ſort of Pebbles, pure white and black, of the Diamond cut.</p>
               <p>If we advance ſtill forwards beyond the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> in the ſame Walk, we behold another Noble <hi>Fountain,</hi> in the middle of whoſe Baſin is a young na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Hercules</hi> of Marble, ariſing as from his Cradle, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Marble; the <hi>Hercules</hi> ſqueezing a green <hi>Serpent</hi> in each hand, and both the <hi>Serpents</hi> ſpirting the water about two yards above the Baſin. On the right and left of the <hi>Hercules,</hi> at a little diſtance, within the ſame Baſin, there are placed two <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,</hi> each ſpirting ſeven ſeveral <hi>Jette</hi>'s towards the <hi>Hercules.</hi> The Baſin of this Fountain is likewiſe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with a broad blew Stone, ſixteen inches breadth; and paved with a Stone that is about a foot ſquare.</p>
               <p>Turning out of the aforeſaid Walk, from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Venus,</hi> into a Croſs-walk on the right, we meet with a <hi>Fountain</hi> in the middle, wherein is erected a <hi>Celeſtial Globe,</hi> placed on a Marble Pedeſtal, between
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101429:14"/>which <hi>Pedeſtal</hi> and the <hi>Globe</hi> there are four naked <hi>Boys</hi> in Marble, incircling one another in ther Arms. About the <hi>Globe</hi> the twelve <hi>Signs</hi> of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> are curiouſly painted, the <hi>Stars</hi> Gilded, and out of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the <hi>Stars</hi> there do ſpout out <hi>Jettes</hi> on all ſides of the <hi>Globe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Paſſing beyond this <hi>Globe,</hi> we behold at the end of the Walk a moſt Noble <hi>Caſcade,</hi> a Fabrick of wrought Stone, reaching from the Terras-walk above, down to the Gravel-walk below. The water here falls out of the Mouth of a great <hi>Head</hi> at the top of the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture (a round carved covered Baſin being placed above the <hi>Head</hi>) into three great ſemi-oval carved Baſins, one below the other, each of them being two yards in front, beſides the allowance of above two foot more on both ſides of the two lowermoſt of thoſe three Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, which two foot do ſerve for conveying the water that is to make the leſſer ſheets, which will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently mentioned. On both ſides of the <hi>uppermoſt</hi> of thoſe three Semi-oval Baſins there is placed a <hi>Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apple</hi> in Stone, by way of ornament; and on both ſides of the <hi>ſecond</hi> of thoſe Baſins, is erected a round ſcollopt Baſin of two foot diameter, that has a <hi>Spout</hi> in the middle, which throws up the water about two foot. From three parts of thoſe round ſcollopt Baſins, as well as from the whole front of the three great ſemi-oval Baſins, the water does fall into the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of ſix leſſer ſemi-oval Baſins placed on each ſide. Theſe leſſer Baſins are about a yard in front, beſides an allowance of about two more for the forming of the ſmaller falls of water that are now to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. On each ſide of the ſix leſſer Baſins, both on the right and left of the Structure, there are made lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſheets of water one below another in ſix deſcents,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101429:15"/>contiguous to thoſe made from the foreſaid leſſer Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins. But at the bottom of this Fabrick, between the falls on both ſides, there is an excellent Statue of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> at length in Marble, ſtanding upright, but looking a little downward into the water in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Baſin, or Receiver below; and holding a <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Horn</hi> in one hand, whilft he draws up the other by way of Admiration, at the beholding his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection in the water.</p>
               <p>Again, turning from the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> on the left hand the ſame diſtance in this Croſs-walk, as we did before from thence on the right to come to the <hi>Celeſtial Globe,</hi> there is, I ſay, on the left ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Noble Fountain, in the middle of which is crect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Terreſtrial Globe.</hi> On this <hi>Globe, Europe, Aſia, Africa</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> the four parts of the World, are exactly painted, and out of the ſeveral parts of it there do ſpring a great number of <hi>Spouts,</hi> which throw up the water from all parts round it, as in the former <hi>Globe.</hi> This is likewiſe placed on a high Pedeſtal, round which there are four naked <hi>Boys</hi> in <hi>Marble,</hi> the firſt with a <hi>Crown</hi> on his <hi>head,</hi> the ſecond with a <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hant,</hi> the third a <hi>Negro</hi> in his ſhort frizled hair, and the fourth with long hair hanging down his back: The four Boys repreſenting the Inhabitants of the four parts of the Earth.</p>
               <p>At the end of this Walk, beyond this <hi>Globe,</hi> and on the ſlope of the oppoſite Terras-walk, there is ſuch another admirable <hi>Caſcade</hi> as was juſt now deſcribed. Only in the middle of this <hi>Caſcade</hi> there is a Marble Statue of <hi>Galatea</hi> ſitting with a <hi>Lute</hi> in her hand, at the bottom of the Fabrick, where <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was placed in the former <hi>Caſcade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All along the middle of this Crofs-walk, between
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101429:15"/>the Fountain of <hi>Venus</hi> and each of the <hi>Globes,</hi> as alſo between the <hi>Globes</hi> and the <hi>Caſcades</hi> now deſeribed, there are little <hi>Canals</hi> without any <hi>Jette's</hi> in them, of the ſame length and make with the others that were placed on the ſides of the firſt Walk.</p>
               <p>This firſt Partition of the <hi>Garden,</hi> that contains all the aforeſaid <hi>Fountains</hi> and <hi>Caſcades,</hi> does likewiſe contain eight ſeveral <hi>Parterres,</hi> all the <hi>Quarters</hi> being ſeparated by Gravel-walks on every ſide. The four <hi>inmoſt Parterres</hi> do conſiſt of divers <hi>Figures</hi> in <hi>Box,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with Beds of Flowers, and in thoſe Beds there are intermixed many Juniper Trees growing in Pyramidal forms about round and high Staves painted Green. But the four <hi>outmoſt Parterres</hi> do conſiſt of <hi>Green Plots,</hi> that haves <hi>Statues</hi> placed upon high Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtals in the middle of every one of them, and have Beds of Flowers a little interſperſed among the <hi>Green Plots,</hi> beſides other Beds of Flowers on all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of thoſe <hi>Parterres,</hi> next to the Gravel-walks. The <hi>Statues</hi> in the middle of thoſe Green <hi>Quarters</hi> are excellently cut in Marble; they are of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Pomona</hi> on one ſide of the Garden, and of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and a <hi>Flora</hi> on the other ſide, ſtanding upright on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Pedeſtals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Beds</hi> and <hi>Parterres</hi> of this and the other <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> are not only adorned with <hi>Pyramids</hi> of <hi>Juniper</hi> and <hi>Box,</hi> and with Shrubs of <hi>Marſhmallows</hi> of all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, but contain variety of Flowers, which ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively blow according to the Seaſons of the Year. In the Spring there is a variety of the fineſt <hi>Tulips, Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinths, Ranunculi, Anemond, Auricula urſi, Narciſſus, Junci,</hi> &amp;c. In the Summer there are double <hi>Poppies</hi> of all colours, <hi>Gilliflowers, Larks-heels,</hi> &amp;c. In the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, the <hi>Sun-Flower, Indian Creſſes,</hi> the <hi>Paſs-roſe</hi> or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101429:16"/>
                  <hi>Stock-roſe, Marygolds,</hi> &amp;c. On the Walls of theſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens do grow great variety of moſt excellent Fruit, as the beſt <hi>Peaches, Apricocks; Cherries, Pears, Figs, Plums, Muſcant Grapes</hi> of all ſorts; and their props are every where painted Green.</p>
               <p>At four yards diſtance from the before-mentioned <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Hercules,</hi> we advance forwards unto two broad Stone-ſteps, thirteen foot and a half in front; on both ſides of which Steps there are <hi>Stone-rails</hi> near five foot high, and on each ſide of the <hi>Rails</hi> are <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſters</hi> of Stone, which are raiſed a foot higher than the Rails. On the two <hi>Pilaſters</hi> next to the Steps are placed two Beautiful <hi>Sphinxes</hi> with their Riddle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd or carved; and on the two others are ſeen two <hi>Wolfs</hi> in Stone, each of them giving ſuck to a <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus.</hi> From thoſe <hi>Pilaſters</hi> and <hi>Rails</hi> there is continued the whole breadth of the Garden a <hi>Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> that is above four foot high, wherein there are alſo divers Pillars of Brick, faced with Free-ſtone, for the placing of Flowerpots.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Second Part of the <hi>Creat Garden,</hi> called the <hi>Upper Garden;</hi> together with the <hi>Middle Walk,</hi> and <hi>Canals,</hi> which do divide this Garden into the two Parts.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHEN we are up the two Stone-ſteps now mentioned, we paſs over a <hi>Canal</hi> into the <hi>Middle Croſs-walk,</hi> that divides this Garden, and is remarkable for its double row of tall Oaks on both
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101429:16"/>ſides of it. This Walk is eighteen yards broad from the two Stone-ſteps, and Rails, unto the Bridge over which we are to paſs the ſecond Canal, in order to go into the <hi>Upper Garden.</hi> The <hi>firſt Canal</hi> is five foot broad, the <hi>ſecond</hi> is fourteen foot. They run from Weſt to Eaſt, and are ſupplied from <hi>Caſcades</hi> that are made at the Weſt-end of the foreſaid Walk, which has Iron-rails faſtned in Free-ſtone, that is half a foot above the Brick-wall, and that hath alſo divers Stone-pilaſters, ten Inches broad, and as high as then Iron-rails. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe Rails there is a Gate of wrought Iron, through which we are to paſs into the <hi>Gardens</hi> near the <hi>Old Hoof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From a Marble <hi>Head,</hi> placed in this Wall over the <hi>Canals,</hi> there is on each ſide a double fall of Water into two Stone-Baſins, that are one below the other. The uppermoſt Baſin is about a yard in front, and the lowermoſt a yard and a half.</p>
               <p>About the <hi>Bridge</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Canal,</hi> there is a <hi>Stonework,</hi> that is extended both Eaſt and Weſt from the Bridge about ſifteen foot. At both ends of this Stone-work, which croſſes the <hi>Canal,</hi> a <hi>Fountain</hi> riſes in the middle of the Crofs-wall, and by the declivity of a Baſin both ways forms a ſheet of water both Eaſt and Weſt, and alſo the ſame on both ſides of the Bridge. Moreover, out of the Walls that are on both ſides of this <hi>Canal,</hi> and alſo on each ſide of the <hi>Bridge,</hi> there are other falls of water from <hi>Stone-baſins,</hi> beſides ſome others in other parts of the <hi>Canal,</hi> made by raiſing the water, of ſtopping its paſſage, to a certain heighth. Theſe <hi>Canals</hi> are all along bordered with green Turf, and have a green Slope reaching from the border down to the Water.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:101429:17"/>
               <p>Advancing forwards from the <hi>ſecond Canal</hi> about a hundred Paces, in a very broad Gravel-walk, we come to a moſt <hi>Remarkable Fountain,</hi> of a vaſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. The <hi>Baſin</hi> of it is <hi>Octangular,</hi> and there are ſixteen Paces diſtance between each of the eight An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. In the whole it is a <hi>hundred and twenty eight Paces round.</hi> 'Tis bordered with a broad raiſed Stone-work, and paved with Pebbles, like many of the other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, in divers ſorts of uniform Figures. In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of this <hi>Great Baſin</hi> there is a <hi>Spout</hi> that throws up the water <hi>forty four,</hi> or <hi>forty five foot high</hi> perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. And round about this <hi>Spout</hi> there are placed two ranks of other <hi>Spout,</hi> each of the ranks containing ſixteen, which do all at a ſmall diſtance encompaſs that High one in the middle. The inmoſt of theſe two ranks do throw up the water twelve foot high, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rank ſix foot. This Noble Fountain containing no leſs than <hi>three and thirty Spouts,</hi> does make an agreable ſhower of them together, and muſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pleaſe and divert the moſt curious Spectator. The water of the <hi>Spout</hi> which throws it up ſo many foot high, is brought from a <hi>Hill</hi> two Leagues diſtant from <hi>Loo,</hi> and called <hi>Aſſelt.</hi> But the <hi>ſixteen Spouts</hi> which do immediately encompaſs that High Spout, are brought from another Source, called <hi>Orden,</hi> about a League off. And the reſt of them are ſupplied from the <hi>Viver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little beyond this Great Fountain, in the ſame Walk, we deſcend by three wide Stone-ſteps to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admirable Fountain, in the middle of which there are four naked <hi>Boys</hi> in <hi>Marble,</hi> with four <hi>Beaſts</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, thoſe <hi>Boys</hi> and <hi>Beaſts</hi> repreſenting the <hi>four parts of the World.</hi> Over the <hi>Boys Heads</hi> there are four gilded <hi>ſcollop Shells,</hi> and over the inmoſt part of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101429:17"/>thoſe Shells a gilded <hi>Baſin inverted.</hi> Out of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of this Baſin the water riſes in form of a <hi>Peacock's Tail</hi> ſpread out at length, about a foot and a half above the <hi>inverted Baſin.</hi> This Fountain hath its Baſin bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Free-ſtone, ſixteen inches broad, and its Stone-work raiſed three or four inches. From the ſaid Border to the bottom of the Baſin, there is rough Rockwork of divers Colours. But the bottom it ſelf is bordered with White Marble ten inches round, and the reſt of the bottom is paved with dark Pebble, among which there are alſo intermixed Marble Stones in divers Figures.</p>
               <p>As we do aſcend from this Fountain forwards, we meet with a Fall of water from <hi>one ſemioval Stone Baſin,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended four foot and a half in front, and placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween three Stone Steps on each ſide of it. At the four Corners of thoſe Steps, Baſes are raiſed for the placing of Flower-pots. And round this Fountain there is a Green Slope equal to the height of the Steps, by which we deſcend to, or aſcend from the aforeſaid <hi>Fountain.</hi> Farthermore, between thoſe Steps and the Border of the Baſin to this Fountain, there is a round Gravel Walk above four yards broad.</p>
               <p>Going ten Paces forwards beyond the former <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade,</hi> we come to another, where the Water falls from <hi>Three Stone Baſins,</hi> one below another; whereof the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt is about three foot in front, that in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle four foot and a half, and the lowermoſt five foot, beſides a farther extenſion of theſe Baſins on both ſides, for the making of leſſer Sheets of Water of eleven inches each in front, which are likewiſe one below another in three deſcents. Here is alſo an aſcent of five ſtone ſteps on both ſides of the Water, with four
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101429:18"/>Baſes at the four Corners of thoſe Steps, for the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Flower-pots.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as we are up theſe Steps, we do preſently turn on the right and left of the Walk into <hi>Semicircu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Galleries</hi> or <hi>Porticoes,</hi> below which there are two Green <hi>Slopes,</hi> one below the other; and between thoſe <hi>Slopes</hi> there are Flower-pots diſpoſed the whole length of them. Each of theſe <hi>Galleries</hi> is forty paces long, and about ſix yards broad; and each of them is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>twenty Pillars.</hi> They are covered with <hi>Lead</hi> to ſhelter from the Rain, and have White Balliſters four foot high upon the <hi>Leads,</hi> to which there is an aſcent by Stairs behind the <hi>Galleries.</hi> On the Wall within the <hi>Galleries,</hi> there are drawn the <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes</hi> at length in <hi>Freſco,</hi> thirteen of them in each <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery.</hi> They are paved with White and Red Brick.

               <p>ON the Weſt-ſide of the <hi>Palace,</hi> under His <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>'s Apartments, there is a Garden called the <hi>King's Garden;</hi> which conſiſts of two Diviſions.

The other is a large <hi>Bowling-green.</hi> The three Parterres do conſiſt of Beds of Flowers, bordered with Box in divers figures, with Pyramids of Juniper, or Box, in many parts of them. The <hi>Fountain</hi> is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with white Marble, thirteen Inches broad: In the middle of this <hi>Fountain</hi> there is a gilded <hi>Triton,</hi> holding under his left Arm a gilded <hi>Dolphin,</hi> out of whoſe Mouth ſprings a <hi>Jette,</hi> that throws up the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about ſix foot high.

               <p>The <hi>Bowling-green</hi> lies on the South-ſide of this Garden, and has the <hi>King's Stables</hi> adjoining on two ſides of it.</p>
               <p>At the Weſt-end of the Gravel-walk, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>King's Garden</hi> and the <hi>Bowling-green,</hi> we do paſs through a Gate of Iron Rails, partly gilded, and partly painted Blew, into another Garden, called the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> or Wilderneſs.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:101429:19"/>
               <p>When we have here croſs'd a Gravel-walk, a Hedge, and a Green-walk, we come to an aſcent of three Stone-ſteps, on both ſides of which there is a Stone Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick with Balliſters in the middle, and four wrought Flowerpots covered, one on each ſide of the Balliſters. From the Stone-work on each ſide of the Steps, the water falls from three Marble Heads into a common Baſin bordered and walled with Stone; in each of theſe Baſins there are two <hi>Spouts</hi> which do throw up the water ſix foot high.</p>
               <p>Advancing Weſtward from the ſaid Steps about thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix Paces, we come to a <hi>Fountain,</hi> in the middle of which there are <hi>four Sea-Cupids</hi> in Stone, ſitting on <hi>four Dolphins.</hi> Between the <hi>Cupids</hi> there riſes a <hi>Spout</hi> out a <hi>Serpent's Head,</hi> that throws up the water about five foot, and out of every noſtril of the four <hi>Dolphins</hi> there do run other little <hi>Spouts.</hi> The Border of the Baſin of this Fountain is a raiſed Stone-work; and it is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with white Pebbles, but towards the Angles (the Baſin being octangular) there are Figures of large Flowerdeluces in a dark Pebble.</p>
               <p>At this <hi>Fountain</hi> there are <hi>eight</hi> ſeveral <hi>Walks</hi> to be Teen, between Hedges of an equal heighth, all the Hedges being between ſeven and eight foot high. Of theſe eight Walks four are Green, and the four others are of Earch without Turf, and ungravelled. The Green Walks are placed between the others. At the end of all theſe Walks there are to be ſeen <hi>Statues,</hi> or <hi>Paintings,</hi> and Weſtward from the Fountain, beſides a large piece of Painting, there is a <hi>Fountain</hi> with two <hi>Spouts,</hi> and a fall of water out of a <hi>Head</hi> placed below the <hi>Painting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>North and South from this Foutain, at forty Paces diſtance, we come unto other Fountains. In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101429:20"/>of that Northwards, there are two <hi>little Boys</hi> of Stone, with an <hi>Otter</hi> between them, out of whoſe mouth there riſes a <hi>Jette,</hi> ſix foot high. It is border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rough Rockwork of divers colours, with ſome large <hi>Concha,</hi> or Shells intermixed: The bottom of the Baſin is paved with white and brown Pebbles in different Figures.</p>
               <p>At the ſame diſtance from the Fountain of the <hi>Sea-Cupids</hi> Southward, there is another Fountain, in the middle of which there is a <hi>naked Boy</hi> in Stone, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſcollopt Shell in his hand, through which there riſes another <hi>Jette</hi> like to the laſt now mentioned; and below this <hi>Boy</hi> there is a <hi>Satyr</hi> in Stone.

               <p>Beyond theſe three Fountains, North and South, the Walk is continued to ſome diſtance; and from all thoſe Fountains there are other Walks alſo to the Eaſt and Weſt.</p>
               <p>And beſides theſe Walks now mentioned, there are other Walks and Turnings between the Hedges, into which when we have gone a little way, we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to return into ſome of the former Walks by the way we entered.

                  <p>Of the <hi>Queen's Garden,</hi> and another Private Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>or Labyrinth</hi> beyond it, Eaſtward.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ON the Eaſt-ſide of the <hi>Palace,</hi> there is a Garden that is called the <hi>Queen's Garden,</hi> being under the <hi>Apartments</hi> appointed for her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as the <hi>King's Garden</hi> before deſcribed was on the <hi>King</hi>'s ſide. Both of them are of the ſame dimenſions.</p>
               <p>This garden is divided into two Parts; whereof the one, being next to the <hi>Great Garden,</hi> conſiſts of three <hi>Parterres</hi> of Flowers, bordered with Box, and having Pyramidal Juniper Trees in divers parts of them. The <hi>Parterres</hi> are on all ſides encompaſſed with Gravel-walks; and on the Walls here are divers fort of Fruit-trees, Grapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beſides Paintings of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> &amp;c. in ſome places.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the Parterres is a Fountain of <hi>Arion</hi> gilded, playing on a <hi>Lute,</hi> and riding on a gilded <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> out of whoſe Noſtrils there do riſe two <hi>Spouts</hi> five of ſix foot high. The Baſin is bordered with white Marble, thirteen Inches broad. On the border are placed at convenient diſtances eight gilded <hi>Sea-Horſes,</hi> every one making a <hi>Jette</hi> out of each Noſtril. The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin is paved with a ſquare Stone, about a foot broad. On both ſides of this Fountain are Seats painted green, next to the Parterres.</p>
               <p>The other Part of this Garden conſiſts of divers Gravel-walks within <hi>Arbors,</hi> the whole length and breadth of it, and has five <hi>Fountains</hi> in the middle of all the <hi>Arbors.</hi> Into the middle of the firſt <hi>Arbor-walk</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:101429:21"/>there is an aſcent of four Steps, beſides a like aſcent of Steps at both ends of the ſame Walk, without the <hi>Arbors;</hi> or between them and the Garden Walls. Between thoſe three pair of Steps, there is a green Slope the height of the Steps, and at the top of the Slope there are long Beds of Flowers, with Juniper Trees intermixed. And at the corners of all the Steps there are Flowerpots.</p>
               <p>The firſt Arbor-walk that runs from Weſt to Eaſt, and is next to the Garden now deſcribed, hath eight open ſpaces or Windows, towards the <hi>Parterres,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides eight other ſuch Windows on the inſide, whereas the other three Sides or Arbor-walks have their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows only on the inſide of the Walk. Theſe Windows and five foot and a half long, and near upon the ſame height; and they are ſquare at bottom, and convex at top. The four long <hi>Arbor-walks,</hi> on the four ſides of this Part of the <hi>Queen's Garden,</hi> are each above threeſcore Paces long, and twelve foot and a half wide, At the four corners, or ends of theſe Walks, there is placed a <hi>Cupid</hi> above the Seat, and from thoſe Seats we can ſee through Windows cut in the inward <hi>Arbors,</hi> diametrically croſs this Part of the Garden, three of the five Fountains, that are preſently to be deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Beſides the four Gravel-walks within the Arbors, and three other Gravel-walks without the Arbors, next to the Garden-wall; there are other Walks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Arbors that are not gravelled, the which do wind and turn in uniform Figures from the middle of one of the ſide Arbor-walks to the middle of another. And between theſe there are Parterres with Fountains in them.</p>
               <p>In the middle of all the <hi>Arbors</hi> there is a <hi>Fountain</hi> with a large gilded <hi>Triton,</hi> ſitting on a Rock of Stones
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101429:21"/>and Shells, and blowing through a gilded <hi>Horn</hi> a <hi>Spout</hi> about eight foot high. The <hi>Baſin</hi> is border'd with rough Rockwork. It is paved with Pebbles, and white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſet among them, cut in oval, or Diamond forms. From the middle of the four long Arbor-walks unto this Fountain there are four direct Walks, and between theſe Walks there are four little Gardens, or Parterres, ſeparated from the ſaid Gravel-walks by Hedges of <hi>Dutch Elm,</hi> about four foot high.</p>
               <p>In the middle of each of theſe four little Gardens, there is a diſtinct Fountain, and in each of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains there is place a gilded <hi>Triton,</hi> ſitting on a gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sea-Horſe,</hi> or an a <hi>Sea-Goat,</hi> all upon Rockwork, like that in the middle Fountain; and the Baſins of theſe are paved like the former. But theſe <hi>four Tritons</hi> and Baſins are leſs in proportion than that in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Fountain. One of theſe four <hi>Tritons</hi> holds a <hi>Cup</hi> in his Right hand, through which there riſes a <hi>Jette</hi> ſix of ſeven foot. The ſecond holds a <hi>Trident</hi> in his hand, and through the three Spikes of the <hi>Trident</hi> are made three Dards or Spouts. The third holds a <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and makes a <hi>Spout</hi> through the Mouth of the <hi>Fiſh.</hi> And the fourth blows another through a twined <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</hi> All the <hi>Spouts</hi> in theſe four Fountains do riſe much about the ſame height. And beſides theſe, the <hi>Sea-horſes</hi> on which the four <hi>Trions</hi> do ride, do all make a little ſheet of water from their Tongues.</p>
               <p>About the firſt and largeſt of theſe five <hi>Tritons,</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the middle of thoſe other four Fountains, and the Arbors, there are eight ſemicircular <hi>Seats,</hi> covered behind and over head Arbor-like; the <hi>Seats</hi> and Prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and alſo the Prop-work of all the Arbors being painted green. Every one of theſe <hi>Seats</hi> is above eight foot wide, and ten foot high. And between the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101429:22"/>four Gravel-walks, which come to this Fountain from the middle of the four Side-Arbor walks, there are two of theſe eight Seats, as alſo between every two Seats there is an entrance five foot wide into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torres of one of the four leſſer Fountains.</p>
               <p>All along theſe Gravel-walks, and round the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Fountain, there are placed Orange-trees, and Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Trees in portable Wooden Frames, and Flower-pots about them.</p>
               <p>In a corner of the <hi>Queen's Garden,</hi> next to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras-walk of the <hi>Great Garden,</hi> and under one corner of the <hi>Palace,</hi> there is a fine <hi>Grotto,</hi> conſiſting of the Roots of Trees, Flints, and Shells, diſpoſed in a rough <hi>Groteſco</hi> manner, and in one corner of this <hi>Grotto</hi> there is a <hi>Aviary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Room for the <hi>Grotto</hi> is paved with Black and White <hi>Marble,</hi> there being two Fountains in it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt one another, and they are raiſed Arch-wiſe from the bottom to the top of the Room, the border round the Fountains being raiſed above a foot from the floor, in order to hinder the water from wetting the Room. The ſides are embelliſhed with divers ſorts of Shells, and all parts of the Windows beautiſied with the ſame, in divers Figures. There are three Gates or Paſſages into this Room, one from the <hi>Queen's Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> another from the <hi>Great Garden,</hi> under the Terras-walk, the third goes into a little Room, where a Couch is placed for Repoſe, and thence we go into another Room adorned all over with abundance of <hi>Porcelaine,</hi> or <hi>China.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Aviary</hi> is expoſed to the open Air, but incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with a ſmall Grate, to confine the Birds; and there is a place in the corner of the <hi>Grotto</hi> for the Birds to retreat into, from the Rain, or Weather.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:101429:22"/>
               <p>On the Eaſtſide of the <hi>Queen's Garden,</hi> there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Garden for retirement, with Walks, and Hedges of Witch-Elm, about eight foot high; into which we do paſs out of the former through a Gate of wrought Iron, painted Blew and Gilt. Turning in it North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the ſecond Walk, we come to a Noble <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> unto which we deſcend by ſix Stops; but in the middle of theſe Steps there is a ſmall fall of water in ſix deſcents from a <hi>Fountain</hi> at the top of the Step; and from thence the water runs in a ſmall channel croſs the Walk that encompaſſes the Fountain which I am going to deſcribe.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Fountain</hi> is oblong, or of an Oval figure; its <hi>diameter</hi> is in length twenty Paces, and it is about ten Paces wide. In the middle of this <hi>Baſin</hi> there is a round Rock, of rough Stones, Shells, and Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinders, about a yard above the water. Out of this <hi>Rockwork</hi> there ſprings a <hi>Jette</hi> about five yards high, from the middle of it; and from the other parts round about this <hi>Rock</hi> there do riſe abundance of other <hi>Spouts.</hi> This <hi>Fountain</hi> is bordered with green Turf, on the Slope of which Border there are placed at due diſtances ſix <hi>collopt Shells</hi> of wrought Stone. Into all theſe <hi>Shells</hi> there is a fall of water from the mouth of a wrought <hi>Head,</hi> joined to the <hi>Shell</hi> in one and the ſame Stone; and from four parts of each <hi>Shell</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter falls into the Baſin of the Fountain, which is not paved at all, the Bottom being only of Earth, as the Border of it and the Slope were of Turf.</p>
               <p>Round this <hi>Fountain,</hi> next to the Hedge, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly behind the foreſaid <hi>ſix Shells,</hi> there are <hi>ſix Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> in Stone, or ſo many little <hi>Cupids</hi> ſtanding upon high Pedeſtals of wrought Stone; and at the bottom of each Pedeſtal there is a fall of water into a ſmall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101429:23"/>ſquare Stone-baſin, from whence the water runs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Walk into one of the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Shells</hi> that were before mentioned to be placed on the Slope below the Border. The firſt of theſe <hi>Cupids</hi> is drinking out of a <hi>Stone-cup</hi> held in one hand, and has a <hi>bunch</hi> of <hi>Grapes</hi> in the other. The ſecond holds a <hi>Tulip</hi> in his Right hand. The third is reading in a <hi>Book,</hi> through a pair of Spectacles, held near the Book. The fourth has a Play-thing in his hand. The fifth has a <hi>Snake,</hi> which he ſqueezes hard in his Arms. And the ſixth leans upon a <hi>Spade.</hi> Alſo round about this Fountain there are placed fifty <hi>Orange-trees</hi> in Frames.</p>
               <p>Going ſtill Northwards about thirty Paces from this Fountain, we come at the end of this Walk to a Statue of <hi>Venus</hi> at length, a little ſtooping, and holding <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi> by both hands. The <hi>Venus</hi> is placed on a Stone Pedeſtal, and out of a wrought Head at the bottom of the Pedeſtal, there is a fall of water into a ſmall Stone-baſin.</p>
               <p>A little Eaſtward of this Statue of <hi>Venus,</hi> there is another <hi>Fountain</hi> in a ſquare Stone-baſin. In the middle of it there is a ſmall fall of water from a round Stone-baſin, whence the water does fall equally all round in one ſheet. And beſides another <hi>Caſcade</hi> that is here made out of a <hi>Head</hi> into a large Baſin, there are five other falls of water from out of the Walls of this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, each of them about a foot in breadth.</p>

               <p>Advancing from the foreſaid Gate fifty paces North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, we turn to the Gate of the <hi>Fowl Garden</hi> on our left, to which we paſs on a Bridge over the Moat. This Gate is likewiſe of wrought Iron, painted Blew and Gilt. Going from this Gate two and twenty paces, we deſcend by three Steps to a Noble <hi>Fountain</hi> and <hi>Caſcade,</hi> round which <hi>Fountain</hi> from the bottom of the Steps to the Border of its Baſin there is a Walk twelve foot and a half broad, into which Walk there are four deſcents by three Steps, four oppoſite ways: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one and the other row of Steps there is a Green Slope round the Fountain.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſin</hi> of this <hi>Fountain</hi> is oblong, or oval, and of a great circumference, the <hi>Diameter</hi> at leaſt forty paces in length, and about twenty four paces in breadth. It is deſigned for the uſe of divers ſorts of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101429:24"/>
                  <hi>Fowl;</hi> and there are <hi>Houſes</hi> built on the two ſides of this Garden, for ſheltering the <hi>Fowl.</hi> In the middle of this <hi>Fountain</hi> there is a <hi>Jette,</hi> that throws up the water about twenty foot; and below the <hi>Jette</hi> there is a <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Caſcade,</hi> made from three round Baſins, whereof the uppermoſt appears to make a ſheet about a foot in depth, the middle-one near about two foot, and the lowermoſt four foot. Between theſe three Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins the ſpaces or intervals are filled all round with <hi>Shells,</hi> &amp;c. the which <hi>Shells</hi> are ſeen round them through the Sheets of water that fall from the ſaid <hi>Baſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the North and South-ſide of this Fountain, ſix yards from one of the deſcents by three Steps, there are two <hi>Summer Houſes,</hi> the one oppoſite to the other. They are within painted in <hi>freſco</hi> and <hi>bronze,</hi> and have <hi>Cupola</hi>'s over them, painted Blew and Gilded. Into theſe <hi>Houſes</hi> we enter by folding Doors, which conſiſt: of two foot Wainſcot from the bottom, the reſt in broad Glaſs up to the <hi>Cupola.</hi> Each of theſe <hi>Houſes</hi> hath four Shaſh-windows, beſides the Doors, and hath on each ſide of them contiguous to the middlemoſt and largeſt Windows, an <hi>Aviary,</hi> wherein are kept curious Foreign, or Singing Birds. When the Shaſh-windows next to the <hi>Aviaries</hi> are opened, there is ſtill a Wire-grate remaining, to hinder the Birds from fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their <hi>Aviaries</hi> into the <hi>Summer-houſes.</hi> Theſe Houſes are paved with white and red Marble, cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to curious Figures, but they are bordered all round with black Marble, of half a foot breadth, over which Border there is alſo a Ledge of white Marble, between the black, and the Wainſcot.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aviaries</hi> that adjoin to <hi>Summer-houſes,</hi> are likewiſe covered with leſſer <hi>Cupola</hi>'s of Lead, painted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101429:24"/>Blew and gilded; but large <hi>Cupola</hi> in the middle has a round Glas-window, and another little <hi>Cupola</hi> above the Window, and on the top of the higheſt <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pola</hi> in each Houſe there is a Gilded Pine-apple placed on a Gilded Baſis. Theſe <hi>Aviaries</hi> have on three ſides Grates of Wire, which do reach from the <hi>Cupola</hi> above, to a Stone-wall about two foot high at bottom. The two outmoſt Side-grates have wooden Shutters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, and thoſe Shutters an oval Glaſs-window in them towards the top. In the middle of the <hi>Aviaries</hi> there is a <hi>Jette,</hi> whoſe water falls into a little ſhallow leaden Baſin, near a yard ſquare. Behind theſe <hi>Avia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> there are other leſſer ones, open above, and on one ſide, for the receiving ſome particular Birds, that muſt be more in the open Air, or that muſt be kept alone by themſelves.</p>
               <p>And beſides theſe <hi>Aviaries,</hi> there are in two corners of this Garden, on the Northweſt, and Southeaſt, two other <hi>Houſes</hi> in three diviſions, for Ducks, Pigeons, Poultrey, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> with holes on both ſides at the bottom for the Fowl to enter. The middle part of theſe Houſes is now uſed for tame Pigeons, and has a large Wire-grate towards the Air, and a Spout in the middle, that falls into a ſhallow round Leaden Baſin of about two foot diameter.</p>
               <p>Round the uppermoſt Walk that encompaſſes this Fountain, there are high Stakes joined together, five yards above this Walk, being a prop for the Hedges to grow on, that are now of that heigth, according to the manner that is frequently uſed in the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi> In four places of this Hedge there are alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircular <hi>Arbors,</hi> of the height of the Hedge, with Seats at convenient diſtances from the Summer-houſes.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:101429:25"/>
               <p>Between this Hedge and the Wall of this Garden there are ſome plain <hi>Parterres</hi> bordered with Box, and in other places Ever-Greens ſet here and here.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Park,</hi> and its <hi>Fountains, Long Canal, Caſcade,</hi> &amp;c. together with the <hi>Viver,</hi> that ſupplies the <hi>Fountains</hi> and <hi>Caſcades</hi> with water: as alſo a deſcription of ſix other <hi>Vivers,</hi> or Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>Park</hi> is a great ſpace of Ground contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Long <hi>Green Walks, Groves, Nurſeries: Fountains, Canals, Caſcades,</hi> the <hi>Viver</hi> and divers Corn-fields, within the Pales. So that when His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> is pleaſed to take diverſion at home, there is not wanting Game for <hi>Shooting, Setting,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As we go from the <hi>Fowl-Garden</hi> Weſtwards, we do leave the <hi>Old Hoof</hi> on the the left hand, and at the Weſt-end of this Garden we come to a large Wire-grate, of the bigneſs of a large Gate, on both ſides of which Grate we paſs through Doors into the <hi>Park,</hi> and firſt to a <hi>Long Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> in the which there are no leſs than a hundred and eight <hi>Spouts,</hi> half on one ſide, and the other half on t'other ſide of the <hi>Canal.</hi> They throw the water above four foot high, and the water of every <hi>Spout</hi> is made to fall on the contrary ſide of the <hi>Canal.</hi> This <hi>Canal</hi> is about ſix foot broad, and the diſtance between every one of the <hi>Spouts</hi> is five foot, ſo as that between eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry two on the ſame ſide there are ten foot diſtance.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101429:25"/>At the beginning and end of the <hi>Canal,</hi> there are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced two <hi>Spouts</hi> falling the one upon the place of the other; but all the reſt do fall on the contrary ſide, and diſtant from the oppoſite Spouts, the whole length of the <hi>Canal.</hi> All theſe <hi>Spouts</hi> do fall into the figure of an Arch.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Canal</hi> reaches from the Gate of the <hi>Fowl-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> already deſcribed, unto a <hi>Great Caſcade</hi> that will be preſently mentioned; it has Hedges on each ſide five yards high; and on the farther ſide of the Hedge South of the <hi>Canal,</hi> has a ſtately Grove of tall Trees, and Northwards of it has all along a Nurſery of young ones. About half way, the Walk on each ſide between the Hedge and the Border of the <hi>Canal</hi> is about five foot broad, but the other half way, next the <hi>Caſcade,</hi> the Walk is widened unto fifteen foot on both ſides. The <hi>Canal</hi> is Bordered with Green Turf, and has a Slope of the ſame from the Border down to the water.</p>
               <p>About the middle of this <hi>Canal,</hi> on the South-ſide, there is placed a Marble Statue of a <hi>Flora</hi> at length, on a high Stone Pedeſtal; and on each ſide of the <hi>Flora</hi> there is alſo a Head; the which Statue and Heads are ſeen as at the end of a long Green Walk North of the <hi>Canal,</hi> the which Walk is a hundred and ſeventy paces, to go from the <hi>Canal</hi> unto the Fountain of <hi>Faunus,</hi> that will ſoon be deſcribed.</p>
               <p>At the Weſt-end of this <hi>Long Canal,</hi> we come to a moſt Noble Fabrick of wrought Stone, or to the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade</hi> of the <hi>Fiſhers,</hi> ſometimes alſo called the Cypher Fountain. It is joined to the ſide of one of the Walks about the <hi>Viver;</hi> it has Balliſters at the top of the Fabrick, and joining to the Walk above; and there are covered Flowerpots upon the Balliſters. On each ſide of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101429:26"/>this <hi>Caſcade</hi> there are two ſeveral aſcents by Stone-ſteps. And firſt we come to four Steps, on the corners of which there are placed two little <hi>Dragons,</hi> out of whoſe mouths the water falls into two ſcollopt Stone Baſins at the bottom, under the <hi>Dragons.</hi> From theſe four Steps on both ſides, we croſs over other <hi>Canals</hi> by a Stone-bridge, and then come to eleven Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps more. Theſe <hi>Canals</hi> do ſerve to carry away good part of the water that makes this <hi>Caſcade,</hi> and the reſt of it runs into the <hi>Long Canal,</hi> juſt now deſcribed.</p>
               <p>In the middle of this <hi>Caſcade,</hi> below the Balliſters, there are four little <hi>Boys</hi> a <hi>fiſhing,</hi> and drawing a Nett full of Fiſh; the four little <hi>Boys</hi> are of Stone, with leaden Net-work coloured like Stone, in their Arms; and through a great deal of this Net-work placed between the <hi>Boys,</hi> the water falls into the a large wrought <hi>Baſin,</hi> and from this <hi>Baſin</hi> the water falls again in five ſeveral places between other Net-work. Two of theſe falls of water from the ſaid Baſin are made into a Stone <hi>Canal</hi> below, that runs along the ſide of the Wall, under the Stone Bridges into the <hi>Canals</hi> on the North and South ſides of the <hi>Caſcade.</hi> The three other falls are thence made firſt upon Rockwork, and from thence into a common or general Baſin that receives the water aforeſaid, beſides what comes from the <hi>Spouts,</hi> and <hi>Bell,</hi> that will be preſently mentioned.</p>
               <p>Moreover, into the ſaid <hi>Canal</hi> that runs along the ſide of the Wall of this <hi>Caſacade,</hi> there are four other falls of water, whereof the two outward are from two <hi>Heads</hi> of Stone, the two inward from two <hi>Heads</hi> of Marble, placed at due diſtances in the Wall aforeſaid. The water from the Heads of Stone falls directly into the <hi>Canal,</hi> but from the Heads of <hi>Marble</hi> it falls into Stone-baſins, that are about a yard in front, and from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101429:26"/>them the ſheet of water falls into the ſaid <hi>Canal.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, out of the lower Wall of this <hi>Canal</hi> there are two other falls out of two more <hi>Heads</hi> of <hi>Marble</hi> into two other Stone-baſins of the ſame bigneſs with the former, and directly under thoſe <hi>Heads</hi> of <hi>Marble</hi> and Baſins, that were before mentioned to be placed in the upper Wall of the Canal, or the Side-wall of the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade.</hi> And from theſe two Baſins the ſheets of water of fall into the general Baſin at bottom.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the common Baſin there is a large inverted <hi>Bell</hi> of water, near two yards high, and the <hi>diameter</hi> of its <hi>baſis</hi> on the top ſeems to be much about two yards likewiſe. About this <hi>Bell</hi> there do ariſe twelve Spouts which throw up the water about eight foot. On the North and South ſides of the Baſin, wherein were the ſaid <hi>Great Bell,</hi> adn the twelve Spouts, there are other <hi>leſſer Bells</hi> of water inverted, on each ſide one. Theſe do riſe about a foot high, and the <hi>diameter</hi> of them at the top is much the ſame. The <hi>common Baſin</hi> below the <hi>Caſcade</hi> is bordered with a broad Stone of ſixteen inches breadth, and walled with Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; and the whole ſpace between the ſaid Border, and the <hi>Long Canal</hi> before deſcribed, as well as to the Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtairs on either ſide of this <hi>Caſcade,</hi> is taken up chiefly with little Stone-Canals of ſeven inches breadth, their Border but two inches. But in the intervals between thoſe little <hi>Canals</hi> the ſpace is paved with white and black Pebbles in divers Figures. From the two <hi>leſſer Bells</hi> the water does run along thoſe little <hi>Canals,</hi> which beſides the flouriſh they do make on each ſide, do form the Letters <hi>R. W. M. R.</hi> And above thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the ſaid ſmall <hi>Canals</hi> are ſo diſpoſed, as to form the repreſentation of a <hi>Crown.</hi> Moreover, from among theſe Pebbles, with which all the intervals between the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101429:27"/>little <hi>Canals</hi> are paved, there are made to riſe, when 'tis thought fit, by the turning of two <hi>ſCocks,</hi> about fourſcore the moſt minute Spouts that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. They are like a ſhower of ſmall rain, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſicially made in a certain order. One half of the fourſcore is made to play by the turning of one <hi>Cock,</hi> and the t'other half by turning the other. And theſe <hi>Cocks</hi> are turned in the Walk above the <hi>Caſcade,</hi> or between it and the <hi>Viver.</hi> Every one of theſe little <hi>Spouts</hi> plays about a yard high, and the Pipe of every one of them is covered with a ſmall Copper Cover, that has five little holes through which the water does riſe in five ſmall branches, like to a very ſmall ſhower of Rain. Some of the Covers of theſe Pipes are half an inch, others are three quarters of an inch diameter. But in ſhort, they do make a very pleaſant and agreeable ſight, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are made to play: And they are intended to divert the Spectators, by cauſing a ſmall Rain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares on thoſe who ſhall advance within the compaſs of their reach.</p>
               <p>I did before mention two pair of Stone-ſteps, the one of four, the other of eleven Steps on the North and South ſides of this <hi>Caſcade.</hi> From the two ſides of the lowermoſt, or leaſt pair of Steps, where the little <hi>Dragons</hi> were ſaid to be placed, there are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from the Steps on one ſide to the Steps on the other ſide of the <hi>Caſcade,</hi> all round this ſpace (which was ſaid to be paved with Pebbles, and to conſiſt of the ſoreſaid Stone <hi>Canals</hi>) two <hi>circles</hi> of <hi>Stone</hi> of fourteen inches, breadth, which do ſerve inſtead of a <hi>double Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to the whole; the two <hi>Borders</hi> keeping the ſame diſtance from one another throughout, as the Steps do make in front, or breadth.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:101429:27"/>
               <p>When we are up the ſecond pair of Stairs of eleven Steps, we enter upon a Walk, that encompaſſes a large <hi>Quadrangular Pond,</hi> called the <hi>Viver,</hi> being the common Storehouſe of the <hi>Water</hi> that ſupplies ſo many of theſe <hi>Fountains, Caſcades,</hi> and <hi>Canals.</hi> The Walk on the four ſides of the <hi>Viver</hi> is ſeven yards broad; it is a Gravelled Walk; and on the ſide next to the water it is adorned with <hi>Juniper-trees</hi> two yards high, adn ſix yards diſtance from one another; and on the other ſide of it has <hi>Lime-trees</hi> at the ſame diſtance, beſides large round Buſhes between the <hi>Lime-trees.</hi> The <hi>Viver</hi> is a hundred and forty paces long, and threeſcore and ten paces broad. It is bordered with green, and has a green <hi>Slope</hi> from the Border down to the water.</p>
               <p>At the Weſt-end of the <hi>Viver,</hi> in the middle of the Walk, we do paſs through another Gate, the Bars partly Gilt, and partly Blew, into a long ſhady <hi>Grove,</hi> uſually called the <hi>Queen's Grove,</hi> wherein there are divers Walks, ſome near unto <hi>Brooks</hi> of a clear running water, others at ſome diſtance from the <hi>Brooks,</hi> and all of them as ſolitary and retired, as can well be imagined. This Grove is of a good extent, and in the Summer-time very delightful.</p>
               <p>And now before we end, let us return unto the Eaſt-gate of the <hi>Fowl-Garden,</hi> from whence we may enter North-weſt into a long Walk between high Trees, there being a <hi>Grove</hi> on each ſide beyond the rows of Trees. In this Walk, when we have gone about two hundred and twenty paces, and there croſs'd another long green Walk, towards the middle of this Walk, where the <hi>Groves</hi> do end, we do at length come to the Fountain of <hi>Faunus,</hi> whoſe Baſin is round, and about fifty ſeven foot <hi>diameter.</hi> In the middle of this <hi>Fountain</hi> there is crected the Statue of <hi>Faunus</hi> in Stone at length, with an <hi>Infant</hi> in his Arms, and a <hi>Goat</hi> at
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101429:28"/>his Feet to ſuckle the <hi>Infant.</hi> This Statue of <hi>Faunus</hi> does lean upon a Stone <hi>Pillar,</hi> and ſtands upon a high <hi>Pedeſtal</hi> of a Blew Stone, placed in the midſt of a Rock, conſiſting of many rough Stones, petrified Earth of divers colours, and large Shells here and there inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed. From about this Rockwork there are made ſix double ſheets of water, whereof each double fall is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt a ſeveral Walk. For from this <hi>Fountain</hi> there are ſix diſtinct <hi>Walks,</hi> one oppoſite to another. And round about it, between each of the <hi>ſix Walks,</hi> near the corners of the <hi>Walks,</hi> there are placed two <hi>Statues</hi> in half-length of the <hi>Termini,</hi> or Gods of Boundaries, twelve in all; ſome of which twelve <hi>Statues</hi> have the face of a <hi>Man,</hi> and ſome of a <hi>Satyr;</hi> and they are placed upon Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals two yards high. All theſe <hi>Walks</hi> are twenty two, or twenty four foot broad; they are green in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and on each ſide of the Green they are plain Earth ungravelled, according to the <hi>Dutch</hi> cuſtom, to about four foot and a half breadth on each ſide of the Green. The <hi>Hedges</hi> of all theſe Walks do conſiſt of Trees both great and ſmall, planted cloſe together. Here are alſo other handſome <hi>long Walks</hi> in the Park, that are not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; beſides <hi>Brooks,</hi> and <hi>Fiſhponds</hi> within the <hi>Grove</hi> on the ſides of the <hi>Long Canal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one thing more very remarkable in theſe many <hi>Fountains</hi> and <hi>Caſcades</hi> that have been deſcribed; as that they are ſupplied with a natural conveyance of water that does conſtantly run, and is not forc'd up with <hi>Engines</hi> into great <hi>Ciſterns,</hi> where it muſt ſoon corrupt and ſtink, if not quickly diſcharged. Whence it comes to paſs, that the famous <hi>Water-works</hi> at <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles</hi> have in this regard a very great diſadvantage and inconvenience, becauſe they ſoon contract corruption, and after they are forc'd to play, are found to cauſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101429:28"/>an <hi>ill ſtench</hi> in the <hi>Gardens.</hi> Whereas at <hi>Loo</hi> the water is always ſweet, and there is no need of Commands, or Preparations for a day or two before, in order to make it run.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Gradens</hi> in the whole are a Work of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Magniſicence,</hi> moſt worthy of ſo <hi>Great</hi> a <hi>Monarch;</hi> a Work of prodigious expence, infinite variety, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; and after nine years labour by abundance of Workmen they were ſome years ago intirely finiſhed, and brought to perfection in all reſpects.</p>
               <p>I ſhould here conclude this Deſcription, if I did not judge it it may be acceptable to give a ſhort account of ſix <hi>Vivers,</hi> or Fiſh-ponds, which His <hi>Majeſty</hi> has cauſed to be made in the <hi>Heath,</hi> beyond the <hi>Gardens.</hi> When I was at <hi>Loo,</hi> two years ſince, there were about two hundred Perſons imployed in the making the ſaid <hi>Vivers,</hi> which are ſince finiſhed. They are ſituated on the Eaſt-ſide of that Walk which is continued from the end of the <hi>Upper Garden,</hi> between <hi>Lime-trees,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Pyramid</hi> that is crected half a mile off in the <hi>Heath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe <hi>Vivers</hi> is about twenty yards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the <hi>Lime-trees,</hi> and is eight hundred and forty foot, or two hundred and eighty yards in length. And it is two hundred and forty foot, or fourſcore yards in breadth.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>ſix Vivers</hi> do lye Eaſtward of one another, and the water is conveyed from one to another, after the manner as in the <hi>Fiſt-ponds</hi> in <hi>Hide-park.</hi> To the firſt there is made a ſubterrancan Paſſage, built of Brick, from the Canal that runs at the North-end of the <hi>Great Garden,</hi> by the which Paſſage the water is brought into the firſt <hi>Viver,</hi> and from that let into the others.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:101429:29"/>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Viver</hi> is in length ſix hundred and twelve foot, or two hundred and four yards; and it is two hundred and forty foot, or fourſcore yards broad.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Viver</hi> is four hundred forty four foot, or a hundred forty eight yards long; and of the ſame breadth with the two former.</p>
               <p>The fourth, ſifth, and ſixth <hi>Vivers,</hi> are all of the ſame length, that is, three hundred ninety ſix foot, or one hundred thirty two yards long; and they are all three of the ſame breadth, that is, four hundred forty four foot, or one hundred forty eight yards.</p>
               <p>The length of the three firſt <hi>Vivers</hi> is extended <hi>Northwards,</hi> but that of the three latter is made <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> the ſituation of the ground, wherein they are made, requiring this alteration. For on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the <hi>Heath</hi> has a riſing aſcent, which makes this alteration of the dimenſions neceſſary. Between the <hi>Vivers</hi> and this riſing-ground there is room enough for receiving the water that ſhall at any time be emptied out of them, in order to fill them with freſh water.</p>
               <p>They are not made above ſix foot deep, and the Earth that is dug out of them does ſerve to make the <hi>Banks</hi> round about them; the which <hi>Banks</hi> being raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three foot above the <hi>Vivers,</hi> does occaſion that their depth is but three foot more. The <hi>Banks</hi> that ſurround all the <hi>ſix Vivers</hi> are twenty four foot broad, and on thoſe <hi>Banks</hi> which ſo encompaſs them, there is made a pleaſant Walk, adorned with <hi>Willows</hi> the whole circumference. But the <hi>Banks</hi> which ſerve to ſeparate them from one another, are but eighteen foot broad. Theſe <hi>Vivers</hi> are provided for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying different ſorts of <hi>Fiſh;</hi> and are now finiſhed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101429:29"/>by a Model of Moſieur <hi>Marot,</hi> a very ingenious Mathematician, who is the ſame Perſon that firſt <hi>Deſigned</hi> all theſe <hi>Gardens</hi> and <hi>Fountains;</hi> but the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders relating to them were from time to time gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Right Honourable the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Portland;</hi> and his Lordſhip's Directions were punctually obſerved by Monſieur <hi>des Marais,</hi> His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Chief Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, a Gentleman of great Endowments and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>

            <head>A Short Account of <hi>HOLLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the foregoing Deſcription I have given the Reader a moderate comprehenſion of thoſe famous <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens;</hi> the <hi>finiſhing</hi> of which ſo nobly, and with that great variety, is the more to be Admired, becauſe it was done <hi>during the late War,</hi> when all things were at ſtake, and the event was feared ſo much by moſt men. And although things were not indeed in that danger from the <hi>French,</hi> as the <hi>Roman State</hi> was, when <hi>Hannibal</hi> was at the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet it puts me in mind of a Brave Action of that Great People, who, whilſt <hi>Hannibal</hi> was juſt under their Walls with his Army, and ſome of the <hi>Fields</hi> whereon he was Incamped, happening to be then expoſed to <hi>Publick Sale,</hi> were no deſtitute of Purchaſers of the Magnanimity, who at that very time gave even the Market Price for an Eſtate then in poſſeſſion of the Greateſt and moſt Deadly Enemy that ever threatned that <hi>Republick,</hi> from the firſt <hi>Founding</hi> of the <hi>City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the more remarkable, becauſe the <hi>French King,</hi> at the breaking out of this War, though his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were then full of an inexhauſtible Treaſure, as 'twas thought; and though he had an inclination to Magain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Buildings beyond all his Predeceſſors, yet he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Ordered a <hi>full ſtop</hi> to be put to all his <hi>Publick Works:</hi> Well foreſeeing what a terrible Storm he had brought upon his Kingdom, and with how <hi>Great a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> he was like to contend. Inſomuch that this <hi>Grand Monarch,</hi> who was often ſaid to give <hi>Peace</hi> to <hi>Europe,</hi> out
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101429:31"/>of a certain peculiar Generoſity, when he had on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſnatcht away from his Neighbours one Province after another, and his <hi>Slow Enemies</hi> had begun to form their Forces; this <hi>Monarch,</hi> I ſay, was by the late long and Expenſive <hi>War,</hi> by the firmneſs of the <hi>Confederate Union,</hi> and by the proſpect of a <hi>Peace</hi> with the <hi>Turks,</hi> brought to ſuch Fears and Apprehenſions, that he <hi>Purchaſed</hi> a <hi>Peace</hi> with a ſtrange and ſurprizing diſmembring his Great <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and by the Surrendring an incredible number of large and rich <hi>Provinces,</hi> and many <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Strong Towns</hi> that were thought to be <hi>Impregnable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An ſince there is ſo near a proximity between <hi>Loo</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> I cannot here omit to ſay ſomewhat of that <hi>Great,</hi> and <hi>Conſiderable People,</hi> among whom theſe <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> are to be ſeen. But this Subject having been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well performed, if not in a manner exhauſted, by one of the <hi>beſt</hi> of our <hi>English Pens,</hi> who has joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the <hi>Scholar</hi> and the <hi>Gentleman</hi> in his Writings, as well as any of our Modern Authors; and particularly in his late <hi>Eſſays</hi> upon <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern Learning,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall therefore refer my Reader to Sir <hi>William Temple's</hi> Curious <hi>Obſervatios</hi> upon the <hi>United Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> for a more diſtinct and full knowledge of this Great Subject; and yet however I will not paſs it by altogether in ſilence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Belgae,</hi> or the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> were for their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Courage eminent above other People, even in the time of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> who at the beginning of his <hi>Commentaries, de Bello Gallico,</hi> has theſe words. <hi>Horum omnium fortiſſimi ſunt Belgae.</hi> When <hi>Caeſar</hi> had divided <hi>Gaul</hi> into three Parts, he ſays the Stouteſt and moſt Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious of them all, were the <hi>Belgae,</hi> or <hi>Low Countrymen,</hi> then called <hi>Gallica Belgica,</hi> and ſince divided into <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Provinces</hi> under the Dominion of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> until <hi>William</hi> the Wiſe and Valiant <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:101429:31"/>firſt reſcued, and the Invincible <hi>Prince Maurice</hi> of <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw,</hi> by abundance of Victories, and Sieges, compleated the Peace of, <hi>Seven</hi> of thoſe <hi>Provinces,</hi> and eſtabliſhed them in a <hi>Free Republick,</hi> on the 9th of <hi>April,</hi> 1609. Again <hi>Tacitus,</hi> lib. 4. ſays, <hi>Quicquid roboris apud Gallos ſit, Belgas eſſe:</hi> That the chiefeſt ſtrength of all <hi>France</hi> was in theſe People. By which it appears, that the Dominion of <hi>France</hi> was then greater than it is now, and yet <hi>Europe</hi> was not overrun with it. That <hi>Providence,</hi> which certainly counducts and over-rules the Affairs of the World, ſets bounds to <hi>Empires,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Sea.</hi> But to proceed, We have had, in the late War, ſufficent experience of the Fortitude and Valour of the <hi>Provinces</hi> now mentioned. For what <hi>Horſe</hi> have done their duty, or fought better upon occaſion that the <hi>Walloons,</hi> ſo miſerable to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, uſually called the <hi>Spaniſh Horſe,</hi> though Natives of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Brabant?</hi> Or what <hi>Foot</hi> have done better ſervice in the late War than the <hi>Dutch,</hi> either in Sieges, or in Battels?</p>
            <p>For if I were to ſpeak of the <hi>Engliſh Soldiery,</hi> or were askt which were the <hi>beſt Soldiers,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> or the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gae,</hi> I ſshould anſwer, the <hi>Englisſh,</hi> as <hi>Sir Walter Rawleigh</hi> did, when putting the queſtion, in his book of the World, which were the braveſt Soldiers, the <hi>Roman,</hi> or the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> made anſwer the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> who, if they were in his time of ſuch account and eſteem, when only a <hi>Queen,</hi> though ſhe indeed a moſt Excellent one, ſate on the Throne, and leſt her Armies to the Conduct of her <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is:</hi> What admiration ought now to be had of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when they have our <hi>Preſent King</hi> at the <hi>Head</hi> of them! For we muſt not forget, <hi>tanti eſſe f, quanti Imperatorem.</hi> That the Strength of an <hi>Army</hi> is to be truly meaſured by the Valour and Conduct of the <hi>General.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:101429:32"/>
            <p>And we may have ſome reaſon to doubt, whether <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> had a better Army, or better Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, even of his <hi>Grecians,</hi> with which it was his good fortune to <hi>Conquer the World</hi> before him, and the which he led ſo boldly and bravely againſt a great concourſe of <hi>Perſians,</hi> who were a weak and eſſeminate People; than our <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> or <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fifth,</hi> conducted againſt <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, that was always eſteemed a Warlike People, and was long ago adjudg'd ſuch by <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf, by his own Experience, after he had <hi>Conquer'd</hi> them, and the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> Thoſe two famous <hi>Engliſh Kings,</hi> I ſay, did ſufficiently maniſeſt the <hi>Superiority</hi> of <hi>Engliſh Armies</hi> to all others, upon better trials than with <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> when they had <hi>Kings</hi> at their <hi>Head, like</hi> to <hi>themſelves,</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> to <hi>conduct</hi> them.</p>
            <p>The knowledge of this Truth, made the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned and Excellent General <hi>Turenne,</hi> ſo much to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet <hi>Engliſh Soldiers</hi> before all others, and even before his own Countrymen, in the <hi>Armies</hi> he Commanded. And this made him ſo deſirous of the Honour, to be called Father of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when he was their Friend and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector.</p>
            <p>The laſt Demonſtration we have had of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage, was lately before <hi>Namur,</hi> where in the firſt <hi>Attack</hi> that was made, the <hi>Engliſh Red-Coats</hi> ſtruck ſuch a Terror on the <hi>French,</hi> by an unparalel'd Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that they were never able to recover themſelves from the fright, during the Siege. And when the Town was forced to Surrender, and the <hi>King</hi> then Ordered away all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the Succour of <hi>Prince Vandemont,</hi> after the <hi>famous Retreat</hi> he had made, and to Preſerve <hi>Bruſſels</hi> from falling into the hands of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> at the time he Bombarded it; the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as I have heard, begg'd of His <hi>Majeſty</hi> the detaining <hi>four Engliſh Battalions</hi> towards carrying on the <hi>Siege</hi> of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and <hi>Forts</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101429:32"/>to the end that the ſame Terror might ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with the Enemy, which the Valour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had ſtruck ſo deeply upon them.</p>
            <p>And of how great weight and force to the animating a People, or Army, the <hi>genius</hi> of a <hi>Good General</hi> is, may be evinced, by that diſmal <hi>Revolution,</hi> which happened to the <hi>United Provinces</hi> in the Year 1672. This People, ſo famous in Hiſtory for their <hi>Courage,</hi> and who had ſo gallantly ſignalized themſelves for it againſt the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> when they were beſieged by them in <hi>Leyden, Haer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and <hi>Alcmar;</hi> when it happened that the inundation of the <hi>French</hi> Armies came upon them in that Year, they made no manner of Reſiſtance, their Towns hardly ſtaid for a Summons to ſurrender, the <hi>French</hi> were advanced within ſight of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and all the People of <hi>Holland</hi> ſeem'd to be without a <hi>Soul,</hi> as they were without a <hi>Head.</hi> Now at this ſo ſtrange and fatal a Juncture, when once the <hi>Perpetual Edict,</hi> for abrogating the Office of <hi>Stadtholder,</hi> was annulled and at end, and the then <hi>Young Prince of Orange</hi> was reſtored to the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of his <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> behold all things quickly recovered new life, the Soldiers reſumed the Courage they had loſt, and the many <hi>Towns</hi> that were ſubjected to the <hi>French,</hi> in <hi>Gelderland, Over-Iſſell, Utrecht,</hi> and in part of <hi>Holland</hi> it ſelf, they were ſoon obliged to reſtore, and with the ſame celerity, as they had before over-run them. Nay, and the ſtrong Town of <hi>Grave,</hi> ſituated upon the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> defended ſo well by <hi>Chamilly,</hi> and which the <hi>French</hi> were ſo unwilling quit, was by the vigor and prudent Conduct of the <hi>ſame</hi> ſucceſsful <hi>General,</hi> our preſent moſt <hi>Auguſt Monarch,</hi> ſoon reduced to the Obedience of the <hi>States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, to the ſame Cauſe, under <hi>God,</hi> to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and Conduct of the <hi>ſame General;</hi> our moſt Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous <hi>King,</hi> at the Head of the Confederate Army,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101429:33"/>
               <hi>Spain</hi> does now owe, not only the recovery of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia,</hi> that was entirely loſt; but the Preſervation of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> by the Surrendring of <hi>Aeth,</hi> and <hi>Courtray;</hi> the Reſtitution of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> and <hi>Hainault;</hi> and the late Conqueſt of <hi>Namur</hi> it ſelf, in ſight of a <hi>French</hi> Army of above a hundred thouſand men. And laſtly, To the ſame <hi>Generaliſſimo Europe</hi> will ever be indebted for this Glorious, and Wonderful <hi>Peace,</hi> that it now ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily enjoys, and which will always be recorded by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, to the immortal Praiſe of the <hi>Great King William,</hi> and to the Admiration of all Poſterity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> are not now torn and divided into Factions, and Parties, but are generally unanimous in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, calm in their Deliberation, and ſoon reſolve on ſuch Supplies or Taxes, as are neceſſary for the ſafety and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the <hi>State.</hi> Formerly indeed, by the influence of <hi>French Emiſſaries,</hi> they have laboured under Diviſions and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, to the detriment, and danger of the <hi>State;</hi> and they have <hi>not always hearkened to the wiſeſt Counſel,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs their haſty concluſion of the <hi>Peace</hi> at <hi>Nimmeguen.</hi> But it is now become a frequent Obſervation among the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as a Gentleman of theirs of good underſtanding, and conſiderable employment, informed me, that in all things wherein they have been found to <hi>follow</hi> the <hi>Wiſe Counſel</hi> and <hi>Advice</hi> of our <hi>preſent King,</hi> they have <hi>always</hi> found themſelves to be <hi>Succeſsful;</hi> and whenſoever they have rejected, or <hi>not followed</hi> the ſame <hi>Wiſe Counſel,</hi> they have <hi>as often</hi> proved <hi>unfortunate,</hi> as the Events themſelves have afterwards demonſtrated. And hence it comes to paſs, that now the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>War</hi> for the next Year can there be determined in as <hi>few days,</hi> as it is <hi>in months</hi> in ſome other Countries. And now the <hi>Penſionary</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> Conſulting two or two three days with the <hi>Stadtholder,</hi> does bring matters of the greateſt moment to a ſhorter iſſue, than can be eaſily expected from the different Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101429:33"/>of a great number of Counſellors, though never ſo Wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holland</hi> does contain a greater number of large, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and conſiderable Towns, than poſſibly are to be found ſo near together in any other part of the Univerſe. But though it abounds with multitudes of Inhabitants, and is enriched with ſo many great Towns, ſuch as <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the <hi>Hague, Leyden, Dort, Delf, Rotterdam, Haer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the <hi>Briel,</hi> &amp;c. and others, as remarkable as the Chief Cities in other Countries, yet it yields to their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance little or no product of <hi>Corn</hi> or <hi>Grain.</hi> They are ſain to fetch from the <hi>Baltick,</hi> and other Places, where it is plentiful, <hi>Corn</hi> enough to ſupply themſelves, and their Neighbours, who want it. And they do ſend out great <hi>Fleets</hi> every year for that purpoſe. All this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is a <hi>low level,</hi> lower tan the <hi>Sea</hi> it ſelf in many places, and defended from the inundation of the Sea by incredible <hi>Dykes,</hi> or <hi>Banks.</hi> All the <hi>ſeventeen Provinces</hi> are commonly called the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> no that they are all a <hi>Low level</hi> like unto <hi>Holland,</hi> but becauſe they are ſituated towards the <hi>Lower</hi> part of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and therefore are now called by Authors <hi>Germania inferior,</hi> or Lower <hi>Germany.</hi> The Country of <hi>Holland</hi> is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for <hi>Paſture,</hi> and cultivated to the beſt advantage by mighty labour and induſtry of the Inhabitants. They have cut large <hi>Canals</hi> through all parts of the Country, by means of which they do go commodiouſly and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly from Town to Town, at a regulated eaſy expence, in cleanly and large Veſſels, covered from the Weather, which ſet out conſtantly at certain hours, whether the Paſſengers are many or few, ſo ſoon as a <hi>Bell</hi> has done ringing. And by means of the ſaid <hi>Canals,</hi> they do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich, and water their Grounds at pleaſure, and by Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills they do throw out the water again, as they judge convenient. As we travel along theſe <hi>Canals,</hi> it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101429:34"/>to ſee ſo many Noble <hi>Country Houſes,</hi> bordering upon them, and adorned with near <hi>Gardens,</hi> within ſight of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll Paſſengers. The <hi>water</hi> of theſe <hi>Canals</hi> is not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the ſmell, even in the Summer time, although generally they are a Standing water. Poſſibly the great number of <hi>Boats</hi> that are continually plying to and fro, and drawn by Horſes upon the trot, do keep the water in that agitation, that it has not time to putrify, and grow offenſive.</p>
            <p>If this <hi>Low Country</hi> wants any thing, it is that <hi>variety</hi> of different Objects, which we do enjoy ſo much here in <hi>England;</hi> and the which <hi>Variety</hi> is ſo acceptable and agreable to the nature of Mankind, who do all, and in every thing, conſiſt of Variety, as in <hi>Languages, Voices, Perſons, Countenances, Geſtures, Hand-writing, Cloaths, Appetites, Guſtoes,</hi> and what not. For what can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſo much to the eſtabliſhing our Healths, when declining into a Conſumptive ſtate, as Variety even of Country-Air? Or to what end has <hi>Providence</hi> made that <hi>inſinite</hi> Proviſion of Fleſh, and Fiſh, and all other Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, if not to pleaſe and gratify the different Appetites of men? And I am mightily miſtaken, if even in <hi>Phyſick</hi> too, the conſtant, long continuance of the <hi>ſame Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines</hi> will have that good effect on abundance of Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions in Chronical Caſes, as a Change, and Variety, and <hi>Alteration of Medicines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return; there is little of our <hi>Variety</hi> to be ſeen in <hi>Holland.</hi> In travelling from place to place we do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ſee the ſame ſort of <hi>Country</hi> again and again. One Houſe that we look upon may differ in dimenſions, or other circumſtances from another Houſe; but the <hi>Countrey</hi> in one place has the ſame Aſpect and Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to that in another, as an Egg is like to an Egg. So that after our firſt Curioſity is reaſonably well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, our Entertainment in the Boats is commonly a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101429:34"/>Book, or viewing the mixt Company, or ſometimes Diſcourſe of I know not what, to paſs away the time.</p>
            <p>He that would ſee kind of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> in this Country, muſt go by Land from <hi>Dort</hi> one League towards <hi>Breda;</hi> and there he will ſee all the way a Country ſo adorned with fine Houſes, and fine Gardens, and with that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Trees, planted in good order, and on all ſides, that he will not know which way to caſt his Eye firſt, ſo many Objects will invite him. Perhaps he will find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſtracted with as much diverting <hi>variety,</hi> as a young Gentleman or Lady is wont to be, when they firſt come out of the Country, and take the diverſion of the <hi>Ring</hi> in <hi>Hidepark</hi> in good Weather, on a <hi>Sunday</hi> Evening, when the Town is full. I need not deſcribe the Charms, the Luſtre, the Atractions of <hi>Living Objects</hi> there, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals in the greateſt perfection that Nature ever drew, and ſuch Maſterpieces of Man and Womankind, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf, nor all the World perhaps, can equal, or ſhew the like, as in this our <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of <hi>Women,</hi> as <hi>England</hi> has been often and juſtly called; nor need I hint how the Eyes of young Comers do there nimbly rowl about, not without pain ſometimes, and even danger of Diſtortion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch Brabant</hi> to ſay nothing now of the <hi>Velawe</hi>) from <hi>Bergen-op Zoom</hi> to <hi>Breda, Boiſleduc,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Grave,</hi> is for much the greateſt part a barren and ſandy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where Horſes do ſeldom travel above a League an hour. It is indeed a very ſtrong <hi>Frontier,</hi> and hard to be attempted; and therefore the <hi>French,</hi> when they made their memorable Inroad on theſe <hi>Provinces</hi> in the Year 1672. thought it more adviſeable to hazard the difficult paſſage of the <hi>Rhine</hi> it ſelf, by ſwimming one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rivers of <hi>Europe,</hi> than to make its Attack upon any part of this large Frontier, where the Towns were ſo ſtrong, and Forrage would have been ſo ſcarce.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:101429:35"/>
            <p>I was never in <hi>Frieſeland,</hi> nor <hi>Groningen,</hi> and therefore ſhall ſay nothing of thoſe Parts. Once I rid from <hi>Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> to <hi>Zutphen,</hi> over the <hi>Iſſell,</hi> in order to ſee a moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Magniſicent Houſe of the Right Honourable the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> that his Lordſhip has lately built about half a League from <hi>Zutphen,</hi> and from which City there is a very ſpacious Avenue, or Acceſs made to the <hi>Houſe,</hi> between a double Row of Trees; his Lordſhip poſſeſſing a conſiderable Eſtate in that Province. This <hi>Houſe</hi> has <hi>Noble Gardens</hi> adjoining to it, and made after the greateſt Models, with <hi>Terras-Walks, Fountains, Caſcades, Canals, &amp;c.</hi> But they were not then finiſhed, no more than the <hi>Houſe,</hi> when I went to ſee them, after the laſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Lordſhip</hi> is deſcended of an Ancient Family in this Country, and was <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Keppell,</hi> or <hi>Kappell,</hi> a Town of note in the Juriſdiction of <hi>Zutphen,</hi> before he was made an <hi>Engliſh Earl;</hi> and his Lordſhip is admitted among the Noblemen of <hi>Holland,</hi> which compoſe one part of the <hi>States,</hi> or have their Repreſentation in the <hi>States General.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is now twenty years ſince I was in <hi>Zealand,</hi> having been then ſent to <hi>Uluſſing</hi> to ſee a ſick Gentleman; whom after I had, through God's Bleſſing, ſoon put into a ſtate of ſaſety, I went to ſee <hi>Middleburgh:</hi> and going thither upon a high Cauſeway, and looking down upon the Country, I could not but think it anciently belonged to the Dominion of the <hi>Sea,</hi> from whence it has therefore properly its name of <hi>Zealand.</hi> They are Towns of great: Trade, and Ships of the greateſt Burthen, or Force, do ride in deep Canals, in the middle of the Streets of <hi>Uluſſing,</hi> as well as in ſome parts of <hi>Middleburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great <hi>Geographers</hi> may indeed write learnedly of all the World, though they never were out of the Country they were born in; nor ever hazarded their Perſons, by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101429:35"/>dangerous Travels, in order to form their Notions, or Experience, Yet I ſhall give but a ſhort and ſlender Account of my Obſervations in theſe Provinces, becauſe my <hi>Travels</hi> here have been none of the greateſt. I always thought it my Duty to continue in my proper Poſt, that ſo I might be ready to receive the Honour of the <hi>King's Commands,</hi> when His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſShould judge it convenient to lay any upon me. For in my Profeſſion ſudden Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents do ſometimes happen, which will not allow that Liberty or Curioſity which other Gentlemen may take at plaeſure.</p>

               <hi>Travelling</hi> abroad is certainly of ſingular uſe to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing a Gentleman. It enlarges all his Faculties, and takes off that narrowneſs or littleneſs of mind, which for want of knowing the World, is apt to ſowre his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Converſation. It makes men have juſt, and kind, and charitable Ideas of Mankind; and though many of our Gentlemen have ſo great natural Endowments, and have beſides ſuch advantages above Foreigners, by their Education in our own Unverſities, that they do not ſeem to want either this, or any other Improvement; yet <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling</hi> will, as it were, poliſh even a Diamond, take off its Roughneſ, and give it a new Luſtre. And laſtly, it will have that good eſſect, if it be well employed, as to make him <hi>love his own Country the better.</hi> And <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> that <hi>Travel,</hi> prove very unhappy, or make but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good uſe of it, if after they have ſeen what is to be ſeen abroad, they do not reliſh and admire the abundant Happineſs of their own Country, much better than they did before.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Traveller</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Country muſt be eaſy, and obliging in his Carriage, muſt make no noiſe, and but little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute about his Reckonings; and then he will ſeldom have juſt cauſe of <hi>COmplaints.</hi> He muſt be contented with what he finds upon the ſpot, and muſt take care to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101429:36"/>put his Hoſt to as <hi>little trouble</hi> as may be. The more he appears a <hi>Man of Quality,</hi> the more he muſt expect ſometimes to pay for it; but in the general, if he be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and of a quiet peaceable Temper, he will Travel in <hi>this</hi> Country with as much frugality and fair dealing, as he can in any other, notwithſtanding the Clamors which have ſometimes been made through the indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Stranger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great Taxes</hi> are here ſuſſered patiently, and without murmuring, for the ſake of the <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> they enjoy. They are all laid as <hi>equally</hi> as poſſible; and he that can invent a <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Eaſy Tax,</hi> that will not be Grievous to the People, ſhall be ſure not to fail of a Publick Reward. Whatever is ſaid of <hi>Laws, their Taxes</hi> are not like <hi>Cobwebs,</hi> in which the leſſer Flies are uſually catch'd, whilſt the greater break through and eſcape. The inferior People, and the Rich, do pay to a Penny the ſame Pound-rate, in proportion to their Abilities. No body there thinks it their <hi>Intereſt</hi> (or at leaſt it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver practiſed) to promote <hi>Unequal,</hi> or <hi>Uneaſy Taxes,</hi> that ſhall cruſh one part with an inſupporatble burthen, and leave other parts free from feeling the weight. And their <hi>Exciſes,</hi> although they reach almoſt every thing imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, are but little felt bythe generality, or cauſe but few Complaints, by reaſon that all do ſhare alike in the payments, according to their conſumption; and that they reach the Luxurious and Expenſive, more than the Poor, or Frugal People.

               <hi>Fuſtice</hi> is ſo well diſtributed among them, and ſeverely executed, that many do think a Traveller may with more Safety paſs through all the <hi>ſeven Provinces</hi> with his <hi>Purſe in his hand,</hi> by Day and by Night, than go ten miles out of <hi>London</hi> with Money in his Pocket. Inſomuch that few
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101429:36"/>do 'ſuſſer here on the account of <hi>Felonies</hi> and <hi>Burglaries,</hi> excepting ſome <hi>Swart-makers</hi> of late, who did blacken their Faces to conceal themſelves in their Robberies. But that Gang has been happily diſovered, and I think ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated before this time. Thoſe that ever Rob, or Steal, are all <hi>hang'd</hi> in <hi>Chains</hi> on the <hi>Gallows,</hi> or remain on the <hi>Wheel</hi> they were broke upon, until the Fowls of the Air have done picking their Bones, and they drop aſunder. The which exemplary Puniſhment has that good effect in deterring others from the like Offences, that it is thought more do dye by the hands of the Common Executioner in <hi>London</hi> at one or two <hi>Seſſions,</hi> than do on ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts in a Year in all the <hi>Seven Provinces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though all Opinions, that are not Dangerous to the <hi>State,</hi> do here find a refuge, and are tolerated without ſcruple; yet <hi>Idle People,</hi> who will not work for a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and have no viſible way of ſubſiſting honeſtly, will not long meet with a ſafe Sanctuary in theſe <hi>Provinces.</hi> The Magiſtrate will ſoon find them out, and make them give a probable account how they live and ſubſiſt. They who deſire to ſee what becomes of <hi>Idle Drones,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate</hi> Wretches, may take a walk to the <hi>Raſp-bouſes,</hi> and <hi>Spin-bouſes,</hi> where they will find them buſily employed at their daily Tasks; but if they will not work there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appointment, the <hi>Pump</hi> is ready for the one, to <hi>Work or Drown,</hi> and due Correction to enforce the other.</p>
            <p>Indeed the <hi>Muſick-Houſes,</hi> where looſe People may meet in the Evenings, are ſuffered by connivance, if not allowed by Authority, at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> for ſome Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Conſiderations, and particularly, that the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Seamen, or others, when they are trouble with <hi>too much Money,</hi> after a long Voyage, may here have the convenience of disburthening, or ſoon ridding themſelves of the <hi>Incumbrance;</hi> and may thereby be the ſooner rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for <hi>another Voyage.</hi> But even <hi>theſe Houſes</hi> do obſerve
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101429:37"/>ſome Order. No boiſterous Rudeneſs, or ſcandalous Obſcenities are here permitted. And if a Couple co happen to agree matters, ſtrike up a Bargain, and reſolve to try dangerous Experiments, they muſt e'en retire from thence to private Lodgings hard by, in order to commit their Follies. If in other Places of this famous <hi>City</hi> Frailties of this kind do come to be taken notice of; and the <hi>Scout,</hi> or <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> who has his Spies abroad, ſhould receive information of ſuch Adventures, he enters all Places immediatly without oppoſition, and where he finds Offenders, he inſlicts ſuch <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaments</hi> as with ſufficiently diſcourage Debauchery; and the <hi>Law</hi> is ſoon diſpatcht, being wholy in his own hands.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Food</hi> is commonly <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and they do generally ſeem to <hi>like</hi> it, and <hi>prefer</hi> it to <hi>Fleſh,</hi> for Guſto, as well as Cheapneſs. For here they ſtudy not the Dainties of <hi>Apicius,</hi> nor the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Luxury. But in great plenty they do live with great frugality. Their <hi>Fleſh</hi> they <hi>Stew,</hi> or <hi>Boil,</hi> and but ſeldom <hi>Roaſt.</hi> For their Fewel being <hi>Turf,</hi> they cannot ſo Conveniently, or ſo Well <hi>Roaſt,</hi> as we do with our Coals and Wood. Their <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>Moll,</hi> that are publickly ſold, are wholſome, cool, and good, and fail not to quench the Thirſt; whereas the Liqours we commonly meet with here in our <hi>Inns,</hi> and our <hi>London Brewing</hi> for ſale, is unhappily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> that a great deal of it will rather increaſe than quench the thirſt. Their <hi>Nimmeguen Moll,</hi> that is ſo plentifully tranſported about <hi>Holland,</hi> is a ſort of <hi>Oat-Ale,</hi> much celebrated by them for its ſanative var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, like their <hi>Freſh Herring</hi> in Summer. 'Tis a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtd, mild, and wholſome Ale, And 'tis hoped, that our <hi>Parliament,</hi> when the have leaſure to conſider it, will take ſome care of the <hi>wholſomneſs</hi> of our <hi>London Brewing,</hi> both by <hi>Brewers</hi> and <hi>Vintners,</hi> ſince our <hi>Health</hi> does depend as much (if not more) upon the goodneſs
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101429:37"/>of the <hi>Liquors</hi> we drink, as it does upon the <hi>Food</hi> we eat; ſince our Table-Beer that is well Brew'd, is both a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and Pleaſant Drink: And laſtly, ſince we are come to that <hi>Skill,</hi> or Perſfection now-a-days, that we an make <hi>Wine</hi> without <hi>Grapes, Cyder</hi> without <hi>Apples,</hi> and <hi>Beer</hi> without <hi>Malt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Wine</hi> they drink is either a ſweet, and to us nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous <hi>White-wine,</hi> which they call <hi>French Wine,</hi> but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuch a <hi>White-wine,</hi> as I cannot remember to have taſted in <hi>France;</hi> or elſe <hi>Rheniſh</hi> and <hi>Old Hock.</hi> The <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> they are well known to make, or to ſtore up plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, at <hi>Dort;</hi> and the <hi>Hock</hi> they have ſometimes moſt excellent in its kind. For it cannot be ſuppoſed, that after ſo long a War on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> they can have that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>thoſe Wines</hi> in reality, as when the <hi>Great Tun</hi> of <hi>Heydleburgh,</hi> and other <hi>Magazines</hi> were in being, and the Vineyards not deſtroyed by the <hi>Fate of War.</hi> They have alſo common enough, a ſort of <hi>Sack,</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh Wine;</hi> but it is as different from our <hi>Canary,</hi> as Poſſet-drink is from good Table-beer. <hi>Claret</hi> is no where to be found in their Publick Houſes, unleſs perhaps at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> or in ſome <hi>French Ordinary.</hi> And they are not yet fallen in love with <hi>Claret,</hi> or elſe in pure Civility to <hi>England</hi> do leave to us the free poſſeſſion of a whole <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Claret,</hi> fetcht from divers Countries and People, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to drink <hi>Water</hi> themſelves, and very <hi>little Wine,</hi> that we may have enough to drown our ſelves in, for pleaſure and diverſion. They have alſo every where their <hi>Wormwood-wine,</hi> which is commonly called by the name of <hi>Alſom Wine,</hi> and by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for ſound-ſake, <hi>Wholſome Wine,</hi> and the which they do not drink only for a Whet before Dinner, or on <hi>Phyſical</hi> accounts, but indifferently at any time of the days, or evening. It is made of the <hi>French Wine</hi> before mentioned, and by its Bitterneſs does take off that luſciouſneſs, or nauſeous taſte to Strangers.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:101429:38"/>
            <p>This <hi>Country</hi> being Cold and Moiſt, their <hi>Food</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>Fiſh,</hi> their <hi>Moll</hi> very cool that they ſo much drink of, and their uſual Wine <hi>Rheniſh</hi> or <hi>Hock,</hi> their Temper caſily chills, and grows tender. Inſomuch, that they do as naturally fall into <hi>Agues,</hi> or elſe into <hi>Putrid Fevers,</hi> as we do into <hi>Inflammatory</hi> Diſtempers, or into the moſt <hi>Violent</hi> and <hi>Malignant Fevers,</hi> the effects of our Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Living, and over-high Feeding. And although they have many Learned and Good Phyſicians among them, yer I know not how it happens, that <hi>their Agues</hi> are not very eaſily, or very ſoon Cured. Many Months are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpent in ſuch Cures, and the <hi>Agues</hi> very often firſt or laſt do turn into <hi>Continued Fevers,</hi> or from a Safe into a Dangerous State. For it happens that the uſe of the <hi>Jeſuit's Bark</hi> is too much ſuſpected among them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not to be tried, until all other ways have been long tried in vain. And this I obſerved at a time, when there was never a more general occaſion of uſing the <hi>Bark,</hi> and when the uſe of it was never more proper or effectual; I mean, in the <hi>two firſt Campaigns</hi> that I had the Honour to wait upon His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> being the Years 1693, and 1694. <hi>Agues</hi> were at that time very <hi>Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;</hi> and the <hi>Continued Fevers</hi> had ſuch remarkable <hi>Remiſſions,</hi> that they were Cured with as much <hi>Certainty,</hi> if not <hi>Speed</hi> too, by the <hi>Bark,</hi> as the <hi>Agues</hi> theſelves, provided that proper <hi>Evacuations</hi> did precede its exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I have reaſon to ſay <hi>with Speed;</hi> for I was then ſeldom obliged to make above three or four Viſits, even in thoſe <hi>Fevers.</hi> And by reaſon of the <hi>Bark's</hi> ſo well agreeing with the <hi>Fevers</hi> at that time, as well as the <hi>Agues,</hi> I made uſe of as many <hi>Pounds</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe two Years, as I have ſince done <hi>Ounces</hi> in any ſubſequent Campaign, or Summer; the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Fevers</hi> being ſince quite <hi>altered,</hi> and therefore requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a different Method of Cure.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:101429:38"/>
            <p>And as for the common practice of the <hi>Netherland Phyſicians,</hi> in not uſing the <hi>Bark</hi> for the <hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Agues,</hi> I am apt to believe, that it may have proceeded from a fear of <hi>Innovation</hi> in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> by a New Medicine of that importance. As it happened before to the Learned <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> Who were as much afraid of <hi>Inovations,</hi> and all cried out, <hi>Fire,,</hi> when <hi>Spagyrical Preparations</hi> came firſt into uſe. For prudent Perſons will not lightly relinquiſh an Eſtabliſhed Method. And I can ſay farther in their behalf, that ſome <hi>few</hi> among them do begin to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that the <hi>Bark</hi> does not deſerve to be too much neglected in the Cure of <hi>Agues.</hi> I may add concerning it, what is ſaid of the <hi>Italians, When they are Good, they are extraordinary Good; and when Bad, as extraordinary Bad:</hi> So it may be ſaid of the <hi>Bark,</hi> in what caſes ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is properly adminiſtred, no medicine was ever known to have ſuch great and good effects; but when it is improperly, or unſeaſonably given, it becomes one of the moſt <hi>Dangerous</hi> that can be uſed. And therefore thoſe who ſhall think fit to uſe this <hi>Bark</hi> in hazadous or difficult Caſes, or in Aſthmatick Perſons, muſt be ſure to have a very watchful eye over it, to obſerve whither it agrees, or diſagrees, and accordingly to proſecute, or quickly deſiſt from its uſe.</p>
            <p>But it may be <hi>Objected,</hi> That <hi>Agues</hi> are in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries more Dangerous in their nature, and Difficult of Cure, than they are in others; as they are ſaid to be with us, in the <hi>Hundreds</hi> of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey.</hi> And therefore that the <hi>Dutch</hi> may have good reaſon for neglecting, or deferring, as they do, to <hi>Cure</hi> their <hi>Agues</hi> by the uſe of the <hi>Cortex,</hi> or Bark; and which poſſibly they do think will not agree ſo well with <hi>their Agues,</hi> or <hi>their Tempers,</hi> as it is found to do with <hi>ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That when I was abroad, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obſerved one ſingle Perſon, either at <hi>Loo,</hi> or in the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101429:39"/>
               <hi>Field,</hi> who miſs'd a Cure of his <hi>Ague</hi> by the uſe of the <hi>Bark,</hi> or who had any <hi>Relapſe</hi> afterwards, that throughly followed my Directions, both before, and after he had loſt his Fits. And in that Succeſs, I do think my ſelf very much obliged to the Worthy Mr. <hi>Rottermond,</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary to His <hi>Majeſty's Perſon,</hi> for his ſo good <hi>choice</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> I uſed, and who is perfectly skilful in the knowledge of Simples, and in all the parts of <hi>Pharmacy.</hi> Indeed ſome of His <hi>Majeſty's</hi> inferior Servants had <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes</hi> through their own neglect and folly, becauſe they would needs think themſelves well before I did, and ſo ſoon as they had miſs'd the <hi>Fitt</hi> Returned; and this would ſometimes happen more than once unto the ſame Perſon.</p>
            <p>And however the <hi>Bark</hi> has been ſometimes cenſured, as if the <hi>Cures</hi> by it were more ſubject to <hi>Relapſes</hi> than by other Methods; on the contrary, I am fully perſuaded, that the <hi>Cures</hi> of <hi>Agues</hi> by <hi>Vomits, Seaſonable Purges,</hi> by <hi>Cordials acidulated,</hi> or by <hi>Amulets,</hi> or <hi>Domeſtick Applications</hi> alone, are all more ſubject to <hi>Relapſes,</hi> than thoſe by the <hi>Bark,</hi> if this be prudently adminiſtred. To confirm which Opinion, I may add, That thoſe who recover by the <hi>Bark,</hi> look florid and vigorous, grow quickly athletick and ſtrong, and eat and digeſt well; whereas thoſe who miſs their <hi>Fitts</hi> by other means, look pale and weakly ſome time after, and their natural functions do return more ſlowly, and by degrees, to their former ſtrength and vigor.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>our Agues,</hi> in the <hi>Hundreds</hi> of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Cure by the <hi>Bark</hi> does certainly agree with them, as well as with thoſe in other places. And it was to this very place, that our once famous Sir <hi>Robert Talbor</hi> had his recourſe, in order to the firſt eſtabliſhing his Method of giving ſuch repeated Doſes of the <hi>Bark.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:101429:39"/>
            <p>I do apprehend an <hi>Ague</hi> to be but a weak and ſlight Attack of a <hi>Fever,</hi> or to be an <hi>imperfect Fever,</hi> or it may be ſaid to be a <hi>Fever by halfs.</hi> Either the Enemy that makes the Aſſault is weak and feeble, or the Fort that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture defends, is Strong, and well prepared to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Either the Body is not ſufficiently prediſpoſed for ſuch a Combuſtion as the <hi>Continued Fever</hi> does occaſion, or the <hi>Pores</hi> are then but <hi>little Obſtructed;</hi> and therefore after the two firſt proper Symptoms of a <hi>Fever,</hi> the <hi>Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or Shivering, and the <hi>Burning Heat,</hi> have a-while ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted themſelves, there is alwasy in an <hi>Ague</hi> a ſudden ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of a Profuſe <hi>Sweat,</hi> which terminates the <hi>Fit.</hi> For when the <hi>Burning</hi> ſtill remains, and no <hi>Sweat</hi> ſucceeds, the <hi>Fever Continues</hi> of courſe, and undergoes another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination.</p>
            <p>The one may be ſaid to make its Impreſſion more <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</hi> and upon the <hi>Pores;</hi> the other not only ſo, but alſo more <hi>Inwardly,</hi> and upon the <hi>Vitals.</hi> The one falls chiefly upon the <hi>Outworks,</hi> or upon the <hi>Counterſcarp,</hi> the other makes a breach in a <hi>Baſtions,</hi> or in the <hi>Courtine.</hi> The Attack of the one is not in it ſelf <hi>hazardous,</hi> or dangerous to the ſtate of the Body; the Attack of the other is like a <hi>General Aſſault,</hi> and proves of a <hi>Critical</hi> nature, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the fate of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> And this is a more eaſy, and natural, and a more intelligible explication of the General Difference between <hi>Fevers</hi> and <hi>Agues,</hi> than other Accounts of them, that are more Obſcure and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, more Philoſophical, or artificially wrought into ſome Ingenious <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have Obſerved, that in <hi>Seaſons</hi> or Times when <hi>Agues</hi> are very <hi>Epidemical,</hi> as it is in <hi>Countries</hi> where they are very common and frequent, the <hi>Continued Fevers</hi> are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the ſame nature and progeny, and do generally require a like Method of Cure, and are actually Cured by a prudent uſe of the <hi>Conrtex,</hi> as <hi>Intermittent Fevers,</hi> or
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101429:40"/>
               <hi>Agues</hi> are. Only in the former we muſt always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as we muſt alſo ſometimes in the latter, to take care that we uſe ſufficient proper <hi>Evacuations,</hi> in order to bring the ſmall <hi>Remiſſion</hi> that they then commonly have, to ſome <hi>Intermiſſion,</hi> if it can be obtained, before we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to give the <hi>Bark.</hi> And then we may as ſafely and effecttually make uſe of the <hi>Bark</hi> in the firſt, as we do without difficulty in the other. I hope the Reader will excuſe this Digreſſion, becauſe, with reſpect to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, it may be matter of note and illuſtration to ſome, if not of uſe and benefit alſo to the Publick.</p>
            <p>The Diet and Air of the <hi>Dutch</hi> do much contribute to their growing ſo plump, and fat; and that may be one reaſon, why they <hi>Bleed</hi> ſo ſparingly, and ſeldom as they do. For when they do think fit to <hi>Bleed,</hi> they will ſeldom or never take away more <hi>Blood</hi> from a Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, than we do from an <hi>Infant</hi> of a Year old. How they came to fall into ſuch an Extremity of <hi>Bleeding little,</hi> I cannot well comprehend, conſidering how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely the <hi>French,</hi> and the more Southern Nations, do uſe <hi>Veneſection</hi> upon moſt occaſions. Nor are the <hi>Dutch</hi> the moſt abſtemious from <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Brandy,</hi> which will be apt to heat and inflame the Blood, and conſequently upon exceſs ſometimes cauſe <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> that properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>large Bleedings;</hi> neither am I ignorant that their <hi>Phyſicians</hi> are very <hi>Learned Men,</hi> and muſt read thoſe Excellent Books of <hi>Galen,</hi> concerning <hi>Veneſection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coughs,</hi> that are ſo common with us, are very ſeldom known among the <hi>Dutch;</hi> inſomuch that in the <hi>Autumn,</hi> when we are <hi>deafning</hi> one another with <hi>Continual Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> you may go into a <hi>Church</hi> there, and not hear a ſingle perſon <hi>Cough.</hi> And for this reaſon I am induced to think, when an <hi>Inflammation</hi> there falls upon the <hi>Lungs,</hi> and cauſes a <hi>violent Cough,</hi> they cannot ſo well deal with ſuch a ſtrange and <hi>foreign Diſeaſe,</hi> as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101429:40"/>thoſe who have leſs apprehenſions of <hi>Bleeding plentifully</hi> when there is occaſion.</p>
            <p>I have been ask'd ſometimes the reaſon, why <hi>Holland</hi> has ſo few, or <hi>No Coughs,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ſo many. The True Reaſon I conceive to be this: <hi>Holland</hi> has as great a ſcarcity of <hi>Minerals,</hi> as of <hi>Corn,</hi> of its native growth. <hi>England</hi> does abound with <hi>Minerals</hi> of divers Kinds, that are very offenſive to the <hi>Lungs;</hi> howſoever <hi>Chymiſts</hi> may commend the <hi>Preparations</hi> from them, for <hi>other</hi> Phyſical uſes. And our <hi>Air</hi> does abound with <hi>Mineral Effluviums,</hi> and much of our <hi>water</hi> with <hi>Mineral Impregnations.</hi> This is alſo the reaſon, why the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Sheppey,</hi> otherwiſe a Rich Country, is ſo unwholſome to live in. And this is the reaſon, why the Waters of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and others Rivers in <hi>Hungary</hi> are ſo unhealthful to drink of. For it was well ſaid of <hi>Plmy,</hi> the Great Naturaliſt: <hi>Tales ſunt Aquae, quales Terroe per quas ſluunt.</hi>

            <p>I cannot omit to take ſome notice of the <hi>good Proviſion</hi> they do make for their <hi>Poor,</hi> whereby they are not peſter'd or moleſted in their Streets, in their Shops, in their Coaches, with any crowd of Beggars, which would ſerve to divert their <hi>Chavity</hi> from proper and good Objects; I mean poor Labourers, or Houſekeepers, who take much pains, to the getting little, towards a ſorry main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a great many Children; or ſuch who through Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or Accidents, are diſabled from getting any thing at all, and are above the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Begging.</hi> If the <hi>Poor</hi> there cannot work, or do want work, there is proviſion made for them both. The <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> or <hi>Officers,</hi> do not think it any <hi>trouble</hi> to them, to go ſometimes from Houſe to Houſe, to enquire privately into their Condition, to obſerve what Children they have, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what they can, or cannot do, towards their Maintenance. And accordingly, both the <hi>known,</hi> and <hi>unknown Poor,</hi> who are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ask for what they want, are ſupplied by the <hi>Publick</hi> from time to time.</p>
            <p>In their <hi>Churches</hi> they do never aſſemble to ſerve <hi>God,</hi> but they manifeſt their <hi>Love</hi> to their <hi>Neighbour.</hi> There is always a <hi>Bag</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to every perſon, with the notice of a little <hi>Bell;</hi> and I am told, that there's hardly one ſingle Perſon, though never ſo mean or little, that comes to <hi>Church,</hi> but does drop ſome <hi>Mite,</hi> or <hi>Doit,</hi> into the <hi>Poor's Bag,</hi> every time he comes. And whatſoever is ſo Collected, or upon other Occaſions, for the <hi>Poor,</hi> does not ſerve
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101429:41"/>to fatten, and make merry, the Petty Officers, but is faichfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, and expended duly to its proper uſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apparel</hi> of the <hi>Dutch</hi> is grave, and free from levith. The men do put on <hi>Black</hi> on Sundays, and other high days; and at other times dark Colours. And this is the mode of all Citizens, and many others, even fo the Boors, not only in the <hi>Seven Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> but in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> Nevertheleſs, their <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> both Men and Women, do dreſs as fine, and modiſhly, as we our ſelves, or others, that cannot for all the world help imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of <hi>Apeing</hi> the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed I muſt ſay, we in <hi>England</hi> are not in ſuch mighty haſt for <hi>New Faſhions,</hi> but that we can make a ſhift to ſtay until our <hi>Taylors</hi> do ſupply us, and make us happy with <hi>Modes</hi> from <hi>Frances,</hi> by their taking a Journey on purpoſe to <hi>Paris</hi> in vacation-time. But ſome of the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> are more careful to be <hi>à la mode de France</hi> as early as may be; for they have the <hi>Faſhions</hi> brought to them ſome hundred Leagues in Poſt-haſte; and, before the War, did uſe to keep <hi>Couriers</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> ready, to bring them quickly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch great moment, upon the <hi>firſt Invention</hi> of a <hi>New Mode.</hi> As if <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> or a ſudden irruption on a Neighbour-State, could not be of greater concern, than a new-cut Feather in the Cap, or ſome ſurprizing Maſterpiece of Gayety.</p>
            <p>And thus I have but gently toucht upon ſome of the Cuſtoms, and ſome part of the Good Government of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which though in ſo near a Neighbour-State, they cannot but be well known to many of our <hi>better ſort,</hi> who are perfectly well acquainted with this part of the Word, and much better than they can be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me; yet I thought even the mentioning theſe things would not be unacceptable to ſome others, who have never been abroad. For it I ſhould undertake the Relation at large of only the <hi>Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> it ſelf, or ſhould particularly ſpeak of the <hi>Keyſer-Grafs,</hi> the <hi>Princes-Graft,</hi> and the <hi>Heer-Graft,</hi> three ſpacious Streets that do almſt incircle the whole <hi>City,</hi> and three Streets that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more Sumptuous Houſes, all of Stone, throughout their long circuit, than can be well imagined by thoſe who have not ſeen them; or if I ſhould treat of the Pleaſant and Magniſicent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of <hi>Sorgvliet,</hi> within a Mile of the <hi>Hague,</hi> given ſome years ſince by His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to the Right Honourable the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Portland,</hi> and which no Strangers, that have any Curioſity, can omit See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they are ſo Admirable and Pleaſant: and the <hi>King</hi> does often
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101429:41"/>retire thithes to Dine, whilſt he reſides at the <hi>Hague;</hi> or laſtly, if I ſhould deſcribe the Charming Sweetneſs of the <hi>Hague,</hi> in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-time, the Pleaſantneſs of <hi>Leyden,</hi> or enter into a repetition of what others have done with applauſe before, this Account would ſoon ſwell into a <hi>Volume,</hi> and a ſhort <hi>Memorandum</hi> into a <hi>prolix Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Conclude, The <hi>Dutch</hi> do deſerve great Conſideration and Kindneſs from us, as they are become a Principal <hi>Bulwork</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> next unto <hi>England,</hi> whoſe <hi>Church</hi> is without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the chiefeſt <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the brighteſt <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>True Moderation,</hi> between the gay Decorations and Paintings of <hi>Superſtition</hi> on the one ſide, and the mean and homely Adrreſſes to <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> on the other. And now eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Dutch</hi> may lay nearer claim to our Amity, when the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> in general had never greater need of <hi>Bulworks</hi> and <hi>Defences;</hi> when not only <hi>France</hi> does manifeſt an unparallel'd <hi>Bigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> by an impolitick and unchriſtian Rage and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> that may in time be found ſo to weaken and unpeople it ſelſ, as to be a <hi>main cauſe</hi> of her Declenſion, whatſoever glorious or formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance ſhe may make for the preſent; but alſo divers <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Princes</hi> have with one accord, and with an unuſual Sympathy, in this Age exerted a <hi>Zeal</hi> againſt their <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that is inconſiſtent with their own <hi>Temporal Intereſt,</hi> and contrary to the Rules of <hi>Humanity</hi> or <hi>Prudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis certain, that whenever <hi>Religion</hi> comes to be ſo far abuſed, as to lay aſide the moſt Eſſential part of it, <hi>Churity,</hi> it blinds the Eyes of all <hi>Zealots,</hi> that they cannot ſee their own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toreſt;</hi> it tranſports and turns them from all the Rules of <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Reaſons,</hi> and makes men commit the moſt fatal, and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant <hi>Errrors,</hi> in Politicks and Civil Socity.</p>
            <p>It is worth the Conſideration of warm and imprudent Princes, whoſe indiſcreet Zeal it ſo apt to inſtigate them to moleſt and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs their Subjects for the ſake of what Honeſt and Pious men cannot ſometimes help, I mean, difference in <hi>Religious</hi> Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what happened to the Obſervation of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth,</hi> after he had Reſigned the <hi>Empire</hi> to his Brother <hi>Ferdimand,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> to his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Second.</hi> This Warlike and Great Prince, after he was grown weary of the Pomp and Glories of the World, and had made his <hi>Retreat</hi> into a <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> had abundance of <hi>Clocks</hi> broght him thither by the beſt Artiſts
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101429:42"/>he could hear of; and his deſire was to make all his <hi>Clocks</hi> ſtrike together at the ſame Hour. When he had long tried this Attempt in vain, he brake out into this <hi>poius</hi> Exclamation: <hi>How vain and fooliſh is it for Princes to endeavour to make all their Subjects to be of one mind, when no Art is able to make a few Clocks ſtrike together at the ſame time!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, ſince now no former Alliances, no common Intereſt, no remenbrance of Benefits lately received, no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how great ſoever, can poſſibly reſtrain <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates from trampling their own Subjects under their feet, meerly for thinking otherwiſe than they do in matters of <hi>Supperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and from attemptng to <hi>Convert</hi> them by the powerful miſſion of irreſiſtible <hi>Dragoons,</hi> and by more refined Methods than were heretofore practiſed in the Ten dull Pagan Perſecutions; moſt certainly at <hi>Hearty Union,</hi> and Strict Alliance, and <hi>Freindſhip,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> was never more abſolutely neceſſary than at this time, for the Good and Proſperity, ſhall I ſay, or for the <hi>Preſervation</hi> and mutual Defence of <hi>both Nations,</hi> and alſo for the maintenance and ſupport of the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Europe.</hi> Whilſt <hi>We</hi> ſtand firm, and ſtrictly <hi>United</hi> with <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> we ſhall have no need to fear the Power or Attempts of <hi>any Common Enemy;</hi> our <hi>Trane</hi> can never ſuffter in any great degree, and our <hi>Riches</hi> will ſupply to us ſuch <hi>Smews</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> ſuch an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible <hi>Magazine</hi> of <hi>Military Force,</hi> as will defeat and overcome thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>Monarchs,</hi> whoſe <hi>Ambition</hi> will never ſuffer them to be <hi>quiet,</hi> but whilſt they are <hi>diſturbing</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> of their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> or who will needs be aiming at <hi>Impoſſibilities,</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher's Stone,</hi> or <hi>Univerſal Monarchy.</hi>
