         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>We ſee all their dealings, which troubl'd us ſore,</l>
               <l>The Fryars and Ieſuits dayly came o're.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In City and Town they did Maſs-houſes build,</l>

               <l>The Proverb of old is made true in this caſe,</l>
               <l>We ſee that an ill Weed will flouriſh apace.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They ſtill are inventing and forging of Lyes,</l>
               <l>Againſt our Bible and Clergy likewiſe;</l>
               <l>In hopes they might ſuddenly be overthrown,</l>
               <l>And then they concluded the Game was their own.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Biſhops away to the Tower was ſent,</l>
               <l>As ſtout and as chearful as Martyrs they went;</l>
               <l>Not fearing what ever might fall to their doom,</l>
               <l>They ſcorn to ſubmit to the Clergy of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now while the true Church thus did tottering ſtand,</l>
               <l>It was a great grief to moſt Men in this Land:</l>
               <l>But while we with ſorrowful ſighings did grieve,</l>
               <l>Each Fryar and Ieſuits laught in their Sleeve.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And Old Father <hi>Peters</hi> was one of the Train,</l>
               <l>Who did for a while in his Roguery Reign;</l>
               <l>But Fortune was pleaſed to ſend him a Frown,</l>
               <l>And from his high Honour to tumble him down.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now ſeeing himſelf in this ſorrowful caſe,</l>
               <l>He thought it no boot to remain in this place;</l>
               <l>And therefore his Breetches with Guinnies he lin'd,</l>
               <l>In order for running ſome ſhelter to find.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now while he was taking this dangerous flight,</l>
               <l>He pray'd to Saint <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Bridget</hi> all night;</l>
               <l>But yet not withſtanding his Religious Prayer.</l>
               <l>He was taken napping as <hi>Moſs</hi> catcht his Mare.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>There is many more as we well underſtand,</l>
               <l>Wiſhes that they were ſafe out of the Land;</l>
               <l>They'd rather leave <hi>Brittain,</hi> and flye to the Pope,</l>
               <l>Than here to take part of the Hatchet and Rope.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And now to return to the Prince <hi>Van Orange,</hi>

               <l>And now let us drink a good Health to the Mitre,</l>

               <l>Next Health to that Seven that ſtood by out Cauſe,</l>
