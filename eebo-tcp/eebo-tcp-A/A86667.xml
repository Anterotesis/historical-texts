            <title>The rebukes of a reviler fallen upon his own head, in an answer to a book put forth by one Iohn Stelham, called a minister at Terlin in Essex. Wherein is shewed unto all spiritual men, that he himself is justly proved to be a contradictor of the scriptures, while he falsly accuses others thereof, that are clear, and the saying is fulfilled upon him, he is fallen into the pit, which he digged for others, for even that way which he calls heresie, do we worship the God of our fathers.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which light is Chriſt, and which light is the foundation of Faith, and is the foundation of many generations, in which many did believe, before, this letter which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares of it was written; And that Faith which ſtands in the light, and in the power of God is the ground of the Scripture letter, from whence it did proceed; after they believed they ſpoke and wrote that which is now declared, in Chapters.

                  <p>But <hi>John Stelham</hi> going on in his own deviſed Fables, would pervert the words of truth, both in our writings, and in the Apoſtles, as it is manifeſt, in his writing, of this reviling Rebuke concerning <hi>R.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118841:16"/>
ſaying, <hi>If they mean thus, &amp;c.</hi> then he goes about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his own meaning, and when he hath contradicted his own meaning; then he ſaith he hath contradicted their words, though he have before confeſſed the truth of their words, ſo he hath not contradicted the words as they were ſpoken, but becauſe they ſpoke not his meaning with the words, therefore the true words muſt be falſe in his judgement, and bear his rebuke, as his Book doth make manifeſt, and adding his lye to the words of truth, theſe two things are his greateſt proofs to reſiſt the truth, in <hi>page</hi> 77. he hath mingled his own words with the words of <hi>R.

                  <p>But on the contrary, for we never have ſaid that every mans judgement is renewed with the light, though they be enlightened, for they are enlightened who hate it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who are void of true judgement becauſe they hate the light which they be enlightened withal. And alſo the Apoſtles words he perverts and gives meanings unto, which if he did not they would be a plain teſtimony with that which he hath ſet himſelf to oppoſe, ſo giving meanings both to their words, and our words, his meanings muſt be the ground of his Believers Faith, and not the Scriptures, as he ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of a more ſure Word of Propheſie, wherein they did well to take heed, as unto a light that ſhined in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in their hearts, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.

                  <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, Until the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts, and that holy men of God ſpoke as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt, and that which moved them to ſpeak Propheſies was in their hearts, and the Apoſtle did not bid them wait till the day-ſtar did ariſe in the Scriptures, but till it did ariſe in their hearts, and then he told them how the Propheſies of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures came.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> ſaying, Until the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in our hearts, <hi>I. S.</hi> ſaith, That is until by the ſtudy of the Scriptures, more light be cleared up, &amp;c.</p>

was before Ordinances was, and which light gives to ſee the place of Ordinances, and their time wherein they are to be obeyed, for the light comes from the ſubſtance of all the divers waſhings, and carnall Ordinances, and it leads into the one Baptiſme which is the ſubſtance of that of Water which <hi>Iohn</hi> who was a Prophet was the Miniſter of, and Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>Iohn verily bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth with Water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and with fire; but he never commanded them to baptize with Water, but commanded them <hi>to go teach all Nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and although ſome of the Diſciples, and <hi>Paul</hi> for a time did Baptize with Water: yet who ſhall judge their permiſſion in it, although <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt witneſſeth, <hi>that he was not ſent to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 17. and thanks God that he had baptized no more of them, yet witneſſed that they were all Baptized with one Spirit into one Body.

This is falſe, for that Scripture doth not command it, nor give preſident for it; let the Reader ſearch if he find any ſuch thing, as the Scripture proving Infants Baptiſme, but the promiſe is to as many as the Lord ſhall call, and ſo he hath foully belyed the Scripture, for if that Scripture be contrary to ſuch who are againſt Infants Baptiſme, then muſt he prove from that Scripture Infants Baptiſme to be commanded as practiſed, which he cannot do, and ſo is a perverter of the Scripture, and it is truth that we do deny brain imaginations, and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Infants with water; but then he rambles over many Scriptures, proving the Baptiſme of Believers; theſe proofs are impertinent, what is this to prove Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme? ſo that is paſſed by here, as making arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Believers Baptiſme, except one profeſſing that were our preſent adverſary, but in this he is purſued from all the Scriptures; he cannot prove in juſtice that ever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Baptiſme was either commanded, or practiſed, though he craftily wind about never ſo much in his Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations

to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which Goſpel was, and is the power of God, before theſe four men did Declare of it, though we deny their Writings to be the very Goſpel which is the power of God, yet we do not deny, but they truly declared of the Goſpel, and this is to own the Scripture as it ſpeaks of it ſelf to be.</p>

                  <p>And further, he would plead for the title of Maſter, from the example of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, but this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prove the lawfulneſs of a Miniſter of Chriſt, that they may be called Maſter: for Chriſt ſaith to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Be ye not called Maſters, and the Spirit of Chriſt being our rule, that leads us in the fulfilling of Chriſts words, let <hi>I.

light of Chriſt, by whom the world was made, who light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man in the World: and by this it is known more evidently what Spirit I. <hi>S.</hi> is of: but there is none of us who have received the knowledge of God by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light of Chriſt which ſhines in our hearts can believe him: and this is no contradiction to ſay that every man is lightened by Chriſt with the true light, and y et to ſay, ſome men are living in a natural condition, both theſe are true, for ſome hates the light of Chriſt, and their deeds are evil, and ſuch are in a natural condition; but this doth not prove that Chriſt hath not given them light, though they be in a natural condition, I leave it to ſpiritual men to judge, though they ſay <hi>it ſeems ſtrange, that ſome ſhould live a natural condition, and yet have the light of Chriſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as if every man brought a Saviour with him into the world.</hi> This laſt is his falſe conception, but he is mans Saviour by whoſe power every man is brought into the World, and if <hi>I.

                  <p>And further, <hi>he ſaith the light in every man is a poor, baſe, beggarly ſcrap to the Goſpel treaſure;</hi> theſe words are uttered in his haſtineſs, and without either fear or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for he that lighteth every man with the true light of life, (or of condemnation) is not baſe beggarly ſcraps, as <hi>I.

Further, he would ſay that this is contradiction to ſay that every man in his firſt birth may ſee himſelf to be natural; and yet to ſay that the light which diſcovers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural corruptions, is not natural, but ſpiritual, both theſe are true, for the light ſhines in darkneſs, which ſhews the darkneſs, and is not darkneſs but light: and he that can underſtand that Scripture <hi>Iohn</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. ſhall ſee the truth of both theſe to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And further, he charges <hi>a deceit when men will put off that for redemption light which is but old creation light;</hi> let

him charge them that are guilty: but yet we ſay that the ſame is Redeemed by whom the world was created; and this is without any deceit, and he that lighteneth every man with the light, that is but one, he is the Saviour of all that receive him in the light, and he is the condemner of all that hate his light; and this is no ſelf-contradiction, but the very truth as it is in Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>I. S.</hi> would make it appear if he could that we contradict our ſelves concerning ſin and Chriſt, but his whole Section I leave to be read in his Book, and let the wiſe Reader judge whether his proof be any ſuch thing, only his lye will prove what he ſaith; he ſaith, <hi>We hold Chriſt to be in all,</hi> this is his Lye, for we ſay Chriſt is not in the Reprobate, neither did we ever affirm that Chriſt is not in the Reprobate, and ſo is not in all; neither do we concerning Juſtification contradict our ſelves in the Spirit of God, though ſo it may appeare to <hi>I. S.</hi> blind mind, and ſo would make it appear to others by blind ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments by his own meaning. Again <hi>I. S.</hi> would charge ſelf-contradiction upon, becauſe we bear witneſs to the New Covenant, and doth ſay, the children of God are taught of God, and needs no man to teach them, but as the anoynting within them, and yet doth write and print; here he ſaith we condemne in others what we allow in our ſelves. Now to all honeſt people this is no contradiction, neither a condemning in others what we allow in our ſelves, for therefore we write, and print, and ſpeak, that all may come to the knowledge of this thing, and may be converted to God, and know his teaching within them; but what would <hi>I. S.</hi> have ſaid of <hi>John</hi> who told them they needed no man to teach them, but as that within them; and yet did write Epiſtles to them, very like he would have called this contradictions. And the ſame is our cauſe, who doth and muſt do (though <hi>I. S.</hi> and his companions be grieved therewith) becauſe their folly is laid open, thereby print, and write, and ſpeak that people through the Miniſtry be brought to know the teaching of God in themſelves, and yet herein in the light of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118841:37"/>
of God, do we not contradict our ſelves, let <hi>I. S.</hi> ſay what he will: neither do we allow in our ſelves what we condemn in another, this is one of <hi>I.

                  <p>Further, <hi>I. S.</hi> doth inſtance <hi>E.

by which carnal men doth judge of carnal tranſgreſſions, is natural; <hi>E.

                  <p>Further he ſaith, <hi>There is ſufficient light in the Scripture to guide men to ſalvation:</hi> mark his Doctrine, whether he hath not preached another thing than Chriſt to be the way, and whether he hath not made Chriſt, and the blood of Chriſt of none effect, without which no ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he ſaith there is ſufficient in the Scripture to lead men to ſalvation, and neither Chriſt nor his blood is in Scripture, let it be moved.</p>

                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:118841:38"/>Further, he ſaith, <hi>The Scripture was given by the Spirit for a rule;</hi> this we deſire a proof off by plain Scripture, and till then we deny it. And further, he ſaith, <hi>The Spirit gives out himſelf by Scripture:</hi> and yet he ſaith <hi>he never ſaid the Scripture did give the Spirit,</hi> and this is an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, as may be noted ſo <hi>I.

                  <p>He charges us with ſelf-contradiction, becauſe we ſay we own praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet hath given over Family prayer, morning and evening, and at meals, but this is no contradiction: for we own praying in the Spirit of God, but doth deny it without the Spirit, and this is no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; he may as well ſay it was contradiction in Chriſt to cry againſt the prayers of the Phariſees, &amp; yet to teach his Diſciples to pray, and to pray himſelf; this is the ſame cauſe of ours which he fooliſhly charges with contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as I have ſaid the prayers of the Wicked we deny, and yet doth own Prayer in the Spirit, and who are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Spirit morning or evening, or at meals, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118841:39"/>
and this is truth let <hi>I. S.</hi> gather what he can from it.</p>
                  <p>Further, he ſaith, <hi>If we teach one another, why do we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them for teaching.</hi> But to this I have anſwered Preaching or Teaching by the Spirit we own, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit we deny; and becauſe we ſay we own all that which is Gods, as Baptiſme, the Lords Supper, and Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pet doth diſown in practice their Water Baptiſme, and their form of breaking of Bread and Wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their forms of Church-fellowſhip, and their form of keeping a Sabbath; this he charges to be contradiction, but it is not ſo in the ſight of the Lord, though <hi>I. S.</hi> falſely ſo judge it; for their Baptiſme and breaking of Bread and Wine, and their Church fellowſhip, and keeping of a day, I ſay their exerciſe in theſe things we do deny to be of God, as in meaſure is proved, and may be further if need require; and I ſay we own that which is Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which is led unto by his Spirit, and practiſed in his fear, and counſel, and yet we do deny all their Immitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any thing which God commanded doth owne the command of God, and yet doth not contradict our ſelves, though <hi>I. S.</hi> falſely ſo judge of us.</p>
                  <p>Further, he charges us with ſelf-contradiction, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeech, and ſilence, becauſe we check ſome for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet ſpeaks or writes our ſelves; but this is the ſame with the former, and the ſame anſwer will ſerve, that ſpeaking that which is not in the Spirit we check, which is not the voyce of Chriſt, but of the ſtranger, and yet doth own that which is ſpoken by the Spirit of God, and herein doth not contradict our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Further, he ſaith, We contradict our ſelves concerning Conſcience and Laws; becauſe we ſay there muſt be no Law concerning Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> to bind any man to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in this or the other way, and to bind him from this or that way of Worſhip, and yet in exhorting the Rulers that their Laws be according to that in the Conſcience; but in theſe words there is no contradiction, for the Laws being according to the light in every mans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Conſcience,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118841:39"/>
that Law will not bind, or limit the Conſcience from this or that way of Worſhip in Religion, for that Law is un<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> juſt which binds or limits the pure conſcience of any man; but that Law which is contrary to the light in every mans conſcience, is oppreſſion, and we bear witneſs againſt it; and though we do ſay no Law muſt be laid upon Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is to ſay, to bind any mans Conſcience to or from ſuch a form of Religion; and though we further ſay that all juſt Laws is and ſhould be according to the light in every mans conſcience: yet in this there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>I. S.</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch Laws who perſecuted, priſoned, and crucified for the teſtimony of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>God hath hewen down in all ages</hi> ſaith he: Let the Rulers of <hi>England</hi> take notice of this from the mouth of one of their Teachers. And further, I adde, ſo will God hew down in this Age all thoſe Laws by which many are perſecuted and priſoned, as he hath done ie other Ages; therefore let it be conſidered by them.</p>
                  <p>And he ſaith, <hi>The Magiſtrate is not to levell his Law with every mans conſcience and light:</hi> and this he ſpeaks in oppoſition to us, but he needs not, for we ſay the ſame that ſome mens Conſciences are defiled, and we do not deſire the Laws to be made according to mens ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and defiled Conſciences, but according to the light of Chriſt Jeſus in every mans Conſcience, which is but one in all, and is according to the Law of God, and every juſt Law will be according to it, and though <hi>I. S.</hi> by his own meaning would make it appear contradiction in our ſaying no Law muſt be concerning Religion, and yet ſaying all Laws ſhould be according to the light of Chriſt in the Conſcience; Now by theſe words we do not mean that we would not have a Law according to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but no Law to limit to or from this or that manner of Religion, and this doth very well agree with our ſaying, let all your Laws be according to the light of Chriſt; ſo by his miſinterpretation of the firſt he makes it appear to be contradictions to the ſecond; but it is not ſo in the light of the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:118841:40"/>And further, <hi>R. F.</hi> ſaying the law of God anſwers his Juſtice, and the light of Chriſt in the conſcience anſwers the law of God which is perfect, according to that in the conſcience; theſe words <hi>I. S.</hi> charges with two errors: but let the Reader try where the error lyes, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>I. S.</hi> falſe deduction from <hi>R. F.</hi> plain words, which are ſimply uttered, through ſubtilty wreſted.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>I. S.</hi> ſpeaks as if ſome would have Magiſtrates to make Laws to bind themſelves from ſtriking at offenders, Blaſphemers, Goſpel and Church diſturbers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In anſwer to this, we are not they that would have any Magiſtrates to bind themſelves from ſtriking at offenders, who are truly able to judge of offences, we own that ſuch ſhould be puniſhed according to the offence, but the Magiſtrates Law reaches but to the outward man, to keep that in peace and good order, and not to the inward man to bind or limit that.</p>
                  <p>And as for Blaſphemy, and Goſpel, and Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, we find many Magiſtrates not able to judge thereof: but many on the contrary calling truth blaſphemy, and reproving of ſin in Teachers and people, Goſpel and Church diſturbing, and ſo by falſe judgement making ſuch offenders which are not, and ſo abuſing their power, and condemning the Innocent rather then the guilty, and theſe are ſuch as <hi>I. S.</hi> ſpeaks of, where the ſtrong man armed keeps the houſe, and theſe are rather a terror to well doers then to evill, and ſuch Magiſtrates, and ſuch Laws by which the juſt are oppreſſed, and the hands of the wicked ſtrengthened will the Lord confound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a day to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his name, and to the refreſhing of all his people, who is now every way oppreſſed by evill men, both by Rulers, Teachers, and People.</p>
                  <p>And as for the reſt of his Book, its but of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the former, and not worth anſwering to, onely his lyes I do deny, and his firſt following is, that all our Doctrines are raiſed upon the ruines of the Scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and authority; this is falſe, neither doth his proof at all make it good. His ſecond lye is, that our corrupt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118841:40"/>
Tenents are built upon falſe and novel Interpretations, and this is two lyes together, our Tenents are not corrupt, neither do we build any thing which we hold upon falſe Interpretations. His third lye is, that it is pride that hath bred, and doth feed our opinions and practiſes: and this is alſo falſe, and to prove it hath wreſted ſome of <hi>E. B.</hi> words. His fourth lye is, that unbelief begets, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creates all our errors, and our love of error with our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſions of the truth; here is many lyes folded up in one, which are all denyed with the life of God, and the author of them proved to be of the Devil, and we proved to be of God, who are ſpoken all manner of evil againſt falſely for the name of Jeſus. His fifth lye is, that we do ſubtilly couch many errors under ſpacious words of truth: this lye alſo I bear Witneſs againſt, as alſo againſt his Sixth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he charges us with meer ignorance, and wilful blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs about the covenant of Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His ſeventh lye is, that much of myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> and confuſion is in our Writings, and wayes: this is alſo a lye and of the devil; and alſo againſt his eight I bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, our Doctrines and practiſes ends not in Apoſtacy, neither are they blaſphemy againſt Chriſt, as <hi>I. S.</hi> impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aſſerteth; ſo that from the firſt of his Book to his laſt his whole Work is born witneſs againſt not to be of God, but of the devill, and in vain hath he ſtriven, and his Work ſhall not accompliſh any part of his deſire: for the <hi>Quakers</hi> againſt whom he hath Written cannot be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in Chriſt, though <hi>I. S.</hi> have endeavoured for to make their way and Doctrines in the ſight of men abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable; but his Work ſhall not prevent the purpoſe of the Lord, nor the gathering in of the upright-hearted from the mouths of devouring Shepheards, ſuch as <hi>I.

                     </hi> who is it that doth not begin to ſee their deceits and abominations? yea thouſands do, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſhall be changed, and ſhall become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt, and Antichriſt and all his miniſters ſhall be confounded, and the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet ſhall both be taken alive, and caſt into the lake.</p>
                  <p>Ah, <hi>John Stelham,</hi> againſt whom haſt thou ſet thy ſelf, and exalted thy horn? againſt whom haſt thou bent thy ſtrength, and ſhot forth thy envie in crafty words of guile? who is it that thou haſt defied, and girded on thy armour againſt, and counted them as nothing before thy uncircumciſed ſtrength? even againſt the Lords people haſt thou thus done, though thou wilt not now know it, yet one day thou ſhalt know it, when iniquity is come to an end, and tranſgreſſion finiſhed, and thou ſhalt ſtand in thy lot at that day, and receive according to thy work a juſt and righteous reward from the hand of the Lord, in the day of judgement, when every ſecret work of iniquity ſhall appear to condemnation; and in the mean time, the Lord will bring forth good unto his people, even from thy evil, and all things (even thy evil purpoſes) ſhail work together for good, unto ſuch whom God hath called: and thy works and purpoſes which are to trouble them, and to break them, and to make them appear vile in the ſight of men, even thy work doth the Lord turn, to eſtabliſh them, and to unite them; and in the ſight of men, thy work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, proves us to be of God, and thy ſelf to be of the Devil, who was a perſecutor from the beginning, and thou ſhalt be ſcattered in thy imaginations, and thy whole work hath God confounded, and it ſhall not accompliſh any whit of that end propounded in thy ſinful heart, which hath brought forth milchief, for it's blaſted in the anger of God, and men ſhall neither call it, nor the Father of it, any more bleſſed: And Friend, hadſt thou known how little it doth accompliſh of thy evil intent, thou would have ſpared thy labour, and employed thy ſervice to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, and then had not thy wickedneſs ſo greatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the ſight of God, nor thy ſhame and nakedneſs in the ſight of men, as it now doth, by this thy ſinful deed,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118841:41"/>
brought forth of a curſed womb, and conceived in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs: Alas, alas man! How art thou fallen into the pit which thou haſt digged for another? And how doth the ſhame overtake thee, which thou haſt thought ſhould fall upon us; let thy wickedneſs correct thee, and know thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Lord will not forſake his people, who cannot be offended in Chriſt, though thou caſt ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks of iniquity in the way, and would cauſe them to ſin; but even ſo much the more, as thou ſpeaks evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the way of the Lord, are they the more upright therein, and the more loving and delighting in the path of righteouſneſs, and thou haſt but the more fully diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in many things from thy own pen, the wickedneſs and wrath that hath ſecretly lodged in thy heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it appears that thy wiſdom is devilliſh, and from below; deceiving and being deceived, and thy path is in craft and ſubtilty, and not in innocency and plain ſimplicit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> this manner, and by this means chiefly is thy work man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged unto an evil end, but the Lord hath rebuked it, and will do yet more, till it appear to all men, as it doth to us, to be what I have ſaid of it, and it ſhall be a ſhame to thee, and ſhall not receive prayſe neither of God nor man, but condemnation in the ſight of both; and hadſt thou known that we are eſtabliſhed even on the top of Gods holy mountain, and cannot be moved nor ſhaken, by ſuch weak pitiful blaſts of confuſion and ignorance, coming out of thy mouth, where poyſon lodges under thy tongue, ſure hadſt thou known it, thou would have travelled in another path; but that thy folly might appear unto all men, is thy work ſent abroad, that they may ſee what lodges in thy mind, even more envie then in the heart of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and more deſire of evil to the Lords people than ever, was in him; and thou fulfils the meaſure of thy forefathers wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, till the ſum be accounted, and deſtruction follow, thou haſt too much troubled thy ſelf, in labouring, and thy reward will not countervail thy pains; hadſt thou but only ſpoken againſt us, we ſhould have born it, and thou might
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118841:42"/>
have been the more excuſed, but in that thou haſt ſpoken againſt the light of Chriſt, and called it <hi>perverſe Principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and many other blaſphemous words of bitterneſs againſt the very truths of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>This is the cauſe wherefore we have anſwered thee, and thou art utterly inexcuſable; for what thou haſt done, it is not altogether through ignorance, though much igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be in it, but out of perfect rebellion, and purpoſe of miſchief; and for Maſtery we do not ſtrive with thee, but rather wiſheth thy repentance, than thy deſtruction; and who doth not believe but your kingdom (I mean the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi>) is going down apace, and your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fading as a flower, and the Lord will make you a ſhame to your ſelves, who hath for many ages preyed devouring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the upright, and through perfect covetouſneſs have made merchandize of Souls; and now many hath an eye opened to ſee your ſhame, and it appears with horrible deteſtation; even the ſaying is fulfilled, <hi>As troups of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers wait for a man, ſo the company of Prieſts Murders in the way by conſent,</hi> as the Prophet ſaid: and as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Wo unto you, you will not enter your ſelves, nor ſuffer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to enter that world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore thou <hi>J. Stelham.</hi> even thou repent of this thy Wickedneſs, for the wrath of the Lord is gone forth againſt thee, and evill haſt thou done againſt God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his people, and againſt thy own Soul, and this thou ſhalt know one day to thy exceeding ſorrow, unto which time we leave thee, and could have born all thy ſcandalous rearms without replying again, but onely for the ſake of the ſimple, that thy neighbours may ſee thy folly, and all men to whom thine and this doth come, and we have not been large, but in ſhort, have in ſingleneſs of heart born our teſtimony once more to the truth of the glorious Goſpel which we have received of God, and not of man, and againſt thee and thy ſinful heart, and whatſoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds out of it, for thou being evill, how canſt thou ſpeak good things, the Tree muſt be good before the fruit can be ſo, but out of thy evill heart haſt thou brought
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118841:42"/>
forth evill, and muſt receive the reward of evill whether thou wilt or no; and what if we ſhould go about to ſhew wherein the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> do contradict the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, might not we have a large Catalogue, even in all your Worſhip, and in the moſt of your practiſes, acting contrary to the Scripture, and contradicting that Spirit that gave it forth in Doctrine, and in converſation in ſuch an enterpriſe as this might, we make your folly ſound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; and as to the contradicting your ſelves, and being of many judgements and opinions, and difference in many particulars about the things of God among your ſelves herein you abound almoſt above meaſure; and this if need require, could I by the ſtrength of Jeſus ſufficiently make you appear abominable in the eyes of all juſt men, and ſo think not in thy ſelf that you are free from Scripture, and ſelf-contradiction, but truly guilty your ſelves in what thou haſt wickedly accuſed us of falſely, which doth but prove thee to be of thy Father who is an accurſer of the Brethren, and proves us to be of God according to Chriſts words, we are ſpoken all manner of evill of falſely for the name of Jeſus Chriſt, whom we ſerve, and therefore are hated of the world becauſe we are not of it; but without much more words I leave this <hi>I.
