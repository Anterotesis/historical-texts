            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The ſtate of the Caſe upon a Decree againſt the Lord Chancellor of Ireland by the Lord Deputy and Councell there: as alſo of the Commitment of the Lord Chancellor, and taking from him the Seale of that Kingdome.</head>
            <p>THAT about <hi>Anno</hi> 1620. There was a propoſition made for a marriage to be had between Sir <hi>Robert Loftus</hi> the Lord Chancellors eldeſt Son, and <hi>Elinor</hi> one of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Sir <hi>Francis Ruſhy.</hi> That the perſon employed herein betweene the Fathers, was only Sir <hi>William Cooley,</hi> who married the daughter of the Lady <hi>Ruſhy</hi> by Mr. <hi>Gifford</hi> her former husband. That the Marriage tooke effect <hi>Anno</hi> 1620. 1750 li. portion given. And Sir <hi>Robert</hi> and his Lady, and family lived in the Lord Chancellors houſe, and at his charge in a plentifull manner, without any complaint, untill about <hi>anno</hi> 1636. That there was not any complaint by Sir <hi>Francis Ruſhy,</hi> who lived divers yeares, nor by his Lady, ſince by Bill or Petition againſt the Lord Chancellor either for preſent maintenance of the young couple, jointure or ſettlement of eſtate. That by the death of <hi>Thomas Ruſhy</hi> ſonne of Sir <hi>Francis Ruſhy,</hi> a faire inheritance befell to the young Lady <hi>Loftus,</hi> and two other ſiſters whereof Sir <hi>George Wentworth</hi> the Lord Deputies brother, about foure yeares ſince married the one. This thus reſting for many yeares, The Lord Chancellors eſtate he had at the time of his ſonnes marriage much improved, and a faire addition ſince by purchaſe. A faire inheritance ſettled upon Sir <hi>Robert</hi> his eldeſt ſonne. A jointure upon his Lady A dignity and honour upon his ſecond ſonne, he married and having iſſue, and the Lord Chancellor bound in Iuſtice and Honour to performe an agreement made upon his ſecond ſons marriage. A daughter mariagable and unpreferred. Himſelfe, Lady and family to be ſupported according to the place and honour he beares. Debts to be provided for. And ſervants of good deſerving in ſome ſort agreeing to honour recompenced. About Michaelmas <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. a Petition is here preferred to his Majeſty in the name of Sir <hi>Iohn Gifford,</hi> a halfe brother to Sir <hi>Robert Loftus</hi> his Lady. Thereby is informed that the Lord Chancellor in conſideration of the ſaid marriage and 1750 li. portion did agree to ſettle upon Sir <hi>Robert</hi> 1500 li. <hi>per an.</hi> with hope of further increaſe. For preſent maintenance 200 li. <hi>per annum.</hi> For jointure 300 li. <hi>per annum.</hi> That he excuſed to ſet his agreement in writing, but proteſted the performance. That the portion was paid. The performance long expected. That no allowance hath beene for preſent maintenance. No ſettling of eſtate. No jointure made. That the Lord Chancellor was become diſaffected to Sir <hi>Robert</hi> his eldeſt ſonne, and inclined to Sir <hi>Edward</hi> a ſecond ſonne, who had no iſſue male, and in failer of iſſue male by him, to the iſſue male of a daughter, rather then to the heires generall of his eldeſt ſonne whereby is prayed. That this agreement being properly relievable in equity where the Lord Chancellor is both Iudge and Party, that the ſame might be referred, heard and determined <hi>per</hi> Lord Deputy and Counſell, where witneſſes might be examined, the cauſe heard, all conveiances produced of Lands whereof the Lord Chancellor was poſſeſſed of at the time of the marriage. A diſcovery of what eſtate by him made to Sir <hi>Edward</hi> his younger ſonne, and a reſtraint of any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſtate to be made. Agreeable to this prayer, there is procured from his Majeſty a letter 9. Feb. 1636. to the Lord Deputy, with a ſpeciall intimation of his Majeſty, of a care of a ſettlement to be had for ſupport of the honour. Hereupon 7. Martii, 1636. in the name of Sir <hi>Iohn Gifford</hi> is preferred to the Lord Deputy and Counſell there, a Petition in the nature of a Bill. This differs from the former Petition to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Differences betweene the Petition to the King, and that to the Lord Deputy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This informing the 1500. li. <hi>per annum</hi> pretended by the former petition, was agreed to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> upon Sir <hi>Robert Loftus,</hi> Should be 1500. li. <hi>per annum</hi> of the then preſent value, and to be ſettled upon Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> and upon the heires of his body, and in particular mentions the Mannor of Mounſtreven. That to the King pretending the agreement was the Lord Chancellor would ſettle 1500. li. <hi>per annum,</hi> with hope of a further increaſe. This chargeth him to have agreed to ſettle all he had and ſhould have, and provide for Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> his ſecond ſonne onely an annuity of 200. li. <hi>per annum.</hi> Whereas that to the King chargeth 200. li. <hi>per annum</hi> to be given for preſent maintenance of the young couple. This chargeth farther, it was agreed Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> his Lady and family ſhould live in houſe of the Lord Chancellor at his charge, or have allowance for it, and alſo 200. li. <hi>per annum.</hi> Vpon theſe complaints that are thus different in maine points. That are ſtirred up by the petition of a ſtranger, and not upon the complaint of his ſonne, or his Lady, nor moved by Sir <hi>Francis Ruſhy</hi> nor his Lady. Not ſtirred untill Sir <hi>George Wentworth</hi> had married a ſiſter and coheire of Sir <hi>Robert Loftus</hi> Lady grounded upon a pretended verball agreement of 16. yeares old, which no Court of juſtice admits. Proved but by the ſingle teſtimony of Sir <hi>William Cooley,</hi> which no Court of juſtice grounds a Decree upon, and is no more then that the Lord Chancellor ſaid unto him as a meſſage to deliver Sir <hi>Francis Ruſhy,</hi> I will leave unto my ſonne Sir <hi>Robert Loftus</hi> my houſe and lands of Mounſtreven, and other lands to the value of 1200. li. in Ireland and England, and if it pleaſe God to ſpare me life and health, I hope I ſhall be able to leave him more, and ſaid he would make a Ioynture better then the portion, and would give them ſo long as they lived with him 200. li. <hi>per annum</hi> for maintenance, and if they lived from him 200. li. and Dronmaugh to live on. Yet doth the Decree complained of adjudge the Lord Chancellor. 1. To pay from the time of the marriage the 200. li. <hi>per annum</hi> adjudged to be wholly unpaid, and intereſt for it, but at 10. li. <hi>per centum.</hi> To eſtate upon Sir <hi>Robert</hi> Dronmaugh, and 200. li. <hi>per annum,</hi> and put him in poſſeſſion of the ſame. That 2000. li. lately paid <hi>per</hi> Lo: Chancellor for Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> debts ſhall not be allowed as any part of the arreeres of 200. li. <hi>per annum</hi> decreed againſt him. That for other ſummes proved payed <hi>per</hi> Lo: Chancellor to Sir <hi>Robert</hi> (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſtrictneſſe is not to be uſed betweene father and ſon) the Auditor directed to collect them, and then farther conſideration to be had of the allowance of them. That for as much as the Lord Chancellor had ſaid upon the treaty, the Ioynture ſhould exceed in proportion, the 1750. li. portion given, the ſame decreed to be 300. li. <hi>per annum</hi> of lands, as the value ſtood at Michaelmas next after the marriage, which are more by improvement above 800. li. <hi>per annum.</hi> That the Lord Chancellor ſhall ſettle likewiſe upon Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> and the heyres of his body begotten on the body of <hi>Ellenor,</hi> lands of the value of 1200. li. as the ſame were at Michaelmas next after the marriage, the value to bee ſettled <hi>per</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, chargeable onely with the thirds of the Lo: Chancellors Lady the jointure of Sir <hi>Robert</hi> the ſons Lady and 200. li. <hi>per annum</hi> annuity to Sir <hi>Edward Loftus</hi> during his life. And that for ſettling the ſame that the Lord Chancellor and Sir <hi>Edward</hi> procure their Ladies to joyne in a fine and farther aſſurance, as the Councell and that Board ſhould thinke fit. And that the lands called Criew Euſtace being a purchaſe after the marriage, and taken by the Lord Chancellor in the name of Sir <hi>Robert Loftus</hi> his ſon in truſt, and granted by the Lo: Chancellor to Sir <hi>Edward</hi> his ſecond ſon for 1000. yeares, ſhould (if otherwiſe there were ſufficient to ſupply the 1200. li. <hi>per annum)</hi> be ſettled likewiſe with Sir <hi>Robert</hi> in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforeſaid, otherwiſe to be caſt into the value of 1200. li. <hi>per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This thus decreed 1. Febr. 1637.</p>
            <p>Severall references with Commiſſions are awarded to ſettle the ſumme of the arrerage, of the 200. li. <hi>per annum</hi> with intereſt, decreed for Sir <hi>Roberts</hi> maintenance, and to inquire and certifie the value of the Lord Chancellors lands which he had at the time of the marriage, or purchaſed ſince, with reference to the time of the marriage. Theſe references being on foot, the Lord Chancellor (no cauſe being intimated in the Order) or warrant of the 20. of April 1638. is commanded upon his allegiance to bring and deliver the great Seale. The Lo: Chancellor comming the next day without it is committed, and the Seale taken from him. And under that commitment is continued priſoner for 15. moneths; in which time his Chaplaines acceſſe to him, petitioned for, is denyed. The 17. of Iuly 1638. the arrerage of the 200. li. <hi>per annum</hi> maintenance for Sir <hi>Robert</hi> with the intereſt is eſtated to be 3179. li. 6. s. 5. d. and ordered to be paid. 18. Ianuar. 1639. his whole revenue, entertainment, fees and penſions, ſequeſtred. A Statute of 4000 li. that my Lord <hi>Loftus</hi> ſhould not interrupt the payment of the rents and profits to Sir <hi>Paul Davis</hi> Clarke of the Councell, who was appointed to receive them. That in execution of this decree the whole eſtate was conveied unto <hi>Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> Sir <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Mannering</hi> in truſt. The 3179 li. 6 s. 5 d. levied and paid into Sir <hi>Paul Davis,</hi> and ſo by him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by his anſwer in this Houſe, and by his counſell at the barre, but alledged the ſame was by him paid over to Sir <hi>George Wentworth</hi> by order of the Board, and a coppy of his aquittance proved. The cauſes of reverſall are,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It appeares to be a ſute begunne not by the party concerned although no defect of nonage or other appeared in him.</hi> 2. <hi>It appeares it was without bis aſſent, and contrary to his will.</hi> 3. <hi>All the colourable grounds to proceed in it, at the Councell Table; was a Petition preſented here to His Majeſty and tranſmitted in a letter.</hi> 4. <hi>The proceedings there had is upon another Petition differing in the maine points from that tranſmitted.</hi> 5. <hi>Jt is a decree of an eſtate of inheritance at the Councell Table.</hi> 6. <hi>It is a decree grounded upon a verball agreement</hi> 16. <hi>yeeres old</hi> 7. <hi>It is built upon the ſingle teſtimony of Sir</hi> William Coolie, <hi>and that in the bookes very uncertaine and various.</hi> 8. <hi>Whereas the ſupport of the honour in the heire Male was principally deſired, and ſettlement accordingly recommended by His Majeſty, this contrary to the ſaid direction and petition decreeth and hath inforced the conveiances, whereby the heire Male is diſinherited, the honour expoſed to contempt, for want of ſupport by the eſtate, and the lands come to a daughter, for whom the Deputy had before the decree made a contract for his Sonne.</hi> 9. <hi>It chargeth the father with the whole arreares for maintenance with Intereſt where the father maintained bis ſonne and family to his great charge without complaint.</hi> 10. <hi>It exacteth of the father notwithſtanding lands ſetled of</hi> 3000. <hi>pound</hi> per annum <hi>where the pretence is but of</hi> 1500. <hi>pound</hi> per annum, <hi>to be debter, and to purchaſe</hi> 55. <hi>pound</hi> per an. <hi>to ſupply the values, when his whole eſtate was taken away, and this upon a meere conceit that the father was to ſettle lands of the value pretended as they were at the time of the Marriage.</hi> 11. <hi>It reduceth the now heire Male to</hi> 200. <hi>pound</hi> per annum <hi>for life, which was not pretended to be any part of the agreement, in the Petition to His Majeſtie, and his ſonne upon whom the honour is to deſcend to have nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is humbly prayed,</p>
            <p>1. That the decree &amp; all proceedings had, and acts done in purſuance thereof may be declared void, and the ſame reverſed. 2. That reconveiances may be made by the Feoffees to the Lord <hi>Loftus</hi> and his heires, and all the evidences redelivered which are in any of their hands, or in the hands of the Clarke of the Councell. 3. The meane profits taken by vertue of the ſequeſtration, may by Sir <hi>Paul Davis,</hi> or Sir <hi>George Wentworth</hi> be repaid with damages. 4. That the 4000 li. ſtatute may be vacated. 5. And laſtly, that the Petitioner for his commitment, unjuſt removall from the place he did beare, as alſo for his coſts and damages, may according to the tranſmiſſion of the Houſe of Commons be repaired.</p>
