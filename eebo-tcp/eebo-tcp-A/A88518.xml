            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis little, pleaſant Laund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchip of Love, by its own deſtiny, and mine, belongs moſt properly to your fair eyes, and hands, and happier laps. And them, who would not lay his legge over a book; although that, ſometimes has been the complaint of a Schollar's ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? But hold! There is nothing here to that purpoſe, but what <hi>Lycaeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> taught her Schollar in the Wood: Here Cupid is a Shepherd: <hi>Pan,</hi> a Souldier: <hi>Chloe,</hi> a maid, of whom Love would write a ſtorie: a Youth, the Darling of the Nymphs: Love catcht robbing an Orchard; and his own Herald from a Myrtle Grove. Here are Pipes that drown Pirats; others reduceing a Captive maid; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorall Feſtivalls, and Games; The ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, cuſtomes, and manners of
<pb facs="tcp:115136:4"/>
the ancient Greekes; with a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full interſperſion of their old and ſweet Tales: And in ſhort; nothing to vex you, unleſſe perchance, in your own conſcience. <hi>Chloe</hi> knew well enough (though the Author makes her ſimple) what, and where, her Fancie was; and <hi>Daphnis</hi> too, needed not <hi>Lycaeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um's</hi> Lanthorn to a plakit, or to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Will with the wiſpe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But hark you Lady; and I will tell you a ſtorie; one I had at a Tavern veſper; a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue from a Summer ſhade. A boy, and a Girle were gott thither together: The boy opened his ſhop, and drew out all a yong beginner had to ſhow: The Girle askt him, what it was: The boy ſaid; It was his purſe: the Girle lookt upon her ſelfe; And, if that be thy purſe; Then (quoth ſhe) my purſe is cutt. And theſe are parallells to the ſimple ruralls here. But what ſay you to that Tradition of the <hi>Hebrewes;</hi> That a very wiſe man, knew not the way of a Serpent upon a Rock, nor of a
<pb facs="tcp:115136:4"/>
yong man with a maid? And thoſe that ſay, <hi>Nicaula Sabaea</hi> had like to have puzzled him quite, with Boyes and Girles in the ſame dreſse, but that he made them waſh before him, and found out (as you do) all the Boyes, by a ſtronger kind of rubbing. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; It is ſo like your owne either ſimplicitie, or Art, you cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it here. You do not know what we meane, when we ſpeak as plain as day. And now you have an Author too (which you never had before) to prove you do not counterfeit; The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſt in his third book; a man of great Authoritie; a Magiſtrate among the maids. For this, I have deſerved a kiſſe of every ſweet ingenious Girle; and if I find, that this book lyes nearer to you, then the other Romances do, thoſe of the affected, twirling tongue; I ſhall trie, either to find, or ideate, ſomewhat for you, that for its various invention, intertexture, and the ſtyle; ſhall be compoſed, examin'd, and ſent

            <p>THe Sophiſt ſees a picture of curious Interpretation in the Iſland <hi>Lesbos.</hi> And he deſcribes it in four Books. The Situation of <hi>Mitylene</hi> (the Scene of the Story) is drawn. <hi>Lamo</hi> a Goat-herd following a Goat that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected her Kid, finds an Infant-boy Expoſed, with fine Accoutrements about him, takes him away, keeps him, and names him <hi>Daphnis.</hi> Two years after, <hi>Dryas</hi> a Shepherd, locking for a ſheep of his, found, in the Cave of the Nymphs a Girle of the very ſame fortune; brings her up, and calls her <hi>Chloe. Dryas</hi> and <hi>Lamo,</hi> warned by dreams, ſend forth the Expoſed children together, to keep their flocks. They are joyfull, and play away their time. <hi>Daphnis</hi> running after a
<pb facs="tcp:115136:10"/>
hee-goat, falls unawares together with him into a Trapditch made for a Wolf: but is drawn up alive, and well. <hi>Dorco</hi> the Herdſman asks of <hi>Dryas, Chloe</hi> for his wife; but all in vain. Therefore diſguiſed in a Woolfs-skin, he thinks to ſeize her from a Thicket, and carry her away by force; but the flock-doggs fall upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affected. <hi>Daphnis</hi> tells the Tale of the Stock-dove. The <hi>Tyrian</hi> Pyrats plunder the fields, and carry away <hi>Daphnis. Chloe</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to do, runs up to <hi>Dorco,</hi> whom ſhe finds a dying of his wounds; he gives her a Pipe of wonderful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſhe playes on it, and the Oxen and Cowes, that were carried away, turn over the Veſsell; They and <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſwim to the Land, while the armed Pyrats drown. Then they bury poor <hi>Dorco,</hi> and return to their wonted game.</p>

            <p>WHen I was hunting in <hi>Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos,</hi> I ſaw in the Grove of the Nymps, a Spectacle, the moſt beauteous, and pleaſing of any, that ever yet I caſt my eyes upon. It was an Icon, or varied picture, reporting a Hiſtory of Love. The Grove indeed was very pleaſant, thick ſet with Trees, and ſtarr'd with flowers every where; and water'd all from one Fountain, with divers Maeanders and Rills. But that picture, as having in it, not onely an excellent, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull piece of Fortune, but alſo the Art of Ancient Love, was far
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115136:11"/>
more amiable. And therefore many forreigners enchanted by the fame of it, came as much to ſee that, as in devotion to the Nymphs. There were figured in it, young women in the poſture of teeming their babes: there were others, ſwadling children that were expoſed, children which by the deſtiny of the draught, did then tend their flocks of Sheep and Goats; there were many Shepherds ſlain; young men banded together; Incurſions of Theeves; Impreſſions of Enemies; Inroads of armed men. When I had ſeen with admiration theſe, and many other Things, but all belonging to the ſweet, or to the dangerous affairs of Love; I had a mighty Inſtigation to write ſomething, as to anſwer that Picture. And therefore, when I had carefully ſought, and found an Interpreter of the Image, I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115136:11"/>
drew up theſe four Books; <hi>A Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Oblation to Love; an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Anathêma, Sacred to Pan and the Nymphs;</hi> and <hi>A Delightful Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion, even for all men.</hi> For this will cure him that is ſick; and rouze him that is in dumps; one that has loved, it will remember of it; one that has not, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct. For there was never any yet that wholly could eſcape Love, and never ſhall there be any: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſo long as beauty ſhall be; never, ſo long as eyes can ſee.—But help me God to write with wiſdom and proportion, the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and wonderfull fortunes of others; and while I write of their Loves, keep me in my own right Wits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mitylene</hi> is a City in <hi>Lesbos,</hi> and by ancient Titles of honour, it is the Great, and Fair <hi>Mitylene.</hi> For it is diſtinguiſht, and divided (the Sea flowing in) by a various
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115136:12"/>
Euripus, and is adorn'd with many Bridges built of white and poliſht Marble. You would not think you ſaw a City, but an Iland in an Iland. From this <hi>Mitylene</hi> ſome twenty furlongs, there lay a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of a certain rich Lord, the moſt ſweet and pleaſant proſpect under all the Eyes of Heaven. There were Mountains, ſtored with wild Beaſts for Game; there were Hills, and Banks that were ſpread with Vines; the Fields abounded with all ſorts of Corn; the Valleys with Orchards, and Gardens, and purles from the Hills; the Paſtures with Sheep, and Goats, and Kine; the Sea billows daſhed to the ſhore as it lay extended along in an open horizon, with a ſoft, and glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſand. In this ſweet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the field and farm of <hi>Mitylene,</hi> a Goat-herd dwelling, by name <hi>Lamo,</hi> found an Infant-boy expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115136:12"/>
by ſuch a chance (it ſeems) as this. There was a Laun, and in it a place of thick Groves, and many brakes, all lined with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Ivie, the inner ground furred over with a finer ſort of graſſe, and on that the Infant lay. A Goat coming often hither, diſappeared very much, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill her own Kid, to attend the wretched child. <hi>Lamo</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves her frequent Outs and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſations, and pittying that the Kid ſhould be ſo forſaken, follows her even at high-noon; and anon he ſees the Goat walking careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the child, holding up, and ſetting down her feet ſoftly, leſt ſhe ſhould chance to tread upon it, or to hurt it with her hooves; and the Infant drawing milk as from the breaſt of a kind mother. And wondring at it, (as well he might) he comes nearer, and finds it a manchild, a luſty boy, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115136:13"/>
beautiifull; with pretious accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements about him, the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and admonitions of a ſecret noble Stem. His mantle, or little Cloak was purple, faſtened with a Golden button; and by his ſide, a little dagger, the handle poliſht Ivory. He thought at firſt to take away the fine Things, and take no thought about the child. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards conceiving ſhame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, if he ſhould not imitate the kindneſſe and philanthropy that he had ſeen in that Goat, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till the night came on, he brings all to <hi>Myrtale</hi> his Wife, the boy, his pretious Trinkets; and the Goat. But <hi>Myrtale</hi> all amazed at This, What (quoth ſhe) do Goats caſt boyes? Then he fell to tell her all: namely, how he had found him Expoſed; how ſuckled, how overcome by meer ſhame he could not leave the ſweet child to dye in that forſaken thicket. And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115136:13"/>
therefore when he diſcerned <hi>Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale</hi> was of his mind, the things expoſed together with him, are laid up carefully and hid; they ſay the boy's their own child, and put him to the Goat to nurſe. And that his name might be indeed a Shepherds name, they agreed to call him <hi>Daphnis.</hi> And now when two years time was paſt, a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of the neighbouring fields, had the luck to ſee ſuch ſights, and find ſuch rarities as <hi>Lamo</hi> did. There was a <hi>Nymphaeum,</hi> a ſolitary, ſacred Cave of the Nymphs; a huge rock, hollow and vaulted within, but round without. The Statues, or Images of the Nymphs, were cut out moſt curiouſly in ſtone, bare-footed, &amp; bare-legg'd; their arms naked up to the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; all their hair looſe and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careleſly, their eyes and lips ſmiting the <hi>Maediama,</hi> the proper ſweetneſſe of the Nymphs; their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115136:14"/>
veſts, and lawnie-petticoats tied, and tuckt up at the waſte. The whole preſence made a figure as of a divine ammuſing Dance, or Maſque. The mouth, and ſieling of the Cave reacht the midſt of that great rock. And from below out of the Chaſme, guſht a ſtrong Chryſtal Fountain into a fair cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or brook, and made before the holy Cave, a freſh, green, and flowery Mead. There were hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and conſecrated there, the milking-pailes of fair Maids; Shepherds pipes, ho-boyes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and reeds, the Gifts and Anathema's of the ancient Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds. To this Cave the often gadding of an Ewe, made the Shepherd often think, that ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly was loſt. Deſiring therefore to correct the ſtraggler, and reduce her to her rule; of a green With, he made a ſnare, and lookt to catch her in the Cave. But
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115136:14"/>
when he came there, he ſaw things he never dreamed of. For he ſaw her giving ſuck from her duggs in a very humane manner; and an Infant, without crying, greedily to lay, firſt to one dugge, then the t'other, a moſt neat and fair mouth: for when the Child had ſuckt enough, the careful Nurſe lickt it ſtill, and trimmed it up.</p>
            <p>That Infant was a Girle, and in ſuch manner as before, was trickt and harneſſed out with fine and rich advertiſements of her origin and Extraction: on her head ſhe wore a Mitre embroyder'd with Gold; her ſhooes were Gilded; her blankets and mantle cloth of Gold. Wherefore <hi>Dryas</hi> thinking with himſelf that this could not come about without the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Gods, and learning mercy from the Sheep, takes her up into his arms, puts her Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into his Scrip, and prayes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115136:15"/>
to the Nymphs he may happily preſerve, and bring up, their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant, and Votary. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when it was time to drive home his flocks, he comes to his Cottage, and tells all, that he had ſeen, to his Wife; ſhews her what he had found; bids her think ſhe is her daughter; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, nurſe her up, though uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, though unknown. <hi>Nape,</hi> that was her name, began preſently to be a Mother, and with a kind of Jealouſie would appear to love the Child, leſt that Ewe ſhould get more praiſe; and all in haſte gives her the paſtoral name of <hi>Chloe,</hi> to aſſure us, it's their own.</p>
            <p>Theſe Infants, grew up apace, and ſtill their beauty appeared too excellent to ſuit with ruſticks, or derive at all from Clowns. And <hi>Daphnis</hi> now is fifteen, and <hi>Chloe</hi> younger two years. Upon a night <hi>Lamo</hi> and <hi>Dryas</hi> had their viſions
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115136:15"/>
in their ſleep. They thought they ſaw thoſe Nymps, the Goddeſſes of the Cave, out of which the Fountain guſht out into a ſtream; and where <hi>Dryas</hi> found <hi>Chloe;</hi> That they delivered <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> to a certain young boy, very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull, very fair; one that had wings at his ſhoulders, wore a bowe, and little darts; and that this boy did touch them both with the very ſelf-ſame dart; and commanded it from thenceforth, one ſhould feed his flock of Goats; the other keep her flock of ſheep.</p>
            <p>This dream being dreamed by both, they could not but conceive grief, to think that <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> ſhould be nothing but Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds like themſelves, when they had read them better fortune from their Infant Swadling cloaths; and for that cauſe, had both allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them bolted bread, with a finer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115136:16"/>
ſort of meat, and bin at charge to teach them to read a ballad in the <hi>Lesbian</hi> Tongue; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other things were paſſing brave, among the rurall Swains and Girls. Yet nevertheleſſe it ſeemed fit, that the Mandats of the Gods concerning them, who by their providence were ſaved, ſhould be attended, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>And having told their dreams to one another, and ſacrificed in the Cave of the Nymphs to that winged boy (for his name they knew not yet:) They ſet them out Shepherds with their flocks; and to every thing inſtructed: how to feed before high-noon, and when the ſcorching Glare decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; when to drive their flocks to mater; when to bring them to the folds; what cattell was diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd with the Crook; what commanded by the Voice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:115136:16"/>And now this pretty pair of young Shepherds, are as jocund in themſelves as if they had got ſome great Empire, while they ſit looking over their goodly flocks; and with more then uſual kindneſſe, treated both the Sheep and Goats. For <hi>Chloe</hi> thankfully referred her preſervation to a Sheep: and <hi>Daphnis</hi> had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to acknowledge his to a Goat.</p>
            <p>It was the beginning of the Spring, and all the flowers of the Launs, Meadowes, Valleyes, and Hills, were now blowing; all was freſh, and green, and odorous. The Bee's humming from the flowers, the Bird's warbling from the groves, the Lamb's skipping on the hills, were pleaſant to the ear, and eye. And now when ſuch a fragrancy had filled thoſe bleſt and happy fields, both the old men and the young, would imitate
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115136:17"/>
the pleaſant things they heard, and ſaw: and hearing how the birds did chant it, they began to carroll too; and ſeeing how the Lambs skipt, tript their light and nimble meaſures; then to emulate the Bees, they fall to cull the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt flowers. Some of which in toyſome ſport they caſt in one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others boſoms, and of ſome plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Garlands for the Nymphs. And alwayes keeping near toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had, and did all things in common: for <hi>Daphnis</hi> often ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the ſtraggling ſheep; and <hi>Chloe</hi> often drove the boldet ventrous Goats from the crags, and precipices; and ſometimes to one of them, the care of both the flocks was left, while the other did intend ſome pretty knack, or Toyſome play.</p>
            <p>For all their ſports, were ſports of children, and of Shepherds. <hi>Chloe</hi> ſcudding up and down, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115136:17"/>
here and there picking up the windleſtrawes; would make in plats, a Trap to catch a Graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and be ſo wholly bent on that, that ſhe was careleſſe of her flocks. <hi>Daphnis</hi> on the other ſide, having cut the ſlender reeds, and bored the quils, or intervals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the joynts, and with his ſoft wax joyned and fitted one to another; took no care, but to practiſe, or deviſe ſome tune, even from morning, to the twilight. Their wine, and their milk, and whatever was brought from home to the fields, they had ſtill in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. And a man might ſooner ſee all the Cattel ſeparate from one another, then he ſhould <hi>Chloe</hi> and <hi>Daphnis,</hi> aſunder. But while they are thus playing away their time, to ſweeten pleaſure, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Love procures them theſe Cares:</p>
            <p>A Wolf that had a kenncl of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115136:18"/>
whelps, came often ravenous up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fields, and bore away ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cattel, becauſe ſhe needed much prey, to keep her ſelf, and thoſe cubs. The Villagers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meet together, and in the night they dig a ditch of a proportinall Length, and Depth, and Breadth; the earth flung up they ſcatter all abroad at a good diſtance, by handfulls; and laying over-croſſe the Chaſm, long, dry, and rotten ſticks, they ſtrow them over with that earth which did remain: that if a Hare did but offer to run there, ſhe could not chooſe but break thoſe rods, that were as brittle as the ſtubble; and then would eaſily make it known, that that indeed was not true, but onely counterfeited Soil. Many ſuch Trap-ditches were digg'd in the Mountains, and the fields; yet they could not take this Wolf, (for ſhe could perceive the Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115136:18"/>
and commentitious ground:) but many of the Sheep and Goats were there deſtroyed; and there wanted but a little, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> too was not ſlain; and it was on this chance: Two he-goats were exaſperated to fight, and the ſhock was furious. One of them, by the violence of the very firſt Butt, had one of his horns broke; upon the pain and grief of that, all in a fret and mighty chafe, he betakes himſelf to flight: but the victor purſuing him cloſe, would not let him take breath. <hi>Daphnis</hi> was vext to ſee the horn broke, and that kind of malepertneſſe of the Goat; up he catches his Club, and purſues the purſuer. But, as it frequently happens when one haſtes away as faſt as poſſibly he can, and the other with ardency purſues; there was no certain proſpect of the things before them, but into the Trapditch both
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115136:19"/>
fall, firſt the Goat, then <hi>Daphnis.</hi> And indeed it was only this that ſerved to ſave poor <hi>Daphnis,</hi> that he flunder'd down to the bottome of the ditch a cock-horſe on the rough Goat. There in a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table caſe he lay, waiting, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance it might be ſome body to draw him out. <hi>Chloe</hi> ſeeing the accident, away ſhe flyes to weep over <hi>Daphnis</hi> his grave, and found he was alive, though buried there, and calls for help to a herdſman of the adjoyning fields. When he was come, he buſled about for a long Cord: but finding none, <hi>Chloe</hi> in a tearing haſte, pulls off her hair-lace and her fillet, gives him them to let down; and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the pit brim, both began to draw and hale; and <hi>Daphnis</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt by it, nimbly followed <hi>Chloe's</hi> line, and ſo aſcended to the Top. They drew up too the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Goat, which now had both
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115136:19"/>
his horns broke, (ſo fiercely did the revenge of the victor purſue <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

And if any body miſt him at home, they would ſay, it was the Invaſion of the Wolf: and ſo returned to their Sheep and Goats. And when they had found that all were feeding orderly, according to the precepts of <hi>Lamo</hi> and <hi>Dryas;</hi> ſitting down upon the Trunk of an Oak, they began curiouſly to ſearch, whether he had hurt any limb in that terrible fall; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was hurt, nothing bloodied; onely his head, his boſome, and ſome other parts, were durtied by the ſoil which covered over, and hid the Trap. And therefore they thought it beſt before the accident was made known to <hi>Lamo</hi> and <hi>Myrtale,</hi> that he ſhould waſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Cave of the Nymphs.

            <p>But it happened, that in an Agonie that one kiſſe had caſt him into, he fell to mutter with himſelf, ſuch fancies as theſe. Whither, in the name of the Nymphs, will that kiſſe of <hi>Chloe</hi> drive me? Her lips are ſofter then Roſes, and ſweeter then the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs of the Launs, and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes; but her Kiſſe ſtings like a Bee. I have often kiſt the young Kids; I have kiſt a pretty whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, the whelp of <hi>Melampo;</hi> and that Calf which <hi>Dorco</hi> gave me: but this Kiſſe is a new thing.</p>
            <p>My heart leaps up to my lips; my ſpirit ſparckles, and my ſoul melts; and yet I am mad to kiſſe her again. Oh what a miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Victory is this! Oh what a diſeaſe, whoſe name I know not!
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115136:20"/>
Did <hi>Chloe</hi> take poyſon before ſhe kiſt me? How then is ſhe not dead? How ſweetly ſing the Nightingales, while my pipe hangs on yonder pine? How wantonly the Kids skip, and I lie ſtill upon the ground? How ſweetly do the flowers grow, and I neglect to make garlands? So it is, the Violet, Hyacinth, and the Cowſlips flouriſh; but alas, <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, Daphnis</hi> withers! And will it come at length to this, that <hi>Dorco</hi> ſhall appear hereafter, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer then I to <hi>Chloe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Paſſions and Complaints the good <hi>Daphnis</hi> felt, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured to himſelf, as now firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to taſte of the works and language of Love. But <hi>Dorco</hi> the Herdſman obſerving when <hi>Dryas</hi> planted his Scyons near the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits or ſpreading branches of the Vines, came to him with certain cheeſes, and his wooing and wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115136:21"/>
Pipes about him: the Chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he preſented him withall, as one who had long been his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and friend, when he himſelf tended Cattel. And ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his riſe from thence, he caſt in words about the marrying of <hi>Chloe,</hi> and if he might have her to his Wife, promiſed many and great Gifts, according to the Eſtate of Herdſmen; a yoake of Oxen for the plough; four bives of Bees; fifty choyſe young Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees; a good Bull-Hide to make Shooes; every year a weaned Calf: ſo that it wanted but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that, allured by theſe Gifts, <hi>Dryas</hi> did not promiſe <hi>Chloe.</hi> But when he had recollected himſelf, and found the Maid deſerved a better husband; and likewiſe, that he had reaſon to fear, leſt at any time being deprehended to have taken away the expoſed Child, he ſhould fall into a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115136:21"/>
from which he could no way then eſcape; he deſires to be excuſed, denyes the Marriage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Gifts. But <hi>Dorco</hi> falling from his hope, and loſing his Cheeſes, reſolves with himſelf to lay his clutches upon <hi>Chloe,</hi> if ever he could catch her alone. And having obſerved, that every day, ſometimes <hi>Daphnis,</hi> ſometimes the Girle, drove the flocks to water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he practiſed a Trick not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming one that tended a herd of Cattel. He took the skin of a huge Wolf, which formerly the Bull, fighting for the herd, had killed with his horns, and flung it o're his back, and it dangled down to his feet; ſo, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet were drawn on his hands; the hinder, over his thighes to his heels; and the Gaping of the mouth covered his head, like the helmet of an armed man. When he was got into this Lycanthropy,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115136:22"/>
as well as poſſibly he could; he makes to the Fountain where the flocks, after their feeding, uſed to drink. But that Fountain lay in a bottom, and about it all the place, was rough with buſhes, thorns, brakes, thiſtles, and the bruſh Juniper; ſo that indeed, a true Wolf might very well lye lurking there. Therefore when he had hid himſelf, he waited the time when the Cattel were driven thither to drink, and conceived no ſmall hope, that in the habit of a Wolf (a beaſt that ſcares our voice away;) he ſhould ſnap the poor <hi>Chloe.</hi> After a while ſhe left <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſhaking down green leaves for the Goats, and drove her flocks down to the Fountain. But the flock-dogs following <hi>Chloe,</hi> and barking at <hi>Dorco,</hi> who had moved himſelf, and ruſled in the brakes, becauſe he perceived they were hot on the Sent; fell on him
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115136:22"/>
furiouſly as on a Wolf; and before he could wholly riſe from the lurk, becauſe of the ſuddain conſternation, all-to-towſed the Wolf-<hi>Dorco,</hi> and gave him many a ſharp nip. However, fearing leſt he ſhould be manifeſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, blamed, and ſhamed, guarding himſelf as he could, with the skin, he lay cloſe and ſtill in the thicket. But when <hi>Chloe</hi> was ſcared at the firſt ſight of ſhe knew not what, and cryed out to <hi>Daphnis</hi> for help; the doggs ſoon tore his vizard off, tattered the skin, and bit him ſoundly. Then he roared and cryed out a main, and begged for help of <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe.</hi> They rated off the doggs with their uſual known recalls; and lead <hi>Dorco,</hi> who was torn in the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the Thigh to the Fountain, &amp;c. where they found the doggs had left the print of their teeth. There ſweet <hi>Chloe</hi> gently waſht,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115136:23"/>
and chawing in her mouth, the green ryne of the Elme, applyed it ſoftly to his wounds. Now, becauſe of their unskilfulneſſe in amorous adventures, they thought <hi>Dorco</hi>'s diſguiſing, and hiding of himſelf, was nothing elſe but a Paſtoral pranck, and were not at all moved at it; but endeavouring firſt, to cheer and erect him with the gentle language of pitty, and leading him by the hand ſome part of his way, they bid him fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and diſmiſt him.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> had much ado to get together, before it was late in the evening, their ſcattered, ſtraggling Sheep and Goats. For they were terrified with the wolfs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin, and the fierce barking, and baying of the dogs; and ſome ran up the ſteeps craggs; ſome ran on rucks, and hurried down to the Sea-ſhore: although they were taught, not only to obey the voice,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115136:23"/>
and be quieted by the pipe, but to be driven up together, even by the clapping of the hands. But fear had caſt in an oblivion of all: ſo that at length with much ſtirre, following their ſteps, like Hares by the foot; they drave them home to their own folds. That night alone <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> ſlept ſoundly, and found, that weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was ſome kind of remedy for the paſſion of Love. But as ſoon as the day appeared, they fell again to theſe fits. When they ſaw one another, they were paſſing joyful; and ſad, if it chanced, that they were parted; in their grief, they were voluntiers, and yet they knew not what they would have. Onely this one thing they knew, that kiſſing had deſtroyed <hi>Daphnis,</hi> and bathing had undone <hi>Chloe.</hi> Now beſides this, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year inflamed, and burnt them. For now the cooler ſpring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115136:24"/>
was ended, and the Summer was ended, and the Summer was come on, and all things were got to their higheſt flouriſhing, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible: damage" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A man would have thought that the very rivers by their gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle gliding away, did ſing; and that the ſofter gales of wind, did play, and whiſtle on the pines; that the Cattel, as languiſhing with love, lay down and ſlumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the ground; and that the Sun, as a lover of beauty, unvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, did ſtrive to undreſſe, and turn the rurals all naked. By all theſe was <hi>Daphnis</hi> inflamed; and therefore often he goes to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Brooks, there to bathe and cool himſelf, and often he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115136:24"/>
drinks of the clear purls, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by that, to quench his inward <hi>Caum,</hi> and ſcorching. When <hi>Chloe</hi> had ſpent much time, becauſe the flyes were importune, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, to milk the Sheep, and the Goats, and to curdle, and preſſe it into ſmaller Cheeſes; ſhe waſht her ſelf, and crowned her head with pine-boughes; and when ſhe had girt her Kid-skin about her, ſhe took a piggin, and with wine and milk, ſhe made a Sillibub for her dear <hi>Daphnis,</hi> and her ſelf. When it grew towards noon, they fell to their faſcination, or catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one another, by their eyes. For <hi>Chloe</hi> ſeeing <hi>Daphnis</hi> naked, thought ſhe had fallen on the moſt ſweet and florid beauty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not chooſe but melt, as being not able to find in him the leaſt moment to diſlike, or blame. <hi>Daphnis</hi> again, if he ſaw <hi>Chloe</hi> in her Kidskin, and her Pine coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115136:25"/>
give him the Sillibub to drink, thought he ſaw one of the Nymphs, the faireſt of the holy Cave. Therefore taking off her pine, he would put it on his own head; and when he had kiſt it o're and o're, ſet it upon hers again. And <hi>Chloe,</hi> when he was naked and bathing, would take up his veſt, and when ſhe kiſt it, put it on upon her ſelf. Sometimes they flung Apples at one another, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they dreſt, and diſtinguiſht one anothers hair, into curious trammels, and locks. And <hi>Chloe</hi> likened <hi>Daphnis</hi> his hair, to the Myrtle, becauſe it was black: <hi>Daphnis</hi> again, becauſe her face was white, and ruddy, compared it to the faireſt Apple. He taught her too, to play on the pipe, and alwayes when ſhe began to blow, would catch the pipe away from her lips, and run it preſently o're with his: he ſeemed to teach her
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115136:25"/>
when ſhe was out, but with that ſpecious pretext, by the pipe, he kiſt <hi>Chloe.</hi> But it hapned, when he played on his pipe at noon, and the Cattel took ſhade, that <hi>Chloe</hi> fell unawares aſleep. <hi>Daphnis</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, and laid down his Pipe; &amp; without any ſhame or fear, was bold to view her all over, and every limb, inſatiably; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſpoke ſoftly thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What ſweet Eyes are thoſe that ſleep? How ſweetly breathes that roſie mouth? The Apples ſmell not like to it, nor the flowery launes, and thickets. But I am afraid to kiſſe her. For her Kiſſe ſtings to my heart, and makes me mad, like new honey. Beſides, I fear, leſt a Kiſſe ſhould chance to wake her. O ye prating Graſhoppers, ye make a noyſe to break her ſleep! And the Goats beſide are fighting, and they clatter with their hornes. Yee Wolves, worſe daſtards then the</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:115136:26"/>
               <hi>Foxes, come and raviſh them away!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he was muttering this paſſion, a Graſhopper that fled from a Swallow, took Sanctuary in <hi>Chloes</hi> boſome, and the purſuer could not take her; but her wing, by reaſon of her cloſe purſuit, flapt the girle upon the cheek; but ſhe not knowing what was done, cryed out, and ſtarted from her ſleep. But when ſhe ſaw the Swallow flying near by, and <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> laughing at her fear, ſhe began to give it over, and rub her eyes that yet were ſleeping. The Graſhopper ſang out of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, as if her ſuppliant were now giving thanks for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Therefore <hi>Chloe</hi> again ſqueakt out; but <hi>Daphnis</hi> could not hold laughing, nor paſſe the opportunity, to put his hand into her boſome, and draw forth the Graſhopper, which ſtill did ſing even in his hand. When <hi>Chloe</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:115136:26"/>
ſaw it, ſhe was pleaſed, and put it in her boſome again, and it prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the way. But beſides theſe, the Stockdove did delight them too; and ſang from the Woods, her bucolic's. But <hi>Chloe</hi> deſiring to know, askt <hi>Daphnis</hi> what that complaint of the Stock-dove meant; and he told her the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ancient Shepherds. The Stock-dove (<hi>Chloe</hi>) was once a very fair Maid, as thou thy ſelf now art; and in the flower of her age, kept her herds, as thou doſt thine. She was skilfull in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and her herds were ſo taken with her voice and pipe, that they needed not the diſcipline of the ſtaffe, or goad: but ſitting under a pine, and wearing a coronet of the ſame, ſhe would ſing of <hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Pitys,</hi> and her cowes, would never wander out of her voyce. There was a Youth that kept his herd not far off; and he was fair, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115136:27"/>
muſical, and not inferiour to the maid: but, as he tryed with all his skill, to emulate her notes and tones; he played a higher ſtrain, as a male, and yet ſweet, as being a boy; and ſo allured, from the maids Herd, eight of her beſt Cowes, to his own. She took it ill that her herd was ſo diminiſht, and in very deep diſdain, that ſhe was his inferiour at the art; and preſently prayed to the gods, that ſhe might be transformed to a Bird, before ſhe did return home. The gods conſent, and turn her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mountain-bird, becauſe the Maid did haunt there; and muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, as ſhe had been: And ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill, to this day, ſhe publiſhes her heavy chance, and demands her Cowes again. Such delights and pleaſures as theſe, the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time entertained them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. But when Autumne was come in, and the grapes were ripe, the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Pyrats, in a <hi>Carian</hi> Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115136:27"/>
leſt perchance they ſhould ſeem to be <hi>Barbarians,</hi> ſailed up to the fields; and coming aſhore, armed with ſwords, and half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corſlets, fell to rifle, plunder, and carry away the beſt of all that came to hand; the fragrant wines, great ſtore of grain, the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of the honey-combs. Some Oxen too they drove away from <hi>Dorco</hi>'s herd, and took <hi>Daphnis</hi> as he wandred near the Sea. For <hi>Chloe,</hi> as a Maid, was fearfull of the fierce and ſurly Shepherds; and therefore, till it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what later, drove not out the flocks of <hi>Dryas.</hi> And when they ſaw the young man was proper and handſome, and of a higher price then any of their other prey, they thought it not worth their ſtaying longer about the Goats, or other fields, &amp; hall'd him aboard, lamenting, and not knowing what to do, and calling loud &amp; often, on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115136:28"/>
the name of <hi>Chloe.</hi> But they, when they had looſed from the ſhore, and caſt in their Oars; when <hi>Chloe</hi> had brought out her ſheep, and with her, a new pipe, that was ſent to <hi>Daphnis,</hi> made in haſte away to Sea. When <hi>Chloe</hi> ſaw the Goats in a hurry, and heard <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> louder and louder call <hi>Chloe,</hi> ſhe preſently caſts off all care of her flocks, flings the pipe on the ground, and runs amain for help to <hi>Dorco.</hi> But he being cruelly wounded by the theeves, and breathing yet a little, his blood guſhing out, was laid along upon the ground. Yet ſeeing <hi>Chloe,</hi> and a little ſpark of his former love being awakened in him; <hi>Chloe,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I ſhall now preſently dye: for, alas, thoſe curſed Theeves, as I fought for my Herd, have kill'd me, like an Oxe. But do thou preſerve our</hi> Daphnis, <hi>and in their ſudden deſtruction, take vengeance for me, on</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:115136:28"/>
               <hi>the Rogues. I have accuſtomed my Herd to follow the ſound of this Pipe, and to obey the charm of it, although they feed a good way off me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Come hither then, and take the pipe, and blow that tune, which I heretofore taught</hi> Daphnis, <hi>and</hi> Daphnis <hi>thee, and call'd it</hi> Dorco. <hi>Leave the care of what ſhall follow, to the pipe, and Cowes alone. And to thee,</hi> Chloe, <hi>I give this Pipe; this pipe, by which I have often conquered many Herdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, many Goatherds. But, for this, come, and kiſſe me, (ſweet</hi> Chloe) <hi>while I am yet awhile alive; and when I am dead, weep a tear or two o're me; and if thou ſeeſt ſome other tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Herd, upon theſe Hills, I pray thee, then remember</hi> Dorco.</p>
            <p>Thus ſpake <hi>Dorco,</hi> and received his laſt Kiſſe; and together with the kiſſe, and his voyce, breathed out his Soul. But <hi>Chloe</hi> taking the pipe, and putting it to her lips, began to play and whiſtle, as loud
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115136:29"/>
as poſſibly ſhe could: The Cowes aboard the Pyrats preſently hear, and acknowledge the muſick; and with one bounce, and a huge bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, ſhoot themſelves impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly into the Sea. By that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent bounding on one of her ſides, the Pinnace toppled, and the Sea gaping from the bottom, by the fall of the Cowes in, the Surges on a ſuddain return, and ſink her down, and all that were in her, but with unequal hope of eſcape. For the Theeves had their Swords on, with their ſcaled, and nailed Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlets, and were booted up to the middle of their thighes. But <hi>Daphnis</hi> was barefoot, as he was wont to go in the fields, it being yet the heat of Summer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they when they had ſwom a little while, were carried by their arms to the bottom. <hi>Daphnis</hi> on the other ſide, eaſily got off his clothes; and yet was much puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115136:29"/>
to ſwim, becauſe he had been uſed before onely to the brooks and Rivers. But at length, being taught by Neceſſity what was beſt for him to do, he ruſhes into the midſt of the Cowes, and on his right, and left, laid hold on two of their horns; and ſo without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or pain, was carried between them to the Land, as if he had driven a falcked Chariot. Now an Ox, or Cowe ſwims ſo well, that no man can do the like; and they are exceeded only by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-fowl, and Fiſh: nor do they ever drown, and periſh, unleſſe the nails upon their hooves, be thorough drencht with wet, and fall. Witneſſe to this, Thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places of the Sea, to this day called the <hi>Boſphori;</hi> The Trajects, or the narrow Seas, ſwom over by Oxen. And thus poor <hi>Daphnis</hi> was preſerved, eſcaping beyond hope, two dangers at once, ſhipwrack,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115136:30"/>
and latrociny. When he was out, he found <hi>Chloe</hi> laughing, and crying; and, caſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into her arms, askt her what ſhe meant, when ſhe piped and whiſtled ſo loud. Then ſhe told him all that had happened; how ſhe ſcutled up to <hi>Dorco;</hi> how, the Cowes had been accuſtomed; how ſhe was bidden to play on the pipe; and that their friend <hi>Dorco</hi> was dead; onely for ſhame ſhe told him not of that Kiſſe. They thought then it was their duty to honour their great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, who ſo highly had obliged them; and therefore they lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and buried the unfortunate <hi>Dorco,</hi> with all the Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the ancient Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds. By the name <hi>Dorco,</hi> thrice they call'd upon his Ghoſt; then laid good ſtore of Earth upon the Coarſe. On his Grave they ſet abundance of the moſt fragant,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115136:30"/>
laſting, ſative plants, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and vowed an Anniverſary ſuſpenſion to him of ſome of the firſt fruits of the year. Beſides, they poured on the ground a liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of milk, and preſſed with their hands, the faireſt bunches of the grapes, and then with eyes caſt on the ground, broke many Shepherds pipes o're him. There were heard miſerable groans, and bellowings of the Cowes, and Oxen; and together with them, certain incompoſed curſations, and freques, were ſeen. The Cattel of the Herd amongſt themſelves, as well as the Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and the Shepherds, had a kind of lamentation, for the death, and loſſe of their keeper. When the Funeral of <hi>Dorco</hi> was done, <hi>Chloe</hi> brought <hi>Daphnis</hi> to the Cave of the Nymphs, and waſhed him ſtark naked with her own hands; and ſhe her ſelf, <hi>Daphnis</hi> then firſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115136:31"/>
of all, looking and gazing on her, waſhed her naked limbs before him; her limbs, which for their perfect and moſt excellent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, needed neither waſh nor dreſſe: and when they had done, they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered flowers, to crown the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Nymphs, and hang'd up <hi>Dorco</hi>'s charming pipe, for an Anathema in the phane. Then coming away, they looked what became of their Sheep and Goats; and found, that they neither fed, nor blated, but were all laid upon the ground, as wanting <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe,</hi> that had been ſo long out of their ſight. When they ſaw this, and had call'd, and whiſtled, as they were wont; they roſe up preſently, and fell to feed; and the mantling Goats skipt and leapt, as rejoycing at the ſafety of their familiar Goat-herd. But <hi>Daphnis</hi> for his life could not be merry, becauſe he had ſeen <hi>Chloe</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:115136:31"/>
naked, and that <hi>Venus</hi> of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which before was not unvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. His heart was gnawed, as with a ſecret poyſon, and had deep ſentiments of grief and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh: inſomuch, that ſometimes he puffed and blowed thick and ſhort, as if ſome body had been in a cloſe purſuit of him: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again, he breathed ſo faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if he had been quite ſpent in running. That waſhing ſeemed to him more dangerous and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, then the Sea: And he thought his life was ſtill in the hands, and at the diſpoſe of the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Pyrats, as being but a young Ruſtick, and yet unskill'd in the Aſſaſſinations, and Robberies of Love.</p>

            <p>THe Autumn now being grown to its height, and the Vintage at hand; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ruralr began to ſtirre, and be buſie in the fields; ſome to repair the Winepreſſes; ſome to ſcowr the tuns, and hogs-heads: others were making baskets, skeps, and panniers; and others provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding little hooks to catch and out the bunches of the grapes. Here one was looking buſily about to find a ſtone that would ſerve him to bruiſe the ſtones of grapes:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115136:34"/>
there another, furniſhing himſelf with a ſtang, of very dry and ſmooth wood, to carry away the muſt in the night, with light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Wherefore <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> for this time laid aſide the care of the flocks, and put their helping hands to the work. <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> in his basket carried grapes, caſt them into the preſſe, and trod them there; and then anon, out of the Lake, tunn'd the Wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Butts. <hi>Chloe</hi> dreſt meat for the Vintagers, and ſerved them with drink, the old wine daſht with Fountain-water; and when ſhe had done, gathered grapes of the lower vines. For all the vines about <hi>Lesbos</hi> incline themſelves, and protend their palmits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ground, and creep like the Ivie; ſo that indeed a very Infant, if that his hands be looſe from his Swathes, may eaſily reach and pull a bunch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:115136:34"/>Now, as they were wont in the Feaſt of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of the <hi>Genethliacs</hi> of wine; the women that came from the neighbouring fields to help, caſt their eyes all upon <hi>Daphnis,</hi> gave him prick and praiſe for beauty, and ſaid, he was like to <hi>Bacchus</hi> himſelf. And now and then, one of the bolder ſtrapping girles would catch him in her arms, and kiſſe him.</p>
            <p>Thoſe wanton praiſes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, did animate the modeſt Youth, and more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame him ſtill, but vext and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the poor <hi>Chloe.</hi> But thoſe that were treading in the Preſſe, caſt out various voyces, words, and verdicts upon <hi>Chloe,</hi> and ſang the praiſe of the young <hi>Baccha,</hi> like ſo many Satyrs drunk with love and wine; and wiſht that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were ſheep, that ſuch a Shepherdeſſe might tend them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:115136:35"/>
And thus the Girle was pleaſed too, and <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſtung with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie. But they wiſht the Vintage were done, that they might return to their haunts in the fields; that, inſtead of that wild, untuned noyſe of the clowns, they might hear again the ſweet Pipe, or the bleating of the Cattel. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe after a few dayes, the grapes were gather'd, and the wines tunn'd into the veſſels, and there needed not many hands to help; they drove again their flocks to the fields, and with great joy and exultation worſhipt and adored the Nymphs, offering to them the firſt fruits, cluſters hanging on their branches. Nor did they in former time, with negligence ever paſſe by the Nymphs; but alwaies when they came forth to feed, would ſit down by them reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in the Cave; and when they went home, would firſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115136:35"/>
adore, and beg their Grace; and brought to them alwayes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, either a flower, or an apple, or an a pornfull of green leaves, or a ſacrifice of milk. And for this great piety and devotion, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards received no ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and favours from the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes. And now being got at liberty, they skip, and dance, and ſing, and pipe to their flocks. While they thus delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there comes up to them an old man, clad in his rugg, and mantle of skins, his carbatins, or clouted ſhooes; his ſcrip hanging at his back, and that indeed a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old one: when he was ſate down by them, thus he ſpoke, and told his ſtory:</p>
            <p>I (<hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi>) am that old <hi>Philetas,</hi> who have often ſung to theſe Nymphs; and often pip't to yonder <hi>Pan;</hi> and have led ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great herds, by the art of muſick
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115136:36"/>
alone; and I come to ſhew you what I have ſeen, and to tell you what I have heard. I have a Garden which my own hands and labour planted; and ever ſince by my old age I gave over fields and herds, to dreſſe and trim it, has been my care and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; what flowers, or fruits the ſeaſon of the year teems, there they they are at every ſeaſon. In the ſpring there are Roſes, and Lillies, the Hyacinths, and both the forms of Violets. In the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Poppies, Pears, and all ſorts of Apples. And now in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne Vines, and Figtrees, Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats, Orenges, Limons, and the green myrtles. Into this Garden, flocks of birds come every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſome to feed, ſome to ſing. For it is thick, opacous, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and watered all by three fountains; and if you took the wall away, you would think you
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115136:36"/>
ſaw a Wood. As I went in there yeſterday about noon, a boy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the Pomgranate and Myrtle grove, with myrtles and Pomgranats in his hand; white as milk, and ſhining with the glance of fire; clean and bright, as if he had newly waſht himſelf in all the three tranſparent Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Naked he was, alone he was; he play'd and wanton'd it about, and cull'd and pull'd, as if it had been his own Garden. Therefore I ran at him as faſt as I could, thinking to get him in my clutches. For indeed, I was afraid, leſt, by that wanton, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward, malepert ramping, and hoytie-toitie which he kept in the grove; he would at length break my Pomgranats, and my Myrtles. But he, with a ſoft and eaſie ſleight, as he liſted, gave me the ſlip, ſometimes running un<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er the Roſes, ſometimes hiding himſelf
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115136:37"/>
in the Poppies, like a cunning, hudling chick of a Partridge. I have often had enough to do, to run after the ſucking Kids; and tyred my ſelf off my leggs, to catch a giddy young Calf. But this was a certain various buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a thing that could not be catcht. Being then wearied, as an old man, and leaning upon my ſtaffe; and withall looking to him, leſt he ſhould eſcape away, I askt what neighbours Child he was; and what he meant to rob anothers mans Orchard ſo. But he anſwer'd me not a word; but coming nearer, laught moſt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and flung the Myrtle berries at me, and pleas'd me ſo, I know not how, that all my anger vaniſht quite. I askt him therefore, that he would give himſelf without fear, into my hands, and ſwore to him by the myrtles, that I would not onely ſend him away
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115136:37"/>
with Apples and Pomegranats, but give him leave, whenſoever he pleas'd, to pull the fineſt fruits and flowers, if he would but give me one kiſſe. With that, ſetting up a loud laughter, he ſent forth a voice, ſuch as neither the Swan, the Swallow, or the Nightingale has, and turn'd himſelf into Old man like to me. <hi>Philetas,</hi> (ſaid he) it would be no trouble at all to me, to give thee a kiſſe, for it is more pleaſure for me to kiſſe, then for thee to be young again: but conſider with thy ſelf, whether ſuch a gift as that be of uſe to thy age. For thy old age cannot help thee that thou ſhalt not follow me, after a kiſſe that I have fired. But I cannot be taken, though a Hawk, or an Eagle, or any other ſwifter bird, were flown at me. I am not a boy, though I ſeem to be ſo, but am older then <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the whole time of this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115136:38"/>
Univerſe. I knew thee, when thou waſt yet a boy, and kept a great herd in yonder Marſh, and was preſent to thee, when under thoſe Beeches, thou didſt ſing, and play on the Pipe for the dear love of <hi>Amaryllis.</hi> But thou didſt not ſee me, although I ſtood cloſe by the Maid. It was I that gave her thee in marriage, and thou haſt had Sons by her, jolly herdſmen, and Colones. And now I take care of <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe;</hi> and when I have brought them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the morning, I come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to thy Garden, and take my pleaſure among theſe groves and flowers of thine; and waſh my ſelf in theſe Fountains. And this is the cauſe, why thy Roſes, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Lillies, Hyacinths and Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies; all thy flowers, and thy Plants, are ſtill ſo fair and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe they are water'd with my waſh. Caſt thy eyes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115136:38"/>
round about, and look whether there be any one ſtem of a flower, any twig of a Tree broken; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of thy fruits be pull'd, or any flower trodden down; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any fountain be troubled, and mudded; and thou (<hi>Philetas</hi>) of all mortals, rejoyce alone in thy old age. This ſaid, the ſweet boy ſprung into the myrtle grove, and like a Nightingale, from bough to bough, under the green leaves, skipt to the top, and higheſt ſtory of the Myrtles. Then I ſaw his wings hanging at his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and at his back, between his wings, a little bow with two Darts; and ſince that moment, never ſaw him any more. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wear not now theſe gray hairs of mine in vain, and by my age, have not got a trivial mind; you two, (O <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi>) are deſtin'd to Love; and Love himſelf takes care of you. With
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115136:39"/>
this they were both hugely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and thought they heard a <hi>Lesbian</hi> tale, not a true diſcourſe, or ſtory, and therefore they would ask him queſtions:</p>
            <p>And, <hi>What is Love</hi> (quoth <hi>Chloe</hi> then)? <hi>Is he a boy, or is he a bird? And, what can he do, I pray you, Gaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore again—thus <hi>Philetas:</hi> Love (ſweet <hi>Chloe</hi>) is a god, a young Youth, and very fair, and wing'd to flye. And therefore he delights in youth, followes beauty, and gives our phantaſie her wings. His power's ſo vaſte, that that of <hi>Jove</hi> is not ſo great. He governs in the Elements, rules in the Stars, and domineers even o're the gods, that are his Peers. Nor have you only dominion o're your Sheep and Goats, for Love has there his range too. All flowers are the works of Love. Thoſe Plants are his creations, and Poems. By him
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115136:39"/>
it is that the rivers flow, and by him the winds blow. I have known a Bull that has been in Love, and run bellowing through the Meadows, as if he had been prickt with a Goad; a he-goat too ſo in Love with a Virgin-ſhe, that he has followed her up and down, through the woods, through the Launs. And I my ſelf, when I was young, was in love with <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> and forgot to eat my meat, and drink my drink; and for many tedious nights, never could compoſe to ſleep: my pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart was very ſad and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and my body ſhook with cold: I cryed out oft, as if I had bin thwackt and baſted back and ſides: and then again, was ſtill and mute, as if I had layen among the dead: I caſt my ſelf into the Rivers, as if I had been all on a fire: I call'd on <hi>Pan,</hi> that he would help me, as having ſometimes bin
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115136:40"/>
himſelf, catcht with the Love of peeviſh <hi>Pitys:</hi> I prais'd the Echo, that with kindneſſe it reſtored, and trebbled to me, the dear name of <hi>Amaryllis:</hi> I broke my Pipes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could delight, and lead the ſturdy herds which way I would, and could not draw the froward girle. For there is no med'cine for Love, neither meat, nor drink, nor any Charm, but onely Kiſſing, and Embracing, and lying naked together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philetas</hi> when he had thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the unskilful Lovers, and was preſented with certain Chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and a young Goat of the firſt horns; bleſt their love, and went his way.</p>
            <p>But when they were alone, and had then firſt heard of the name of Love, their minds were ſtruck with a kind of Woodneſſe; and they began to compare thoſe things which they had ſuffer'd in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115136:40"/>
themſelves, with the doctrine of <hi>Philetas</hi> concerning Lovers and Love:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lover has his Grief and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and we have had our ſhare of that. They are languiſhing and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to other things: juſt ſo are wee. They cannot ſleep, and we ſtill watch for the early day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They think they are burnt; and ſo do we, even in the Fountains and the Brooks. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing more, then to ſee, then to be near one another: And for that cauſe, we call, and rouze the heavy day. This undoubtedly is Love, and we are in Love, and do not know it.</hi> Philetas <hi>did not lye a tittle. That Boy in the Garden was ſeen too, by our Fathers,</hi> Lamo, <hi>and</hi> Dryas; <hi>and 'twas he that commanded us to the field. How is it poſsible for one to catch him? he's ſmall and ſlim, and ſo will ſlip and ſteal away. And how ſhould one eſcape, and get away from</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:115136:41"/>
               <hi>him by flight? he has wings to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take us. Shall we flye to the Nymphs, our Patroneſses? But</hi> Pan, <hi>alas, did not help his Servant</hi> Philetas, <hi>when he was mad on</hi> Amaryllis. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe remedies, which he taught us, are before all things, to be tryed; Kiſsing, Embracing, and Lying na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on the ground. It's cold indeed; but after</hi> Philetas <hi>wee'l endure it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, to them, was a kind of nocturnal play, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When it was day, and their flocks were driven to the field, they ran to kiſſe, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace one another with a bold, impatient fury, which before they never did. Yet of that third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, which the old <hi>Philetas</hi> taught, they durſt not make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment: for that was not onely an enterpriſe too bold for Maids, but too high for young Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds. Therefore ſtill, as before
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115136:41"/>
they ſpent their nights without ſleep, and with remembrance of what was done, and with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, of what was not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have kiſt one another, and are never the better; we have clipt and embrac't, and that's as good as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too. Therefore to lye together naked, is the onely remaining reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Love. That muſt be tryed by all means; ther's ſomething in it without doubt, more efficacious then in a kiſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While they indulg'd theſe kind of thoughts, they had, as it was like, their ſweet, erotic, amorous dreams; and what they did not in the day, that they acted in the night, and lay together ſtark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, kiſſing, clipping, twining limbs. But the next day, as if they had bin inſpired with ſome ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Numen,</hi> they roſe up, and drive their flocks with a kind of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115136:42"/>
to the fields, haſting to their kiſſes again; and when they ſaw one another, ſmiling ſweetly ran together. Kiſſes paſt, Embraces paſt, but that third Remedy was wanting; for <hi>Daphnis</hi> durſt not mention it, and <hi>Chloe</hi> too would not begin; till at length, even by chance, they made this eſſay of it: They ſate both cloſe together upon the trunck of an old Oak, and having taſted the ſweetneſſe of kiſſes, they were ingulf'd inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiably in pleaſure, and there aroſe a mutual contention, and ſtriving with their claſping arms, which made a cloſe compreſſion of their lips; and when <hi>Daphnis</hi> hugg'd her to him with a more violent deſire, it came about that <hi>Chloe</hi> inclin'd a little on her ſide, and <hi>Daphnis</hi> following his kiſſe, fell o'th top on her. And remembring that they had an image of this in their dreams the night before,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115136:42"/>
they lay a long while clinging to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But being ignorant what after that was to be done, and thinking that this was the end of amorous fruition, moſt part of the day ſpent in vain, they parted, and drove their flocks home from the fields, with a kind of hate to the oppreſſion of the night. And perchance ſomething that was right and true had then bin done, but that this tumult and noyſe fill'd all that rurall tract. The young gallants of <hi>Methymne</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep the Vintage holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, and chooſing to take the pleaſure abroad, drew a ſmall Veſſell into the water, and putting in their own domeſtick Servants to rowe, ſail'd about thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Farms of <hi>Mytelene.</hi> For the maritim Coaſt has many Havens, many good and ſafe Harbours, and all along is adorn'd with many ſtately buildings, and ſtairs. There
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115136:43"/>
are beſides, many Baths, Gardens and Groves; theſe by Art, thoſe by Nature; all brave for habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Ship therefore being arrived and brought into the Bay, they did no harm or injury to any, but recreated themſelves with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers pleaſures: ſometimes with Angles, taking fiſh from this or the t'other prominent rock: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with dogs or toyles hunting the Hares that fled from the noiſe of the Vineyards: then anon, they would go a fowling, and take the Wildgooſe, Duck and Mallard, and the ſlower birds of the Marſh; and ſo by their pleaſure furniſht themſelves with a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous table. If they needed any thing elſe, they paid the Villagers above the price. But there was nothing elſe wanting, but onely bread, and wine, and houſe-room. For they thought it unſafe, the Autumn now in its declination, to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115136:43"/>
quit the Land, and lye all night aboard at Sea. And therefore drew the Veſſel aſhore for fear of a tempeſtuous night. Now it hapned, that a Country-fellow wanting a rope, his own being broke, to haul up the ſtone where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was grinding grapeſtones for his uſe in the Winter, ſneakt down to the Sea, and finding the Ship with no body in her, loos'd the cable that held her, and brought it away to ſerve his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe. In the morning the young men of <hi>Methymne</hi> began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the rope, and no body owning the theevery; when they had a little blam'd the unkindneſſe and injury of their hoſts, they looſ'd from thence, and ſailing on ſome leagues, arrived at the fields of <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe,</hi> thoſe fields ſeeming the likelieſt for hunting the Hare. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of a rope to uſe for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115136:44"/>
their Cable, they made a Withe of green and long Sallow twiggs, and with that tyed her by her ſtern to the ſhore. Then ſlipping their doggs to hunt thoſe grounds that ſeem'd fitteſt for game, they caſt their toils. The deep-mouth'd dogs open'd loud, and running about, with much barking, ſcar'd the Goats, that all hurried down from the Mountains towards the Sea; and finding nothing there to eat, ſome of the bolder miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Goats gnaw'd the green Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With in pieces. At the ſame moment there began to be a blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at Sea, the wind blowing from the Mountains. On a ſudden therefore the reciprocation of the waves ſet the looſe Pinnace afloat, and carried her off to the main. As ſoon as the <hi>Methymneans</hi> heard the news, ſome of them poſted to the Sea, ſome ſtayed to take up the doggs, all made a hubbub
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115136:44"/>
through the fields, and brought the neighbouring rurals in. But all was to no purpoſe; all was loſt, all was gone. For the ſhip with an irrevocable pernicity and ſwiftneſſe was carried away. Therefore the <hi>Methymnaeans</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great loſſe by this, lookt for the Goat-herd; and lighting on <hi>Daphnis,</hi> fell to cuffe him, tore off his cloathes, and offer'd to bind his hands behind him with a dog-ſlip. But <hi>Daphnis,</hi> when he was miſerably beaten, implor'd the help of the Countrey Lads, and chiefly of all, cryed out for reſcue to <hi>Lamo</hi> and <hi>Dryas.</hi> They preſently came in and oppoſed themſelves, brawny old fellowes, and ſuch as by their Countrey la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour had hands of ſteel; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of the furious Youths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe things that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, a fair legal debate and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And others deſiring the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115136:45"/>
ſame thing, they made <hi>Philetas</hi> the herdſman Judge. For he was oldeſt of all that were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and famous for Juſtice amongſt the Villagers. The <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymnaeans</hi> therefore began firſt, and laid their accuſation againſt <hi>Daphnis,</hi> in very ſhort and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous words, as before a herdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We came into theſe fields to hunt. Wherefore, with a green Sallow With, we left our Ship tyed to the ſhore: While our dogs were hunting the grounds, his Goats ſtrayed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the Mountains down to the Sea, gnaw'd the green Cable in pieces, ſet her at liberty, and let her flye. You ſee her toſsing in the Sea: but with what choice, and rich goods laden? all are loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before your face. What rare harneſſe, and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for dogs are there? what a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of precious ſilver? he that had all, might eaſily purchaſe theſe fields.</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:115136:45"/>
               <hi>For this dammage, we think it but right and reaſon to carry him away our captive, him that is ſuch a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Goat herd to feed his Goats upon the Sea, as if he were ſome Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner.</hi> This was the Accuſation of the <hi>Methymnaeans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> on the other ſide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his bones were ſore with baſting, yet ſeeing his dear <hi>Chloe</hi> there, ſet it at naught; and ſpoke thus in his own defence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I, in keeping my Goats have done my office well. For never ſo much as one of all the neighbours of the Vale, has blamed me yet, that any Kid, or Goat of mine has broke into, &amp; eaten up his Garden, or browzed a young, or ſprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vine. But thoſe are wicked, curſed hunters, and have dogs that have no manners, ſuch as with their furious courſing, and moſt vehement barking, have like Wolves ſcared my Goats, and</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:115136:46"/>
               <hi>toſsed them down from the Mountains through the Valleys, to the Sea. But they have eaten a Green With. For they could find nothing elſe upon the Sand, neither arbute, wilding, ſhrub, nor Thyme. But the Ship's loſt by wind and wave. That's not my Goats, but the fault of Seas, and Tempeſts. But there were rich Clothes, Collars, Dogſlips, and Silver aboard her. And who that has any wit can believe, that a Ship that is ſo richly laden, ſhould have nothing for her Cable but a With?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With that <hi>Daphnis</hi> began to weep, and made the Ruſticks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate him, and his Cauſe: ſo that <hi>Philetas</hi> the Judge ſtarted up, calling <hi>Pan</hi> and the Nymphs to witneſſe, That neither <hi>Daphnis,</hi> nor his Goats, had done any wrong; but that it was the wind, and Sea, and that of thoſe there were other Judges. Yet by this Sentence <hi>Philetas</hi> could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115136:46"/>
and bind the <hi>Methymnaeans,</hi> but again in a fury, they fell to <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owſe <hi>Daphnis,</hi> and offered to bind him. With which the Villagers being moved, fell upon them like flocks of Starlings, or Jackdawes; and carried him away as he was buſling amongſt them, never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing till with their Clubs they had driven them the Ground, and beaten them from the hills into the other fields.</p>
            <p>While thus they purſued the <hi>Methymnaeans, Chloe</hi> had time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbance to bring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> to the Fountain of the Nymphs, and there to waſh his bloody face, and entertain him after he had ſcaped the danger, with bread and cheeſe out of her own Scrip; kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him then far more ſweetly then before; for it wanted but a little, that then her dear <hi>Daphnis</hi> had bin ſlain.</p>
            <p>But theſe Commotions could
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115136:47"/>
not thus be laid, and at an end; for thoſe Gallants of <hi>Methymne</hi> having bin ſoftly and delicately bred, and every man his wounds about him, travelling now by Land, with miſerable labour and pain, got into their own Country, and procuring a Councill to be called, humbly petition'd that their Cauſe might be revenged, without reporting a word of thoſe things which indeed had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, leſt perchance they ſhould be laughed at for what they had ſuffered by the Clowns: but accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Mitylenaeans</hi> as if they had taken their Ship and Goods in an hoſtile and warlike manner. The Citizens eaſily believed their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe they ſaw they were all wounded; and knowing them to be of the beſt of their Families, thought it juſt to revenge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. And therefore without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a War by any Herald,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115136:47"/>
they commanded <hi>Bryaxes</hi> their General with ten Sail to infeſt the Maritim Coaſt of <hi>Mitylene.</hi> For the Winter now approaching, they thought it dangerous to truſt a greater Squadron at Sea. On a ſuddain the next day the General ſets ſail; and putting to the main, comes up to the maritims of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylene,</hi> and hoſtilely invades them, plundering, and raping away, their Flocks, their Corn, their Wines, (the Vintage now but lately over) with many of thoſe that were employed in ſuch buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>They ſail'd up too to the fields of <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe,</hi> and coming ſuddenly down upon them, preyed upon all that they could light on. It happened, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> was not then with his Goats, but was gone to the Wood, and there was bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up green leaves to give them for fodder in the winter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115136:48"/>
this incurſation being ſeen from the higher ground, he hid himſelf in an old hollow tree. But his <hi>Chloe</hi> was with her flocks, and the enemies invading her and them, ſhe fled away to the Cave of the Nymphs, and begged of the enemies, that they would ſpare her, and her flocks, for thoſe holy Goddeſſes ſakes. But that did not help her at all. For the <hi>Methym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeans</hi> did not onely mock at, and rail upon, the Statues of the Nymphs, but drove away her flocks and her before them, thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping her along with their Battons as if ſhe had bin a ſhe-goat. But now their ſhips being laden with all manner of prey, they thought it not convenient to ſail any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but rather to make home, for fear of the winter, no leſſe then of their enemies. Therefore they ſail'd back again, and were hard put to it to row, becauſe there
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115136:48"/>
wanted wind to drive them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Tumults and Hubbubs ceaſing, <hi>Daphnis</hi> came out of the Wood, into the field they uſed to feed in; and when he could find neither the Goats, the Sheep, nor <hi>Chloe,</hi> but onely a deep ſilence and Solitude, and the Pipe flung away wherewith ſhe entertain'd her ſelf; ſetting up a piteous Cry, and lamenting miſerably, ſometimes he ran to the Beech where <hi>Chloe</hi> ſate, ſometimes to the Sea, to try if there he could ſet his eyes on her: then to the Nymphs, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe fled when ſhe was taken; and there flinging himſelf upon the ground, began to accuſe even the Nymphs as her betrayers:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was from your Statues that</hi> Chloe <hi>was drawn and raviſht away! and how could you endure to ſee it? ſhe that made the Garlands for you; ſhe that every morning poured out before</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:115136:49"/>
               <hi>you, and ſacrificed her firſt milk; and ſhe whoſe pipe hangs up there a ſweet Anathema and Donarie. The Wolf indeed has taken from me never a Goat, but the enemy has my whole flock, together with my ſweet Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the field; and they are buſie killing and flaying the Sheep and Goats, and</hi> Chloe <hi>now muſt live in the City. With what face can I now come into the ſight of my Father and my Mother, who have loſt my Goats, have loſt</hi> Chloe, <hi>and am quite broke, and muſt now give over my trade. For now I have nothing left to feed, and</hi> Daphnis <hi>is no more a Goat-herd. Here I'le fling my ſelf on the ground, and here I'le lye expecting my death, or elſe a ſecond war to help me. And doſt thou (ſweet</hi> Chloe) <hi>ſuffer now in thy ſelf ſuch heavy things as theſe? Doſt thou remember, and think of this field, thy own Beech, the Nymphs, and me? Takeſt thou any pleaſure from thy ſheep, and thoſe Goats of mine,</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:115136:49"/>
               <hi>which are carried away with thee into Captivity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he was thus lamenting his condition, by his weeping ſo much, and the heavineſſe of his grief, he fell into a deep ſleep, and thoſe three Nymphs appeared to him, Ladies of a tall ſtature, very fair, half naked, and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed, their hair diſhevel'd, and in all things like their Statues. At firſt they appeared very much to pity his Cauſe; and then the eldeſt, to erect him, ſpoke thus:</p>
            <p>Blame not us at all (<hi>Daphnis</hi>) we have greater care of <hi>Chloe</hi> then thou thy ſelf her Lover haſt. We took pity on her, when ſhe was yet but an Infant; and when ſhe lay in this Cave, took her our ſelves, and ſaw her nurſt. She does not at all belong to the fields, nor to <hi>Lamo,</hi> nor his flocks. And even now we have provided, as to her,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115136:50"/>
that ſhe ſhall not be carried a Slave to <hi>Methymna,</hi> nor be any part of the enemies prey. We have begged of <hi>Pan, Pan</hi> that ſtands under yonder Pine, whom you have not honour'd ſo much as with flowers, that he would bring back thy <hi>Chloe,</hi> and our Votary. For <hi>Pan</hi> is accuſtom'd to Camps, and leaving the Plains, has made of late many Wars, and the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymnaeans</hi> ſhall find him an infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemy. Trouble not thy ſelf any longer; but get thee up and ſhew thy ſelf to <hi>Myrtale</hi> and <hi>Lamo,</hi> who now themſelves lye caſt on the ground, thinking thee too, to be part of the rapin. For <hi>Chloe</hi> ſhall certainly come to thee to morrow, accompanied with the Sheep and the Goats; you ſhall feed together as before, and play together on the Pipe. For other things concerning you, Love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will take the Care.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:115136:50"/>Now when <hi>Daphnis</hi> had ſeen and heard theſe things, he ſtarted up out of his ſleep, and full of pleaſure, full of grief, with tears in his eyes, adored the Statues of the Nymphs, and vowed to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to them, the beſt of all his ſhe-goats, if <hi>Chloe</hi> ſhould return ſafe. And running to the Pine where the Statue of <hi>Pan</hi> was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the legs a Goat's, the head horned, one hand holding a Pipe, the other a Goat dancing to it; that he adored, and made a vow for the ſafety of <hi>Chloe,</hi> and promiſed <hi>Pan</hi> a he-goat.</p>
            <p>Scarce now with the ſetting of the Sun, he made a pauſe of his weeping, his walling, and his prayers; and taking up the boughs he had cut in the Wood, return'd to the Cottage, comforted the heavy <hi>Lamo,</hi> and made him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, refreſht himſelf with meat and wine, and fell into a deep
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115136:51"/>
ſleep, yet not that without tears, praying to ſee the Nymphs again, &amp; calling for an early day, the day that they had promiſed <hi>Chloe.</hi> That night ſeem'd to him the longeſt of Nights; but in it, theſe wonders were done.</p>
            <p>The General of the <hi>Methymnae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> when he had born off to Sea about ten Stadium's, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, after the Incurſion and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, his wearied and Sea-ſick Souldiers. Coming up therefore to a Promontore which ran into the Sea, winding it ſelf into a half Moon, within which the Sea made a calmer ſtation then in a Port; in this place when he had caſt anchor, leſt the Ruſticks ſhould miſchieve him from the Land; he permitted them ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rant and be joviall as in peace. The <hi>Methymnaeans,</hi> becauſe by this direption they abounded with all things, feaſted, carowſ'd,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115136:51"/>
and danc'd, and celebrated victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.</p>
            <p>But the day being now ſpent, and their mirth protracted to the night; on a ſuddain all the Land ſeem'd to be on a light fire; then anon their ears were ſtruck with an impetuous clattering of Oars, as if a great Navy were a coming: ſome cryed out, The General muſt arm; others call'd to have it done; here, ſome thought they were wounded; there, others ſaw the ſhapes of bleeding, falling, dying men. A man would have thought he had ſeen a kind of nocturnall battel, when yet there was no enemy there. The night thus paſt in theſe Spectres, the day aroſe far more terrible than the night. For on the horns of all <hi>Daphnis</hi> his Goats, there grew up on a ſuddain the berried Ivie; and <hi>Chloe</hi>'s ſheep were heard to howl like Wolves in the Woods. <hi>Chloe</hi> her ſelf in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115136:52"/>
the midſt of her flocks, appear'd Crown'd with a moſt freſh and ſhady Pine.</p>
            <p>In the Sea it ſelf too, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened many Wonders, Paradoxes and Prodigies. For when they labour'd to weigh their Anchors, and begone, their Anchors ſtuck as faſt as the Earth; and when they caſt their Oars to rowe, they ſnapt and broke; the leaping Dolphins with the thumping of their tails, looſened the planks, and broke the ribs of the Barges. From that high Crag which lifted up it ſelf under the promontory, was heard a ſtrange ſound of a pipe; for it was not pleaſing as a Pipe, but like a Trumpet, or a terrible Cornet, which made them run to their arms, and call thoſe Enemies whom they ſaw not at all; inſomuch, that they wiſht it night again, as if they ſhould have a truce by that. Yet thoſe things
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115136:52"/>
which then happen'd might very well be underſtood by ſuch as were wiſe; namely, that thoſe Spectres, phantaſms and Sounds, proceeded from <hi>Pan,</hi> ſhewing himſelf angry at the Voyagers: yet the Cauſe they could not conjecture (for no Chappel of <hi>Pan</hi>'s was robbed) untill, about high noon, their Grand Captain, not without the impulſe of ſome Deity, fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſleep, <hi>Pan</hi> himſelf appeared to him, and rated him thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O ye moſt unholy and wickeddeſt of Mortals! what made you ſo bold as madly to attempt and do ſuch outrages as theſe? You have not only fill'd with war theſe fields that are ſo dear to me; but alſo you have driven away herds of Cattel, flocks of Sheep and Goats that were my care. Beſides, you have taken ſacrilegiouſly from the Altars of the Nymphs, a Maid of whom Love himſelf will write a Story. Nor did</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:115136:53"/>
               <hi>you at all revere the Nymphs that look't upon you when you did it, nor yet me, whom very well you knew to be</hi> Pan. <hi>Therefore you ſhall never ſee</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymna, <hi>ſailing away with thoſe ſpoils, nor ſhall you eſcape that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pipe from the Promontore, but it ſhall drown you every man: unleſſe Thou ſpeedily reſtore, as well</hi> Chloe <hi>to the Nymphs, as the herds and flocks to</hi> Chloe. <hi>Riſe therefore, and ſend the Maid aſhore; ſend her with all that I command thee; and I ſhall be as well to thee a Convey in thy Voyage home; as to her a Conduct on her way to the fields.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bryaxis</hi> being aſtoniſht at this, ſtarted up, and calling together the Captains of the Ships, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that <hi>Chloe</hi> ſhould be ſought for among the Captives. They found her preſently, and brought her before him; for ſhe ſate crown'd with a pine. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115136:53"/>
remembring that the pine was the mark and ſignal diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which he had in his dream, carried the Maid aſhore in the Admiral, with no ſmall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and ceremonious fear. Now as ſoon as <hi>Chloe</hi> was ſet on ſhore, the ſound of the Pipe from the Promontore, began to be heard again; not martial and terrible, as before, but perfectly paſtorall, ſuch as was uſed to lead the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel to feed in the fields; the ſheep ran down the ſcale of the ſhip, and not ſo much as one of them ſlipt becauſe they were hooved; The Goats more boldly, for they were uſed to climb the Crags and ſteeps of the hills. The whole flock encircled <hi>Chloe</hi> moving as in a dance about her, and with their skipping, and their blating, ſhewed a kind of joyfulneſſe and exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the Goats of other Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, as alſo the ſheep and the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115136:54"/>
herds, ſtirr'd not a foot, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd ſtill in the ſhip, as if the muſick of that Pipe did not at all call for them. When therfore they were all ſtruck with admiration at theſe things, and celebrated the praiſes of <hi>Pan;</hi> there were yet ſeen in both the Elements, things more wonderfull then thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For the Ships of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymnaeans</hi> before they had weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Anchors, ran amain; and a huge Dolphin bouncing ſtill out of the Sea, went before and led their Admiral: On the Land, that moſt ſweet melodious Pipe, led the flocks of the ſacred Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, and yet no body ſaw the Piper, no body knew from whence the Charm. It was now the time of the ſecond paſturing, and <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> having ſpied from a high Stand, <hi>Chloe</hi> coming with the flocks; crying out mainly, <hi>O ye Nymphs, O bleſsed Pan!</hi> made down
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115136:54"/>
to the Plains, and ruſhing into the Embraces of <hi>Chloe,</hi> in a ſwoon fell to the ground. With much ado, when he was come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with <hi>Chloe</hi>'s kiſſes, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in her cloſe and warm arms, he got to the Beech where they were wont; and when he was ſate down on the trunck, he askt her how ſhe had eſcap't ſuch a dangerous Captivity as that? Then ſhe told him every thing one after another, how the freſh and berried Ivie appeared on the horns of all the Goats; how her ſheep howl'd like Wolves, how a pine ſprung up upon her head; how all the Land ſeem'd on a fire; what horrible fragors and claſhings were heard from the Sea, with the two tones of that pipe from the Crag of the Promontore, the one to War, the other to Peace; the terrible Spectres of the night how ſhe was raviſht away; and how ſhe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115136:55"/>
not knowing her way, had for her Companion and Guide, the ſweet muſick of that ſtrange inviſible Pipe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> then acknowledged the viſion of the Nymphs, and the works of <hi>Pan,</hi> and ſtoried to her what he himſelf had ſeen, and what he had heard; and how, when he was ready to die for grief, his life was ſaved by the providence, and kindneſſe of the holy Nymphs. And then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſent her away to bring <hi>Dryas</hi> and <hi>Lamo</hi> to the Sacrifice, and all things neceſſary for ſuch a devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Pan</hi> and the Nymphs. In the mean time, `he catcht the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of all his She-goats, and when he had crown'd it with Ivie in that manner as the whole flock had appear'd to the Enemy, and had poured milk on the horns; in the name of the Nymphs he ſtruck and kill'd it, and ſacrificed it to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115136:55"/>
them; he hanged it up, took off the skin, conſecrated that, and made it an Anathema. When <hi>Chloe</hi> with her Company was come, he made a fire, and ſome of the fleſh being boiled, and ſome roſted, he offer'd the <hi>Aparchae,</hi> the Firſt, and chiefeſt parts of both to the Nymphs, and filling a Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with new wine, made a <hi>liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> then having made ſeveral beds of green leaves, gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to eating, drinking, and playing, onely he lookt out now and then, leſt the irruption of a Wolf upon him ſhould chance to do ſomething like the enemy. They ſung two certain ſongs in the praiſe of the Nymphs, the ſolemn <hi>Carwen</hi> of the ancient Shepherds. All that night they lay in the fields, and the next day they were not unmindfull of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working <hi>Pan;</hi> but took the hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goat that was Captain and leader
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115136:56"/>
of the flock; and when they had crowned him with pine-garlands, they brought him to the Pine; and pouring wine upon his head, with benedictions and thankful praiſe, they ſacrificed him to <hi>Pan</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, then, the fleſh, part roſted, part boiled, they ſet upon banks of green leaves hard by, in the Meadow: the skin with the horns themſelves, they pegged to the Pine cloſe to the Statue, to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral god, a paſtoral <hi>Anathema.</hi> They offered too, the <hi>Primitiae,</hi> or, the firſt carvings of the fleſh; <hi>Chloe</hi> ſang, and <hi>Daphnis</hi> played upon the pipe. Theſe Rites per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they ſate down, and fell to feaſt. And it happened, that <hi>Philetas</hi> the Herdſman came up to them, bringing with him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Garlands to honour <hi>Pan,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with grapes hanging ſtill upon the branches. His youngeſt Son <hi>Tityrus</hi> came along with him,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115136:56"/>
a ruddy Lad, and gray-eyed, ſtout and fierce, and of a nimble, bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pace like a Kid. When they ſaw what the intention of the good old <hi>Philetas</hi> was, they ſtarted up, and all together crowned the Statue of <hi>Pan</hi> with Garlands, and hang'd the palmits with their grapes upon the leaves of the Pine; and then they made <hi>Philetas</hi> and <hi>Tityrus</hi> ſit down to the Feaſt, and be their gueſts, to eat and drink, and celebrate. Then, as old men uſe to do, when they are a little whittled with wine, they had va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſcourſes and chats amongſt them; how bravely in their youth they had adminiſtred the paſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their flocks, and herds; how in their time they had eſcaped very many invaſions, and inroads of Pyrats and Theeves; here one bragged, that he had killed the hugeſt Wolf that ever came upon the fields; there another, that he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115136:57"/>
had bin Second to <hi>Pan</hi> alone in the skill and art of piping. And this was the crack of <hi>Philetas.</hi> And therefore <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> uſed all manner of ſupplications to him, that he would communicate with them that Art of piping, and play upon the Pipe at the feaſt of that god, whom he knew to delight ſo much in the Pipe. <hi>Philetas</hi> promiſed to do it, although he excuſed himſelf by the ſhort breath of his old age, and ſo took <hi>Daphnis</hi> his Pipe.</p>
            <p>But that being too little for ſo great an Art, as being made to be inſpired by the mouth of a boy, he ſent his Son <hi>Tityrus</hi> for his own, the Cottage lying diſtant from thence but ten furlongs. <hi>Tityrus</hi> flinging off his jacket ran naked, ſwift as a Hind. But <hi>Lamo</hi> had promiſed to tell them that Tale of the Pipe, which a <hi>Sicilian</hi> hired by him for a Goat and a Pipe, had ſung to him.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:115136:57"/>
            <p>
               <hi>This Pipe, That Organ which you ſee, was heretofore no Organ, but a very fair Maid, who had a ſweet, and muſical voice.

But ſhe diſdained and derided his Love, and denyed to take him to be her Sweet-heart, who was neither perfect man, nor perfect Goat.</hi> Pan <hi>followes her with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and thinks to force her;</hi> Syrinx <hi>fled</hi> Pan, <hi>and his force.

               <hi>Lamo</hi> had now done his Tale, and <hi>Philetas</hi> praiſed him for it, as one that had told them a Story far ſweeter then any Song; when <hi>Tityrus</hi> came in, and brought his Fathers Pipe, a large Organ, and made up of great quils; and where it was joyned together with wax, there too it was ſet, and varied with braſſe. Inſomuch, that one would have thought, that this had bin that very Pipe which <hi>Pan</hi> the inventor made firſt.</p>
            <p>When therefore <hi>Philetas</hi> was got up, and had ſet himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right on a bench, firſt he tryed the quills whether they ſounded clear and ſweet; then finding never a Cane was ſtopt, he played a loud, and luſty tune. One would not
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115136:58"/>
have thought that he had heard but one Pipe, the Sound was ſo high, the conſort ſo full. But by little and little remitting that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence, he changed it to a ſoft and ſweeter tone; and playing with all the dexterouſneſſe of the art of Muſick, he ſhewed upon the Pipe, what Notes were fit for the herds of Cowes and Oxen, what agreed with the flocks of Goats, what were pleaſing to the ſheep. The tones for the ſheep were ſoft and ſweet, thoſe of the herds were vehement; and for the Goats, were ſharp and ſhrill. In ſumme, that ſingle Pipe of his expreſt even all the Shepherds pipes. Therefore the reſt in deep ſilence ſate ſtill, delighted and charmed with that Muſick. But <hi>Dryas</hi> riſing and bidding him ſtrike up a <hi>Dionyſia<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And now he acted to the Life the cutting and gathering of the grapes; now the carrying of the baskets; then the treading of the grapes in the Preſſe; then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the tunning of the Wine into the Butts; and then again, their joyful and hearty carouſing the Muſt. All theſe things he repreſented ſo aptly and clearly in his dancing, that they all thought, they verily ſaw before their face, the Vines, the Grapes, the Muſt, the Butts, and that <hi>Dryas</hi> did drink indeed. This third old man when he had pleaſed them ſo well with his dance, embraced and kiſt <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe.</hi> Therefore they two riſing quickly, fell to dancing <hi>Lamo</hi>'s Tale. <hi>Daphnis</hi> played <hi>Pan;</hi> and <hi>Chloe, Syrinx.</hi> He wooes, and prayes, to perſwade, and win her; She ſhews her diſdain, laughs at his love, and flies him. <hi>Daphnis</hi> followes as to force her, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

on his tiptoes, imitates the hooves of <hi>Pan. Chloe</hi> on the other ſide, acts <hi>Syrinx</hi> wearied with her flight, and throwes her ſelf into the Wood, as ſhe had done into the Fenne. But <hi>Daphnis</hi> catching up that great Pipe of <hi>Philetas,</hi> playes at firſt ſomething that was dolefull, and bewailing a Lover; then ſomething that made Love, and was perſwaſive to relenting; then an <hi>anacletic,</hi> or recall from the Wood, as from one that dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought her; inſomuch, that <hi>Philetas</hi> ſtruck with admiration and joy, could not hold from ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering: then kiſſing <hi>Daphnis,</hi> he gave him that Pipe of his, and commanded him to leave it to a Succeſſour like himſelf. <hi>Daphnis</hi> hanged up his own ſmall one to <hi>Pan,</hi> &amp; when he had kiſt his <hi>Chloe,</hi> as returning from a true unfeigned flight, he drove home his Flocks piping all the way. <hi>Chloe</hi> too, by

the ſame Muſick gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Flocks, the Goats ſtritting along with the Sheep, becauſe <hi>Daphnis</hi> walked cloſe by <hi>Chloe.</hi> Thus till it was night they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained one another with pleaſure, and agreed to drive out their flocks ſooner the next morning. And ſo they did. For as ſoon as it was day they went out to paſture; and when they had firſt ſaluted the Nymphs, and then <hi>Pan,</hi> afterwards ſitting down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Oak, they had the muſick of <hi>Philetas</hi> his Pipe, in that ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſolitude of the early morning. After that, they kiſt, embrac'd, and hugg'd one another, and lay down both together on the ground, and doing nothing more then ſo, roſe up again. Nor were they incurious of their meat; and for their drink, they drank wine mingled with milk. With all which Incentives being more

heated, and made more lively and forward, they practiſed between them an <hi>Erotic</hi> Contention, or an amorous Controverſie about their Love to one another, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceeded to bind themſelves by the faith of Oaths.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Daphnis</hi> coming up to the Pine, ſwore by <hi>Pan,</hi> that he would not live alone in this world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Chloe,</hi> ſo much as the ſpace of one day: And <hi>Chloe</hi> ſwore in the Cave of the Nymphs, that ſhe would have the ſame death, and life with <hi>Daphnis.</hi> Yet ſuch was the Simplicity of <hi>Chloe,</hi> as being but a Girle, that when ſhe was out of the Cave, ſhe deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another Oath of <hi>Daphnis.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis,</hi> (quoth ſhe) <hi>Pan</hi> is a wanton, faithleſſe god; for he loved <hi>Pitys,</hi> he loved <hi>Syrinx</hi> too. Beſides, he never ceaſes to trouble and vex the <hi>Dryads,</hi> and to ſollicite the Nymphs under the Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees.

Therefore he, if by thy faithleſneſſe thou ſhouldſt neglect him, would not take care to puniſh thee, although thou ſhouldſt go to more Maids, then there are quills in that Pipe.

            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> was pleaſed with this pretty Jealouſie, and ſtanding in the midſt of his flocks, with one hand laying hold on a ſhe-goat, and the other on a he, ſwore that he would love <hi>Chloe</hi> that loved him, and that if ſhe preferred any other to <hi>Daphnis,</hi> that then in her ſtead, he would ſlay that hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goat.

But while he was yet an hundred Stadiums off from the Town, an Herald met him with Articles. For after that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymnaeans</hi> were informed by the Captives, that the <hi>Mitylenaeans</hi> knew nothing of thoſe things that had happened; and that the Ploughmen and Shepherds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the young Gentlemen, were they that were the Cauſes of all; it repented them of that expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Bryaxis</hi> againſt a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-City, as of an Action more precipitant, then moderate and wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:115136:64"/>And theſe were the Articles of Agreement: To return all the Prey and Spoil that was taken and carried away; To have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and trade ſecurely with one another, by Land, and by Sea. Therefore <hi>Hippaſus</hi> diſpatches away that Herauld to <hi>Mitylene,</hi> although he had bin created the General of the War, and ſo had power to ſign as he liſted. But pitching his Camp about ten Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums from <hi>Methymna,</hi> there he attended Mandates from the City. Two dayes after, the Meſſenger returned, and brought a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that they ſhould receive the plunder'd Goods, and all the Captives, and march home with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing the leaſt harm. Becauſe <hi>Methymna,</hi> when War, or Peace were offered to be choſen, found peace to be more profitable. And this quarrel betwixt <hi>Methymna</hi> and <hi>Mitylene,</hi> which was of an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115136:65"/>
beginning and end, was thus taken up and compoſed. And now Winter was come on, a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more bitter then war, to <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> and <hi>Chloe.</hi> For on a ſuddain there fell a great Snow which blinded all the paths, ſtopt up all wayes, and ſhut up all the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and Colones. The very Torrents were frozen and glazed with Chryſtal. The hedges and trees lookt as if they had bin clipt and cropt; and there was nothing to be ſeen but ſtumps. All the ground was hoodwinkt up, but that which lay upon the fountains and the rills. And therefore no man drove out his flocks to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, or did ſo much as come to the door, but about the Cock's crowing made their fires noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>high; and ſome ſpun flax; ſome Tarpaulin for the Sea; others; with all their Sophiſtry, made gins, and nets, and traps for birds.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115136:65"/>
At that time their care was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about the Oxen and Cows that were fodder'd with chaffe in the ſtalls; about the Goats, and about the Sheep, and thoſe which fed on green leaves in the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats and the folds; or elſe about fatting their hogs in the ſtyes with Acorns and other maſt.</p>
            <p>When all was thus taken up with their domeſtick affairs, the other Colones and Shepherds were very jovial and merry, as being for a while diſcharged of their labours, and uſed to have their breakfaſt betime in the morning, when they had ſlept long winter nights: ſo that the winter was to them more pleaſant then the Summer, the Autumne, or the very Spring. But <hi>Chloe</hi> and <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> when they remembred what a ſweet Converſation they had held before; how they had kiſt, how they had embraced and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115136:66"/>
hugg'd one another, how they had lived at a common Scrip, all which were now as pleaſures loſt: how they had long and ſleepleſſe nights, now they were alwaies ſad and penſive, and deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as a quick retrive of the Spring, to become their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and return from death. Beſides this, it was their grief and complaint, if but a Scrip came to their hands out of which they had eaten before in the fields; or a Sillibub-piggin, out of which they had uſed to drink: or if they chanced to ſee a Pipe laid aſide and neglected, ſuch as had bin not long before, the Gift of a dear friend, or a Lover. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they prayed to <hi>Pan,</hi> and the Nymphs, that they would deliver them from theſe evils and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſhew to them and their flocks the Sun again. Both pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame thing, they labour'd
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115136:66"/>
too, and caſt about to find a way, by which they might come to ſee one another. Poor <hi>Chloe</hi> was void of all counſell, and had no device nor plot. For the old woman, her reputed mother, was by her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and taught her to card the fine wooll, and twirle the Spindle, or elſe was ſtill a clock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her, and ever and anon caſting in words, and twatling to her about her marriage. But <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who was now at leiſure enough, and was of a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting wit then ſhe, deviſed this Sophiſm to ſee her.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Dryas</hi> his Cottage, and indeed under the very Cottage it ſelf, there grew two tall myrtles, &amp; an Ivie-buſh. The myrtles ſtood not far off from one another, and between them the Ivie ran, and ſo, that it made a kind of arbour by claſping the arms about them both, and by the order, the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115136:67"/>
and interweaving of its branches and leaves; many and great cluſters of berries, hanging like thoſe of the Vines upon the palmits. And therefore it was, that great ſtore of winter birds haunted the buſh, for want (it ſeems) of food abroad; many blackbirds, many Thruſhes, Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doves and Starlings, with other birds that feed on berries. Under pretext of birding there, <hi>Daphnis</hi> came out, his Scrip furniſhed with Country dainties, bringing with him, to perſwade and affirm his meaning, ſnares and lime-twigs for the purpoſe. The place lay off but ten furlongs: and yet the Snow that lay unmelted, found him ſomewhat to do to paſſe through it. But all things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to Love, even Fire, Water, and <hi>Scythian</hi> Snowes. Therefore plodding through, he came up to the Cottage, and when he had
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115136:67"/>
ſhook off the Snow from his thighs, he ſet his ſnares, and prickt his lime-twiggs. Then he ſate down, and thought of nothing carefully, but of <hi>Chloe</hi> and the birds.</p>
            <p>There flew to the buſhes many birds, and a ſufficient number was taken to buſie <hi>Daphnis</hi> a thouſand wayes, in running up and down, in gathering, killing, and deplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his game. But no body ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the Cottage; not a man or woman to be ſeen, not ſo much as a henne at the door; but all were ſhut up in the warm houſe: ſo that now poor <hi>Daphnis</hi> knew not what in the world to do, but was at a ſtand, as if he had come unluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kily a fowling. And aſſuredly he would have ventured to intrude himſelf, if he could but have found out ſome ſpecious cauſe, and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible enough; and ſo deliberated with himſelf, what was the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt to be ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:115136:68"/>
               <hi>I came to fetch fire, and was there none within ten furlongs nearer to</hi> Lamo's? <hi>I came to borrow bread, but thy Scrip is ſtufft with Cakes. I wanted wine; Thy Vintage was but t'other day. A wolf purſued me; where are the tracings of a wolf? I came hither to catch Birds; And when thou haſt catcht them, why get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou not thy ſelf home? I have a mind to ſee</hi> Chloe; <hi>but how can any body confeſſe ſuch a thing as that to the Father and Mother of a Maid? Beſides, the Servants are at a deep ſilence, and all at home. But there is not one of all theſe things that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not Suſpition with it. Therefore it's better to be ſilent. But I ſhall ſee</hi> Chloe <hi>at the firſt peeping of the Spring, ſince (as it ſeems) the Fates prohibit it in Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe thoughts caſt up and down in his anxious mind, and his prey taken up, he thinks to be gone, and makes away. But then,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115136:68"/>
as if Love himſelf had pitied his cauſe, it happened thus: <hi>Dryas</hi> and his Family had a Feaſt, the meat was taken up, and divided to meſſes, the boord was covered, the Crater ſet and trimm'd. But one of the flock-dogs took his time while they were buſie, and ran out adoors with a ſhoulder of mutton. <hi>Dryas</hi> was vext, for that belong'd to his meſſe, and ſnatching up a club, followed at his heeles as if it had bin another dog. This pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit brought him up to the Ivie, where he eſpyed the young <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> packing away with his birds on his back.</p>
            <p>With that, forgetting the dog and the fleſh, he cryes out amain: <hi>Hail boy, hail boy;</hi> and fell on his neck to kiſſe him, and catching him by the hand, led him along into the houſe. And then it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but a little that <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> fell not both to the ground,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115136:69"/>
when at firſt they ſaw one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet while they ſtrove with themſelves to ſtand upright, there paſt ſalutations and kiſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and thoſe to them were as pillars and ſuſtentations to hold them from toppling into ſwoones. <hi>Daphnis</hi> having now got, beyond all hope, not onely a kiſſe, but <hi>Chloe</hi> her ſelf too, ſate down by the fire, and laid upon the table his blackbirds, Stock-doves, and Thruſhes: and fell to tell them, how tedious the buſineſſe of the houſe, and keeping within had bin to him, and that therefore he was come out to recreate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and, as they ſaw, to catch birds: how he had taken ſome with lime-twigs, ſome with ſnares as they were feeding greedily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ivie and the myrtle-berries. They on the other ſide fell to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and praiſe <hi>Daphnis,</hi> as if <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelf had bin their ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115136:69"/>
and commanded <hi>Chloe</hi> to wait on them, and fill their wine. She with a merry countenance fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the reſt; and after them, ſomewhat frowningly to <hi>Daphnis:</hi> For ſhe feigned a pretty anger, becauſe that when he was there, he would offer to go away in ſuch a manner, and not ſee her. Yet before ſhe gave it to him, ſhe kiſt the Cup, and ſipt a little, and ſo gave it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis,</hi> although he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt choakt for want of drink, drank ſlowly, tickling himſelf by that delay, with longer pleaſure. Dinner was done, and the Table voided; and every body began to ask, how <hi>Lamo</hi> and <hi>Myrtale</hi> had done a great while, and ſo went on to pronounce them happy folks, who had got ſuch a ſtay, and cheriſher of their old age.</p>
            <p>And it was no ſmall pleaſure to <hi>Daphnis</hi> to be praiſed ſo in the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115136:70"/>
hearing of <hi>Chloe.</hi> And when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they ſaid, That he muſt and ſhould tarry with them the next day, becauſe it was their Sacrifice to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> it wanted but a little that for very pleaſure the raviſht Lover had worſhipped them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Bacchus</hi> himſelf; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſently he drew out of his Scrip good ſtore of ſweet-cakes, and his birds were order'd to be made ready for Supper. A freſh Crater of wine was ſet, a new fire kindled up; and when it was night, their ſecond Table brought in: when Supper was done, and part of their time was ſpent in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of old Tales, part in ſinging ſome of the ditties of the fields, they went to bed; <hi>Chloe</hi> with her Mother, <hi>Daphnis</hi> with <hi>Dryas.</hi> But then nothing was ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to poor <hi>Chloe,</hi> but that the next morning ſhe ſhould ſee her <hi>Daphnis</hi> again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:115136:70"/>And <hi>Daphnis</hi> entertained the night himſelf with a fantaſtick, empty pleaſure; for it was ſweet to his imagination, to lye but with the Father of <hi>Chloe,</hi> and he dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to himſelf that even there he embraced, and kiſt her. In the morning it was a ſharp froſt, and the North wind was very nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, when they all roſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to celebrate. With ſolemn invocations of <hi>Bacchus, Dryas</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed a ramme, and a huge fire was built up to roſt the meat. While <hi>Nape</hi> was making the holy bread, and <hi>Dryas</hi> roſting the Ramme, <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> had time to go forth as far as the Ivie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh; and when he had ſet his ſnares again, they had a ſweet Collation of Kiſſes without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and then a dear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the Language of Love.</p>
            <p>Chloe, <hi>I came for thy ſake. I</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:115136:71"/>
               <hi>know it</hi> Daphnis. <hi>'Tis long of thee that I deſtroy the poor birds. And am I no-body in thy account? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me. I remember thee by the Nymphs, by whom heretofore I have ſworn in yonder Cave, whither we will go as ſoon as ever the Snow melts. But it lies very deep,</hi> Chloe, <hi>and I fear I ſhall melt firſt. Courage man, the Sun burns hot. I would it burnt like that fire which now burns my very heart. You do but gibe, and couſen me! I do not, by the Goats, by which thou didſt once bid me to ſwear to thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While <hi>Chloe</hi> was holding on her <hi>Antiphona</hi> to <hi>Daphnis, Nape</hi> call'd, and in they ran, with more birds then had bin taken the day before. Now when they had made a <hi>liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the firſt of the Crater to <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> they fell to their meat, with Ivie Crownes upon their heads: and when it was time, having cryed the <hi>Jacchus,</hi> and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115136:71"/>
               <hi>Euous,</hi> they ſent away <hi>Daphnis,</hi> his Scrip firſt cramm'd with fleſh and bread. They gave him too, the Stock-doves and Thruſhes to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Lamo</hi> and <hi>Myrtale,</hi> as being like to catch themſelves more while the froſt and Ivie laſted. And ſo <hi>Daphnis</hi> went his way when he had kiſt the reſt firſt, and then <hi>Chloe,</hi> that he might carry along with him, her Kiſſe untoucht and intire: and by other devices he came often thither, that the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might not eſcape away whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without ſome fruition of the ſweets of Love.</p>
            <p>It was now the beginning of the Spring, the Snow was gone, the Earth uncovered, and all was green, when the other Shepherds drove out their flocks to paſture, and <hi>Chloe</hi> and <hi>Daphnis</hi> before the reſt, as being Servants to greater Shepherds. And forthwith they took their courſe up to the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115136:72"/>
Nymphs, and that Cave, thence to <hi>Pan,</hi> and his Pipe; afterwards to their own Oak, where they ſate down to look to their flocks, and kiſſe, and clip inſatiably. They ſought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about for flowers too to crown the Statues of the Nymphs. The ſoft breath of <hi>Zephyrus</hi> and the warm Sun, had brought ſome forth; and there were then to be found the Violet, the Daffodil, the Primroſe, with the other primes, and dawnings of the Spring. And when they had crown'd the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the gods with them, they made a Libation with new milk from the Sheep, and from the Goats. They began too to play on the Pipe, and to provoke and challenge the Nightingales with their Muſick, and Song. The Nightingales anſwer'd ſoftly from the Groves, and reſuming their long intermitted Song, began to jug and warble their <hi>Tereus</hi> and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115136:72"/>
               <hi>Ity's</hi> again. Here and there not without pleaſure, the blating of the flocks was heard, and the Lambs came skipping and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themſelves obliquely under the damms to riggle and nuſsle at their dugs. But thoſe which had not yet teemed, the Rams purſued; and when with ſome pains they had made them ſtand, one rid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. There were ſeen too the Chaſes of the he-goats, and their laſcivious ardent leaps. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they had battels for the ſhe's, and every one had his own wives, and kept them ſollicitouſly, that no ſculking adulterer ſhould ſet upon them.</p>
            <p>The old men ſeeing ſuch incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary ſights as theſe, were prickt to <hi>Venus:</hi> but the Young, and ſuch as of themſelves did itch, and for ſome time had longed for the pleaſure of Love, were wholly inflamed with what they heard,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115136:73"/>
and melted away with what they ſaw, and lookt for ſomething far more excellent then kiſſes and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces were: and amongſt them was <hi>Daphnis</hi> chief. Therefore he, as being now grown up and luſty by keeping at home, and following eaſie buſineſſe all the Winter, was carried furiouſly to kiſſing, and ſtung with the deſire to embrace, and cloſe; and, in what he did, was now more curious, and more rampant then ever before. And therefore he began to ask of <hi>Chloe,</hi> that ſhe would give him free leave to do with her what he liſted, and that ſhe would lye naked with him naked, and longer too then they were wont: For there was nothing but that, remaining of the Inſtitutes of old <hi>Philetas,</hi> and that he would try, as the onely Canon, the onely medicine to eaſe the pain of Love.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Chloe</hi> asking him, whether
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115136:73"/>
any thing remain'd more then kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, embracing, and lying toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the ground? or what he could do by lying naked upon a naked Girle?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> (quoth he) <hi>which the Rams uſe to do with the Ewes, and the he-Goats with the She's. Do you not ſee, how after that work, neither theſe run away, nor thoſe weary themſelves in purſuit of them; but afterwards how enjoying a common pleaſure, they feed together quietly. That—as it ſeems is a ſweet practice, and ſuch as can maſter the bitterneſſe of Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>How</hi> Daphnis? <hi>And doſt thou not ſee the ſhe-Goats and the Ewes, the he-Goats and the Rams, how theſe do their work ſtanding, and thoſe ſuffer ſtanding too; theſe leaping; and thoſe admitting: them upon their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> backs? And yet thou askeſt me to lye down, and that naked. But how</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:115136:74"/>
               <hi>much rougher are they then I, although I have all my Clothes on?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> is perſwaded, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her down, lay down with her, and lay long; but knowing how to do nothing of that which yet he was mad to do, lifted her up, and endeavour'd to imitate the Goats. But at the firſt finding a meer fruſtration there, he ſate up, and lamented to himſelf, that he was more unskilfull then a very Top in the practice of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the Art of Love. But there was a certain neighbour of his, a landed man, <hi>Chromis</hi> his name, and was now by his age ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what declining. He married out of the City a young, fair, and buxome girle, one that was too fine and delicate for the Country, and a Clown: Her name was <hi>Lycaenium;</hi> and ſhe obſerving <hi>Daphnis</hi> as every day early in the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115136:74"/>
morning he drove out his Goats to the fields, and home again at the firſt twilight, had a great mind to purchaſe the youth by gifts to become her ſweet-heart. And therefore once when ſhe had ſculkt for her opportunity, and catcht him alone, ſhe gave him a curious fine pipe, ſome pretious hony-combs, and a new Scrip of Stag-skin: but durſt not break her mind to him, becauſe ſhe could eaſily conjecture at that dear love he bore to <hi>Chloe.</hi> For ſhe ſaw him wholly addicted to the girle; which indeed ſhe might well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive before, by the winking, nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, laughing and tittering that was between them: but one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe made <hi>Chromis</hi> believe that ſhe was to go to a womans labour, and followed ſoftly behind them two at ſome diſtance, and then ſlipt away into a thicket and hid her ſelf, and ſo could hear all that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115136:75"/>
they ſaid, and ſee too all that they did; and the lamenting untaught <hi>Daphnis</hi> was perfectly within her reach. Wherefore ſhe began to condole the condition of the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Lovers, and finding that ſhe had light upon a double opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; this, to the preſervation of them; that, to ſatisfie her own wanton deſire, ſhe projected to accompliſh both by this device. The nextday making as if ſhe were to go a Goſſipping again, ſhe came up openly to the Oak where <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> were ſitting together; and when ſhe had skilfully coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited that ſhe was ſcared, <hi>Help</hi> (Daphnis) <hi>help me,</hi> (quoth ſhe) <hi>An Eagle has carried away from me the goodlieſt Gooſe of twenty in a flock, which yet, by reaſon of the great weight, ſhe was not able to carry to the top of that her wonted high crag, but is fallen down with her into yonder Cops. For the Nymphs ſake, and</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:115136:75"/>
               <hi>this</hi> Pan's, <hi>do thou</hi> Daphnis <hi>go in to the Wood, and reſcue my Gooſe. For I dare not go in my ſelf alone. Let me not thus loſe the Tale of my Geeſe. And it may be thou mayeſt kill the Eagle too, and then ſhe will ſcarce come hither any more to prey upon the Kids and Lambs.</hi> Chloe <hi>for ſo long will look to the flock; the Goats know her as thy perpetuall Companion in the fields.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſuſpecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that that was intended, gets up quickly, and taking his ſtaffe followed <hi>Lycaenium,</hi> who lead him a great way off from <hi>Chloe.</hi> But when they were come into the thickeſt part of the wood, and ſhe had bid him ſit down by a Fountain:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> (quoth ſhe) <hi>Thou doſt love</hi> Chloe, <hi>and that I learnt laſt night of the Nymphs. Thoſe teares which yeſterday thou didſt pour down, were ſhewn to me in a dream by them,</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:115136:76"/>
               <hi>and they commanded me, that I ſhould ſave thee, and teach thee the ſecret practices of Love. But thoſe are not Kiſſes, nor Embracing, nor yet ſuch things as thou ſeeſt the Rams, and the he-goats do. There are other leaps, there are other friskins then thoſe, and far ſweeter then them: For unto theſe there appertains a much longer dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pleaſure. If then thou wouldſt be rid of thy miſery, and make an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of that pleaſure and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which you have ſought, and miſt ſo long, come on, deliver thy ſelf to me a ſweet Schollar, and I, to gratifie the Nymphs, will be thy Miſtris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this <hi>Daphnis</hi> as being a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Goat-herd, a ſanguin Youth, and burning in deſire, could not contain himſelf for meer pleaſure, and that Lubency that he had to be taught; but throwes himſelf at the foot of <hi>Lycaenium,</hi> and begs of her, That ſhe would teach him quickly that Art, by which he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115136:76"/>
ſhould be able, as he would, to do <hi>Chloe;</hi> and he ſhould not onely accept it as a rare and brave thing ſent from the gods, but for her kindneſſe he would give her too a young Kid, ſome of the fineſt new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milk-Cheeſes; nay, beſides, he promiſed her the dam her ſelf.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Lycaenium</hi> now ſhe had found the Goat-herd ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and forward beyond her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, began to inſtruct the Lad thus—She bid him ſit down as near to her as poſſibly he could, and that he ſhould kiſſe her as cloſe and as often as he uſed to kiſſe <hi>Chloe;</hi> and while he kiſt her to clip her in his arms and hugg her to him, and lye down with her upon the ground. As now he was ſitting, and kiſſing, and lay down with her; She, when ſhe ſaw him itching to be at her, lifted him up from the reclination on his ſide, and ſlipping under, not
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115136:77"/>
without art, directed him to her <hi>Fancie,</hi> the place ſo long deſired and ſought.</p>
            <p>Of that which happened after this, there was nothing done that was ſtrange, nothing that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent: the Lady Nature and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenium</hi> ſhewed him how to do the reſt.</p>
            <p>This wanton Information being over, <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who had ſtill a Childiſh Paſtorall mind, would preſently be gone, and run up to <hi>Chloe,</hi> to have an experiment with her, how much he had profited by that magiſtery, as if indeed he had bin afraid leſt ſtaying but a little longer, he ſhould forget to do his trick.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lycenium</hi> intercepted him thus: <hi>Thou art yet</hi> Daphnis, <hi>to learn this beſides: I who am a woman, have ſuffered nothing in this cloſe with thee, but what I am well acquainted withall. For heretofore another Youth</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:115136:77"/>
               <hi>taught me to play at this ſport, and for his pains he had my maidenherd. But if thou ſtrive with</hi> Chloe <hi>in this liſt, ſhe will ſqueak, and cry out, and bleed as if ſhe were ſtickt. But be not thou afraid of her bleeding; but when thou haſt perſwaded her to thy pleaſure, bring her hither into this place, that although ſhe ſhould cry and roar, no body can hear; and if ſhe bleed, here's a clear Fountain, ſhe may waſh: and do thou,</hi> Daphnis, <hi>never forget it, that I before </hi> Chloe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>made thee a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe advertiſements given, <hi>Lycenium</hi> kiſt him, and went away through another glade of the Wood, as if ſtill ſhe would look her Gooſe. But <hi>Daphnis</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himſelf what had been ſaid, remitted much of that impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous heat he had to <hi>Chloe.</hi> For he durſt not venture to preſſe her beyond his former kiſſing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing; becauſe he could not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115136:78"/>
endure that ſhe ſhould make an outcry, as againſt an Enemy, or ſhed tears for any grief or anguiſh from him, and much leſſe that ſhe ſhould bleed, as if ſhe had bin ſlain by <hi>Daphnis.</hi> For he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not long before had had ſome experience of that when he was beaten by the <hi>Methymnaeans,</hi> and therefore he abhorred blood, and thought verily that no blood could follow but onely from a wound. His reſolution therefore was, to do with her as he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and imagine pleaſure on this ſide the traverſe; and ſo he comes out of the Wood up to the place where <hi>Chloe</hi> ſate platting a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of Violets, and tells her he had reſcued the Gooſe, and kill'd the Eagle; then flinging his arms about her, and claſping her to him, kiſt her as he did <hi>Lyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> in that ſweet ſport that he was lately at: For that he might
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115136:78"/>
do, becauſe that ſeemed to have no danger in it. But <hi>Chloe</hi> fits the chaplet to his head, and then kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his locks as fairer and ſweeter then the Violets, and out of her Scrip ſhe gave him of her Cakes and Simnels to eat, and ſnatcht it by ſtealth from his mouth again as he was eating, and fed like a wanton, harmleſſe bird.</p>
            <p>While thus they eat and take more kiſſes then bits, they ſaw a Fiſher-mans boat come by. The wind was down, the Sea was ſmooth, and there was a great Calm. Wherefore when they ſaw there was need of rowing, they fell to ply the Oars ſtoutly. For they made haſte to bring in a delicate ſort of fiſh newly-ſalted, to fit the palates of the richer Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of <hi>Mitylene.</hi> That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which other Marriners uſe to do to elude the tediouſneſſe of labour, theſe began, and held on,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115136:79"/>
as they rowed along. There was one amongſt them that was the <hi>Celeuſtes,</hi> or, the hortator to ply, and he had certain <hi>nautic-odes,</hi> or Sea-ſongs: the reſt like a <hi>Chorus</hi> all together ſtrained their throats to a loud <hi>hollà,</hi> and catcht his voice at certain intervals. While they did thus in the open Sea, the clamor vaniſht, as being diffuſed in the vaſt ayr.</p>
            <p>But when they came under any Promontore, or into a flexuous, horned, hollow bay, there as the voice was heard ſtronger, ſo the Songs of the <hi>Celeusmata,</hi> or hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments to the anſwering Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, fell clearer to the Land. The hollow valley below received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelf, that ſhrill ſound as into an Organ, and by an imitating voice rendred from it ſelf, all that was ſaid, all that was done, and every thing diſtinctly by it ſelf; by it ſelf the clattering of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115136:79"/>
Oars; by it ſelf the whooping of the Sea-men: and certainly it was a moſt pleaſant hearing. The Sound coming firſt from the Sea, the Sound from the Land ended ſo much the later, by how much it was ſlower to begin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> therefore taking ſpecial notice of the muſick attended wholly to the Sea, and was ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected, endeavouring while the Pinnace glided by like a bird in the ayr, to preſerve to himſelf ſome of thoſe tones to play after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon his Pipe.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Chloe</hi> having then had her firſt experience of that which is called <hi>Echo,</hi> now caſt her eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea, minding the loud <hi>Celeusmata</hi> of the Marriners; now to the Woods, ſeeking for thoſe who anſwer'd from thence with ſuch a clamor, and when, becauſe the Pinnace was paſt away, there was a deep ſilence in the valley,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115136:80"/>
ſhe askt of <hi>Daphnis,</hi> Whether there were another Sea beyond the Promontore, and another Ship did paſſe by there? and whether there were other Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that ſung the ſame Songs, and all were whiſt and kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence together? <hi>Daphnis</hi> laught ſweetly at this, and giving her a ſweeter kiſſe, put the violet chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let upon her head, and began to tell her the Tale of <hi>Echo,</hi> requiring firſt, that when he had taught her that, he ſhould have of her for his wages, ten kiſſes more:</p>
            <p>There are of the Nymphs (my dear Girle) more kinds then one. There are the <hi>Melicae,</hi> there are the <hi>Dryades,</hi> there are the <hi>Eliae;</hi> all are beautiful, all are muſical. To one of theſe <hi>Echo</hi> was daughter; and ſhe mortal, becauſe ſhe came of a mortall Father; but a rare beauty, deriving from a beauteous
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115136:80"/>
mother. She was educated by the Nymphs, and taught by the Muſes to ſing, to play on the Pipes to ſtrike the Lyre, to touch the Lute; and in ſumme, all muſick. And therefore when ſhe was grown up, and in the flower of her Virgin beauty, ſhe danc'd together with the Nymphs; and ſung in conſort with the Muſes; but fled from all males whether Men or gods; becauſe ſhe loved Virginity. <hi>Pan</hi> ſees that, and takes occaſion to be angry at the maid, and to envy her muſick, becauſe he could not come at her beauty. Therefore he ſends a madneſſe amongſt the Shepherds and Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds; and they in a deſperate fury like ſo many Doggs and Wolves, tore her all to pieces, and flung about them all over the Earth her yet Singing Limbs. The Earth in obſervance of the Nymphs, buried them all, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115136:81"/>
to them ſtill their muſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>property: and they by an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Sentence and decree of the Muſes breathe out a voice, and they imitate all things now, as ſhe did then before a Maid, the gods, Men, Organs, Beaſts: <hi>Pan</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhe imitates too, when he playes on the Pipe, which when he hears, he bounces out, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to follow her over the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, not ſo much to catch her, and hold her, as to know what clandeſtin Schollar that is that he has got.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Daphnis</hi> thus had told his Tale, <hi>Chloe</hi> gave him not onely ten, but innumerable kiſſes. For <hi>Echo</hi> ſaid almoſt the ſame, and bore him witneſſe that he did not lie.</p>
            <p>But now when the Sun was grown more burning, the Spring going out, and Summer coming in, they were invited to new, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115136:81"/>
Summer pleaſure. <hi>Daphnis;</hi> he ſwome in the Rivers: <hi>Chloe,</hi> ſhe bathed in the Springs: he with his Pipe contended with the Pines; ſhe with her voice ſtrove with the Nightingales. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they hunted the pratling Locuſts; ſometimes they catcht the chirping Graſhoppers, they gather'd flowers, they ſhak't the Trees for mellow fruits. And now and then they lay together naked on a Goat-skin, That ſtill they took along with them. And <hi>Chloe</hi> undoubtedly had loſt her maidenhead, but that <hi>Daphnis</hi> was terrified with the thought of blood. And therefore fearing, leſt one time or another his Reaſon ſhould be maſter'd by his Love, he ſeldom bid <hi>Chloe</hi> turn her ſelf na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to dally with him; which <hi>Chloe</hi> wonder'd at; but her baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe would not let her ask him the reaſon of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:115136:82"/>That Summer <hi>Chloe</hi> had many Suitors, and many came from many places to <hi>Dryas</hi> to get his good will to have her. Some brought their gifts along with them; others promiſed great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nape</hi> was tempted by her hope, &amp; began to perſwade that the Girle ſhould be beſtowed, and to urge, that a maid of her age, ſhould not longer be kept at home: for who knows whether one time or other, ſhe may not loſe her maidenhead for an apple, or aroſe as ſhe keeps the field, and make ſome unworthy Shepherd a man, and her husband; and therefore it was better ſhe ſhould now be made the Dame of the houſe, and when they had got ſufficiently by her, it ſhould be laid up for their Son; for of late they had born a jolly boy.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Dryas</hi> was variouſly affected
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115136:82"/>
with what was ſaid; ſometimes he was pleas'd: for greater gifts were named to him by every one, then ſuited with a rural Girle, a Shepherdeſſe: ſometimes again, he thought the Maid deſerved better, then to be married to a Clown, and that, if ever ſhe ſhould find her true Parents, ſhe might make him and his Family happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he defers his anſwer to the Wooers, and puts them on from day to day, and in the interim has many Preſents.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Chloe</hi> came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this, ſhe was very ſad, and yet ſhe hid it long from <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> becauſe ſhe would not give him a cauſe of grief. But when he was importunate, and urged her to tell him what the matter was, and ſeemed to be more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when he knew it not, than he ſhould be when he knew it; then, poor Girle, ſhe told him all the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115136:83"/>
words, by which <hi>Nape</hi> incited <hi>Dryas</hi> to marry her ſpeedily; and how <hi>Dryas</hi> had not denyed it, but onely had put it off to the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> with this is at his wits end, and ſitting down he wept bitterly, and ſaid, that, if <hi>Chloe</hi> were taken from him, he would die; and not onely he, but all the flocks that loſt ſo ſweet a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe.</p>
            <p>After this paſſion <hi>Daphnis</hi> came to himſelf again, and took cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, thinking he ſhould perſwade <hi>Dryas</hi> in his own behalf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to put himſelf among the Wooers, with hope that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert would ſay for him, <hi>Room for your Betters.</hi> There was one thing troubled him worſt of all; and that was, his Father <hi>Lamo</hi> was not rich; that diſhearten'd him, that allayed his hope much. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, it ſeem'd beſt that he
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115136:83"/>
ſhould come in for a Suitor, and that was <hi>Chloe</hi>'s ſentence too. To <hi>Lamo</hi> he durſt not venture to ſpeak, but put on a good face, and ſpoke to <hi>Myrtale,</hi> and did not onely ſhew her his Love, but talk't to her of marrying the Girle; and in the night, when they were in bed, ſhe acquainted <hi>Lamo</hi> with it. But <hi>Lamo</hi> entertaining what ſhe ſaid in that caſe very harſhly, and chiding her that ſhe ſhould offer to make a match between a Shepherds daughter, and ſuch a Youth as he, whoſe monuments did declare him a great Fortune, and of high extraction; and one, that if his true Parents were found, would not only make them free, but poſſeſſors of larger lands: <hi>Myrtale</hi> conſidering the power of Love, and therefore fearing, if he ſhould altogether deſpair the marriage, leſt he ſhould attempt ſomething upon his life, return'd
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115136:84"/>
him other cauſes then <hi>Lamo</hi> had, to contradict it:</p>
            <p>My Son, we are but poor, and have more need to take a Bride that does bring us ſomething, then one that will have much from us. They on the other ſide are rich, and ſuch as look for rich hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. Go thou and perſwade <hi>Chloe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and let her perſwade her Father, that he ſhall ask no great matter, and give you his conſent to marry; for on my life ſhe loves thee dearly, and had rather a thouſand times lye with a poor, and handſome man, then a rich Monkey.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Myrtale,</hi> who never hoped that <hi>Dryas</hi> would conſent to theſe things, becauſe there were ſo many rich Wooers, thought ſhe had finely excuſed to him, their refuſing of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:115136:84"/>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> knew not what to ſay againſt this, and ſo finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf far enough off from what he deſired; that which is uſual with Lovers who are beggars, that he did. With tears he lamented his condition, and again implored the help of the Nymphs. They appeared to him in the night in his ſleep, in the ſame form and habit as before; and ſhe that was eldeſt ſpoke again: Some other of the gods takes the care about the marrying of <hi>Chloe:</hi> but we ſhall furniſh thee with gifts, which will eaſily make her Father <hi>Dryas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> That Ship of the <hi>Methymnaeans,</hi> when thy Goats had eaten her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that very day was carried off by the winds far from the ſhore. That night there roſe a tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sea-wind that blew to the Land, and daſht her againſt the rocks; there ſhe periſht with all that was in her. But the waves
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115136:85"/>
caſt up a purſe, in which there are three thouſand Drachma's, and that thou ſhalt find cover'd with Ouſe hard by a dead Dolphin, near which no paſſenger comes, but turns another way as faſt as he can, deteſting the ſtench of the rotting fiſh. But do thou make haſte thither, take it, and give it <hi>Dryas.</hi> And let it ſuffice that now thou art not poor, and hereafter in time thou ſhalt be rich. This ſpoken, they paſt away together with the night. It was now day, and <hi>Daphnis</hi> leapt out of bed as full of joy as his heart could hold, and hurried his Goats before him to the field; and after he had kiſt <hi>Chloe,</hi> and adored the Nymphs, to the Sea he goes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as if that morning he had a mind to bedew himſelf with Sea-water. And walking there upon the gravell near the line of the excurſion and breaking of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115136:85"/>
waves, he lookt for his three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Drachma's. But ſoon he found he ſhould not be put to much labour. For the ſtench of the Dolphin had reacht him, as he lay caſt up, and was rotting upon the ſlabby ſand. When he had got that ſent for his guide, he came up preſently to the place, and removing the ouſe, found the purſe full of ſilver. He took it up, and put it into his Scrip, yet went not away till with joyfull devotion he had bleſt the Nymphs and the Sea, For though he was a keeper of Goats, yet he was now obliged to the Sea, and had a ſweeter ſenſe of that, then the Land, becauſe it had promoted him to marry <hi>Chloe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having got his three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Drachma's, he made no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtay; but, as if now, he were not onely richer then any of the Colones that dwelt there, but then
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115136:86"/>
any man that trod on the ground, he haſtens to <hi>Chloe,</hi> tells her his dream, ſhews her the purſe, and bids her look to his flocks till he comes again.</p>
            <p>Then ſtretching and ſtritting along, he buſles in like a Lord upon <hi>Dryas,</hi> whom he then found with <hi>Nape</hi> at the threſhing-floor, and on a ſuddain talkt very boldly about the marrying of <hi>Chloe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Give me</hi> Chloe <hi>to my Wife. For I can play finely on the Pipe, I can cut the Vines, and I can plant them. Nor am I ignorant how, and when the ground is to be ploughed, or how the Corn is to be winnowed and fanned by the wind. But how I keep and govern flocks,</hi> Chloe <hi>can tell. Fifty She-goats I had of my Father</hi> Lamo; <hi>I have made them as many more, and doubled the number <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Beſides, I have brought up goodly, proper He-goats; whereas before we went for leaps to</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:115136:86"/>
               <hi>other men's. Moreover, I am a young man, your neighbour too, and one that you cannot twit in the teeth with any thing. And further, I had a Goat to my Nurſe, as your</hi>Chloe <hi>had a Sheep. Since in theſe I have got the ſtart, and out gone others, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in gifts ſhall I be any whit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. They may give you the ſcrag end of a ſmall flock of Sheep and Goats, a raſcal pair of Oxen, and ſo much Corn as ſcant will ſerve to keep the Hens. But from me, look you here, three Thouſand Drachma's. Onely let no body know of this, no not ſo much as my Father</hi> Lamo.</p>
            <p>With that he gave it into his hand, embraced <hi>Dryas,</hi> and kiſt him.</p>
            <p>They when they ſaw ſuch an unexpected lump of money, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay promiſed him <hi>Chloe,</hi> and to procute <hi>Lamo</hi>'s conſent. <hi>Nape</hi> therefore ſtayed there with <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> and drove her Oxen about the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115136:87"/>
floor, to break the ears very ſmall, and ſlip out the grain, with her hurdle ſet with ſharp ſtones. But <hi>Dryas</hi> having carefully laid up his purſe of ſilver in that place where the monuments of <hi>Chloe</hi> were kept, makes away preſently to <hi>Lamo</hi> and <hi>Myrtale,</hi> to wooe them for the new Bridegroom. Them he found a meaſuring barley newly fanned, and much dejected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that year the ground had ſcarcely reſtored them their ſeed. <hi>Dryas</hi> put in to comfort them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that, affirming it was a Common Cauſe, and that every where he met with the ſame cry; and then asks their good will, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> by all means ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Chloe,</hi> and told them withall, that although others did offer him great matters, yet of them he would take nothing; nay, rather he would give them ſomewhat for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:115136:87"/>For they had bin bred up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by keeping their flocks together in the fields, were grown to ſo dear a Love, as was not eaſie to be diſſolved: and now, they were of ſuch an age, as ſayes they may go to bed together. This ſaid <hi>Dryas,</hi> and much more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for the fee of his oratory to the marriage, he had at home three thouſand Drachma's. And now <hi>Lamo</hi> could no longer obtend poverty: for they did not diſdain his lowneſſe, nor yet <hi>Daphnis</hi> his age; for he was come to his flowery youth. That indeed which troubled him, and yet he would not ſay ſo, was this, namely, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> was of higher merit then ſuch a match could ſuit withall. But after a ſhort ſilence, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd him this anſwer:</p>
            <p>You do well to prefer your neighbours to ſtrangers, and not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115136:88"/>
to eſteem riches better then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt poverty. <hi>Pan,</hi> and the Nymphs be good to you for this. And I for my part do not at all hinder the marriage. It were madneſſe in me, who am now ancient, and want many hands to my daily work, if I ſhould not joyn to me the friendſhip and alliance of your family. Oh how great and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable a Good is that! Beſides, <hi>Chloe</hi> is ſought after by very many, a fair Maid, and altogether of honeſt manners and behaviour. But becauſe I am onely a Servanr, and not the Lord of any thing I have: it is neceſſary my Lord and Maſter ſhould be acquainted with this, that he may give his conſent to it. Go to then, let us agree, to put off the Wedding till the next Autumne. Thoſe that uſe to come from the City to us, tell us that he will then be here. Then they ſhall be man and Wife, and in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115136:88"/>
the mean time let them love like Siſter and Brother. Yet know this <hi>Dryas:</hi> The young man thou art in ſuch haſte and earneſt about, is far better then us.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Lamo</hi> having thus ſpoke, embraced <hi>Dryas,</hi> and kiſt him, and made him ſit and drink with him, when now it was hot at high noon, and going along with him part of his way, treated him alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether kindly. But <hi>Dryas</hi> had not heard the laſt words of <hi>Lamo</hi> only as chat, and therefore as he walkt along, he anxiouſly enquired of himſelf who <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſhould be. He was ſuckled indeed and nurſt up by a Goat, as if the providence of the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> had appointed it ſo. But he <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a ſweet, and beautifull aſpect, and no whit like either that flat-noſed old fellow, or the muſty old woman. He had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides three thouſand drachma's, and one would ſcarcely believe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115136:89"/>
that a Goat-herd ſhould have ſo many Pears in his poſſeſſion. And has ſome-body expoſed him too, as well as <hi>Chloe?</hi> And was it <hi>Lamo</hi>'s fortune to find him, as it was mine to find her? And was he trimm'd up with ſuch like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, as were found by me? If this be ſo, O mighty <hi>Pan,</hi> Oye beloved Nymphs; it may be that he having found his own Parents, may find out ſomething of <hi>Chloe</hi>'s too, who are ſo utterly unknown!</p>
            <p>Theſe moping thoughts he had in his mind, and was in a dream up to the floar. When he came there, he found <hi>Daphnis</hi> expecting, and pricking up his ears for <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi>'s anſwer;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hail Son</hi> (quoth he) <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115136:89"/>
body but <hi>Daphnis.</hi> Therefore without eating or drinking, ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thought he flyes to <hi>Chloe,</hi> and full of joy brings her the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the Marriage, and preſently began to kiſſe her, not as before by ſtealth in a corner of the twilight, but as his Wife, and took upon him part of her labour. He helpt her about the milking-paile; he put her Cheeſes into the preſſe; ſuckled the Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, and the Kids. And when all was done, they waſht themſelves, eat and drank, and went to look for mellow fruits. And at that time there was huge plenty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the ſeaſon for almoſt all. There were abundance of Pears, abundance of Apples. Some were now fallen to the ground, ſome were hanging on the Trees. Thoſe on the ground had a ſweeter ſent; thoſe on the boughes a ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bluſh. Thoſe had the fragrancy
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115136:90"/>
of wine; theſe had the flagrancy of Gold. There ſtood one Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree that had all its apples pull'd, all the boughes were now bare, and they had neither fruit, nor leaves, but onely there was one Apple that hang'd as if it were poiſed upon the very top of the Spire of the Tree; a great one it was, and very beautifull, and ſuch as by its rare, and rich ſmell, would alone out-do many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It ſhould ſeem, that he that gather'd the reſt was afraid to climb ſo high, and therefore left it. And peradventure that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent apple was reſerved for a Shepherd that was in Love. When <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſaw it, he mantled to be at it, and was even wild to climb the tree; nor would he hear <hi>Chloe</hi> forbidding him: but ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her interdictions neglected, ſcutled away towards the flocks. <hi>Daphnis</hi> got up into the tree, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115136:90"/>
coming to the place, pulled it in <hi>Chloe</hi>'s name, for <hi>Chloe;</hi> to whom, as ſhe ſhewed her anger againſt that adventure, he thus ſpoke:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sweet Maid, The fair Houres planted this Apple, and a Goodly tree brought it up; it was ripened by the beams of the Sun, and preſerved by the care and kindneſſe of Fortune. Nor might I let it alone, ſo long as I had theſe eyes, leſt if it ſhould fall to the ground, ſome of the Cattell as they feed, ſhould tread upon it, or ſome poiſonous Serpent ſhould touch it, or time ſhould ſpoil it as it lay, when I had ſeen it, ripe, and fair!</hi> Venus <hi>for the Victory of her beauty, carried away no other prize; I give Thee This the palmary of Thyne. For thou haſt as well as ſhe, ſuch witneſſes to thy beauty.</hi> Paris <hi>was but a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd upon</hi> Ida; <hi>and I am a Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd in the happy fields of of</hi> Mity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene. With that, he put it into
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115136:91"/>
her boſome, and <hi>Chloe</hi> pulling him to her, kiſt him. And ſo <hi>Daphnis</hi> repented him not of that boldneſſe to climb ſo high a tree. For he received a Kiſſe from her more pretious then a Golden Apple.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> Fellow-ſervant of <hi>Lamo's</hi> brings word, that their Lord would be there ſpeedily. A pleaſant Garden is pleaſantly deſcribed. <hi>Lamo, Daphnis,</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> make all things fine. <hi>Lampis</hi> the Herdſman ſpoiles the Garden, to provoke the Lord againſt <hi>Lamo,</hi> who had denyed him <hi>Chloe</hi> in Marriage. <hi>Lamo</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it the next day. <hi>Eudromus</hi> teaches him how he may eſcape the anger. <hi>Aſtylus</hi> their young Maſter comes firſt, with <hi>Gnatho</hi> his Paraſite. <hi>Aſtylus</hi> promiſes to excuſe them for the Garden, and procure their pardon from his Father. <hi>Gnatho</hi> falls in love with <hi>Daphnis,</hi> offers to force him, but in vain. <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> the Lord, with his Wife <hi>Cleariſta</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:115136:92"/>
comes down. Amongſt other things, ſees the Goats.

Lamo</hi> thinking it was now time, tells <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> the whole ſtory, how <hi>Daphnis</hi> was found, how brought up. He and <hi>Cleariſta</hi> conſidering the thing carefully, they find that <hi>Daphnis</hi> is their Sonne. Therefore they receive him with great joy, and <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> tells the reaſon why he expoſed him. The Countrey fellowes come in to gratulate. <hi>Chloe</hi> in the interim complains that <hi>Daphnis</hi> has forgot her. She's ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and carried away by <hi>Lampis.

            <p>ANd now one of <hi>Lamo's</hi> fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervants brought word from <hi>Mitylene,</hi> that their Lord would come towards the Vintage, to ſee whether that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the <hi>Methymnaeans</hi> had made any waſte in thoſe fields. When therefore the Summer was now parting away, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne approaching, <hi>Lamo</hi> beſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf to fit a manſion for his Lord, that ſhould preſent him with pleaſure every where. He ſcowred the Fountains, that the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115136:94"/>
water might be clear and tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. He muckt the Cottage, leſt the dung ſhould offend him with the ſmell. The Garden he trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with great care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that all might be pleaſant, freſh, and fair. And that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den indeed was a moſt beautifull and goodly thing, and ſuch as might become even a Royall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; for it lay extended in length a whole Stadium. It was ſituate on a high ground, and had to its breadth, four Acres. To a ſpacious field one would eaſily have likened it. Trees it had of all kinds; the Apple, the Pear, the Myrtle, the Orenge, the Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the Figg, and the Olive: and to theſe, on the other ſide, there grew a rare, and taller ſort of Vines, that bended over, and reclin'd their bunches of grapes among the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Pomgranats, as if they would vie and contend for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115136:94"/>
and worth of fruits with them. So many kinds there were of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; or of ſuch as are planted, grafted, or ſet. To theſe were not wanting the Cypreſſe, the Laurel, the Platan, and the Pine. And towards them, inſtead of the Vine, the Ivie lean'd; and with the Errantry of her boughes, and her ſcatter'd black berries, did imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Vines, and, ſhadowed beauty of the ripened grapes. Within, as in a Garriſon, Trees of lower growth that bore fruit; thickets of various ſhrubs, with their delicate, and fragrant ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were kept. Without, ſtood the barren Trees, enfolding all, much like a Fort, or ſome ſtrong Vall, that had bin built by the hand of Art. And theſe were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with a ſpruce, thin hedge. By alleyes, and glades, there was every where a juſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtermination of things from
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115136:95"/>
things, an orderly diſcretion of Tree from Tree. But on the Tops the boughes met, to interweave their limbs and leaves with one anothers. And a man would have thought, that all this had not bin, as indeed it was, the wild of Nature, but rather the work of curious Art. Nor were there wanting to theſe, borders and banks of various flowers; ſome the Earth's own Voluntiers; ſome the ſtructure of the Artiſt's hand. The Roſes, Hyacinths, and Lillies, were ſet, and planted by the hand: The Violet, the Daffodill, and Anagall, the Earth gave up of her own good will. In the Summer there was ſhade; in the Spring, the beauty and fragrancy of flowers; in the Autumne, the pleaſantneſſe of the grapes; and every ſeaſon had its fruits. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, from the high ground there was a fair and pleaſing proſpect to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115136:95"/>
the fields, the Herdſmen, the Shepherds, and the Cattell feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the ſame too lookt to the Sea, and ſaw all the Boats and Pinnaces a ſailing by: inſomuch, that that was no ſmall addition to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this moſt ſweet and florid place,</p>
            <p>In the midſt of this Paradiſe to the poſiture of the length and breadth of the ground, ſtood a Phane, and an Altar ſacred to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the Lord and Genius of the place. About the <hi>Bomos,</hi> or Altar, grew the wandring, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circling, clinging, Ivie; about the Phane, the palmits of the Vines did ſpread themſelves. And in the more inward part of the Phane, were certain pictures that told the ſtory of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and his miracles: <hi>Semele</hi> bringing forth her babe: The fair <hi>Ariadne</hi> laid faſt aſleep: <hi>Lycurgus</hi> bound in chains: wretched <hi>Pentheus</hi> torn limb from

limb: The <hi>Indians</hi> conquer'd; The <hi>Tyrrhenian</hi> Marriners trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: Satyrs, and dancing <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chae,</hi> all about. Nor was <hi>Pan</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in this place of pleaſure, for he was ſet up upon the top of a crag playing upon his Pipes, and ſtriking up a common Jig, to thoſe that trod the grapes in the preſſe, and the women that danc't about it. Therefore in ſuch a Garden as this that all might be fine, <hi>Lamo</hi> now was very buſie, cutting and pruning what was wither'd, and dry, and propping up the Palmits with his forks. <hi>Bacchus</hi> he had crown'd with flowery chaplets; &amp; then brought down, with curious art, rills of water from the Fountains, amongſt the borders and the knots. There was a ſpring, one that <hi>Daphnis</hi> firſt diſcovered, and that ſerved rarely to this purpoſe of watering the flowers, and in favour to him, it
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115136:96"/>
was alwayes called <hi>Daphnis</hi> his Fountain. But <hi>Lamo</hi> beſides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Daphnis</hi> to uſe his beſt skill to have his Goats as fat as might be; for their Lord would be ſure to ſee them too, who now would come into the Countrey after he had bin ſo long away. And <hi>Daphnis</hi> had a good mind to it, becauſe he thought he ſhould be lookt upon, and praiſed for them. For he had doubled the number he had received of <hi>Lamo,</hi> nor had the Wolf raven'd away ſo much as one, and they were all more twadding fat then the very ſheep.</p>
            <p>And becauſe he would win up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord to be more forward to approve and confirm the match, he did his buſineſſe with great diligence, and great alacrity: he drove out his Goats betimes in the morning; and late in the evening brought them home;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115136:97"/>
twice a day he water'd them, and culled out for them the beſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ground; he took care too to have the dairy-veſſels new, good ſtore of milking-pales and pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and fairer Crates, or preſſes for the Cheeſe. He was ſo far from being negligent in any thing, that he tryed to make their horns to ſhine with vernich, and comb'd their very ſhag to make them ſleek. Inſomuch, as, if you had ſeen this, you had ſaid it was <hi>Pan</hi>'s own ſacred flock. <hi>Chloe</hi> her ſelf too would take her ſhare in this labour about the Goats; and <hi>Daphnis</hi> thought 'twas <hi>Chloe</hi>'s hand, and <hi>Chloe</hi>'s eyes that made his flocks appear ſo fair. While both of them are thus buſied, there came another Meſſenger from the City, and brought a command, that the grapes ſhould be gather'd with all ſpeed: and told them withall, he was to tarry with them
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115136:97"/>
there till the Muſt was made, and then return to the Town to wait upon his Lord thither, the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of that Autumne now done. This <hi>Eudromus</hi> (for that was his name, becauſe he was a Foot-Page) they all received and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with great kindneſſe, and preſently began the vintage; the grapes were gathered, caſt into the preſſe; the Muſt made, and tunned into the Veſſels; ſome of the faireſt bunches of the grapes, together with their branches were cut, that to thoſe who came from the City, a ſhew of the vintage, and the pleaſure of it, might ſtill remain.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Eudromus</hi> made haſte to be gone, and return to the Town, and <hi>Daphnis</hi> gave him great variety of pretty gifts, but ſpecially what ever could be had from his flock of Goats: Cheeſes that were cloſe preſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a kid of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115136:98"/>
the late fall, with a Goat-skin white, and thick ſhagg'd, to fling about him when he ran in the winter.</p>
            <p>With this, <hi>Eudromus</hi> was very pleaſantly affected, and kiſt <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> and told him that he would ſpeak a good word for him to his Maſter; and ſo went away with a benevolent mind to them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Daphnis</hi> then ſoon after was full of anxious thoughts, and <hi>Chloe</hi> too not free from fear: namely, that a Lad that had bin uſed to ſee nothing but Goats, Mountains, Ploughmen, and <hi>Chloe,</hi> ſhould then firſt be brought into the preſence of his Lord, of whom before he had heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but onely his name. For <hi>Daphnis</hi> therefore ſhe was very ſollicitous, how he would come before his Maſter, how he would behave himſelf, how the baſhfull Youth would ſalute him. About
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115136:98"/>
the marriage too ſhe was much troubled, fearing leſt they might but only dream of a meer chance, or nothing at all. Therefore kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes paſt between them without number, and ſuch embracings of one another, as if both of them were grown into one piece: but thoſe kiſſes were full of fear; thoſe embraces very penſive, as of them that fear'd their Lord as then there, or kiſt, and clipt, in hugger-mugger to him.</p>
            <p>Moreover, then there aroſe to them ſuch a diſtraction as this: There was one <hi>Lampis</hi> an unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, bluſtering, fierce Herdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And he amongſt the reſt had wooed <hi>Dryas</hi> for <hi>Chloe,</hi> and given him many gifts too to bring on, and diſpatch the marriage. But perceiving, that if their Lord did not diſlike it, <hi>Daphnis</hi> was to have the Girle; he ſets himſelf to find, and practiſe a cunning trick,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115136:99"/>
to enrage and alienate their Lord. And knowing that he was wonderfully pleas'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with that Garden, he thought it beſt, to ſpoyl that as much as he could, and deveſt it of all its beauty. To cut the Trees he durſt not attempt, leſt ſo he ſhould be taken by the noyſe. Wherefore he thinks to ruine the flowers; and when 'twas night, gets over the hedge, and ſome he pull'd up by the roots, of ſome he graſpt and tore the ſtems, the reſt he trod down like a Boare, and ſo eſcap't unheard, unſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lamo</hi> the next morning went into the Garden to water the flowers. But when he ſaw what the miſchievous rogue his enemy had done, and all the place now made a waſte, he rent his clothes, and call'd ſo loud upon the gods, that <hi>Myrtale</hi> left all, and ran up thither; and <hi>Daphnis</hi> too, who
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115136:99"/>
now had driven out his Goats, ran back again. When they ſaw it, they cryed out, lamented, and wept. To grieve for the flowers it was in vain: but alas, their Lord they feard.</p>
            <p>And indeed, a meer ſtranger had he come there, might very well have wept with them. For all the <hi>Venus</hi> of the place was gone, and nothing remain'd but a lutulent ſoil: If any flower had eſcap't, it had yet, as it was then, a half-hid floridneſſe, and its glance; and ſtill was fair, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though 'twas laid. And ſtill the Bees ſate thick upon them, and all along in a mourning murmur, ſang the Funerall of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lamo</hi> out of his great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation broke forth into theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:115136:100"/>
               <hi>Alas, alas, the Roſaries, how are they broken down and torn! Woe is me, the Violaries, how are they ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and trodden down! Ah me, the Hyacinths and Daffodills, which ſome Villain has pulled up, the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all mortalls! The Spring will come, but theſe will not grow green again: it will be Summer, and theſe will not blow: the Autumne will come, but theſe will give no Chaplets for our heads. And didſt not thou</hi> Bacchus, <hi>Lord of the Garden, pity the ſuffering of theſe flowers, among which thou dwelleſt, upon which thou lookeſt, and with which I have crown'd thee ſo often. How ſhall I now ſhew this Garden to my Lord? What a Look will he give it? how will he take it? He will hang me up for an old Rogue, like</hi> Marſyas <hi>upon a Pine! and perchance, poor</hi> Daphnis <hi>too, thinking his Goats has done the deed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:115136:100"/>With theſe there fell more ſcalding tears, for now they wept, not for the flowers, but Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And <hi>Chloe</hi> bewail'd poor <hi>Daphnis</hi> his caſe, and wiſht their Lord might never come, ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her dayes in miſery, as if even then ſhe lookt upon her ſweet <hi>Daphnis</hi> under the whip.</p>
            <p>But towards night, <hi>Eudromus</hi> came and brought them word, that their Lord would come within three dayes, and that their young Maſter would be there to morrow. Therefore about what had befallen them, they fell to deliberate, and took in good <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromus</hi> into their Council.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Eudromus</hi> was altogether <hi>Daphnis</hi> his friend, and he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they ſhould firſt open the chance to their young Lord, and promiſed himſelf an Aſſiſtant too, as one of ſome accompt with him;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115136:101"/>
for <hi>Aſtylus</hi> was nurſt with his milk, and he look't upon as a foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brother; and ſo they did, the next day. <hi>Aſtylus</hi> came on horſeback, his Paraſite with him, and he on horſeback too. <hi>Aſtylus</hi> was now of the firſt doune, but his <hi>Gnatho,</hi> that was his name, had ſometimes tryed the Barbers tooles.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lamo</hi> taking <hi>Myrtale</hi> and <hi>Daphnis</hi> with him, and flinging himſelf at the feet of <hi>Aſtylus,</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeecht him to have mercy on an unfortunate old man, and ſave him from his fathers anger, one that was not in the fault, one that had done nothing amiſſe: and then told him what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſtylus</hi> had pity on the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuppliant, and went with him to the Garden, and having ſeen the deſtruction of it as to flowers, he promiſed to procure them his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115136:101"/>
Fathers pardon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lay the fault on the fiery horſes that were tyed thereabouts, boggled at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and broke their bridles; and ſo it happened, that almoſt all the flowers every where were trodden down, broken, and torn, and flunder'd up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lamo</hi> return'd him the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of wretched men relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and <hi>Myrtale</hi> prayed the gods would proſper him in every thing.</p>
            <p>Soon after young <hi>Daphnis</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with things made ready to that purpoſe, young Kids, Cream-Cheeſes, a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous brood of Hen-and-Chickens, bunches of Grapes hanging ſtill upon their palmits, and apples on the boughes. And amongſt them, a Crater of the <hi>Lesbian</hi> wine, fragrant wine, and the moſt excellent of drinks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:115136:102"/>
               <hi>Aſtylus</hi> commended their obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and entertainment, and went a hunting, for he was rich, and given to pleaſure, and therefore came to take it abroad in thoſe fields.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Gnatho,</hi> a man that had learnt onely to guttle, and drink till he was drunk, and minded nothing but his belly, and his laſciviouſneſſe under that, he had taken a more curious view of <hi>Daphnis</hi> then others had, when he preſented the gifts. And becauſe from the beginning he was ſtruck with <hi>Paederaſtie</hi> (the Love of boys) by the Terreſtriall gods, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to be ſuch a beauty as all <hi>Mitylene</hi> could not ſhew; he reſolved to tempt <hi>Daphnis</hi> to the purpoſe, and thought he had not much to do, becauſe the Lad was but a Goat-herd.</p>
            <p>When he had now thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115136:102"/>
with himſelf, he went not along with <hi>Aſtylus</hi> a hunting: but going down into the field where <hi>Daphnis</hi> kept, he ſaid he came to ſee the Goats, but came indeed Spectator of the Youth. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to palpe him with ſoft words, praiſed his Goats, call'd fondly on him for a Paſtoral Tune, and ſaid withall he would ſpeedily impetrate his Liberty for him, as being able to do what he would with his Lord. And when he had found the harmleſſe boy obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to him, when it was now grown ſomewhat dark, and <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> was to drive home, he watcht his time, and anon he ran at him, and lolled upon him; and when he had kiſt him o're and o're: he ſhuffled himſelf odly-behind him, as if he meant to attempt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the he-goats with the She's.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Daphnis</hi> at length percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115136:103"/>
it, and ſaying; That the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goats rid the ſhees, That was very right indeed: but that a he-goat rid a he, that was never yet ſeen; nor the Rams, inſtead of the Ewes, to ride Rams; nor Cocks tread Cocks inſtead of Hens: <hi>Gnatho</hi> then laid hands on him, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to force him. But <hi>Daphnis</hi> flung off this drunken Sott, who ſcarce could ſtand upon his leggs, and laid him on the ground, then whipt away, and left him to ſome ſturdy Porter, as fitter to lead, or carry him, then a boy. Nor would <hi>Daphnis</hi> endure it he ſhould near him ever after, and therefore ſtill removed his flocks, avoiding him, and keeping <hi>Chloe</hi> carefully. And indeed <hi>Gnatho</hi> did not proceed to trouble him further, for he had found him already, not onely a fair, but a ſtout boy: But he waited an occaſion to ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him to <hi>Aſtylus,</hi> hoping to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115136:103"/>
beg him of the Gallant, as one that would beſtow upon him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and better gifts then that. But it was not a time to talk of it now. For <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> was come with his Wife <hi>Cleariſta,</hi> and all about was a buſie noiſe, tumultuous pudder of carriages, and a long retinue of men-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Maids.</p>
            <p>After that he thought with himſelf to make a Speech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Daphnis,</hi> ſufficient for Love, ſufficient for Length.—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> was now half gray, but very tall and well limb'd, and able at any Exerciſe to grapple in the younger liſt: for his Riches few came near him; for honeſt Life, Juſtice, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manners, ſcant ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to be found. He when he was come, offer'd the firſt day to the preſident gods of rurall buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115136:104"/>
to <hi>Ceres, Bacchus, Pan,</hi> and the Nymphs, and ſet up a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Crater for all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The other dayes he walkt abroad to take a view of <hi>Lamo</hi>'s Works, and ſeeing how the ground was ploughed, how ſwell'd with palmits, and how trim the Vineyard was, how fair and flouriſhing the <hi>Viridarie,</hi> (for as for the flowers, <hi>Aſtylus</hi> had taken the fault upon himſelf) he was wonderfully pleaſed and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all, and when he had praiſed <hi>Lamo</hi> much, he promiſed beſides to make him free. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he went into the other fields to ſee the Goats, and him that kept them. But <hi>Chloe</hi> fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wood, for ſhe could not bear ſo ſtrong a preſence, and was afraid of ſo great a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſtood girt with a Zone from a thick ſhagg'd Goat, a new Scrip about his ſhoulders,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115136:104"/>
in one hand holding green Chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with the other leading ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Kids. If ever <hi>Apollo</hi> would be hired to ſerve <hi>Laomedon,</hi> and tend on herds, juſt ſo he lookt, as <hi>Daphnis</hi> then. He ſpoke not a word, but all on a bluſh, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes upon the ground, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the rural gifts to his Lord.—</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lamo</hi> ſpoke <hi>—Sir,</hi> (quoth he) <hi>This is the keeper of thoſe Goats. To me you committed fifty ſhee's, and two hee's; of them he has made you an hundred now, and ten he-goats. Do you ſee how plump and fat they are, how ſhaggy and rough their hair is, how intire and unſhatter'd their horns? Beſides, he has made them muſicall. For if they do but hear his Pipe, they are ready to do whatſoever he will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleariſta</hi> heard him what he ſaid, and being ſtruck with a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have it preſently tryed
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115136:105"/>
whether it were ſo indeed or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe bids <hi>Daphnis</hi> to play to his Goats as he wonted to do, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to give him for his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a Coat, a Mantle, and new ſhooes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> when all the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was fate as a Theater, went to his Beech, and ſtanding under it, drew his Pipe out of his Scrip. And firſt he blowed ſomething that was lowe, and ſmart: and preſently the Goats roſe up, and held their heads bolt upright. Then he play'd the <hi>Nomion,</hi> the Paſtorall, or the grazing Tune: and the Goats caſt their heads downwards to graze. Then again he breathed a note was ſoft and ſweet: and all lay down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reſt. Anon he ſtruck up a ſharp, violent, tumultuous Sound, (the warning of the Wolf) and they all ruſht into the wood, as if the Wolf had come upon
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115136:105"/>
them. After a while he pip't aloud the <hi>Anacletic,</hi> or <hi>Recall:</hi> and they wheel'd out of the Wood again, and came up to his very feet: never was there any Maſter of a houſe that had his ſervants more obſequious to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.—</p>
            <p>All the Spectators admired his Art, but eſpecially <hi>Cleariſta,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſhe could not but ſwear ſhe would give him the things ſhe promiſed, who was ſo fair a Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and skill'd in Muſick even to wonder.</p>
            <p>From this pleaſure they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Village to dine, and ſent <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſome of their choiſer fare to the fields; where he feaſted himſelf with <hi>Chloe,</hi> and was ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with thoſe delicates and confections from the City, and hoped he had pleaſed his Lord and Lady ſo, that now he ſhould not miſſe the Maid. But
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115136:106"/>
               <hi>Gnatho</hi> now was more inflam'd with thoſe things about the Goats, and counting his life no life at all, unleſſe he had <hi>Daphnis</hi> at his will, he catcht <hi>Aſtylus</hi> walking in the Garden, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with him into <hi>Bacchus</hi> his Phane, he fell to kiſſe his hands and his feet. But he enquiring why he did ſo; and bidding him tell what was the matter with him; and ſwearing withall, to hear and help him in any thing: Maſter, thy <hi>Gnatho</hi> is undone (quoth he:) For I who heretofore was in Love with nothing but a plenteous Table; and ſwore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more deſireable, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a more pretious Tang, then good old wine; I that have often affirmed, That thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioners and Cooks, were ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the boyes of <hi>Mitylene;</hi> I ſhall now hereafter for ever think, that nothing is fair and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115136:106"/>
ſweet but <hi>Daphnis;</hi> and giving over to feed high, as thou art fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht every day with fleſh, with fiſh, with banquetting; nothing could be more pleaſant to me, then to be turned into a Goat, to eat graſſe, and green leaves, hear <hi>Daphnis</hi> his pipe, and be fed at his hand. But do thou preſerve thy <hi>Gnatho,</hi> and be to him the victor of victorious Love. Unleſs it be done, I ſwear to thee by my god, that when I have fill'd my paunch with meat, I'le take this dagger, and kill my ſelf at <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> his door. And then you may go look your little pretty <hi>Gnatho,</hi> as thou uſeſt daily to call me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſtylus</hi> a generous Youth, and one that was not to learn that Love was a tormentous fire, could not endure to ſee him weep in ſuch a manner, and kiſſe his feet again and again; but promiſed him to beg <hi>Daphnis</hi> of his Father, to wait
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115136:107"/>
upon him at <hi>Mitylene,</hi> and ſo to become <hi>Gnatho</hi>'s Pathic-boy. But to pleaſe himſelf, and hearten up <hi>Gnatho,</hi> he ſmiled upon him, and askt him, Whether he were not aſham'd to be in love with <hi>Lamo</hi>'s Son, nay, to be mad to lye with a boy that kept Goats? Beſides, he thought the ſtrong perfume of Goats was ſomewhat abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gnatho</hi> on the other ſide, like one that had learn't the wanton diſcourſe among good fellowes in the drinking Schooles, was ready to anſwer him better then <hi>ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> concerning himſelf, and <hi>Daphnis</hi>—thus: We Lovers (Sir) are never curious about ſuch things as thoſe: but whereſoever we meet with beauty, there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly we are catcht, and fall upon it. And hence it is that ſome have fallen in Love with a Tree, ſome with a River, ſome with a Beaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:115136:107"/>And who would not pity that miſerable Lover, whom we know fatally bound, to live in fear of that that's loved! But I, as I love the body of a ſervant, ſo in that, the beauty of the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous. Do you not ſee his Locks are like the Hyacinths! and his eyes under the browes, like Diamonds burning, in their golden Sockets! How ſweetly ruddy are his cheeks, his lips ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and his mouth rowed with Elephant pearl! And what Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would not be fond to take from thence, the ſweeteſt red and white kiſſes? But if I love a kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of flocks, in that I imitate the gods! <hi>Anchiſes</hi> was a Herdſman, and <hi>Venus</hi> had him. <hi>Branchius</hi> was a Goat-herd, and <hi>Apollo</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him. <hi>Ganymedes</hi> was but a Shepherd; and yet he was <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s rape. We ought not then to contemn the Youth, becauſe he is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115136:108"/>
a keeper of Goats, to whom, we ſee even the Goats, for very love of one ſo fair, every way obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; nay rather, that They let ſuch a beauty as that, continue here upon the Earth, we owe our thanks to <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Eagles. At that word <hi>Aſtylus</hi> had a ſweet laugh, and ſaying, <hi>Oh what migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sophiſters this Love can make</hi> I began to caſt about for a fit time to ſpeak to his Father about <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eudromus</hi> hearken'd what was ſaid, and catcht the Secret; and deteſting in himſelf that ſuch a flower of beauty ſhould be put into the hands of a filthy fellow, be told both <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Lamo</hi> all that happen'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> was ſtruck to the heart with this, and ſoon reſolved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to run away, and <hi>Chloe</hi> with him; or elſe to die, and take her with him to the <hi>Elyſian</hi> fields.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:115136:108"/>But <hi>Lamo</hi> getting <hi>Myrtale</hi> out of doores, What ſhall we do, (quoth he) we are all undone? Now or never is our time to open all that hitherto has bin concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; namely, the lone, forſaken place; the Goat, and all the other Things. For, by <hi>Pan,</hi> and all the Nymphs, though I ſhould be left alone to my ſelf, like an Ox for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in a ſtall, I will not longer hide his ſtory; but declare I found him an Expoſed Child, make it known how he was nurſt, and ſhew the Significations found expoſed together with him. And let that rotten raſcal <hi>Gnatho</hi> know himſelf, and what it is he dares to love. Onely make ready the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents for me!</p>
            <p>This agreed, they went again into the houſe. But <hi>Aſtylus,</hi> his father being at leiſure, went to him, and askt his leave to take <hi>Daphnis</hi> from the Countrey to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115136:109"/>
ſerve him at <hi>Mitylene;</hi> for he was a fine boy, far above the clowniſh Life, and one that <hi>Gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> ſoon could teach the City<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garbe. His Father grants it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and preſently ſending for <hi>Lamo</hi> and <hi>Myrtale,</hi> lets them know, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after wait upon <hi>Aſtylus</hi> in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and leave his keeping Goats. But then inſtead of him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give them two Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds.</p>
            <p>And now when <hi>Lamo</hi> ſaw the Servants running together, and hugge one another for joy they were to have ſo ſweet a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant in the houſe, he askt leave to ſpeak to his Lord, and thus began:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hear me, Sir, a true ſtory, that an old man is about to tell you. And I ſwear by</hi> Pan <hi>and the Nymphs that I will not lie a jott. I am not the</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:115136:109"/>
               <hi>Father of</hi> Daphnis, <hi>nor was</hi> Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale <hi>ſo happy, as to be the Mother of ſo ſweet a Youth. Other Parents expoſed that Child, having (perchance) enow before. But I found him where he was laid, and ſuckled by a Goat of mine; which Goat when ſhe died, I buried in yonder skirt of the Garden, to uſe her kindly, becauſe ſhe had plaid the part of a Mother. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him I found habiliments expoſed, and ſigns (me thought) of what he was. I confeſſe them to you (Sir) and have kept them to this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For they make him of higher fortune, than ours has any ſymbol to: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think not much he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Servant of the noble</hi> Aſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, <hi>a good Servant of a good and honeſt Lord. But I cannot endure to have him now expoſed to be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and baſely uſed by the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Glutton</hi> Gnatho; <hi>and, as it were, be made a ſlave to ſuch a dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell. Who now would have him to</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:115136:110"/>
Mitylene, <hi>there to make a Wench of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lamo</hi> when he had thus ſaid, held his peace, and wept amain. But <hi>Gnatho</hi> being enraged by this, and threatening to cudgell <hi>Lamo, Dionyſophanes</hi> was wholly amazed at what was ſaid, and commanded him Silence, bending his browes, and looking ſtern and grim upon him; then again queſtion'd <hi>Lamo,</hi> charging him to ſpeak the Truth, and tell him no ſuch Tales as thoſe, to keep his Son at home by them.</p>
            <p>But when he ſtood to what he ſaid, and ſwore to it by all the gods, and would ſubmit to any Torture, if he did lie but in the leaſt; he examin'd every paſſage over again, <hi>Cleariſta</hi> ſitting apart. What cauſe is there that <hi>Lamo</hi> ſhould lie, when for One, he is to have two Goat-herds? And how ſhould a ſimple Countrey-fellow
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115136:110"/>
feign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and forge ſuch things as theſe? No ſure; beſides, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that of ſuch an old Churle, and ſuch an Urch in as his Wife, there ſhould come a child ſo fair! And now it ſeem'd beſt to inſiſt no longer upon conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, but to view the monumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and try if they reported any thing of a more noble ſplendid fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Myrtale</hi> therefore went and brought them all to him, laid up ſafe in an old Scrip. <hi>Dionyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> lookt firſt, and ſeeing there the Purple Mantle, the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>button, the Dagger with the Ivory heft, he cryed out loud, <hi>Great Jupiter the Governour!</hi> and call'd his Wife that ſhe might ſee. She too, when ſhe ſaw them, cryed out amain, <hi>O dear, dear Fates! Are not theſe thoſe very Things we expoſed with our Son? Did we not ſend</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroſyne <hi>to lay him here in theſe</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:115136:111"/>
               <hi>fields? They are no other, but the very ſame, my dear! This is our Child without doubt.</hi> Daphnis <hi>is thy Son, and he has kept his Fathers Goats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While <hi>Cleariſta</hi> was yet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> was kiſſing thoſe ſweet revelations of his Child, and weeping over them for joy, <hi>Aſtylus</hi> hearing it was his Brother, flings off his Cloak, and o're the Green away he flies, in an earneſt deſire to be the firſt to entertain him with a kiſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſeeing him make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him ſo faſt with ſuch a Company, and hearing his own name in the noiſe, thinking they came to apprehend him, flung away his Scrip and his Pipe, and in the ſcare ſet a running towards the Sea to caſt himſelf from a high Crag.</p>
            <p>And peradventure the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Daphnis</hi> had then bin loſt,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115136:111"/>
but that <hi>Aſtylus</hi> perceiving it, cryed out to him more clearly: <hi>Stay</hi> Daphnis; <hi>Be not afraid, I am thy Brother, and They thy Parents, that were hitherto thy Lords. Now</hi> Lamo <hi>has told Us all concerning the Goat, and ſhewed the monuments thou hadſt about thee. Turn thee, and ſee with what a rejoycing, chearful face they come along. But do thou kiſſe me firſt of all. By the Nymphs I do not lie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that Oath he ventured to ſtand, and ſtaid till <hi>Aſtylus</hi> came at him, and then offer'd him a kiſſe.</p>
            <p>While they were kiſſing and embracing, the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany came in, the Men-ſervants, the Maids, the Father, and after him, the Mother. Every one kiſt him and hugg'd him in their arms, rejoycing, and weeping. But <hi>Daphnis</hi> embraced his Father and his Mother the moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115136:112"/>
of all the reſt, and cling'd to them, as if he had known them long before, and would not part out of their arms. So quickly comes belief to joyn with nature. An oblivion of <hi>Chloe</hi> had now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by little and little to ſteal upon him.</p>
            <p>And when they got back to the Village, they turned him out of his old clothes, and put him in a gallant habit, and placing him near his own Father, they heard him ſpeak to this purpoſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I married a Wife (my dear Sons) when I was yet very young, and after a while, as I conjectured. I ſhould, it was my happineſſe to be a Father. For firſt I had a Son born, the ſecond a daughter, and then</hi> Aſtylus <hi>the third. I thought there was enow of the breed, and therefore I expoſed this boy, who was born after the reſt, and ſet him out with thoſe Toyes, not</hi>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:115136:112"/>
               <hi>for the monuments of his Stock, but for Sepulchral ornaments. But fortune had other thoughts and Counſels about him. For ſo it was, that my eldeſt Son, and my daughter dyed on the ſame diſeaſe upon one and the ſame day. But Thou by the providence of the gods art kept alive and ſaved for Us, in deſign to make us happy by more helps and manuductors to our Age. Yet do not thou, when it comes in thy mind that thou waſt Expoſed, take it unkindly, or think evill of me; for it was not with a willing mind. Neither do Thou good</hi> Aſtylus, <hi>take it ill, that now thou art to have but a part for the whole Inheritance. For to any man that's wiſe, there is no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion more pretious then a brother is. Therefore eſteem and love one another, and for your riches, compare and vie your ſelves with Kings. For I ſhall leave you large. Lands, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Induſtrious and True, Gold and Silver, all that the fortunate poſseſſe.</hi>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:115136:113"/>
               <hi>Onely in Special I give to</hi> Daphnis, <hi>this Mannour, with</hi> Lamo, <hi>and</hi> Myrtale, <hi>and the Goats that he has kept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he was ſtill going on in his Speech, <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſtarting, <hi>'Tis well remembred, Father,</hi> (quoth he) <hi>'Tis time to go and lead my Goats to watering; They are now dry, and now expecting my Pipe; and I am loytering and lolling here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They all laught ſweetly at this, to ſee him that was now a Lord turning into a Goat-herd again; and ſo another was ſent away to rid his mind of that care. And now when they had ſacrificed to <hi>Jupiter Soter,</hi> the ſaviour of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Child, they had a jovial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceing Feaſt, and only <hi>Gnatho</hi> was not there; for he was in a mighty feare, and took ſanctuarie in <hi>Bacchus</hi> his Phane, and there he was a ſneaking ſuppliant night and day: But the fame flying abroad
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115136:113"/>
that <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> had found a Son, and that <hi>Daphnis</hi> the Goat-herd proved the Lord of thoſe fields: the ruralls came in with the early day, ſome from one place, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, there to congratulate the Youth, and bring their preſents to his Father. And amongſt theſe, <hi>Dryas</hi> was firſt; <hi>Dryas,</hi> to whom <hi>Chloe</hi> was nurſling. And <hi>Dionyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> accepting their expreſſions of Joy and exultation, made them ſtay to celebrate the great feaſt of the Invention of <hi>Daphnis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore great ſtore of Wine, and the fineſt Bread, was furniſht out; water-fowle of all ſorts; ſucking pigs; various curioſities of ſweet cakes, Wafers, Simnels, and Pies. And many Victims that day were ſlain and offer'd to the Gods of <hi>Leſbos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> then, having gott all his paſtorall furniture about him, caſt it into ſeverall Anathema's,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115136:114"/>
his thankfull Donaries to the Gods. To <hi>Bacchus,</hi> he dedicates his Scrip, and Mantle: To <hi>Pan,</hi> his Whiſtle and his oblique Pipe: his Goat-hook, to the holy Nymphs; and Milking-pailes, that he had made. But ſo it is, that thoſe things we have long been acquainted withall, and uſed our ſelves to, are more acceptable and pleaſing to us, then a new and inſolent felicity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore teares fell from his eyes at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very valediction to this and that; nor did he offer the pailes to the Nymphs, till he had milkt into them firſt; nor his Mantle, til he had lapt himſelf in it, nor his Pipe till he had pip't a tune or two But he look't wiſtly upon all the things, and would not let them goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Kiſſe. Then he ſpoke to the She-goats, and call'd the He-goats by their names. Out of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain too he needs muſt drink before
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115136:114"/>
he goes, becauſe he had drank there many a time, and with his ſweeteſt, deareſt <hi>Chloe.</hi> But as yet he did not openly profeſſe to his Love; becauſe he waited a ſeaſon to it.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the meane time, while he was keeping holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, it was thus with poore <hi>Chloe.</hi> By her flocks ſhe ſate, and wept; and complained to her ſelf, and them, (as it was like) in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>Daphnis</hi> has forgot me. Now he thinks of a Great fortune. To what purpoſe is it now, that after we had ſworn by the Nymphs, I would make him ſweare to me by the Goates? He has forſaken them and me! And when the other day, he ſacrificed to <hi>Pan,</hi> and the Nymphs, he would not ſo much as ſee <hi>Chloe.</hi> Perchance he has found a prettyer Wench then I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Mothers Maids. Fare him well! But I muſt die; and will not live.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:115136:115"/>While thus ſhe was maundring and afflicting her ſelf, <hi>Lampis</hi> the Herdsman coming upon her with a band of ruſticks, raviſht her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, preſuming <hi>Daphnis</hi> had caſt off all thoughts of <hi>Chloe,</hi> and <hi>Dryas</hi> too to gape on <hi>Daphnis.</hi> And ſo ſhe was carried away, crying out moſt pitteouſly. But one that ſaw it, told it <hi>Nape,</hi> ſhe <hi>Dryas,</hi> and <hi>Dryas Daphnis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This put <hi>Daphnis</hi> almoſt quite out of his witts; and to his Father he durſt not ſpeak, nor was he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure in that condition, and therefore ſlinking away into the circuit walkes of the Garden, broke forth into lamentations.</p>
            <p>Oh the bitter Invention of <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis!</hi> How much better was it for me to keep a flock? And how much happyer was I when I was a Servant? Then I fed my eyes with <hi>Chloe.</hi> But now ſhe is the rape of <hi>Lampis,</hi> and with him ſhe lyes to night. And I ſtay here, and melt
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115136:115"/>
my ſelfe away in wine and ſoft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and ſo in vain have ſworne to her by the Nymphs, by <hi>Pan,</hi> and by the Goats.</p>
            <p>Theſe heavy complaints of <hi>Daphnis,</hi> it was <hi>Gnathos</hi> fortune to heare as he was ſculking in the Garden; and preſently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the happie houre, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe <hi>Daphnis,</hi> and make him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious; he takes ſome of <hi>Aſtylus</hi> his Servants, makes after <hi>Dryas;</hi> bids him ſhew him to <hi>Lampis</hi> his Cottage, and plucks up his heeles to get thither. And lighting on him in the nick as he was halling <hi>Chloe</hi> in, he took her from him, and bang'd his band of Clowns. And <hi>Lampis</hi> himſelf he endeavour'd to take, and bring him bound, as a captive from ſome Warre, but he prevented that by flight. This undertaking happily perform'd, he return'd with the night; and found <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> at his reſt; but
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115136:116"/>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> watching, weeping, and waiting in the Walks. There he preſents his <hi>Chloe</hi> to him, gives her into his hands, and tells the ſtory of the action; then beſeeches him to think no more of that injurious attempt upon him, but take him as a Servant not altogether unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and not interdict him the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to make him die for want.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſeeing <hi>Chloe,</hi> and having her now in his own hands, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled by that ſervice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him into favour; then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed himſelf to <hi>Chloe,</hi> for his ſeeming to neglect her.</p>
            <p>And now adviſing together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their intended wedding, it was, they thought, the beſt way, ſtill to conceale it, and to hide <hi>Chloe</hi> in ſome hole or other, then to acquaint his Mother only with their Love. But <hi>Dryas</hi> was not of that opinion. He would have the Father know the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115136:116"/>
as it was, and undertakes to bring him on. In the Morning betimes, with <hi>Chloe's</hi> monuments in his Scrip, he goes to <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> and <hi>Cleariſta,</hi> who were ſitting in the Garden. And <hi>Aſtylus</hi> was there preſent, and <hi>Daphnis</hi> himſelf. And, ſilence made, the old Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd thus began.</p>
            <p>Such a neceſſity as <hi>Lamo</hi> had, compells me now to ſpeak thoſe things that hitherto have bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd. This <hi>Chloe</hi> I neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, nor had any thing to do in her nurſing up. But ſome others were her Parents, and a Sheep gave her ſuck in the <hi>Nymphaeum</hi> where ſhe lay. I my ſelf ſaw it done, and wonder'd at it; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at it, took her home, and brought her up. And the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſweetneſſe of her face, bears me witneſſe to what I ſay. For ſhe is nothing like to Us. The fine accoutrements ſhe had about
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115136:117"/>
her make it more apparent too. For they are richer then becomes a Shepherds Coate. Here they are, view them well, ſeek out her kin, and ſo trie whether at length, ſhe may not be found, not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to marrie <hi>Daphnis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words as they were not unadviſedly caſt in by <hi>Dryas,</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they heard by <hi>Dionyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> without regard. But caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes upon <hi>Daphnis,</hi> and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him look pale upon it, and his teares ſtealing down his face, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently deprehended it was Love. Then as one that was bound to be more ſollicitous about his own, then another man's Child, he falls with all accurateneſſe to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what <hi>Dryas</hi> had ſaid.</p>
            <p>But when he ſaw the monitorie Ornaments; her mitre; and her mantle wrought with Gold; her curious blankets, and her gilded ſhoos, he cal'd her to him, bid herbe
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115136:117"/>
of good chear as one that now had a husband, and erelong ſhould find her Father &amp; her Mother. <hi>Cleariſta</hi> took her to her care, and from that time trickt her up and made her fine, as even then her Sons Wife.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> taking <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> aſide, askt him, if <hi>Chloe</hi> were a maid; And he ſwearing, that nothing had paſt betwixt them, but only kiſſing, embraceing, and Oathes; his Father was much delighted to heare of that prettie Conjuration by which they had bound themſelves to one another, and made them ſit down together to a banquet brought in. And then one might preſently ſee what beautie was, when it had got its proper dreſſe. For <hi>Chloe</hi> being ſo clothed, dreſt in her hair, and waſht in <hi>Cleariſta's</hi> waſh; did ſo outſhine even all beautie, that her own <hi>Daphnis</hi> now could ſcarce
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115136:118"/>
know her. And any man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the faith of monuments might now have ſworne, that <hi>Dryas</hi> was not the Father of ſo fair a maid. But he was there, and <hi>Nape,</hi> and <hi>Lamo,</hi> and <hi>Myrtale,</hi> feaſting at a private Table. And again, upon this invention of <hi>Chloe,</hi> were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molations to the Gods, and <hi>Chloe</hi> conſecrated her Trinkets; that skin ſhe uſed to weare; her Scrip; her Pipe; her Milking-pailes. She mingled Wine too with that Fountain in the Cave, becauſe cloſe by it ſhe was nurſt, and had often waſht in it. The Grave of her Nurſe ſhown to her by <hi>Dryas,</hi> ſhe adorned with many Garlands; and to her flock, plaid a little on her Pipe. Then ſhe prayes to the Goddeſſes that ſhe might find them that expoſed her to be ſuch, as would not miſ-become her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Daphnis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:115136:118"/>And now they had enough of feaſting and holy-dayes, in the fields; and would returne to <hi>Mitylene;</hi> look out <hi>Chloe's</hi> parents there, and ſpeedily have a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on't. In the morning betime when they were readie to goe, to <hi>Dryas</hi> they gave the other three thouſand drachma's: To <hi>Lamo</hi> halfe of that Land, to ſow, and mowe, and find him Wine, and Goats, together with the Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; four paire of Oxen for the Plough; Winter Clothes; and made his Wife free.</p>
            <p>Then anon with a great Pompe and a brave ſhow of Horſes and Waggons, on they moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Mitylene.</hi> And becauſe it was night before they could come in, they eſcaped the Cittizen's gapeing upon them then; but the next day; there was a throng of men and Women at the door.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115136:119"/>
Theſe to give joyes, and rejoyce with <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> who had found a Son; and their joy was much augmented when they ſaw the exceſſive ſweetneſſe of the Youth. Thoſe to exult with <hi>Cleariſta,</hi> who had brought home not only a Son, but a Bride too. For <hi>Chloe's</hi> beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie had ſtruck the eyes of them, a beautie for its luſtre beyond eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, beyond exceſſe by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In fine, the whole Cittie was moved about the young man and the maide, and now with loud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geminations, cryed, <hi>A happie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, a bleſſed Marriage.</hi> They prayed too the maid might find her birth as Great, as ſhe was Faire; and many of the richer Ladyes prayed the Gods, they might be taken for Mothers of ſo ſweet a Girle.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> after many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous thoughts, fell into a deep
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115136:119"/>
ſleep, and in that, had this Viſion: He thought he ſaw the Nymphs petition <hi>Cupid,</hi> to grant them at length a licence for the wedding. Then, that Love himſelf, his bow unbent, and by his quiver laid; commanded him to invite the whole nobility of Mitylene to a feaſt, and when he had ſett the laſt creater, there to ſhow the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents to every one; and from that point, commence, and ſing the <hi>Hymenaeus.</hi> When he had ſeen, and heard This, up the getts aſſoone as day, and gave order that a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did ſupper ſhould be provided of all varietyes from the land, from the Sea, from the Marſhes, from the rivers; and at night had to his gueſts all the beſt of the Mitylenaeans.</p>
            <p>And when the laſt Crater was filled, and out of it a Libation poured to <hi>Mercury</hi> the god of ſleep; one of the ſervants came in with <hi>Chloe</hi>'s Trinkets upon a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115136:120"/>
ſilver plate; and carrying them about in his right hand, preſented them to every eye. Of others there was none that knew them. Onely one <hi>Megacles,</hi> who for his age ſate uppermoſt, when he ſaw them, knowing preſently what they were, cryed out amain with a youthful ſtrong voyce:</p>
            <p>Bleſſe me! What is it that I ſee? What is become of thee, my little daughter? Art Thou yet indeed alive! or has ſome Shepherd brought theſe hither, lighting on them by meer chance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tell me, for gods ſake, <hi>Dionyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> How came you by the dreſſe of my Child? Envy not me the finding ſomething after <hi>Daphnis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> bidding him firſt relate the Expoſing of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115136:120"/>
Child; he remitted nothing of his former tone, but thus went on:</p>
            <p>Some yeares ago I had but a ſcanty livelyhood. For I ſpent what I had, on Playes, and Shews, and the publick Galleys. In this condition I had a daughter born. And deſpairing becauſe of my want of an honourable education for her, I expoſed her with Theſe monumentall Toyes, knowing that even by that way, many are glad to be made fathers. In the <hi>Nymphaeum</hi> ſhe was laid, and left to the Truſt of the Reſident God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes. After that I began to be rich, and grow richer every day, yet had no heir; nor was I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſo fortunate, as to be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but to a daughter. But the gods, as if they mockt me for what I had done, ſent me a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115136:121"/>
dream, which ſignified, That a Sheep ſhould make me a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> upon that burſt out louder then <hi>Megacles;</hi> and ſprung away into a near with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing room, and brought in <hi>Chloe</hi> finely dreſt as curioſity could do it. And in haſte to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacles,</hi> This (quoth he) is that ſame daughter of Thine that thou didſt expoſe: This Girle, a Sheep, by the providence of the gods, did nurſe for thee, as a Goat did my <hi>Daphnis.</hi> Take her monuments, Take thy daughter; then by all meanes give her <hi>Daphnis</hi> for a Bride. We expoſed both of them, and have now found them both: <hi>Pan,</hi> the Nymphs, and Love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf took care of both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megacles</hi> highly approved the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and commanded his Wife <hi>Rhode</hi> ſhould be ſent for thither,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115136:121"/>
firſt to ſee her ſweet Girle, then to have her ſleep that night in her lap. For <hi>Daphnis</hi> had ſworne by all the Gods, he would not truſt her with any body elſe, no not with his own Father.</p>
            <p>When it was day, into the fields they turned again. For <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> had impetrated that, by reaſon of the ſtrangeneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of Cittie-converſation to them. Beſides, for them, it was thought the beſt, to make it a kind of Paſtorall Wedding. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore coming to <hi>Lamo's</hi> houſe to <hi>Megacles</hi> was <hi>Dryas</hi> joyn'd aſſiſtant, <hi>Nape</hi> to <hi>Rhode.</hi> And by them all things were finely diſpoſed and furniſht to the rurall celebration.</p>
            <p>Then before the ſtatues of the Nymphs her Father gave <hi>Chloe</hi> to <hi>Daphnis,</hi> and with other more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious things, ſuſpended her Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for <hi>Anathema's</hi> in the Cave. Then in recognition of <hi>Dryas</hi> his
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115136:122"/>
eare, they made up his number ten-thouſand dracma's.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Dionyſophanes</hi> (for his ſhare) the day being ſerene, open, and fair, commanded there ſhould be Arbors of green boughes ſet up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the very Cave, and there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Villagers to their high feaſting jollitie. <hi>Lamo</hi> was there, and <hi>Myrtale, Dryas</hi> and <hi>Nape, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co's</hi> kindred and friends, <hi>Philetas</hi> and his Lads, <hi>Chromis</hi> and his <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenium.</hi> Nor was even <hi>Lampis</hi> abſent; for he was pardon'd by that Beaurie that he had loved.</p>
            <p>Therefore then, as uſually when rurall revellers are met together at a Feaſt; nothing but <hi>Georgics,</hi> nothing but what was ruſtical was there. Here one ſang like the Reapers, There another prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled it, and flung about the <hi>Epile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> flirts and ſcoffs, as in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne from the preſſe. <hi>Philetas</hi> played upon his Pipes, <hi>Lampis</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115136:122"/>
the Hoboy. <hi>Dryas</hi> and <hi>Lamo</hi> danced to them. <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> clipt and kiſt. The Goats too were feeding by, as part of that celebritie.</p>
            <p>And this manner of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe from the Cittie, was pleaſing to them beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Daphnis</hi> now calls up ſome of the Goats by their names, and from the Arbors gives them boughs to browze upon from his hand, and catching them faſt by the hornes, took kiſſes thence.</p>
            <p>And thus they did not only then for that day; but, for the moſt part of their time, held on ſtill the Paſtoral mode; ſerving the Gods the Nymphs, <hi>Cupid, &amp; Pan;</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for food, more pleſant to them then Apples, and Milk. But now for the ceremonyes of giving them their new names, it was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſhould lie down under
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115136:123"/>
a Goat, and take the dugge; <hi>Chloe</hi> then, under a ſheep: him they called <hi>Philopoemen,</hi> her they named, the fair <hi>Ag<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le.</hi> And ſo with them thoſe names grew old. The Cave they adorn'd with curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work, ſet up Statues, built an Altar of <hi>Cupid the Shepherd;</hi> and to <hi>Pan,</hi> a phane to dwell in ſtead of a pine, and called him, <hi>Pan Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiotes, Pan the Lovers Souldier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this adorning of the Cave, building an Altar, and a Phane, and giving them their names, was afterwards at their opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Then when it was night, and <hi>Venus</hi> riſing up the horizon, they all lead the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom to their Chamber, ſome playing upon Whiſtles and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes, ſome upon the oblique Pipes, ſome holding great Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>And when they came near to the door, they chang'd their tone,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115136:123"/>
and gave a grating harſh ſound, nothing like the <hi>Hymenaeus,</hi> but as if the Virgin Earth had bin torn with many Tridents.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> lying naked together, began to clip, and kiſſe, and twine, and ſtrive with one another, ſleeping no more then birds of the night; and <hi>Daphnis</hi> now did the Trick that his Miſtris <hi>Lycaenium</hi> taught him in the thicket. And <hi>Chloe</hi> then firſt knew, that thoſe things that were done in the Wood, were only the ſweeteſt Sports of Shepherds.</p>
