         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and in the judgement of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17840:11"/>
Nations amongst whom
they liued: <hi>How shall
not the ministration of the
Spirit bee rather glorious?
verse</hi> the eighth: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whereof is largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
in the third Verse;
where the Corinthians are
said to be an <hi>Epistle written
not with inke,</hi> or dead Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>but with the Spirit of
the living God;</hi> which kind
of writing leaveth not the
heart a heart of stone, as the
dead writing of the Law did,
but changeth it into <hi>a heart
of flesh,</hi> and maketh such a
through alteration in the
wholeman, as the writing
within, <hi>in the Tables of their
hearts,</hi> is <hi>knowne and read of
all men:</hi> so that their lives and
conversations being answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17840:12"/>
to that spirituall and
gracious writing of Christ
in their hearts, <hi>they are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
declared to be the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of Christ:</hi> and therefore
such a Ministry as this is, by
which the Spirit of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God is received, (and
no by the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2.)
which is a Spirit of glory,
and worketh gloriousthings
both in the hearts and lives
of men, must needs be <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
glorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another Inference
wee have in the 9. verse;
<hi>if the ministration of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
be glorious;</hi> that is, if
that word which concluded
men under sinne, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the sentence of
death upon them <hi>bee glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
much more doth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17840:12"/>
of righteousnesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in glory:</hi> For it is more
glorious to pardon than to
condemne; to give life, than
to destroy. It is the glory of
a man to passe over an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 19. and in God
it is called the <hi>riches of his
glory, Rom. 9. 23 The Law,
which was made glorious,</hi> in
terrifying, condemning, and
stopping the mouthes of
men, in so much as they had
not a word to say for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>hath no glory, by reason
of the glory</hi> of the Gospell
<hi>that excelleth, even in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi>
that it bringeth such a
righteousnesse, as by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
whereof, and satisfaction
given by it, we are justified
and have peace towards
God, notwithstanding the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17840:13"/>
utmost rigour of the Law.</p>
            <p>3. The Apostle argueth
further, verse the eleventh,
<hi>if that which is done away was
glorious,</hi> as the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is, which was made old
by the comming of the
New, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. and by it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
as a thing growne
weake and shaken, <hi>Heb. 12.
much more that which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi>
which is the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
which cannot bee
shaken but shall remaine,
and is <hi>the everlasting Gospell,</hi>
Rev. 14. <hi>is more glorious:</hi> as
Gods last works exceed the
former, and taketh away the
remembrance of them in
comparison; as when hee
createth New heavens, and
a New earth, the former
shall not be remembred nor
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17840:13"/>
come into minde. <hi>Esa.</hi> 65.</p>
            <p>4. There is another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the Gospell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Law, which the
Apostle addeth, and insisteth
upon it more largely then
upon all the rest; and that is,
the comfortable plainnesse
and perspicuity of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Ministry of it,
verse the twelfth; <hi>Seeing we
have such hope, wee use great
plainnesse of Speech.</hi> In which
it excelled the Ministry of
<hi>Moses,</hi> which was in much
difficulty and obscurity, and
that in a threefold respect
layd downe in the 13, 14,
and 15 <hi>verses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Matter of it was
terrible, tending to the
shame, confusion of face, and
condemnation of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17840:14"/>
insomuch as they were
notable to stand before him
nor stedfastly to behold his
face, it was such a dazling
and amazing light that shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in his Ministry.</p>
            <p>2. The Manner of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
was in obscure and
darke expressions, that <hi>the
Children of Israel could not
see to the end of that which is
abolished:</hi> that is, they could
not see the drift and scope of
his Ministery, by reason of
the Types and Shadowes,
which was <hi>the vaile hee put
upon his face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Their minds were blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
there was <hi>a vaile upon their hearts,</hi>
which is evident
by experience in the Jewes
at this day; who so cleave
in their affections to <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:17840:14"/>
and to the Shadowes and
Ceremonies of his Ministry,
that they reject the scope
and end of it, which is Jesus
Christ crucified. And they
can doe no other; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the vaile that was
upon <hi>Moses</hi> face by removed,
as it is by the doctrine of
the Gospell, which sheweth
us in all possible plainnesse
what the drift and meaning
of <hi>Moses</hi> was in all those
Types and Ceremonies, yet
untill the Gospel in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and efficacy of it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
home to their hearts,
and taketh off <hi>the vayle that
is upon their hearts</hi> also: that
is, untill their naturall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and obstinacy be taken
away, which cannot be (but
is rather increased) by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17840:15"/>
Law, (<hi>for although Moses bee
read, yet untill this day remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the same vayle untaken
away,</hi>) the Jewes will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydably
abide in their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and bondage.</p>
            <p>Now in opposition to
this darknesse and obscurity
of the Law in all those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
the Apostle exalteth
the Gospell in this high and
excellent privilege of it,
That it is plaine, and evident,
and full of demonstration;
and that the light of it is not
terrifying and amazing, but
sweet and comfortable; so
that wee may with much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and boldnesse of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
looke constantly upon
the great &amp; glorious things
set before us in it, although
it be no other but the glory
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17840:15"/>
of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>And there is moreover
such an efficacy and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
power in this Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Gospell, as it will

               <p>The <hi>Spirit</hi> here is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

as if the Holy Ghost had
said, The Lord is a Spirit,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17840:16"/>
and not a bodily thing,
though that be a truth.</p>
               <p>And as it is not meant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
so not personally,
<hi>Christ is that Spirit,</hi> as if
Christ were the holy Ghost,
that were a confusion of

to the third person; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lly
Ghost is the Spirit. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as some heretofore
would have it) to shew that
the Spirit is <hi>Iehovah,</hi> God:
It is neither to shew that
Christ is God, nor that the
Spirit is God, nor that Christ
is the holy Ghost: But it is
meant in regard of a speciall
dispensation, The Lord is
<hi>that Spirit;</hi> that is, the Lord
Iesus Christ, who is the Lord
of his Church by marriage,

The Spirit is all in all

doth, he doth, as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
full of the Spirit, in

as God, and receives it
as man; so hee both gives
and receives: the Spirit
proceedeth from the Father
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17840:17"/>
and the Sonne as God, but
the Spirit sanctified Christ
as man, as it did in the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins

sanctified that blessed masse
of his body; it sanctified
him, and filled him with all

it is said <hi>he received the Spirit

all the Angels, and all men,

               <p>3. The Spirit doth rest

               <p>4. By reason of his place
or offices in relation to the
Church, as Head, Husband,
King, Priest, Prophet, &amp;c.
the Head is made by nature
the seat of the more noble
faculties; as of Seeing, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
Understanding, Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and is furnished accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
with greater plenty
of spirits, for the ruling and

so Christ is the head of the

of all the world is laid
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17840:19"/>
upon him, and all excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are derived from him
unto all his members, as
from the Root life is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

               <p>Hee hath his name

they are his fellowes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

Christ, when had hee
it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There was a fulnesse
of the Spirit powred out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ in the union of
the Humane nature with the
Divine; Vnion and Vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
went together: there was
annoynting of the Spirit, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the union of the
Spirit.</p>
               <p>2. There was a more full
manifestation of the Spirit
in his Baptisme; when the
holy Ghost fell on him in
the shape of a Dove, then
he received the Spirit, hee
was to enter into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry
of the Gospell; <hi>the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17840:21"/>
Spirit of the Lord God was
upon him,</hi> because hee had
anoynted him to Preach
good tidings unto the meek,
&amp;c. <hi>Esa.</hi> 61. 1.</p>
               <p>3. But the fullest degree
of declaration and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of the Spirit upon
Christ,<note place="margin">When the fullest mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of the spirit in Christ was</note> was after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:
after he had satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
fully for our salvation,
then the stop of his glory
was taken away: For to
worke our salvation, there
was a keeping backe of the
glory of Christ from his
Humane nature, that hee
might bee abased to suffer
for us; when hee had fully
suffered for us, that stay of
his glory, his abasement
was taken away, and then
nothing appeared but all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17840:21"/>
glory and Spirit in Christ.
All things were put under
his feet, and he was set upon
his Throne as a glorious
King: His Priestly Office
appeared in his death; his
Propheticall Office, before
his death; but then hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be King, and Lord
of all in the Resurrection.
Thus wee see how Christ
is that Spirit; that is, hee is
full of the Spirit in regard of
himselfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is <hi>that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
in regard of his dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
towards his Church
and Children:<note place="margin">2 Christ gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> The Lord is
that Spirit; that is, 1. of
all truths, and 2. of all

               <p>First of truths:<note place="margin">1. To all truths and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> what is

What is all the Scriptures
without Christ? The Law

is the Gospell too without
Christ, hee is <hi>that Spirit</hi>
which gives life unto all the

they were types of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17840:22"/>
Christ, all the Promises they
were made and fulfilled in
Christ, the Law Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
aymed at Christ, the Law
Morall is to drive us to
Christ, Christ is the Spirit
of all; and the Scripture
without Christ, it is but a
meere dead thing, it is but a
shell without a kernell, as
it is to the Iewes at this day.</p>
               <p>2. Christ is <hi>that Spirit,</hi> in
regard of persons,<note place="margin">2 To all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that are spirituall.</note> quickning
them; hee is an universall
Principle of spirituall life,
infusing it into al his Church
and Children: Christ is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
with his Church
from the beginning of the
world, and will bee to the
end. It was no losse to the
Church that Christ in his
bodily presence l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>hee left them the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
his Spirit, by which he
wrought greater workes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Ascension than hee
did before. He is <hi>annoynted
with the oyle of gladnesse</hi>
and grace, <hi>above his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,</hi>
but all was for his
fellowes; whatsoever he is,
or hath, all is for his Church
and Children; <hi>for us</hi> he was
borne, for <hi>us</hi> he was given;
hee is a King, a Priest, a
Prophet for <hi>us:</hi> he dyed for
us, he rose againe for us.</p>
               <p>And he doth all he doth
toward the Church,<note place="margin">Why Christ worketh all by the Spirit.</note> as hee
hath the Spirit, and by the
Spirit. The Father is the first
in the Trinity, <hi>from whom</hi> all
comes; and the Son <hi>by whom</hi>
all things are; but the holy
Ghost is the immediat wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17840:23"/>
of all things, next the
creature; all things are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>from</hi> God the Father,
<hi>through</hi> the Sonne, <hi>by</hi> the
Spirit: what Christ wrought,
and what the Father in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
devised, was applyed
by the Spirit: and so the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of us to be fit for such
a glorious condition as wee
have by Christ, is also by the
Spirit. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why Christ giveth the
Spirit to those to whom hee
purposeth to give faith or
love, or to worke any graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
worke.</p>
               <p>For where Christ saveth
he doth it not onely <hi>by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>

working in us, that he might
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17840:24"/>
be a perfect Saviour. Now
the Essentiall vigour and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative
Principle in all
things, either wrought by
or from the Father or the
Sonne, is the Spirit. As in
Man there is his <hi>will</hi> from
which he resolveth and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth,
there is wisedome
and <hi>understanding</hi> by which
hee proceedeth, and then
there is a vigorous <hi>power</hi> in
man by which he executeth
and doth all: so is it in this
working of God; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
plotteth and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
of what is to be done;
the Sonne, <hi>who is the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Father,</hi> dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
what the Father wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth;
the holy Spirit, the
power of both, finisheth and
worketh all upon us, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17840:24"/>
therefore hee is called <hi>the power of the highest, Luk.</hi> 1. 35.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever works come
from God to the creature in
generall, and are wrought in
the world as works of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and providence, are
immediately by the holy
Spirit, <hi>nakedly considered,</hi>
as the third person com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from the Father and
the Sonne. And in those spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
workes, wrought in his
Church and on his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
all things commeth
from the holy Ghost, but
not simply considered as the
third person, but <hi>as hee is the
Spirit of Christ;</hi> that is, first
sanctifying and filling the

and then sanctifying and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

wee should not have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

for we should have received

                  <hi>Adam</hi> himselfe received

the Spirit, in which is the
seed of all gifts and graces;
and this we have by his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Mediatorship. Yet
this wee must likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that although
Christ be sayd to give the
Spirit, as he doth, yet the
holy Spirit giveth it selfe
too; for there is such an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in the Trinity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and nature, that though
the Father and the Sonne
send the Spirit, yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
comes of his owne selfe;
though the Father and the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17840:27"/>
Sonne give the Spirit, yet
the Spirit giveth himselfe.</p>
               <p>3. Wee have the Spirit
from Christ not onely by
way of Merit,<note place="margin">3. By way of example.</note> but in some
kind by way of <hi>Example;</hi>
hee is the exemplary cause
of all graces in us; looking
to whom, wee are transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
(as wee shall see after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
<hi>from glory to glory:</hi>
For when wee consider that
Christ hath done so much
for us, as to save us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
us, and dye for us,
this begetteth a love in us to
Christ, and makes us often
to thinke of him, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to imitate him, as wee
usually doe such as we love
and highly esteeme of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>dispensation of the Spirit is in most abundance</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Christ gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Spirit in greatest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</note>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:17840:28"/>
after the resurrection of
Christ, as hee appeared in
himselfe then to bee most
spirituall and glorious after
he rose againe, so then being
as the Sun in its full height
and perfect beauty, casteth
his beames most plentifully
abroad, and that for these reasons:</p>
               <p>1. Because then hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
finished the worke of
Redemption, and satisfied
the wrath of God fully, and
given contentment to Divine
Justice, and accomplished
all by his death, there was
nothing to hinder the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
gift of the Spirit. It is
sayd, that <hi>before, the holy Ghost
was not given, because Christ
was not glorified:</hi> The gift
of the holy Ghost especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17840:28"/>
depends upon the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of Christ, when he had
fulfilled the worke of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and was raised to
glory, God being pacified,
gave the holy Ghost as a gift
of his favour.</p>
               <p>2. Then againe after his
Resurrection and Ascension
he did give the holy Ghost
more abundantly than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to his Church, because
now hee is in heaven, and
hath the advantage of the
place, being exalted on
high: As that glorious
creature the Sunne, by the
advantage it hath, being
placed in the heavens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
us, is able to shine
upon the greatest part of
the earth at all times;
and wee need not call the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17840:29"/>
Sunne downe from its place
to come into our houses, or
fields, or gardens; no,
where it is seated in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place or orbe, it hath
the best opportunity in
most abundance and largest
extent to send downe heat,
and light, and influence to
inferiour things: So Christ
doth his Church more good
now he is in heaven, from
whence he sends the Spirit,
then hee could doe if hee
were below; because
though his Humane nature
be confined in heaven, his
person is every where: and
being <hi>ascended now farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all heavens,</hi> he giveth
gifts more liberally and
plentifully, insomuch as he
<hi>filleth all things, Eph.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 10.</note> hee
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17840:29"/>
enlargeth the tents of his
Gospel, and hath taken in a
greater people to himselfe.
We see in Winter when the
Sunne is low and neare the
earth, all things are dead,
and cold; but when the
Sunne in the Spring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to over-top us, to bee
in a higher point above us,
wee see how all things put
a new garment upon them,
there is a new vigour and
freshnesse in them; so there
was more abundant vigour
of the Spirit when Christ
came in the Flesh, his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
appeared much more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
way then before. But
when this blessed Sonne of
righteousnesse was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and seated at the right
hand of his Father, where
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17840:30"/>
his Nature was perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched,
and perfectly ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with all kind of graces
whatsoever in the highest
glory of them; his influence
of light and heat now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
to be increased, and
the efficacy and working of
it to bee felt every where.
The glorious beams of the
Sunne beganne to be scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and the light of the
Gospel to shine to a greater
number of people; now
there was no respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whether Jew or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
bond or free, male or
female, all was one, the
Commission was enlarged
to all; <hi>Mark. 16. Goe preach

and with the Word the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17840:30"/>
and those that were added
to the Church, even such as
should be saved, were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands.</p>
               <p>Thus have wee opened
the meaning of the words,
and shewed how <hi>Christ is
that Spirit,</hi> both in respect
of the Spirits being emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
in him, and his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

is done as sent from Christ,

of spirit in him,

when we want any grace,

God doth all by Christ,
Christ doth all by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
desire Christ that hee
would vouchsafe his spirit

that fulnesse for us,
desire him that out of his

               <p>It is the reason why

Spirit it is of great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that wee should have it.
Above all things next to

for the spirit of
Christ.</p>
               <p>Christ is our Saviour, not
onely by merit and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
but by efficacy and
grace, that is, as hee hath
purchased us for his people
by his blood; so hee will
subdue our corruptions,<note place="margin">Motives to stirre us up to get the Spirit.</note>
and rule us by his Spirit.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For first, <hi>Hee that hath

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17840:38"/>
none of his;</hi> those that have
not the efficacy of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

together, Christ as a King
to rule, and as a Priest to
dye, <hi>He came by blood and by
water;</hi> to satisfie, and to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the Spirit, that we
may be new Creatures: it
was the Spirits brooding
upon the <hi>Chaos</hi> that
brought forth all, so the
Spirit must sit upon our
soules before any change
will be made: Now there
is a necessity that wee bee
changed, and that wee bee
new, or else wee can never
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17840:38"/>
bee inhabitants of the new
heavens and the new earth,
we must have the Spirit of
God: therefore <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 6.
as in the materiall Temple,
<hi>Its not by might or by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
but by the Spirit;</hi> So in
rearing up spirituall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
it is not by strength of
wit or parts, but by the
Spirit; therefore the Spirit
is necessary for us, even as
our being in grace is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
               <p>The holy Apostles wee
know till the Spirit came
more abundantly upon
them; what darke creatures
they were? but when the
holy Ghost was come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, how full of life,
and light, and courage they
were, that the more they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17840:39"/>
suffered, the more they
might suffer: So it will bee
with Christians, the more
spirituall they grow, the
more lightsome and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious,
the more strong,
the more lively and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grous
to all duties: the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost is the substantiall
vigour of all creatures
what soever; all the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
vigour of every thing,
comes from the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and the holy Spirit
from Christ.</p>
               <p>For nothing can worke
above it selfe, nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
worke above nature;
That which elevates nature
above it selfe, and sets a
spirituall stampe, and puts
divine qualities upon it, is
the Spirit of God. That
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17840:39"/>
divine quality is called
Spirit: There is the flesh,
and the spirit; all in us is
flesh by nature, and what
soever is spirituall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
commeth from the
Spirit, and therefore it is
called Spirit; you see
therefore a necessity of the
working of the Spirit, even
as there is a necessity to bee
new creatures, and to bee
spirituall. If we will be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
wee must have it
from him, that is first spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
the Spirit himselfe,
that is the principle and
fountaine of all that is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee are called
oft times to doe, and suffer
such things as are above
nature, and therefore wee
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17840:40"/>
must have a spirit above
nature, when wee feele sin,
to beleeve the forgivenesse
of sinnes; when wee see
death, to beleeve life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting;
and when wee are
in extremity, to beleeve
God present with us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us; to beleeve contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in contraries, is a
strange almighty worke of
faith, by the works of the
Spirit. It is above the work
of nature to dye, to end
out dayes with comfort,
and to resigne up our
soules; for nature sees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but darknesse, and
desolation in the grave and
destruction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Now these things and

them the name of Spirit,
but the Holy Ghost espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
because he is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
vigour. The Spirit
is an operative thing, the
spirits are the quintessence,
and extraction of things,
that is nothing but operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
God that is nothing but
a pure act is said to be a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
those that have the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, are full of act,
and vigour, the spirits of
dull creatures, are active,
when they are ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>racted,
shall the spirits of bodies
bee vigrous, and shall not
the Holy Ghost be vigrous,
that is a substantial vigour?
therefore, if a man have the
Spirit of God in him, it will
worke in him, it is very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:17840:41"/>
Therefore it is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to fire,<note place="margin">The spirit compared to fire.</note> in diverse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
for, first, Fire it is of

by fire. So the Holy

and softneth the heart, and
makes us mallyable, it
makes us fit for the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of all good.</p>
               <p>Secondly Fire, againe,<note place="margin">2. It trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes things.</note>
though bodies be darke, it

it makes us light.</p>
               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">3. It carries upwards.</note> Fire it mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

chearefull, and it ascends
upward; if a man have the
Spirit of God, his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
will be upward, his
conversation will bee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
he minds the things
of God, he doth not grovel
here below, so in diverse
such respects, the Holy
Ghost is compared to Fire,
and hath such effects in us,
in some sort wee finde our
understandings enlightned,
and our selves quickened,
and carryed up to be above
nature, in holy and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
actions, and then it is a
good signe that we have the
Spirit of Christ. A part
will follow the whole, as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17840:42"/>
we see a part of the earth, it

the Spirit is a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

a man, he doth not
doubt of that that he seeth
at noone day, so that that
a man seeth by the Spirit,
he is convinced of, when a
man doubts, and wavers,
whether hee should take a
good course or a bad, and
wavers, it is a signe, he is
carnall, and hath not the
Spirit of God, for if hee
had the Spirit it would
convince him, and set him
downe, you must take this
course, if you will bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,<note place="margin">To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince what.</note>
That is said to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
that saith more for

studdy Christ, if wee will
have the Spirit, studdy the
Gospell of Christ, what is
the reason that before
Christ, there was so little
spirit in comparison? there
was but a little measure of
the knowledge of Christ,
the more Christ is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17840:44"/>
the more is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
given,<note place="margin">Why there was so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle spirit before Christs time.</note> and according to
the manifestation of Christ
what he hath done for us,
and what hee hath, the

the more the Spirit goes

is made knowne to

there is, and againe
backe againe, the more
spirit, the more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ; for there
is a reciprocall going of
these two, the knowledge
of Christ, and the Spirit:
What is the reason, that
in Popery, the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that were witty to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17840:45"/>
that there was

they were wondrous quick

                     </gap>rit in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</note> but they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
not the matters of
grace, and of Christ, it was
not fully discovered to
them, but they attributed
it to satisfaction, and to
merits, and to the Pope,
the head of the Church,
&amp;c. They divided Christ,
they knew him not, and
dividing Christ, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Spirit of Christ,
and wanting that spirit,
they taught not Christ as
they should, they were
darke times, as themselves
confessed, especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
nine hundred, and a
thousand yeares after
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17840:45"/>
Christ, because Christ
was vayled then in a
world of idle ceremonies
(to darken the Gospell
and the victory of Christ)
that the <hi>Pope</hi> made, who
was the Vicare of Sathan,
these were the Doctors of
the Church then, and
Christ was hid, and wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
in a company of idle
traditions, and ceremonies
of men, and that was the
reason that things were
obscure.</p>
               <p>Now when Christ, and
all good things by Christ,<note place="margin">1. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ makes life and death comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note>
and by Christ onely are
discovered, the vaile is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off: now of late for
these hundred yeares, in
the time of reformation,
there hath beene more
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17840:46"/>
spirit, and more light some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and comfort, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
have lived, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more comfortably,
why? because Christ hath
beene more knowne; and
as it is with the Church,
so it is with particular
Christians, the more they
studdy Christ, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
that is in Christ, and
all comfort in him alone
to be had, <hi>Wisedome, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
Sanctification,</hi>
and <hi>redemption,</hi> the more
men grow up in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ, the more
they grow spirituall, and
the more spirituall they
grow, the more they
grow in the knowledge of
Christ, therefore if wee
would have the spirit, let
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17840:46"/>
us come neere to Christ,
and labour to know him
more, who is the fountaine
of all that is spirituall.</p>
               <p>Then againe if wee
would be spirituall,<note place="margin">2. Not to trust to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance without Christ.</note> let us
take heed we trust not too
much to dead things,
without Christ, to have a

worke done, to thinke that
reading, and hearing, and
receiving the Sacrament,
and that the government
of the Church will doe it,
as if it were as man would
have it, put case there
were all these, (which are
excellent good things,)
but what are all these
without the spirit of
Christ, a man may bee
dead with all these,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17840:47"/>
though he heare never so
much, and receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
never so often, if
a man goe not to Christ
the quickning spirit in this
manner; Lord these, and
my soule too, are dead
things without thy spirit,
therefore quicken me, joyn
Christ with all our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
without which
all is nothing, and then he
will be spirituall to us.</p>
               <p>And when wee goe to
Christ,<note place="margin">3. Be careful in use of meanes.</note> for the spirit (as we
must beg it, if wee will
have it, (God will give
the holy Ghost to them
that aske him) remember
that we use the meanes
carefully, reading, and
hearing, and holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints, because
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17840:47"/>
though these without the
spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can doe nothing, yet
the spirit is not given but
by these, these are the
golden conduites of the
spirit of Christ: no man is
ever spirituall but they are
readers, and hearers, and
conferrers of good things,
and attenders upon the
meanes of Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God will worke by
his owne tooles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments;
therefore it is
sayd, <hi>Revel. 1. That Iohn
was full of the spirit upon

sanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,

will be in the Spirit on the

then he is reading,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17840:48"/>
and hearing, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and in some spirituall

it is a thing that mans

contrary man, as a man ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres,
and hee hath not
the nature of a man, that

shall we thinke then of the

what shall wee thinke of

               <p>You may thinke this a
nice difference, but there
is some realty in it.</p>
               <p>Christian liberty,<note place="margin">1. Christian.</note> is that
that belongs to all, even
to those before Christ,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17840:50"/>
though they have not the
terme of Christians, yet
they were members of
Christ, Christ was head
of the Church, <hi>Yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and to day, and for
ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Evangelicall<note place="margin">2. Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</note> liberty is
that that is more appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to the times of the
Gospell since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Christ, now the
liberty that belongs to
Christians as Christians,
is perpetuall from those
grand enemies, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
enemies of all spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and inward liberty.
In Evangelicall liberty
besides that, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
outward liberty,
from the ceremoniall and
morrall law, and such like
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17840:50"/>
and a liberty from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of the law: the
<hi>Iewes</hi> were under many
restraints, that under the
Gospell in this time wee
are not; I speake therefore
of liberty as it runnes
through all ages of the
Church, not of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
meerely since the
time of Christ, where the
spirit is, both these liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are now since the
comming of Christ: now
in that the holy Ghost
saith here, where the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ is there is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
it supposeth that</p>
               <p>We are in bondage before wee have the spirit of Christ.<note place="margin">We are in bondage without the Spirit.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That is a supposed
ground and truth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17840:51"/>
so it is: for out of
Christ wee are slaves, the
best of us all are slaves; in
Christ, the meanest of all,
is a free man, and a King,
out of Christ, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but thraldome, wee
are under the kingdome of
the devill, when he cals us
we come wee are in thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
under the wrath of
God, under the feare of
death, and damnation, and
all those spiritual enemies,
that I neede not mention,
they are well enough
knowne to you, by often-repetition,
there is no man
but he is a slave, till hee be
in Christ, and the more
free a man thinks himselfe
to be, and labours to be,
the more slave hee is: for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17840:51"/>
take a man that labours to
have his liberty, to doe
what he list, he thinkes it
the happyest condition in
the world, and others
thinke it the best conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to have liberty not to
be tyrannized over by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">The more liberty without Christ, the more sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</note>
It is the disposition
of mans nature without
grace, they account it a
happinesse to have their
wils over all other, but the
more liberty in this, the
more slavery. <hi>Why?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The more liberty that a
man hath to doe lawlesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what he wil, contrary to
justice &amp; equity, the more
he sins: the more he sinnes
the more he is inthrawled
to sinne, the more he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrawled
to sin, the more
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17840:52"/>
he is in bondage to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
and becomes the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of God, therefore if a
man would picke out the
wretchedest man in the
world, I would picke out
the greatest man in the
world if he be naught, that
hath most under him, hee
hath most liberty, and
seekes most liberty, and
accounts it his happinesse
that hee may have his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
this is the greatest
thraldome, and it will
prove when he dyes, and
comes to answer for it, the
greatest thraldome of all,
therefore the point needes
not much proofe, that if
wee be not in Christ, wee
are slaves,<note place="margin">Aug. de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Dei.</note> as <hi>Augustine</hi>
saith in his Booke, <hi>De, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17840:52"/>
Dei,</hi> hee is a slave
though he domineere, and
rule.</p>
               <p>A man till he be in Christ
is a slave, not of one man
or of one lord over him,
but he hath so many lords,
as hee hath so many lusts.
There are but two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes<note place="margin">Two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</note>
that the Scripture
speaks of, that is, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Sathan, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and the Kingdome
of Christ, all therefore that
are not in the Kingdome
of Christ, in that blessed
liberty, they must needes
be shoaled under the other
kingdome of Sathan. This
is a ground, therefore I
speake shortly of it, as an
insentive, and provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to stirre us up, to get
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17840:53"/>
into Christ, to get the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ, that we may
have this spirituall liberty,
or else we are al slaves, not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withstanding
all our civill
liberties whatsoever they
be. Now where the Spirit
of Christ is, there is liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
there is freedome from
that bondage, that we are
in by nature, and which is
strengthened by a wicked
course of life, for though
we be all slaves by nature,
borne slaves, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by a wicked
course of life, we put our
selves into bonds and tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
our selves,<note place="margin">Sins bonds.</note> so many sins
and so many repetitions of
sinne, so many cords, the
longer a man lives, the
greater slave he is; Now
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17840:53"/>
when the Spirit of Christ
comes, it frees us from all;
both from the naturall,
and from the customary
slavery.</p>
               <p>Now this liberty is
wrought by Christ,<note place="margin">Liberty wrought by Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the Spirit.</note> and
applyed by the Spirit,
what Christ workes, hee
makes it ours by his Spirit,
which takes all from
Christ, as Christ doth all
by the Spirit, so the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
takes all from Christ,
all the comfort it hath, is
from reasons taken from
Christ, from grounds from
Christ, and doctrines from
Christ, but yet both have
their efficacy, Christ, as
the meritorious cause,<note place="margin">How the Spirit workes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</note> and
the Spirit, as the applying
cause; The spirit disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17840:54"/>
the state of bondage
we are in by nature, and it
discovers withall a more
excellent condition,<note place="margin">By convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> and
as it discovers, so likewise
the spirit of God brings us
to this state, by working
faith, in that that Christ
hath done for us, Christ
hath freed us by his death
from the curse of the Law,
from the wrath of God,
from death and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">By Faith.</note>
and the like: Now
whatsoever Christ hath
done, the Spirit workes
faith, to make this our own
by uniting us to Christ;
when Christ and wee are
one, his sufferings are ours,
and his victory is ours, all
is ours,<note place="margin">By Love.</note> then the Spirit
perswading us of the love
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17840:54"/>
of God, and Christ redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
us from that cursed
slavery wee were in, that
Spirit, it workes love in us,
and other graces whereby
the dominion of sinne is
broken more, and more,
and wee are set at liberty
by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now the Spirit doth not
worke liberty properly, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally,
but Christ is the
grand redeemer, but Christ
redeemeth two wayes.<note place="margin">Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemeth two wayes, 1. By Price.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He redeemes us by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the price, and so he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
redeemeth, for he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the price to divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
wee are in bondage
to the wrath of God under
his justice, and so there
must be satisfaction to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
before wee can bee
free.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:17840:55"/>
Then we are in bondage
to Sathan,<note place="margin">2. By strong hand.</note> as Gods Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
and Iaylor, now
from him we are freed by
strong hand, so Christ free<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eth
us by his holy Spirit,
working such graces in us,
as makes us see the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenes
of that bondage,
working likewise grace in
us to be in love with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
condition, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
discovers to us, so that
the Spirit brings us out by
discovery, and by power.
All that Christ freeth by
vertue of redemption, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the price for all those
hee frees likewise by his
Spirit, discovering to them
their bondage, and the
blessed condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they are to bee
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17840:55"/>
brought to a state of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
which freedome
hee perfects by little and
little, till he bring them to
a glorious freedome in
heaven.</p>
               <p>And the reason of this,<note place="margin">All that Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemes, he frees by his Spirit.</note> that where Christ doth
free by way of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to dye, and satisfie
Gods justice for any, to
those hee gives his Spirit,
by which Spirit they are
set at liberty, the reasons
are manifold, to name one or two:</p>
               <p>Christ doth save all that
hee doth save answerable
to the nature of the party
saved,<note place="margin">1. Because we are saved as men.</note> hee saves them as
reasonable persons, for he
saves us that he may make
us friends, hee saves us as
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17840:56"/>
men, and redeemes us as
men, he doth not only pay
a price for us as wee buy a
thing that is dead, but
likewise he frees us, so as
wee may understand to
what, and by whom wee
are freed, and what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wee are freed from,
therefore there must be a
spirit joyned with the
worke of Christ, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
us throughly, being
creatures fit to bee infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>And God intending to

this fitting must be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Spirit, the

Christ in the wombe, the

Christ, annoints all those

may be fit for so glorious

the Spirit as well as Christ
in the worke of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>Now this Spirit of God
doth set us at liberty,<note place="margin">The Spirit sets us at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in all the course of salvation</note> in all

               <p>Hee sets us at liberty at

               <p>

               <p>And hee sets us then at

               <p>First of all the Spirit of
God is a Spirit of liberty,<note place="margin">1. In our first calling.</note>
when we are first called
powerfully and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
For living in the
Church, sets us not at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
unlesse the spirit stir
us up to answere a divine
call: <hi>for many are called, but few are chosen.</hi>
In the
Church, there is <hi>Hagar</hi> and
<hi>Ishmael,</hi> as well as <hi>Isaack,</hi>
there are hypocrites as
well as sound Christians,
there is outward baptisme
as well as inward, there is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17840:58"/>
outward circumcision of
the flesh, as well as inward
of the Spirit, a man may
have all these outward
priviledges, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
be a slave in
the bosome of the Church;
for <hi>Ishmael</hi> was a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave,
though he were in
the house of <hi>Abraham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
therefore the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of spirituall liberty is
when the spirit of God in
the ordinances,<note place="margin">1. The heart must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere Gods call.</note> in the
meanes of Salvation, stirres
up the heart to answere
Gods call as it were, when
we are exhorted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
and repent, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
gives power to Eccho
to God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 9. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord I beleeve, helpe thou my unbeleefe;</hi>
Lord I repent, and desire
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17840:58"/>
to repent more, and more;
when the spirit of God in
the ordinance saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>seeke my face, Thy face Lord will I seeke,</hi>
be thou mine Lord,
and I will be thine, this
spirituall Eccho, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
of the soule, comes
from the Spirit of God in
calling, and it is the first
degree of liberty.</p>
               <p>Now this answere of
the soule,<note place="margin">2. We must practise that we answere.</note> by the power of
the spirit, overpowring
our corruptions, is toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the obedience
of the inward man, to goe
out, for man answereth
the call, not onely by the
speech of the heart, Lord
I doe it, but he doth it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
therefore when by
the power of the Spirit,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17840:59"/>
we come out of the world,
and out of our corruptions
and walke more freely in
the wayes of God, then
we are set at spirituall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
now the Spirit
doth all this: for if it were
not the Spirit that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
the soule, when
the Minister speakes, alas
all ministeriall perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are to no purpose, if
the Spirit doe not stirre up
the soule to answere, all
speech is to no purpose
from men; but this the
Spirit doth, in the first
place he openeth the eyes
with spirituall eye salve,
to see our naturall bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
he openeth our eyes
to see, I must come out of
this condition, if I will be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17840:59"/>
saved of necessity, or else
I am miserable for ever,
and it is enough for the
soule of a miserable man
if he be convinced to see
his misery, and bondage
what he is by nature, for
let us be convinced of that
once, and all the rest of
the linkes of the golden
chaine of Salvation will
follow; let a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this will follow where
there is conviction of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
therefore the first

it doth not onely lay

God must stablish the

that God the Sonne hath

               <p>It is no wonder that men
of great parts without

when the Spirit is brought

Gods Spirit is above the

the Spirit is of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it breakes the ruling

but now there is a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17840:65"/>
a largenesse of heart which
followes the liberty of

of damnation, then
he hath a free and volen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

               <p>When a man is under

when he is under the feare
of death, being armed
with a sting, whatsoever
he doth, he doth it with a

the Spirit of adoption, the

a free Spirit: the sonne
doth not duties to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the spirit alters our nature

all freely; God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
the hearts of his

themselves in a good

of good workes; it is the
end of their redemption,
as it is <hi>Tit. 2. We are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
to be a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
zealous of good workes:</hi>
for then we have a base

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17840:66"/>
he is ready to part with all

is so free hearted that hee
can part with life it selfe,
<hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe, <hi>My
life is not deare to me, so I
may finish my course with
joy:</hi> as we see in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres

               <p>What shall wee thinke
of those therefore, that if
we get any thing of them,
it must bee as a sparkle out
of the flint: duties come
from Christians as water
out of a spring, they are
naturall, and not forced

they are spirituall.</p>
               <p>I confesse that there is

when the spirit would be

say, oh but I may want?
When the Spirit would

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:17840:67"/>
In a wicked man there is
nothing but flesh,<note place="margin">Liberty in in Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to conflict not from it.</note> and
therefore there is no resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the nature of this

it is not a liberty

and to get good

of it, it is an argument of a

his owne beginnings,
and subdue the flesh more
and more, by the power
of his spirit: We see our
blessed Saviour, what a
sweete excuse hee makes
for his Disciples, when
they were dead hearted
and drowsie, when they
should have comforted
him in the garden, oh saith
he, <hi>The spirit is willing, but

               <p>

any great corruption;
God lookes upon our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,

though that were an
ingredient in it, as nature
in it selfe; Christ saw a
great deale of gold in the
Oare, therefore wee see
how he excuseth them:
therefore when wee are
dull let us strive, Christ is
ready to make excuse for
us, if our hearts bee right,
<hi>The spirit is willing but the
flesh is weake,</hi> I speake this
for the comfort of the best
sort of Christians, that
thinke they are not set at

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17840:69"/>
they finde some
heavinesse, and dulnesse in

a man hath the Spirit

subdue sinne all at once, if
God saw it good, but God
will humble us while wee

therefore God sees it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to bring us to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to set up a combate in

Kings, to be freed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from them, but Kings
to strive against them: It
is a liberty to fight, and in
fighting to overcome at
last: When the <hi>Israelites</hi>
had a promise that God
would give their enemies
into their hands, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
was not that hee
would give them, without
fighting a blow, but I will
give them into your hands,
you shall fight and be of
good comfort, in fighting
you shall overcome, so
this liberty of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17840:70"/>
it is not a liberty that
we should have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
with our corruptions,
but a gracious liberty to
keepe them under, till by
subduing them by little
and little, we get a perfect
victory; what greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
can a man
have, to fight against his
enemie, then when he is
sure of the victory, before
he fights of finall victory,
you see then how the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
brings a liberty into
the soule, it brings us out
of that cursed kingdome
of Sathan and sinne, it
brings us out of the curse
of God, and the law in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and it brings
us from the dominion and
tyrannie of sinne, by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17840:71"/>
a Spirit of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But this is not all that
is in liberty,<note place="margin">Freedome from the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of sinne.</note> for the Spirit

followes it, there is some

and terrours of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp;c. they follow
sinne and death and wrath,
and such like, the subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to these: now where
the Spirit of God is, it
frees from the ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
from the tayle
that followes sinne; where
the Spirit is, it frees us
from feare, for the same
Spirit that tells us in justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
that God is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased,
the same Spirit
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17840:71"/>
frees us from the feare of
damnation, and death and
judgement, from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of an evill consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
being sprinkled with
the blood of Christ, we
are freed from feare.</p>
               <p>And it frees not onely
from the feare of ill
things,<note place="margin">Freedome to good things.</note> but it shewes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
and freedome to
good, liberty implies here
two things, a freedome
from ill, from a cursed
condition, and likewise a
liberty to a better, a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from ill, and to good,
we must take it in the just
latitude, because the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of Christ are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate,
not onely privative
but positive, not onely to
free us from ill, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre

all good to us, as
much as our nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of, as much as these
soules of ours are capable
of, they shall be made free
and glorious and happy in
heaven, God will leave no
part of the soule unfilled,
no corner of the soule
empty, by little and little
he doth it, as we shall see
in the next verse, when we
are called out of Sathans
kingdome we are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called out of that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
state, but we are made
free of a better kingdome,
we are mede the members
of Christ, we are infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised,
and so in justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we are not onely freed
from damnation, from the
justice and wrath of God,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17840:72"/>
but likewise wee can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead
our righteousnesse
whereby we have title to
heaven which is a blessed
priviledge, and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
we are not onely free
from the curse of the law,
but likewise wee have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gracious prerogatives
and priviledges, we are
not onely freed from the
dominion of sinne, but we
are likewise set at liberty
by the spirit, to doe that
that is good, wee have a
voluntary free spirit to
serve God with as great
chearefulnesse as we ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

law, so we have preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to good answerable,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17840:73"/>
we are now by the Spirit
set at liberty to delight in
the law, to make the law
our councellour, to make
the Word of God our

even as he that was a

we be in Christ, it scares
us to Christ, that law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
comes to bee a Tutor,

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17840:73"/>
come to delight in those
truthes, when they are
discovered to us in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

we know, the more wee
would know, because wee
would please God every

freedome from that that

               <p>That which we call free

the will is alway free in

freedome, for freedome it
is a dowrie upon the will,
invested upon the will,
that God never takes from
it, to doe it freely, that is
upon reason that it sees,
be it good or evill; so I

that wrote of this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is sound, and good,

altogether, without

the Spirit of God, <hi>Where
the Spirit is there is liberty.</hi>
Liberty as it is taken for
power and ability to doe
good. In a word, there is
alway a liberty of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
of the person, a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the understanding,
but not of the object, to
this or that thing, a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to supernaturall objects
comes from supernaturall
principles, nothing moves
above its owne spheare,
nothing is acted above its
owne activity, that God
hath put into it: now a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but naturally, for
nothing can worke above
it selfe, by its owne
strength, no more than a
beast can worke according
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17840:75"/>
to the principles of a man,
therefore the soule of man
hath no liberty at all to
that which is spiritually
good, without a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
principle, that ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it above it selfe, and
put it into the ranke of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
things.</p>
               <p>First the Spirit of God
puts a new life into the
soule of a man,<note place="margin">The Spirit puts a new life in us.</note> and then
when hee hath done that,
it preserves that life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all opposition, and
together with preserving
that life, it applyes that
inward life and power it
hath put into it, to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
workes, for when wee
have a new life, yet wee
cannot doe particular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
without the exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:17840:76"/>
power, of the Spirit
of God, the Spirit stirres
up to every particular
thing, when the soule
would be quiet of it selfe,
the moving comes from
the Spirit of God, as every
particular moving in the
body, comes from the
soule, so the Spirit it puts
a new life, it applyes that
life, it applyes the soule to
every action. Where the
Spirit of God therefore is
not,<note place="margin">And then applies it to action.</note> there is no liberty
to any supernaturall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but <hi>where the Spirit of
God is, there is liberty,</hi> It
followes both the negatively,
and affirmatively; there
is a liberty of will to that
that is good, so then this
riseth from hence, againe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17840:76"/>
that where the Spirit of
God is efficatious, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
in his working,
there it robbes not the
soule of liberty but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
that liberty.</p>
               <p>You have some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
(too many indeede)
that hold that the holy
Ghost,<note place="margin">The Spirit in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion doth more then perswade.</note> onely workes by
way of perswasion upon
the soule, and by way of
mooving as it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
but he doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the soule nor alter
and change the soule, hee
doth not worke upon the
soule as an inward worker,
but onely as an outward

and allurer, propounding
objects, and with objects
perswasions, and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17840:77"/>
this is too shallow
a conceite for so deepe a
businesse as this, for the
Spirit works more deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than so, it puts a new
life into the soule, it takes
away the stony heart, and
gives a fleshly heart; those
phrases of Scripture are
too weighty, to fasten
such a shallow sence upon
them, onely as to intreate
them to be converted, as
a man would intreate a
stone to be warme, and to
come out of its place, he
might intreate long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
but the Spirit with
that speech, it puts a new
life and power, and then
acts and stirres that power
to all that is good.</p>

the will, that we Will

the more effectually it

though God worke upon

when a man is set at liberty

chuse one thing, and not
many, yet of it selfe it hath
power to choose many
things: to make this cleere
a little, some creatures are
confined to one thing, out
of the narrownesse of the
parts they have, some are
confined to one thing out
of the largenesse of parts,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17840:81"/>
these seeme contrary, but
thus, I will give this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to make it cleere; the
creature that is unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is alway confined to

because they want under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to worke in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse

their nests, and Bees
make their hives alwayes

of their narrownesse, that
they have not choyse.</p>
               <p>Now when the Spirit
sets a man at liberty to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, he is confined to
good, especiall this is in
heaven, this is out of large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of understanding, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
many goods,
and many ills, and that
good that hee conceives to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:17840:81"/>
be the best good out of a

determined, to that one, so
that though the Spirit of
God take away as it were
that present liberty that a
man cannot doe ill, it will
not suffer him to be so bad
as he was, yet it leaves
him in a state of good to
doe a multitude of good
things. And then though
it confine him to a state of
happinesse, that he cannot
will the contrary, yet
here is no liberty taken a
way, because it is done out
of strength of knowledge,
not out of narrownesse,
because there is no more
things for him to judge,
but out of largenesse, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him this is the best of

all, and carries all the

               <p>What is the reason,
they are determined eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

Is it for want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that the Angels
choose not ill? No,<note place="margin">The Angels determined to that that is good.</note> they
know what ill is by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,

it is an idle objection and
a great stay of many that
are willing to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
oh if grace confine
a man, determine him, as

way perpetually, that hee
holds on to the end, and
leaves him not at liberty
to his will, this confining
and swaying one way, it
is an abridging him of his

comes not from weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of understanding,
but from strength of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

therefore on the contrary,
it is so farre from abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

this a worse liberty then
when a man cannot sinne,
so when the Spirit of God

therefore, the liberty of

and some order in the

the Spirit of God is with

there are the doores of

the Sacraments, that
we can all meete to call

truth, and these outward

God gives these outward

bestow, and to convey
Spirituall liberty: how
shall we come to Spirituall
liberty without unfolding
the Charter,<note place="margin">Spirituall liberty comes by outward liberty.</note> the Word of

hath established a ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Apostles, and Doctors,

Church, to the end of the

see where there is no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
liberty of unfolding
the Word, where there is
no outword liberty of the
ministery, there wants
this inward liberty: for
God by the preaching of
the Gospell, sets us at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>Againe when Christ
preached the Gospell
first, it was the yeere of
Iubile.<note place="margin">Yeere of Iubile in preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell.</note> Now in the yeare
of Iubile, all servants
were set at liberty, and
those that had not sold

recover them againe, if
they would: this Iubile
was a type of the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
liberty that the Gospel
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17840:87"/>
sets us at: those that have
served sinne, and Sathan
before, if they will regard
the gracious promises of
the Gospell, they may of
slaves of sinne and Sathan,
become the free men of
Iesus Christ. But in those
times some would be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
still, and would not
be set at liberty, their
eares were boared for
perpetuall slaves, and it is
pitty but their eares should
be boared for everlasting
slaves, that now in the
glorious Iubile of the
Gospell, resolve still to be
slaves. When a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of liberty was
made to come out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
all that would, many
would sticke there still;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17840:88"/>
so many are in love with
<hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
it is pitty but they

those that have more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

and here you see
how to come by it, <hi>Where
the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is liberty,</hi> and where
the ordinance of God is,
that is, the ministery of
the Spirit, there is the
Spirit, where these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

signe that God hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
to set men at
Spirituall liberty.</p>
               <p>Those therefore that

and it is an argument
that a man is in bondage
to Sathan, when hee is an
enemy any way of the

God, for it is an argument
that he is licentious, that
he will not be called to
Spirituall liberty, but live
according to the flesh,
when he will not heare of

as you have some kinde of

<hi>Let us breake their

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and cast away their

it is better that wee have
no preaching, no order at

all, but live every man as
he would, though they
speake not so in words,
yet their lives and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
carrige, shew that
they regard not outward
liberties, and that argueth
that they are in spirituall
bondage, and that they
have no interest in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
liberty, because they
are enemies of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
spirituall liberty is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Gospell
is set out by that phrase,<note place="margin">The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the kingdome of God, why?</note>
                  <hi>The Kingdome of God,</hi> not

is the Kingdome of God,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17840:89"/>
why? because with the

truth, Christ comes to
rule in the heart, by the

the spirituall kingdome,

               <p>Therefore those that
would have the spirituall

reigne for ever in heaven,
they must come by this

by the outward ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
the ordinance
brings them to grace, and
grace to glory, and it is a

and freed from the guilt of

when we can meekely and

desire to have his spirituall

and to have spirituall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
unfolded, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

when hee heares these

and a love, it is a signe
God loves his soule, and
that he hath interest in

he can improve the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<hi>Where the Spirit of the

And besides this liberty
in this world,<note place="margin">Liberty of glory.</note> there is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

the glorious liberty in

and we are free not from

thraldome to misery, but
then we shall be free from
the encounter and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
all teares shall be
wiped from our eyes, wee
shall be free from all hurt
of body, in sickenesse and

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17840:91"/>

And that we have by the

an earnest of that inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
an earnest penny,

therefore when by the

for God never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
of his bargaine that

grace in some sort
is glory, as we see in the

is the beginning of glory,
it frees the soule from ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,

the more courage he hath,

of this fire, by any

where it sets a man at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
indeed, it gathers
strength by opposition.
See how the Spirit tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
in the Martyres

speake not of the decree

of the thing it selfe, if hee
had said so much to Christ
and to God, he might have
found mercy, so let a man
be never so great a sinner,
if he can goe to God, and
spread his soule, and lay

this is one among

the Spirit of God stirres up

therefore the greatest men

they passe a censure

Christians should know,

the Spirit of God is,

he hath a Spirit that will

yet for outward conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

he is a servant to all,
to doe them good, love

Christ was the greatest

was both the servant of
God, and our servant: and
there is none so free, the

and the more freedome,
the more disposition to

so that the nature of God

therefore I beseech you

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17840:136"/>
God loved the world,</hi> the

how? we cannot tell how,
so as is beyond all expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
the Scripture it selfe

into the secrets of Gods

and shal not we study, and
admire these things that
God may have the glory,
God made all for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:17840:137"/>
therefore if we will make

not in word alone, but in

in life, conversing with
him.</p>

are treasured in Christ,
and Christ and all good

Nay God yet goes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               <p>The Gospel is the glasse,
wherein wee see this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Christ indeed in some

cannot see God out of

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:17840:147"/>

the Sunne in his glory that
is but a creature,<note place="margin">God must be seene in some glasse.</note> how can
we see God himselfe, but

we must see him in Christ,

               <p>These three goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">We cannot see Divine things but in a glasse.</note> the glory of God,
Christ the foundation of

Gospell of the Kingdome,
the Gospell of life, that
discovers the gracious
face of God shining in
Christ, we have Commu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion
with God through
Christ, with Christ
through the Gospell,
therefore in the Gospell
<hi>we behold as in a glasse the

               </p>
               <p>This is sutable to our
condition while we are
here below, we cannot see
divine things, otherwise
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:17840:149"/>
than in a glasse, that sight of
God that we shall have in
heaven, immediately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that is of a higher
nature, when our natures
shall be perfect, but while
we live here wee cannot
see God but in Christ, and
we cannot see him but in
the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
such is the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of our sight, and
such is the luster and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the object, the glory
of God, that we cannot
perfectly see it but in a
glasse; God saith to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
None can see me and
live,</hi> his meaning is none
can see me as I am, none
can see me immediatly and
live, if we would see God,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:17840:150"/>
and the glory of God
immediately without a
glasse, we must see it in
heaven, we must dye first,
we must passe through
death to see God face to
face as he is then, not as
he is, but more familiarly
than we can now, then
God will represent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
so as shall be for our
happinesse, though not
simply as he is, for he is
infinite, and how should
finite comprehend infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
we shall apprehend
him, but not comprehend
him: while we are in earth
therefore, we must bee
content to see him in a
glasse, which is the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
especially unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:17840:150"/>
Now in this word <hi>glasse</hi>
in which we see the glory
of God, is implyed both,</p>
               <p>A Perfection,</p>
               <p>And some Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Perfection, because it is
as a cleare Christall glasse
in regard of the glasse
that was before, for those
under the law saw Christ,
in a glasse of Ceremonies,
and as I sayd before, there
is difference betweene
ones seeing his face in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in a Christall
glasse, so then this implies
perfection in regard of the
former state.</p>
               <p>Againe in regard of
heaven it implyes imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
for there we shall
not see in a glasse, sight in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:17840:151"/>
a glasse is imperfect
though it be more perfect
than that in water: for
we know out of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of learning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that reflections
weaken, and the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
the more weake,
when wee see a thing by
reflection, we see it weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and when we see it by
a second reflection, from
that we see it more weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when we see the sunne
on the wall,<note place="margin">Sight, weak here, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> or any thing
that is light, it is weaker
than the light of the
sunne it selfe, when a man
seeth his face in a glasse,
it is a weaker representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than to see face to
face, but when we see the
sunne upon the wall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexing
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:17840:151"/>
upon another wall,
the third reflexion is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
than the first, the more
reflections the more
weake, so here all sight by
glasses is not so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as that sight and
knowledge which is face
to face, in heaven; that is
the reason that S. <hi>Iames</hi>
saith, that hee that seeth
his face in a glasse is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to forget, what is the
reason that a man cannot
remember himselfe, when
he seeth his face in a glasse
so well as he can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
another mans face
when he seeth it? because
he seeth himselfe onely
by reflection, therefore it
is a weaker presentation to
him, and the memory and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17840:152"/>
apprehension of it is
weaker, when he seeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
face to face, hee
remembers him longer,
because there is a more
lively representation, it is
not a reflection, but face
to face. So there is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in this sight
that wee have of God,
while wee are here as in a
glasse, it is nothing to that
when we shall see face to
face without the Word
and Sacraments or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Medium, which sight
what it is, we shall know
better when we are there,
we cannot now discover
it, it is a part of heaven
to know what apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
we shall have of God
there, but sure it is more
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:17840:152"/>
excellent than that that is
here, therefore this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
imperfection.</p>
               <p>We consist of body and
soule in this world,<note place="margin">Our soules helped by our sences.</note> and
our soules, are much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
and tyed to our
sences, imagination pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
to the soule grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things than the sences,
so God helpes the soule
by outward things that
worke upon the sences,
sence upon the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and so things passe
into the soule.</p>
               <p>God frames his manner
of dealing sutable to the
nature he hath created us
in, therefore he useth the
Word, and Sacraments
and such things whereby
hee makes impressions,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:17840:153"/>
upon the very soule it
selfe.</p>
               <p>And this indeed (by the
way) makes Spirituall
things so difficult as they
are oft times,<note place="margin">What makes spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult.</note> because wee
are too much inthralled to
imagination and sence, and
cannot abstract and raise
our minds from outward
sensible things to spirituall
things: therefore you have
some, all the dayes of
their life spend their time
in the barke of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and they are better
than some others that are
all for notion, and out side,
such things as frame to
the imagination, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come to know the
Spirit of the Scriptures,
but rest in outward things
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:17840:153"/>
in languages and tongues,
and such like, whereas
these things leade further,
or else they come not to
their perfection, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is but a glasse, to see
some other excellencies
in it,<note place="margin">Vse of a glasse.</note> 
                  <hi>We see as in a glasse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the use of a glasse
among us, especially is
two fold:</p>
               <p>It is either to helpe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
weakenesse of sight,<note place="margin">To helpe weake sight.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the excellencie of
the object, when there is a
weake sight, and an over
excellent object, then a
glasse is used, or some po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
and cleare body, as
we cannot see the sunne in
it selfe, the eye is weake,
and the sunne is glorious,
these two meeting; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:17840:154"/>
together we helpe it
by seeing the Sunne in
water as in an eclipse, if a
man would judge of an
eclipse, he must not looke
on the sunne, but see it in
water, and there behold
and discerne these things,
so to see the glory of God
in himselfe, it is too glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an object, our eyes
are too weake, how doth
God helpe it, he helpes it
by a glasse, by God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in the flesh, and by
the Word, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whereby we come
to have Communion with
Christ: to apply this more
particularly.</p>
               <p>Now that we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments glasses.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacraments are
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:17840:154"/>
glasses, wherein wee see
the glory of the love,
and mercy of God in
Christ: for take the bread
alone, as it doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present,
and figure better
things, and what is it? and
take the wine alone, as it
doth not represent better
things, and what is the
wine? but an ordinary
poore creature; Oh but
take them as they are gals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as things that convey
to the soule, and represent
things more excellent
than themselves, so they
are glorious ordinances,
take a glasse, as a glasse it is
a poore thing, but take
the glasse as it represents a
more excellent thing than
it selfe, so they are of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:17840:155"/>
use, so bread and
wine must not be taken as
naked elements, but as
they represent and convey
a more excellent thing
than themselves, that is
Christ and all his benefits,
the love, and mercy, and
grace of God in Christ,
and so they are excellent
glasses: therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you now when you
are to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
let your mindes be
more occupied than your
sences, when you take the
bread thinke of the body
of Christ broken, and
when you thinke of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the bread into one
substance, thinke of Christ
and you made one, when
the wine is powred out,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:17840:155"/>
thinke of the blood of
Christ powred out for
sinne, when you thinke of
the refreshing by the wine,
thinke of the refreshing of

and of the love of Christ,
that did not spare his

good, how doth Christ
crucified, and shedding his

soule, as wine refresheth
the weake Spirits, thus
consider them as glasses,
where better things are

creates, and workes in

               <p>There are many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

they are a booke <hi>in folio,</hi>

and what he will have
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:17840:158"/>
from us againe, there wee

he saw it, was willing to

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:17840:158"/>
he had enough, but that
outward sight is nothing
without another inward

               <p>There is a sight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of faith,<note place="margin">Of faith.</note> and other
sights are to no purpose if
they be without this, a

as hee is: Now there is a
comfort in all these sights
to see him in his Word
and workes, it was a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
thing to see him in

by faith to see God in

God shining in Christ, oh
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:17840:159"/>
but what is all this to the
sight of him after in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
Now this beholding
meant here especially, is
the beholding of faith in
the Ordinances, in the
Word and Sacraments;
<hi>We all behold,</hi> as in the

faith; faith is expressed
by beholding, by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
for indeede faith is
nothing but knowledge

faith includes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
what is faith but o

knowledge, with appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:17840:159"/>
is faith, therefore,

for many reasons.</p>
               <p>First, because sight is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the most g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the highest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
so it is with faith, it
is the most noble sight of
all, and it is quicke as sight
is, for faith is that Eagle
in the cloud, it breakes
through all, and sees in a
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:17840:160"/>
moment Christ in heaven,
it lookes backeward, and
sees Christ upon the crosse
it lookes forward, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Christ to come in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
faith is so quicke a
grace, that it presents
things past, things above,
things to come, and all in

this Eagle-eye of Faith.</p>

then hearing, therefore,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:17840:160"/>
that divine act of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is compared to see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
beleeving is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to beholding, when
faith lookes upon God in
the glasse of the word, and
promises, it is as certaine
as the object is certaine;
Now how certaine is the
object? the mercy, and
love of God in Christ,
who is truth it selfe, is
most certaine.</p>
               <p>Then it is that sence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
that workes most upon

the knowledge that

is compared to sight, it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects

it alters the frame of the

expressed here, by behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
divine, spirituall
knowledge, it workes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the heart. So wee see
why this beholding spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
of the understanding,
and soule is compared to
outward sight, it is called
beholding, because it is a

of the soule, and it is most

that perish, that are lost,
in whom the god of this

therefore take heed of too
much worldly things, of
fixing our soules upon the
dust of the world, upon
things here below, the
sight of Christ, and of
God in Christ, it is not

by fixing the soule upon

is that the divell rules in,

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:17840:185"/>
there is a power, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to beleeve in God,
and to be holy, and to

actions of love Spring
from that power, we live
and then we have a power
to move in nature, being,
and life, and moving goe
together, so if wee have a
being in grace, we have a
power to move; I beseech
you therefore consider
the necessity of a change,
of the inward man, of the
powers, &amp; faculties of the

                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:17840:185"/>
And especially the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
and change is in
the will,<note place="margin">The change es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on the will.</note> which some
would have untouched
they would have it free,
those that would have no

needes must, but grace
workes upon the will
most of all, divinity rules
the will especially: for
the bent of the will makes
a good, or a bad man, and
the desires of the will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the whole man with it,
we are as the bent is of our
will, we are as the choyse
of our will is, if the choyse
and bent, and by as be the

it is good; if the will bee
not inclined, and wrought
to goe the best way, there
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:17840:186"/>
is no worke of grace at
all, though all grace come
in through the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
enlightned, that is the
first, yet it goeth into the
will, it passeth through the
understanding into the
will, and it puts a new
taste, and rellish upon the
will, and affections.</p>
               <p>Well you see therefore
that the grace wrought in
the Gospell, it is not a
meere perswasion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
&amp;c. but a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
worke of the Spirit
entring into the soule, and
changing it, and altering
and turning the bent, and
inclination of the will
heaven-ward, whereas by

turnes the soule downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:17840:186"/>
to things below,
when the Spirit of God
entreth into the soule, it
is not onely by meere out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
perswasion, to leave
it to the liberty of will,
but it altereth the taste of
the will, the soule is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

as though it used it not,
we must have great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites
to the worke of

great words of it, it is an

man, a new creature, new

of a change.</p>
               <p>Againe another reason <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
is this,<note place="margin">God quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies whom he digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</note> God where he cals

change them? No, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he calls to glory he
changeth, and altereth

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:17840:187"/>
as a Christian is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

God hath set such a stamp

the alteration is in growth

still, though it be darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by his carelessenesse,
yet after it receives a fresh
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:17840:192"/>
stampe, it is an everlasting
stampe, when once wee
are Gods coyne, wee are
never reprobate silver, and
all is, because we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
according to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage

is firmely set in our nature

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:17840:193"/>
wee being predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to salvation, it was
fit we should be predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to be conformable to
our elder brother, that
brethren might bee of one
nature and disposition, it is
fit that the husband and
wife should be of one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
Christ is the
husband, and wee are the
Spouse, therfore by grace
he alters, and cleanseth,
and purgeth his Spouse, as
it is, <hi>Ephe. 5. He loved his
Spouse, and gave himselfe
for it, that he might purge
it, and make it a glorious
Spouse.</hi> It is meete the wife
should be the glory of the
husband, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith,
that is, that she should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
the excellencies of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:17840:193"/>
her husband; therefore
that the Church might be
the glory of Christ, and
reflect the excellencies of
Christ, she is changed to
bee like Christ more and
more daily, there is a kind
of congruity that brethren
should be like, and that the
Spouse and the Husband
should be alike, therefore
God hath ordained that
we should be like him in a
threefold degree, in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
in grace, and in glory,
whosoever will bee like
him in glory, must be like
him in grace, first Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
and ordaining
must have its issue, that is,
the representation of the
likenesse of Christ in our

of heaven, so his

heavenly, and holy in

did not returne injury for

he was; I give you but a
touch of every particular,
you may by proportion
apply the rest, he was in

<hi>avoyd Sathan:</hi> wee see
Christ when hee encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
Sathan, he fights not
with Sathans weapons,
and when he was to deale
with his instruments, but
with the Word of God,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:17840:200"/>
he gives not reproach for

for sophistrie, but <hi>It is
written,</hi> shewing that we
must encounter Sathan
with Gods armorie, with
weapons out of the booke
of God.</p>
               <p>And then when Sathan
would confesse him, and
make much of him, <hi>Oh
thou art the Sonne of God,</hi>
he would have nothing to
doe with him, so those
that are manifestly led
with the Spirit of Sathan,
and would presse kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
on us, have nothing
to doe with them so farre:
as we say of the devill, he
is not alway a lyer, but he
alway cozeneth, so take
those that are lead by the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:17840:201"/>
Spirit of the devill, that
are Iesuited Papists, they
lye not in all, but there is
cozening in all, for all is
but snaring kindnesse and
gifts that will hurt more,
all offers from Sathan,
and those that are led with
the Spirit of Sathan, wee
ought to suspect, as Christ
we see when Sathan offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him a kindnesse, hee
saw he was to bee tooke
heed of, therefore saith he
<hi>away,</hi> you and your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
so have nothing to

those are best at ease, and

those that see they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
deceivers though
they be not alway lyers,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:17840:201"/>
those that are nearest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility

you see a taste of Christs

and for hypocrites hee
speakes <hi>Woe</hi> to them,<note place="margin">To Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</note> he

let me consider what

our blessed Saviour would

he would not bee

Art thou a Christian or

thou must expresse Christ,
that as thou art partaker

be partaker of his anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
if thou be a Christian
why doest thou thus? doth
this suite with thy profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
dost thou carry the

dost thou thinke to bee a

No, there is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
but if he be a true

into the likenesse of

therefore it is a good

what would my blessed

therefore let us shame our

               <p>There were these two

have the same affection

               <p>I cannot but hate sinne,
and hating sinne, I must act
his part anew, that is, as
he dyed for sinne, so I dye
to sinne, as hee was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for it, so it is crucified
in me, as he was peirced,
so hee gives corruption a

is buryed, and as he dyed

so I follow my sinnes to

consumption of old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
that hee never riseth
againe, so I say, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of my union
with Christ, that I in
Christ did dye, and was
crucified, because my head
dyed, and was crucified.
And then it puts that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
into mee that was in

these, &amp; the like thoughts

               <p>So by the vertue of his

the power of Gods Spirit

raised him up, when hee

God by that power that
raised Christ at the lowest,
recovers and strengthens
him, and makes him afresh
revenge himselfe upon his
sinne, and when hee is at

the same power will raise
him like Christ every

               <p>How shall wee know

               <p>If wee be changed into

to judge of

things as he did, his ayme

of grace, and of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the soule is more

that he passed upon things:
<hi>Seeke ye first the Kingdome

must bee changed in our
judgement, if we will have
his Image upon us. Wee
must bee like him in our

must be edged, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

we must love, and

               <p>Now the way to stirre

and to see our selves in

Christs Image be not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

make him labour to get

For beloved at the day of

If Christ see his

or else not. Naturally we
are all opposite to Christ,
naturally wee are full of
pride and mallice, of the
spirit of the world, and the

not owne us at the day of

               <p>Againe, the law of God

heart, it is expressed, and
coppyed out, there see
our selves, there see all the

guilty of the breach of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

wee understand the law
spiritually, that desire of
women, and revengefull
thoughts, are murther,

the law spiritually, and see
our selves in that glasse,
see our selves utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
this will make

<pb n="421" facs="tcp:17840:219"/>
Christ it was holy, it was
a suffering flesh, and then
a glorious flesh, now it is
glorious, so our nature
must be like this Image, it
must be sanctified flesh, by
the same Spirit that san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
the masse that hee
was made of in the
wombe, it must be suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
flesh, in conformity
to him, for the flesh that
he tooke was suffering
flesh, and he had a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of patience before
he had a Kingdome of
glory, so we must goe
through a Kingdome of
patience to the Kingdome
of glory &amp; then upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in holinesse with
Christ, comes our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in glory, when wee
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:17840:220"/>
are content to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to Christ in our suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
flesh, then wee shall
be conformed to Christ in
our glorious flesh, for our
flesh must be used as his
was, it must be holy and
patient, and suffering, and
then it shall be glorious,
so in all things we must
looke to Christ first, hee
must have the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</p>
               <p>Beloved of all contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations
under heaven,
there is no contemplation
so sweete and powerfull,
as to see God in Christ,
and to see Christ first aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for us, and our selves
abased in Christ, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
in Christ, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
in Christ, and then
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:17840:220"/>
rayse our thoughts a little
higher, see our selves
made by little and little
glorious in Christ, see our
selves in him rising, and
ascending, and sitting at
the right hand of God, in
heavenly places, see our
selves by a Spirit of
faith, in heaven already
with Christ, what a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sight and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is this? If wee first
looke upon our selves
what we are, we are as
branches cut off from the
tree, as a river cut off from
the spring that dyes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
what is in us but we
have it by derivation from
Christ, who is the first,

that shine upon us, we are
as branches cut off, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now to see Christ,
and our selves in Christ,
this transformes us to bee

that can be.</p>
               <p>We see this change is

the beholding the glory

certainely the eye of faith

of Christ.</p>
               <p>Especially upon this
ground,<note place="margin">Vpon what ground we are changed by behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> that when wee
looke upon Christ, and
God in Christ, we see our
selves there, in the love of
Christ, and in the love of
God, and thereupon wee
are moved to be changed
to Christ, not by seeing
Christ alone, or by seeing
God in Christ alone, but
by seeing Gods love in
Christ to us, and Christs
love to us, for the Spirit
of faith which is given to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Gospell,
it sees Christ giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
for me, and sees God
the Fathers love in me in
Christ, and giving me to
Christ, when the Spirit of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:17840:223"/>
faith with this appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
seeth God mine in
Christ, and seeth Christ
mine, and sees my selfe in
the love of God, and in
the love of Christ, hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the soule is stirred up
from a holy desire, to bee
like Christ Iesus, that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me so much, and to
be conformable to God
all I can: For if the person
be great and glorious, and
our friend too, there is a
naturall desire to be like
such to imitate them, and
expresse them all we can.
Now when wee see our
selves in the love of God
and Christ, out of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing it selfe, it
will stirre us up to be like
so sweete, and gracious,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:17840:224"/>
and loving a Saviour.</p>
               <p>There are three sights
that hath a wondrous effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casie,<note place="margin">Three effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catious sights.</note>
and they goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>God sees us in Christ,
and therefore loves us, as
we are in Christ.</p>
               <p>Christ sees us in the love
of his father, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
loves us as hee sees us
in his fathers love.</p>
               <p>Wee see our selves in
Christ, and see the love of
God to us in Christ, these
three sights are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all comfort, God
gives us to Christ, and sees
us as given to him, in his
election, Christ sees us as
given of the Father, as you
have it <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. And loves
us as wee are loved of the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:17840:224"/>
Father, and then sees us
as his owne members, and
wee by a Spirit of Faith
see Christ, and see our
selves in Christ, and given
to Christ by the Father,
hereupon comes a desire
of imitation and expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Iesus Christ, when
we see our selves in Christ
God lookes upon us in
Christ, and we looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our selves in Christ,
and when we looke upon
the mercy of God in
Christ, it kindleth love,
and love kindleth love, as
fire kindleth fire: Fire hath
that quality, that it turnes
all to it selfe. Now the
meditation of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
love of God in Christ
it workes love, and love is
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:17840:225"/>
an affection of changing,
love transformes as fire
doth, the love of God
warmes us, and wee are
fit for all impressions, as
things that are warme, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
is a dull and heavy
thing, yet when it is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it is bright, and ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and hath as much as
may be, of the nature of
fire imprinted upon it, so
our dead, and dull, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible,
and unyeelding
soules become mallyable,
and flexible by the love
of Christ shining upon
them, his love transformes
them, and kindles them,
so here is the way, how
the glory of Gods love in
Christ transformes us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the discovery of the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:17840:225"/>
bowels of mercy in God
towards us, kindles love
to him, and that being
kindled it workes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
for love to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
transformes us, it
workes a desire to be like
those that are great, where
there is dependance, there
is a desire to be like, even
among men, much more
considering that God so
loves our nature in Christ,
and that our nature is so
full of grace in Christ as
it is, the love of God in
Christ, that hath done so
much for us, it breedes a
desire to be like Christ in
our disposition, all wee
can.</p>
               <p>By looking to the glory
of God in Christ, wee see
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:17840:226"/>
Christ, as our husband,
and that breedes a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in us, to have the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of a Spouse, wee
see Christ as our head, and
that breedes a disposition
in us, to be members like
him.</p>

               <p>For beloved, as there
must be a change, so it is
in this order, from behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the mercy of God in
Christ, for can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that any soule can see
it selfe in the glasse of
Gods love in Iesus Christ,
that it should see in the
Gospell Christ, and in
him, God reconciled unto

him in particular, but that
soule out of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Gods love in
Christ, will love God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and be altered and
changed? It is impossible
such a sight therefore,
whereby we see our selves
in this glasse, as when we
looke in a glasse and see
our owne Image, we see
our owne selves in Christ,
and the love of God, such
a sight altereth and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
alway, it works love,
and love is the worker of
imitaiton:<note place="margin">Love workes i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation.</note> for what doth
make one labour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
another, in their
disposition, carriage, and
conversation? Oh it is
love, as children imitate
their Parents, love is full
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:17840:227"/>
of invention, and of this
kinde of invention, that it
studdies to please the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
loved, as much as it
can every way, hereupon
we come to be desirous to
be like Christ, because we
see the glory of Gods
mercy shining in Christ.</p>
               <p>The adversaries of the
grace of God, they fall
foule upon us, because we
preach justification by the
free mercy, and love of
God in Christ; Oh say
they, this is to dead the
spirits of men, that they
have no care of good
workes.</p>
               <p>Beloved, can there bee
any greater insentive, and
motive in the world, to
sanctification, to expresse
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:17840:228"/>
Christ, and to studdy
Christ, then to consider
what favour and mercy
wee have in Christ? how
we are justified, and freed
by him, by the glorious
mercy of God in Christ?
there cannot be a greater,
therfore we see here, they
depend one upon another,
by seeing in the glasse of
the Gospell, the glory of
God, we are transformed
from glory to glory: An
excellent glasse the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
is, by seeing Gods
love in it, wee are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
The Law is a glasse
too, but such a glasse as
Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speakes of,
that when a man lookes
into it, and sees his duty,
he goes away, and forgets
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:17840:228"/>
all, the Law discovers our
sinne and misery. Indeed
it is a true glasse, if wee
looke there, wee shall see
the true picture of old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
and of corruption, but
it is such a glasse as workes
nothing upon us, but when
this glasse is held out by
the Ministers of the word,
whose office it is to hold
the glasse to people, when
they see the love of God
in Christ, this is a chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
transforming glasse, to
make them that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and disfigured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that bore upon them
the image of Sathan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
now to be transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be like Christ, by
whom they must bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Is there any studdy
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:17840:229"/>
in the world, therefore
more excellent then that
of the Gospell, and of the
mercy of God in Christ,
that transformes &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
men from one degree
of grace to another, as it
followes in the Text.</p>
               <p>Therefore, those that
finde themselves to be the
old men still that have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in corrupt courses, and
doe so still, let them not
thinke to have any benefit
by the Gospell, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves, they
never knew God: for hee
that saith he hath commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God, and walkes
in darkenesse, hee is a lyer,
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> gives him the
lye, for God is light, how
can a man see himselfe in
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:17840:229"/>
the love of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in a darke state op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to love, will it not
alter a man? It will not
suffer him to live in sinnes
against conscience, let no
man that doth so, thinke
he hath benefit by Christ,
that knowledge is but a
notionall knowledge, a
speculation, a swimming
knowledge, it is not a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wheresoever the
knowledge of God in
Christ is to purpose, there
is a change, and conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whole man,
there is a new judgement,
and new affections, the
bent and byas of them is
another way then they
were before, there is a
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:17840:230"/>
change which is called a
turning in the Scripture,
those things that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them before, are now
behind them, and those
things that were behind
them,<note place="margin">Repentance a turning.</note> are now before
them, whereas they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their backe upon God
and good things, now
they turne their faces,
they looke God-ward,
and Heaven-ward, and to
a better condition; for
this change is nothing else
but a conversion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a man may say as hee
said, <hi>I am not I,</hi> those that
have seene Christ, it makes
them differ from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
this sight workes a

               <p>If there were not a

looke to him, that will not
have us, in a state of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
he hath not

but to perfection; and he
hath called us not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,

he hath elected us to

us to be spotlesse, not to

we are called and elected
to perfection, therefore
there is no standing at a

be a perpetuall growth,
it is our disposition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and endeavour it still.</p>
               <p>For beloved it is that
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:17840:261"/>
that is inbred to all things
that are imperfect, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
to perfection, till they
come to their <hi>ubi,</hi> to their
pitch, we see it in graine,
weake graine, till it come
to the full growth, it
breakes through clods,
through harder things
than it selfe, there is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in corne and seedes,
that have a beginning of
life in their kinde in them,
till those seedes come to
growth, they put out
themselves with a great
deale of strength against
opposition, so grace is of
such a strong nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
intended by God to
perfection, it will not rest
in meane beginnings, but
puts it selfe forward still,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:17840:262"/>
and breakes through op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position:
I will not stand
upon the common place
of growth in grace, it is
a large discourse, and I
touched it upon many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
you see the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of it, there must be a
growth from glory to
glory.</p>
               <p>A growth not in parts
as we say, for at the first
regeneration, in the first
beginning, when we are
gracious, there is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of a new life, and
there is the seedes of all
graces, but especially this
growth is in intention, and
extention, grace growes
more and more in strength
and extends, and reacheth
it selfe further and further
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:17840:262"/>
to the use of many; grace
growes I say in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it selfe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
and reacheth it
selfe to the use of more,
the more a Christian lives,
when he is in a right state,
and frame as a Christian
should be, he is of more
strength in all particular
graces, and doth the more
good, and shines more in
his life and conversation
to others.</p>
               <p>And likewise as there
is a growth in intention,
and extention, so there is
a growth in the quality
and purity of grace: for
the longer a man lives,
those graces that he hath
grow more refined; when
a Christian is but a new
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:17840:263"/>
Christian, he tasts much
of the old stocke, as all
fruite at the first will
taste of the stocke,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> so
there is no fruite of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
that comes
from a man, at his first
conversion, but it tasts a
great deale of old <hi>Adam,</hi>
it savours of the old stock,
the more hee live, and
growes spirituall, the more
that that comes from him
relisheth of the Spirit, the
more refined is his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the more refined is
his love, the more refined
from selfelove, his joy

an objection by the way,
an old man seemes not to

not to be so good a man,
not to be so zealous, as
when he was young, not

                  </label> Beloved, in those that
are young,<note place="margin">Grace more refined in aged Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note> there is a great
deale of nature joyned
with a little grace, and
that grace in them makes
a greater expression, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is carryed with
the current of nature, but
in age it is more refined,
that that is, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
they have is more
pure, and more setled,
and that love and affection
is more refined, there is
lesse selfe-love, and that
zeale they have it is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with more heavenly

there be lesse heate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that it doe not worke
in outward demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the eye of the
world, yet it is more refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and pure, so grace
growes thus likewise in
the purity and perfection
of it; Not altogether pure,
for somewhat will sticke
to our best performances,
savouring of the worst
principle in nature, for as
we carry flesh and spirit
alway, so that that comes
from them will savour of
corruption, yet lesse in a
growne Christian, that is
a father in Christianity
than in another.</p>

every thing is glorious in

in us, that others may

when we are not like

with the winde of every

afterwards it spends the

that it makes men more

and perfections, all is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
at once to him,
therefore he gives one
name to the whole state
of grace, grace and glory,
all is glory, I beseech you
therefore, if there be any
goodnesse, any blessed
change in us, let us be
comforted; for he that
hath brought us to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of glory, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
faile, till hee hath
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:17840:274"/>
brought us to perfect glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in heaven, and there
our change shall rest, there
is no further change there,
when we are once in our
element.</p>
               <p>For even as God, when
he made man, he rested
from all his worke upon
the Sabboth,<note place="margin">No change in Heaven.</note> man was his
excellent peece; so the
Spirit of God will rest
sanctifying and altering of
us, when we are once in
Heaven, in that eternall
Sabboth, then wee shall
neede no changes from
glory to glory, wee shall
for ever be filled with the
fulnesse of God, till which
time there is no creature,
in the world so changable
as a Christian.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:17840:275"/>
For, first you see hee
was made in Gods Image,
and likenesse in his state of
standing:</p>
               <p>After he fell there was a
change, to his second state
of sinne.</p>
               <p>After the state of fall,
there is a change to the
state of grace.</p>
               <p>After that, from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of grace to another
in this world till hee dye,
and</p>
               <p>Then the soule is more
perfect and glorious, but
at the last, when body
and soule shall be united,
there shall bee no more
change, there shall bee an
end of all alteration.</p>
               <p>So we see that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
by his spirit to bring
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:17840:275"/>
us to perfection, though
by little and little, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

let us learne this to

               <p>Therefore it is base in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity

but strength too,
and is it not so much more
in the new creature, in the

there will be a desire to
have health, that our sicke

more healed, that our

be not weake languishing

grace to cure our soules

carrying us to a further

               <p>The more wee grow
in grace, the more God
smells a sweete sacrifice
from us, that that comes
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:17840:281"/>
from us is more refined,
and lesse corrupt, it yeelds
better acceptance to
God.</p>
               <p>And then for others,
the more wee grow in

being carryed with

               <p>The more we grow in

are, the better we may be;
the more we doe, the

God further instills the

strength and cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

that they come off with

to glory, and that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to stirre us up to

here which is grace, tends
to glory in heaven, wee
should never rest till wee
come to that perfection,
till the glory of grace, end

               <p>But put the case indeed
that Christians decay in
their first love, and in
some grace, there is a
suspension of growth, it
is that they may grow in
some other graee; God
sees it needefull they
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:17840:283"/>
should grow in the roote,

and there is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
in Gods government
in that kinde, that God
often increaseth grace by
the sight, and sense of our
infirmities: God shewes
his powerfull govenment
in our weakenesse, for
Gods children never hate
their corruption more
than when they have
beene overcome by it,
then they begin to be
sensible of it, that there
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:17840:284"/>
is some hidden corruption
that they discerned not,
before that it is fit they
should take notice off, the
best man living knowes
not himselfe till he comes
to temptation, that disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
himselfe to himselfe,
temptation discovers cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and makes it
knowne, and then stirres
up hatred for it, as love
stirres up indeavour, so
hatred aversation, and
loathing: It is profitable
for Gods children to fall
sometimes, they would
never be so good as they
are else, they would not
wash for spots, but when
they see they are foule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
then they goe to
wash, but this is a mystery
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:17840:284"/>
God will have it so for

               <p>It checkes the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some good people
they thinke they have not
grace, because they have
but a little, this phrase
shewes that we have not
all at once, God carries us
by degrees, <hi>from glory to
glory,</hi> from one degree
of grace to another, Gods
children when they have
truth of grace wrought in
them, their desires goe
beyond their endeavour
and strength, their desires
are wondrous large, and
their prayers are answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their desires, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the Lords prayer,
what say we? <hi>Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
come, thy will be done
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:17840:285"/>
in earth as it is in heaven;</hi>
can it be so in this world?
No, but we must pray till
we come to it, we must
pray till we come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
where prayer shall
cease, so the prayers, and
desires of Gods people
transcend their indeavours
their prayers are infinite:
hereupon the chiefe thing
in conversion being the
desire, the turning of the
streame of the will, when
they finde their will and
desire good, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to fall short of
their purposes, they say
surely I have no good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have not that I

all were framed by the

               <p>It is a comfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration

stands upon the unity of

It is said here, <hi>By the
Spirit of the Lord,</hi> that is,
of Christ, Because Christ
doth <hi>spirare,</hi> as well as
the Father: the Father
doth <hi>spirare,</hi> and the Son
doth breath, the Holy

therefore the Spirit is not

we see here, <hi>The Spirit of
the Lord.</hi> Christ sends the

<hi>The Lord is that Spirit,</hi> that

here the Spirit is said to be

even as it was in naturall

he was lead by the holy

it is in Christ mysticall,
that is, in the Church, all

conceived to be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:17840:307"/>
by the Spirit, the same
Spirit that sanctified him
sanctifieth us: but first the
Spirit by way of Vnion
sanctifieth us, by knitting
us to him the head of all,
and then unction comes
after union, annoynting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
union, then the Spirit
when he hath knit us to
Christ, workes the same
annoynting that he did in
Christ. Therefore we are
called Christians of Christ
not onely partakers of the
naked name, but of the
annoynting of Christ, that
annoynting that runnes
downe the head of our
spirituall <hi>Aaron,</hi> to the
skirts, to every poore
Christian. All change, all
comfort, all peace, is from
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:17840:308"/>
the Spirit of Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
give him the glory
of all, if wee Finde any
comfort in any truth, it
comes not from us, but
from his Spirit, and wee
must goe upward to him
againe, as all descends
from heaven, from the
Father of lights, and from
the Spirit of God, so all

him the prayse of all.
And one worke of the
Spirit is to carry our soules
up: for the Spirit as it
comes from heaven to
change us, so it carries us
up againe to view, and to
imitate Christ, to be where
Christ is, as water when

the spring of those graces,
the holy Ghost is out of

there is no goodnesse in

the Spirit his due, and

the worke of the Spirit,
there are severall workes
of the Spirit, you see here
what the Spirit doth, <hi>We
all,</hi> the Spirit unites us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
it is a Spirit of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
it knits all together
by one faith to God, all
meete in God the Father
reconciled, and we all are
joyned together by love,
wrought by the Spirit,
<hi>With open face,</hi> who takes
away the vayle? wee are
all vayled by nature, the
Spirit takes away the vaile
from our eyes, and from
the truth, what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the Gospell is so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure?
the Spirit takes not
away the vaile, it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:17840:326"/>
not by the Ministery,
or else it takes not away
the vaile from the eyes,
the Spirit takes away the
scales from our eyes, and
the Spirit in the ministery
takes away the obscurity
of the Scriptures, all those
that wee call graces, the
free gifts, the ministeriall
gifts, they are the gifts
and the graces of the
Spirit, and they are for
the graces of the Spirit,
skill in tongues, and in the
Scriptures, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
learning, are given to
men that they may take
away the vaile from the
the Scriptures, that they
may be lightsome, and
then when the Spirit is
given, he takes away the
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:17840:327"/>
vaile from the soule by his
owne worke, and then
with open face, we behold
the glory of the Lord:
What doth open our eyes
to see, when the vaile is
taken off? the Spirit; wee
have no inward light nor
sight, but by the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit, all light
in the things, and all sight
in us, it is by the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit. And
then the change accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Image of
Christ, this is altoge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by the Spirit of Christ, it
is altogether from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>With the Holy Ghost,
and with fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by blood, to dye for

us, and by water, by his
Spirit to change us, and
purge and cleanse us: all is
by the Spirit, Christ came
as well by the Spirit as by
blood. This change and
the graduall change from
glory to glory, all is by
the Spirit; therefore wee
should not thinke altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Christ, or God the
Father, when we goe to
God in prayer, but thinke
of the worke of the Spirit,
that the holy Ghost may
have his due.</p>
               <p>Lord without thy
Spirit my body is as a
thing without a soule, a
dead, loathsome, stiffe,
unapt, carkasse, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stirre a whit; and so
my soule without the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:17840:328"/>
of thy holy Spirit,
it is a stiffe, dead, unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thing, and therefore
by thy Spirit breath upon
me, as thy holy Spirit in
the creation did lye upon
the waters, and brood as
it were all things there,
lying upon the waters it
fashioned this goodly
creature, heaven, and
earth, this <hi>Mundus,</hi> so the
Spirit of God lying upon
the waters of the soule,
it fashions all graces, and
comforts whatsoever they
are, all is wrought by the
Spirit in the new creature,
as all in this glorious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke
of the world was
by the Spirit of God.
Let the Spirit of God
therefore have due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement,
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:17840:328"/>
in all
things whatsoever.</p>
               <p>And what are we to
looke to mainely now?
the knowledge of God
the Father, and his love
to us shining in Christ,
all is in Christ, and if we
would have any thing
wrought in us, any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of our natures, let
us begge the Spirit that
we may have the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the love of God in
Christ, &amp; the Spirit atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon the Gospell.</p>
               <p>And because we have
all these aboundantly in
these latter times, of the
Church, in the second
spring of the Gospell, in
the reformation of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
after our recovery out
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:17840:329"/>
of Popery, there is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
spring of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
oh belovd, how
much are we beholding
to God? never since the
beginning of the world
was there such glorious
times as we enjoy. Wee
see how the holy Apostle
doth preferre these times,
before former times,
when the vayle was upon
their eyes, and when all
was hid in ceremonies,
and types, and such things
among the lewes, <hi>Now</hi>
saith he, <hi>we behold the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, and are changed
by the Spirit from glory to
glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude all,<note place="margin">Whence the glory of times and places is.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
consider that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the times, and the
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:17840:329"/>
glory of places, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
all is from the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Christ by the
Spirit, which hath the
Spirit accompanying it:
the more God in Christ
is layd open, the more the
times and places, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
are excellent. What
made the second temple
beyond the former?
Christ came at the second
temple, therefore though
it were baser in it selfe,
yet the second Temple
was more glorious than
the first: what made <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelem</hi>
that little City
glorious? Christ was
borne there: what makes
the heart where Christ is
borne, more glorious than
other folke? Christ is
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:17840:330"/>
borne there, Christ makes
persons and places glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
What makes the
times now more glorious
than they were before
Christ? what made the
least in the Kingdome of
heaven, greater than <hi>Iohn
Baptist?</hi> he was greater
than all that were before
him, and all that are after
him, are greater than he,
because his head was cut
off, he saw not the death
and resurrection of Christ,
and the giving of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, he saw not so
much of Christ, so that
the revelation of Christ,
and the love of God in
Christ, it is that that makes
times, and persons, and
places glorious, all glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:17840:330"/>
because the vayle is
taken away from our eyes,
we see Christ the King of
glory in the Gospell flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,
and the love of
God manifested, and by
the Spirit of God the
vayle is taken away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
now for a fuller
discovery of Christ than
in former times,<note place="margin">Why more are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</note> comes
the glory of the times,
now there are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
than in former
times, because the Spirit
goes together with the
manifestation of Christ:
what is the reason that
this Kingdome is more
glorious than any place
beyond the Seas? because
Christ is here revealed
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:17840:331"/>
more fully than there, the
vayle is taken off, and here
<hi>we see the glory of God with
open face,</hi> which changeth
many thousands from glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to glory, by the Spirit
of God, that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the revelation of the
Gospell; Is there any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thing that advanceth
our Kingdome, before
<hi>Turkey,</hi> or <hi>Spaine? &amp;c.</hi> No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
thing, their government,
and riches, and outward
things, are as much as ours
if not more: the glory of
places and times are from
the revelation of Christ,
that hath the Spirit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
of it, that
Spirit changeth us <hi>from
glory to glory,</hi> our times
are more glorious than
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:17840:331"/>
they were a hundred
yeeres or two before,
why? because we have
a double revelation of
Christ, and of Antichrist;
we see Christ revealed,
and the Gospell opened,
and the vayle taken off, we
see Antichrist revealed
that hath masked under
the name of head of the
Church, and hath seduced
the world.</p>
               <p>Now this double reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
challengeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of these
blessed times: what should
all this doe, but stirre us
up to know the time of
our visitation, &amp; to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
to blesse God
that hath reserved us for
these places, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:17840:332"/>
that we live in, to cast
our times to be in this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
light of the Gospell
to be borne in; what if we
had beene borne in those
darke Egyptian times of
Popery? our lives had
not beene so comfortable,
Now we live under the
Gospell, wherein <hi>with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen 
face,</hi> we see the glory
of the mercy of God in
Christ, the unsearchable
riches of Christ opened,
and discovered to us. And
together with the Gospell
the ministery of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
goeth the Spirit, and
those that belong to God,
thousands by the blessing
of God are changed from
glory to glory.</p>
               <p>Certainely if we share
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:17840:332"/>
in the good of the times
we will have hearts to
thanke God,<note place="margin">The danger of unprofitablenesse under meanes.</note> and to walke
answerably, that as wee
have the glorious Gospell
so we will walke glorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that we doe not by a
base and fruitlesse life,
dishonour so glorious a
Gospell: I beseech you
let us thinke of the times,
else if we be not the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the glorious times,
if the vayle be not taken
away, we are under a
fearefull judgement, <hi>The
god of this world hath
blinded our eyes,</hi> doe wee
live under the glorious
light, and yet are darke,
that wee see no glory in
Christ, we see nothing in
religion, but are as ready
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:17840:333"/>
to entertaine Popery as
true religion; is this the
fruite of the long prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Gospell, and
the vayle being taken off
so long? certainely the
God of this world hath
cast the dust of the world
into our eyes, that we can
see nothing but earthly
things: wee are under the
seale of Gods judgement,
he hath sealed us up to a
darke state, from darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
