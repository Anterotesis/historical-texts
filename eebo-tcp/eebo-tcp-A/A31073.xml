            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IN these words by the example of an eminent Saint is recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us the practice of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent duty, or vertue: a practice in it self most worthy, very gratefull to God, and immediately of great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to our selves; being indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary toward the comfortable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of our lives: It is contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the vertue, which of all other

               </p>

independent in nature, able to subsist of himself, not wanting any support or comfort without himself (for this is the property and privilege of the great <hi>El-shaddai,</hi> who alone subsisteth of himself, needing toward his being and felicity nothing without himself; this is repugnant to the nature of man, who is a creature essentially depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for his being and subsistence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent of many things for his satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and welfare) but relatively, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering his present state, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances wherein he was, and the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities he had; which by God's dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal and providence were such, that he could not want more, than he had in his possession, or reach. He meant not to exclude God, and his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but rather supposed that as the ground and cause of his self-sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; according as otherwhere he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it: <hi>Not as if we were sufficient</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God:</hi> Nor did he intend to exclude the need of other creatures otherwise than as considered without his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, or beyond his power; But he meaneth onely, that he did not desire
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45924:7"/>
or lack more than what God had supplyed him with; had put into his hand, or had set within his reach; that his will did sute to his state, his desire did not exceed his power.</p>
               <p>This is the meaning of the word, which the Apostle useth; but for the more full and clear understanding the vertue it self, we shall first consider the object, about which it is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, then the several acts, which it requireth, or wherein the exercise thereof consisteth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The object of contentedness is the present state of things whatever it be (whether prosperous or adverse, of eminency or meanness, of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance or scantness) wherein by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence we are set: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the things in which we are,</hi> that is our present condition, with all its circumstances: so it may be generally supposed, considering that it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and almost natural for men (who have not learned as S. <hi>Paul</hi> had done, or are not instructed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in the practice of this duty) to be dissatisfied, and disquieted in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very state; to be always in want of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45924:7"/>
something; to find defects in every fortune; to fansie they may be in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter case, and to desire it earnestly: If we estimate things wisely, rich men are more liable to discontent than poor men. It is observable, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity is a peevish thing, and men of highest fortune are apt most easily to resent the smallest things: a little neglect, a slight word, an unpleasing look doth affect them more, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, blows, wrongs do those of a mean condition.</p>
               <p>Prosperity is a nice and squeamish thing, and it is hard to find any thing able to please men of a full and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous state, which being uncapable of bettering in substantial things they can hardly find matter of solid delight. Whereas a poor estate is easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by the accession of many things which it wanteth: a good meal, a small gift, a little gain, or good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of his labour doth greatly please a poor man with a very solid pleasure: but a rich man hath nothing to please him, but a new toy, a puff of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, success at a horse-race, at bowls, at hunting; in some petty
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45924:8"/>
sport and pastime, which can yield but a very thinn and transitory satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to any man not quite brutifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and void of sense: whence conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedness hath place, and is needfull in every condition, be it in appearance never so prosperous, so plentifull, so pleasant. <hi>In the fulness of his sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The formal object thereof may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed seem to be a condition distastfull <note place="margin">Chrys. <hi>Tom.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 68.</note> to our sense, or cross to our fancy; an adverse or strait condition; a condition of poverty, of disgrace, of any great inconvenience or distress in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to us in this world; but since the most men are absolutely in such a condition, exposed to so many wants and troubles; since many more are needy comparatively, wanting the conveniencies that others enjoy, and which themselves affect; since there are few, who in right estimation are not indigent and poor, that is who do not desire and fansie themselves to want many things which they have not (for wealth consisteth not so much in the possession of goods, as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

In fine, contentedness doth import, that whatever our condition is, our mind and affections should be model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and squared just according to it; so that our inclinations be complyant, our desires be congruous thereto, so that easily we can comport with the inconveniencies, can relish the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, can improve the advantages sticking thereto; otherwise like an ill made Garment, it will sit unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely upon us, and be troublesome to us. It is not usually our condition it self, but the unsutableness thereof to our disposition and desires (which sowreth all its sweets, and rendreth its advantages fruitless) that createth discontent; for (although it be very mean) others bear the same chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; many would be glad thereof; if therefore we will be content, we must bend our inclinations, and adapt our desires to a correspondence with our state.</p>
               <p>If we are rich, we should get a large and bountifull heart, otherwise our wealth will hang loose about us; the care and trouble in keeping it, the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion and fear of losing it, the desire
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45924:20"/>
of amplifying it, the unwillingness to spend or use it, will bereave us of all true satisfaction therein, and render it no less unfavoury to us, than unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to others.</p>
               <p>If we are poor, we should have a frugal, provident, industrious mind, sparing in desires, free from curiosity, willing to take pains, able to digest hardships, otherwise the straitness of our condition will pinch and gall us.</p>
               <p>Are we high in dignity or reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? we then need a mind well bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasted with sober thoughts, otherwise the wind of vanity will drive us into absurd behaviours, thence will dash us upon disappointments, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently will plunge us into vexation and discontent.</p>
               <p>Are we mean and low? we need a meek and lowly, a calm and steady spirit; not affecting little respects, or resenting the want of them; apt to pass over or to bear quietly petty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and neglects; not apt to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by words signifying contempt or disdain; else (being fretted with such things, which in this ill-natur'd and hard-hearted World we may be sure

                  <hi>vertue; it is an art to become good)</hi> is most true of this vertue; it is an art, with which we are not born, no more than with any other art or science; the which, as other arts, cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired without studious application of mind, and industrious exercise: No art indeed requireth more hard study and pain toward the acquiry of it, there being so many difficulties, so many obstacles in the way thereto: We have no great capacity, no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly disposition to learn it; We must, in doing it, deny our carnal sense, we must settle our wild fancy, and suppress fond conceits; we must bend our stiff and stubborn inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we must repress and restrain wanton desires; we must allay and still tumultuous passions; we must cross our humour, and curb our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; which to doe is a hard chapter to learn: Much consideration, much practice, much contention and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence are required thereto.</p>
               <p>Hence it is an art which we may observe few do much study; and of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45924:27"/>
the students therein few are great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients; so that <hi>Qui fit, Mecoenas? Horace</hi>'s question, <hi>How comes it to pass, that no body liveth content with the lot assigned by God?</hi> wanted not sufficient ground.</p>
               <p>However it is not like the <hi>Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the circle,</hi> or the <hi>Philosophers Stone,</hi> an art impossible to be learned, and which will baffle all study: there are examples which shew it to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable; there are rules and precepts, by observing which we may arrive to it.</p>
               <p>And it is certainly a most excellent piece of learning; most deserving our earnest study: no other science will yield so great satisfaction, or good use; all other sciences, in comparison there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, are dry and fruitless curiosities; for were we Masters of all other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet wanted the skill of being content, we should not be wise or happy; happiness and discontent are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (things incompatible.)</p>
               <p>But how then may this skill be learned? I answer, chiefly (divine grace concurring) by these three ways. 1. By understanding the rules
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45924:27"/>
and precepts, wherein the practice thereof consisteth. 2. By diligent exercise, or application of those rules to practice; whereby the habit will be produced. 3. By seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, and impressing upon our minds those rational inducements (suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the nature and reason of things) which are apt to persuade the practice thereof. The <hi>first</hi> way I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy endeavoured to declare; the <hi>second</hi> wholly dependeth upon the will and endeavour of the learner; the <hi>third</hi> I shall now insist upon, propounding some rational considerations, apt (by God's help) to persuade contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and serving to cure the malady of discontent. They may be drawn from several heads; from God, from our selves, from our particular condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or state; from the world, or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral state of men here; from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular state of other men in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to ours; from the nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of the duty it self; Every thing about us well examined and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, will minister somewhat indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and assisting thereto.</p>

I. In regard to God we may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that equity doth exact, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <note place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 18.</note> requireth, and all reason dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that we should be content; or that in being discontented we behave our selves very unbeseemingly and unworthily, are very unjust, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, and very foolish toward him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Equity doth exact this duty of us, and in performing it we act justly toward God, both admitting his due right, and acknowledging his good exercise thereof: That saying in the <hi>Gospel, Is it not lawfull for me to doe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 20. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>what I will with mine own?</hi> is a most evident maxime of equity; it is therefore the natural right, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of God (as the Creatour and Preserver, and consequently the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Lord, Owner and Governour of all things) to assign his station, and allot his portion to every person, as he judgeth good and convenient; it is most just that inviolably he should enjoy this right; He being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so infinitely wise and good, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise most just to acknowledge that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45924:28"/>
he doth perfectly well manage this right; Now by contentfull submission to God's disposal of things, we do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily express our due regard to both these, avowing his right, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his exercise thereof; but by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and regret at what happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, we do in effect injure God in both those respects, disavowing his right, and impeaching his manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We do thereby so renounce his right, as (so far as conceit and wish do reach) to invade it, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp it to our selves; signifying, that in our opinion things ought not to be ordered according to his judgment and pleasure, but after our fancy and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; we claim to our selves the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of controlling his estate, and dispensing his goods, so as to be our own carvers, and to assume to our selves so much as we think good; we imply, that, if we were able, we would extort the power out of his hands, and manage it our selves, modelling the world according to our conceits and desires.</p>
               <p>We do also (since we cannot but perceive the other attempt of dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45924:29"/>
God to be frivolous and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less) <note place="margin">

In earnest, Which is most equal, that God should have his will, or we? For shame we shall say God: Why then do we not contentedly let him have it?</p>
               <p>'Tis indeed, if we consider it, the highest piece of injustice that we can be guilty of; exceeding that which we commit in any other sort of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

               <p>Again, there can be no greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, or affront offered to God, than to <hi>give him the lie,</hi> by questioning his <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 10.</note> veracity or fidelity; this discontent plainly doth involve: for God hath expresly declared himself ready upon all occasions to doe us good; he hath promised to <hi>care for us,</hi> and <hi>never to</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45924:30"/>
not be discontented for fear of any want.</p>
               <p>We must at least, in so doing, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect God to be deficient in goodness toward us, or unwilling to help us; or we must apprehend him impotent, and unable to perform what he would, and what he hath promised, for us (like those Infidels, who said, <hi>Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

Whereas also
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45924:30"/>
all events (how cross soever to our sensual conceits, or appetites) are by God designed, and dispensed for our good, gratitude requireth, that we should thank God for them, and not murmur against them.</p>
               <p>Surely if instead of rendring God thanks for all the excellent gifts, which he most liberally (without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious obligation to us, or desert of ours) hath bestowed on us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth to bestow, we fret, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, that he doth not in smaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters seem to cocker us, we are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingratefull, and disingenuous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him: If any great person here should freely bestow on us gifts of huge value (high preferment, or much wealth) but with good reason, as we might presume, should withhold from us some trisle, that we fansie or dote on, should we not be very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, if we should take it ill, and be angry with him for that cause? The case is plainly the same; God hath in the frankest manner bestowed on us innumerable and inestimable goods, in comparison whereto any comfort or convenience of our state here is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45924:31"/>
very trivial and despicable; Are we not therefore very ingratefull, if we heinously resent the want of any such things; if upon any such accompt we disgust his Providence? Do we not deal, beyond all expression, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily with God, in so much underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing the goods which he hath given us, or doth offer us, and hath put in our reach? He hath made us capable of the greatest goods imaginable, and faithfully upon easie terms proffereth them to us; he even tendereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (himself, the immense and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehending good, the fountain of all joy and bliss) to be fully enjoyed by us; his wisedom he offereth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct and guide us, his power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and guard us, his fullness to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us, his goodness to comfort us; he offereth his love and favour to us, in having which we virtually, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect have all things; becoming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, in the highest degree, rich and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and happy; And is it not then outrageous unworthiness to prize any other thing (any petty accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of this transitory life, any pitifull toy here) so much, as to be

displeased for the want thereof; as if all this were not enough to satisfie our needs, or satiate our desires; as if notwithstanding all these immense effusions (yea as it were profusions) of bounty upon us, we could be indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or unhappy? <hi>Shall we</hi> (to use that holy and most ingenuous consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>Job) receive so much good</hi>

                  <hi>commanded us, must acknowledge, that we are unprofitable servants;</hi> such as can bring no considerable benefit to our Lord, or any-wise advance his state; such as therefore cannot chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any wages from him, more than he out of mere favour is pleased to allow: Could we, by our labours, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich God, or raise him in dignity, or procure delight to him, it might seem congruous that he should answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reward us; but as he getteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by us, so we cannot require any thing from him: our best services do indeed rather need pardon, than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve any reward; No man hath lived so well, that he can pretend any thing from God, that he is not indeed much

behind-hand in his accompts with God, having received from God far more of benefit than he can return to him in service: No man, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme presumption and arrogance, can offer to prescribe, in what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or what manner God should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him.</p>
               <p>Again, if we consider our selves as the children of God, either by birth or nature, or by adoption and grace, How can we be discontent for any thing? Have we not thence great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to hope, or rather to be confident, that we shall never want any good thing (necessary or convenient for us) that no great evil shall ever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press us? For is not God hence by paternal disposition inclined, is he not, in a manner, by paternal duty, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in all needfull occasions, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and succour us? Can we (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great profaneness, and no less fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) surmise, that he, which is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensly good, will be a bad (an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or a neglectfull) Father to us? No, as there is no other Father in goodness comparable to him, so none, in real effects of benignity, can come
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45924:37"/>
near him; so our Lord assureth us: <hi>If ye</hi> (saith he) <hi>being evil, know how</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 7. 11.</note>

               </p>
               <p>If we consider our selves as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, we have still more reason to practise this duty: As such, we are not onely possessed of goods abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly sufficient to satisfie our desires; we have hopes able to raise our minds above the sense of all present things; we have entertainments that ever may divert our minds, and fill our hearts with comfort; but we have also an assurance of competent sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of temporal goods; for, <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45924:38"/>
whose treasure and heart are above, to be so concerned with any thing here, as deeply to resent it.</p>
               <p>Again, if we reflect upon our selves as rational men, How for shame can we be discontent? Do we not therein much disparage that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perfection of our nature? Is it not the proper work of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to prevent things hurtfull or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive to us, when that may be done; to remove them, if they are remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; if neither of these can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed, to allay and mitigate them; so that we may be able well to support them? Is it not its principal use to drive away those fond conceits, and to quell those troublesome passions, which create, or foment disquiet, and displeasure to us? if it cannot doe this, What doth it signifie? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose have we it? Is not our condition really worse than that of brute beasts, if reason serveth onely to descry the causes of trouble, but cannot enable to bear it? All the reasons we have produced, and all that we shall produce against discontent, will, if we are reasonable men, and reason
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45924:38"/>
availeth any thing, have this effect upon us.</p>
               <p>Wherefore considering our selves, our capacities, our relations, our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is most reasonable to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with our condition, and with whatever doth befall us.</p>

               <p n="3">III. FArther, if we consider our condition (be it what it will, how poor, how mean, how despicable and forlorn soever) we can have from it no reasonable ground of discontent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our condition in this world cannot (if rightly estimated, and well managed) be extremely bad, or sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull; nothing here can occur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable, or very grievous in it self; we cannot, if we please, want any thing considerable, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect whereof may not be supplied, or supported by far better enjoyments.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45924:39"/>
If we have high opinions of some things, as very excellent, or very needfull for us, it's no wonder if we do want them, that our condition is unpleasant to us; if we take other things for huge evils, then, if they be incumbent on us, we can hardly scape being displeased; but if we thoroughly look through such things, and scan them exactly, valuing them, not according to fallacious impressions of sense, or illusive dreamings of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but according to sound dictates of reason, we may find, that neither the absence of the former, nor the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the latter doth make our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition much worse, or render our case deplorable.</p>
               <p>We are, for instance, poor: that condition, rightly weighed, is not so very sad: for what is poverty? what but the absence of a few superfluous <note place="margin">Tert. <hi>de Pat.</hi> 7.</note> things, which please wanton fancy rather than answer need; without which nature is easily satisfied, and which if we do not affect, we cannot want? what is it but to <note place="margin">

               <p>In fine, the same reasons, which in any other loss may comfort us, should doe it also in this: neither a friend nor any other good thing we can enjoy under any security of not soon loosing it; our welfare is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to one man no more than to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other inferiour thing; this is the condition of all good things here to be transient and separable from us; and accordingly we should be affected toward them.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:45924:46"/>
But farther, it perhaps displeaseth us, that the course of the world doth not go right, or according to our mind; that justice is not well dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that vertue is under hatches, that worth is not considered, that indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is not rewarded, that innocence and modesty are trampled upon; that favour, partiality, corruption, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, craft, impudence do carry all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; devouring all the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements due to honest industry: This may be observed, but why should it displease? art thou guilty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to this? then mend; if not, then bear; especially seeing thou canst not help it; for so it hath always been, and ever will be in the world, that things never have gone there as the wisest judge, or the best men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: there have never been good men enough to sway the world, nor will the few good men that are, be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in promoting publick good, as bad are in driving on their private designs; doth not this course of things necessarily spring from the nature of men, which therefore we should no more be vexed at, than for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45924:46"/>
that a serpent hath poison, or that a wasp hath a sting? we cannot won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it, why then should we be strangely affected by it? could any man ever have been pleased, if this were a sufficient cause of displeasure? However the world goes, we may yet make a tolerable shift, God is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged competently to provide for us; that should satisfie us. God observeth these things no less than we, and he can easily hinder them, yet he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good to suffer them; and shall not we do so likewise? there is in fine appointed a judgment hereafter, when all these things shall be redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and set streight; when justice and vertue shall triumph, when inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and industry shall find their due recompence, 'tis but a moment to that time, and till then we may rest satisfied.</p>
               <p>Thus if we do survey and rightly state things, which cause discontent, and seem to render our condition hard and sad, we shall find, that not from the things, but from our selves all the mischief proceeds: we by our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation give to the lightest things a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45924:47"/>
weight, and swell the smallest things into a vast bulk; we fansie them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frightfull and dolefull, then we tremble and grieve at them. Mere names (the names of poverty, of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, of defeat) do scare us, without consulting reason, and considering how little terrible the things are themselves. We follow silly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, judging that highly good, which the vulgar admireth, that very evil, which the weakest sort of men are wont to complain of; hence so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doth our case seem grievous. But in truth there is no condition so bad, but if we manage it well and wisely, if we bend our mind to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it, if we moderate our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions about the accidents thereof, if we vigilantly embrace and enjoy the advantages thereof, may not be easily supportable, yea prove very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us; it is our fond conceits, our froward humours, our perverse behaviours, which do create the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which seemeth adherent to any condition, and embittereth every state; which from any slight occasion doth create vexation, and turneth every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent into disaster.</p>

4. Again, if we more closely and particularly survey the states of other men (of our brethren every where, of our neighbours all about us) and compare our case with theirs, our condition hardly can appear to us so bad, but that we have many consorts and associates therein; many as ill, many far worse bestead than our selves. How many of our brethren in the world may we observe conflicting with extreme penury and distress; how many undergoing continual hard drudgeries to maintain their lives; how many sorely pinched with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and cold; how many tortured with grievous sickness; how many oppressed with debt; how many shut up under close restraint; how many detained in horrible slavery; how many by the wasting rage of war rifled of their goods, driven from their homes, dispossessed of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable subsistence? How many, in sine, passing their lives in all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of rude, beggarly, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and savage barbarism? And who of us have, in any measure, tasted of these, or of the like calamities? Yet

                  </note> soon becoming <hi>gall in the bowels.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing indeed can affect the mind with a truer pleasure, than the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of discharging our duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God in bearing hardship, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by his providence, willingly and well. We have therefore much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45924:86"/>
not onely to acquiesce in our straits but to be glad of them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they do yield us an opportunity of immediately obtaining goods more excellent and more desirable, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prosperous or wealthy man can easily have, since they furnish us with means of acquiring and exercising a vertue worth the most ample fortune; yea justly preferable to the best estate in the world; a vertue, which indeed doth not onely render any condition tolerable, but sweetneth any thing, yea sanctifieth all states, and turneth all occurrences into blessings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Even the sensible smart of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity is by contentedness somewhat tempered and eased; the stiller and quieter we lie under it, the less we feel its violence and pungency: It is tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and tossing, that stirreth the ill humours, and driveth them to the parts most weak, and apt to be affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them; the rubbing of our sores is that which enflameth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperateth them: where the mind is calm, and the passions settled, the pain of any grievance is in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son less acute, less sensible.</p>

4. Whence if others in our distress are uncharitable to us, refusing the help they might, or should afford to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the rescuing us from it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving us in it, we hereby may be charitable and great benefactours to our selves; we should need no <hi>anodyne</hi> to be ministred from without, no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to come from any creature, if we would not be wanting to our selves, in hearkning to our own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and enjoying the consolation which it affordeth. In not doing this, we are more uncharitable and cruel to our selves, than any spitefull enemy or treacherous friend can be; no man can so wrong or molest us, as we do our selves by admitting or fostering discontent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The contented bearing of our condition is also the most hopefull and ready means of bettering it, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the pressures we lie under.</p>
               <p>It is partly so in a natural way, as disposing us to embrace and employ the advantages which occur condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible thereto; for as discontent blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth men so that they cannot descry the ways of escape from evil, it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiriteth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:45924:87"/>
and discourageth them from endeavouring to help themselves, it depriveth them of many succours and expedients, which occasion would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford for their relief; so he that being undisturbed in his spirit hath his eyes open, and his courage up, and all his natural powers in order, will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready and able to doe his best, to act vigorously, to snatch any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and employ, any means to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the freeing himself from what appeareth grievous to him.</p>
               <p>Upon a supernatural accompt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is yet more efficacious to the same purpose: for chearfull submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to God's will doth please him much, doth strongly move him to withdraw his afflicting hand, doth ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually induce him to advance us into a more comfortable state: Of all vertues there is none more acceptable to God than patience. God will take it well at our hands if we do conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly receive from his hand the worst things: 'tis a monstrous thing not to receive prosperity with gratefull sense, but it is heroical with the same mind to receive things unpleasant: he that

               <p>It is indeed to quell our haughty stomach, to check our froward hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, to curb our impetuous desires, to calm our disorderly passions, to suppress our fond admiration and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger affection toward these worldly things, in short to work a contented mind in us, that God ever doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict any hardships on us, that he cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth us in our projects, that he detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth us in any troublesome state; untill this be atchieved, as it is not expedient that we should be eased, as relief would really be no blessing to us; so God (except in anger and judgment) will no-wise grant or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense it; it would be a cruel mercy for him to doe it; If therefore we do wish ever to be in a good case as to this world, let us learn to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a bad one: Having got this disposition firmly rooted in our hearts, we are qualified for deliverance and preferment; nor will God sail in that due season to perform for us what he so often hath declared and promised; his nature disposeth him, his word

hath engaged him to help and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us.</p>
               <p>These are the most proper induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto contentedness, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering (in the light of reason and holy <hi>Scripture)</hi> the nature of the thing, suggested unto my meditation: there are beside some other means advisable, (some general, some more particular) which are very conducible to the production of content, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving discontent; which I shall touch, and then conclude.</p>

comfort; as we could not truly be unhappy, so we could hardly be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content; without it no affluence of other things can suffice to content us. It is an evil conscience that giveth an edge to all other evils, and enableth them sorely to afflict us, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would but slightly touch us; we become thence uncapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, seeing not onely things here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth to cross us, but heaven to lowre upon us; finding no visible suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and having no hope from the power invisible; yea having reason to be discouraged with the fear of God's displeasure.

these present things, which have in them nothing satisfactory or stable; so if we can raise our minds firmly to believe, seriously to consider, and worthily to prize the future state and its concernments, we can hardly ever be discontent in regard to these things.

What, shall we say then each of us, is this same loss to the loss of my soul and all its comforts for ever? what is this want to the perpetual want of heavenly bliss? what is this short and faint pain to the cruel pangs of endless remorse, to

               </p>
               <p>It likewise performeth the same by procuring grace and aid from God, which may enable and dispose us to bear all evils well, which is really much better than a removal of them; for that hence they become wholsome and profitable to us, and causes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent good, and grounds of future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; thus when St. <hi>Paul besought</hi>

               <p>It also strengthneth our faith, and quickneth our hope in God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are enabled to support our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <note place="margin">Isa. 26. 3.</note> evils, and peace of mind doth spring up within us.</p>
               <p>It enflameth our love unto God, in sense of his gratious illapses, thence <note place="margin">Psal. 73. 26. 69. 16. 23. 4. 71. 20.</note> rendring us willing to endure any want or pain for his sake, or at his appointment.</p>
               <p>It in fine doth minister a ravishing delight, abundantly able to supply
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45924:93"/>
the defect of any other pleasures, and to allay the smart of any pains what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; rendring thereby the meanest estate more acceptable and pleasant, than any prosperity without it can be. So that if we be truly devout we can hardly be discontent; It is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costing from God by a neglect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, or by a negligence therein, that doth expose us to the incursions of worldly regret and sorrow.</p>
               <p>These are general remedies and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both in this and all other regards necessary, the which yet we may be induced to perform in contemplation of this happy fruit (contentedness) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising from them. Farther</p>
               <p n="4">4. It serveth toward production of contentedness to reflect much upon our imperfection, unworthiness and guilt; so as thereby to work in our hearts a lively sense of them, and a hearty sorrow for them; this will divert our sadness into its right cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, this will drown our lesser grief by the influx of a greater. It is the nature of a greater apprehension or pain incumbent to extinguish in a manner, and swallow up the sense of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45924:94"/>
a lesser, although in it self grievous; as he that is under a fit of the stone doth scarce feel a pang of the gout; he that is assaulted by a wolf will not regard the biting of a flea. Whereas then of all evils and mischiefs moral evils are incomparably far the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, in nature the most ugly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable, in consequence the most hurtfull and horrible; seeing (in Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>'s language) <hi>Excepting sin, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45924:94"/>
and the lamentable consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of sin, all other evils cannot but seem exceedingly light and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; we cannot but apprehend it a very silly and unhandsome thing to resent or regard them: what (shall we then judge) is poverty in comparison to the want of a good conscience? what is sickness compared to distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind, and decay of spiritual strength? what is any disappointment to the being defeated and overthrown by temptation? what any loss to the being deprived of God's love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? what any disgrace to the being out of esteem and respect with God? what any unfaithfulness or inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of friends to having deserted or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed our own soul? what can any danger signifie to that of eternal misery, incurred by offending God? what pressure can weigh against the load of guilt, or what pain equal that of stinging remorse? in fine, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition can be so bad as that of a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched sinner? any case surely is tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, is desirable, is lovely and sweet in comparison to this: would to God, may a man in this case reasonably say,

that I were poor and forlorn as any beggar; that I were covered all over with botches and blains as any <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar;</hi> that I were bound to pass my days in an hospital or a dungeon; might I be chained to an oar, might I lie upon the rack, so I were clear and innocent: Such thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections if reflecting on our sinfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and state do suggest and impress, what place can there be for resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other petty crosses?</p>
               <p>Contrition also upon this score is productive of a certain sweetness and joy apt to quash or to allay all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grief: as <hi>it worketh a salutary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45924:95"/>
so possessing the heart, as to expell or to exclude other displeasures: a holy and a worldly sadness cannot well consist together.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another good instrument of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedness is sedulous application of our minds to honest employment. Honest studies and cares divert our minds, and drive sad thoughts from them: they chear our spirits with wholsome food and pleasant entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; they yield good fruits, and a success accompanied with satisfaction, which will extinguish or temper dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content: while we are studious or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, discontent cannot easily creep in, and soon will be stifled.</p>
               <p>Idleness is the great mother and the nurse of discontent; it layeth the mind open for melancholy conceits to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it yieldeth harbour to them, and entertainment there; it depriveth of all the remedies and allays which bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness affordeth.</p>
               <p>Reciprocally discontent also beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth idleness, and by it groweth: they are like ice and water, arising <note place="margin">Mater me genuit.</note> each out of the other: we should therefore not suffer any sadness so to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:45924:96"/>
encroach upon us, as to hinder us from attending to our business (the honest works and studies of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) for it thereby will grow stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more hardly vincible.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A like expedient to remove dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content is good company. It not <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> onely sometimes ministreth advices and arguments for content, but rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the drooping spirit, erecting it to a loving complaisance, drawing it out towards others in expressions of kindness, and yielding delight in those which we receive from others, infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us by a kind of contagion with good humour, and instilling pleasant <hi>Idea's</hi> into our fancy, agreeably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting us from sad and irksome thoughts: discontent affecteth retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and solitude, as its element and food; good company partly starveth it by smothering sad thoughts, partly cureth it by exhilerating discourse. No man hardly can feel displeasure, while friendly conversation entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him; no man returneth from it without some refreshment and ease of mind.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:45924:96"/>
7. Having right and lowly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of our selves is a most sure guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and procurer of content: for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to a man's judgment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self are his resentments of the dealing he meeteth with from God or man. He that thinks meanly as he ought of himself, will not easily be offended at any thing; any thing, will he think, is good enough for me; I deserve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from God, I cannot deserve much of man; if I have any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of provision for my life, any tolerable usage, any respect, it is more than my due, I am bound to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: but he that conceiteth highly (that is vainly) of himself, nothing will satisfie him; nothing, thinks he, is good enough for him, or answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his deserts; no body can yield him sufficient respect; any small neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect disturbeth and enrageth him: he cannot endure that any man should thwart his interest, should cross his humour, should dissent from his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; Hence seeing the world will not easily be induced to conceit of him as he doth of himself, nor to comply with his humours and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:45924:97"/>
it is impossible that he should be content.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It conduceth to this purpose to contemplate and resent the publick state of things, the interest of the world, of our countrey, of God's Church. The sense of publick cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities will drown that of private, as unworthy to be considered or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with them; The sense of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prosperity will allay that of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular misfortune. How (will a wise and good man say) can I desire to prosper and flourish, while the State is in danger or distress? how can I grieve, seeing my countrey is in good condition? is it just, is it handsome that I should be a non-conformist ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the publick sorrow or joy? Indeed</p>
               <p n="9">9. All Hearty Charity doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleviate discontent. If we bear such a good-will to our neighbour as to have a sincere compassion of his evils, and complacence in his good, our case will not much afflict us. If we can appropriate and enjoy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, the wealth, the reputation, of our neighbour, by delighting in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:45924:97"/>
them, what can we want; what can displease us? If our heart is enlarged in pity for the misfortunes of others, it cannot be contracted with grief for our own: our sorrow, like water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus diffused, cannot be so deep but it will be more fruitfull; it will produce such effects as will comfort and please us; It is a stingy selfishness which maketh us so very sensible of crosses and so uncapable of comfort.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Again, if we will attain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, we must take heed of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our affection upon any worldly thing whatever, so as very highly to prize it, very passionately to affect it, very eagerly to pursue it; so as to conceive our happiness in any measure to hang on it or stick thereto: If there be any such thing, we shall be disappointed in the acquist, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of it; or we shall be dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in its enjoyment.</p>
               <p>So to adhere in affection to any thing is an adulterous disloyalty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Maker and Best friend; from which it is expedient that we should be reclaimed; whence God (in just anger, or in kind mercy)
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:45924:98"/>
will be apt to cross us in our attempts to get it, or to deprive us of its pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session; whence the displeasure will follow, which always attendeth a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from things we love. But if we be suffered to obtain or to retain it, we shall soon find dissatisfaction therein; being either disgusted with some bitterness in it (such as doth lurk in every sensible good) or being cloyed with its lusciousness: it after a small enjoyment will become either distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or insipid.</p>
               <p>This, according to continual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, is the nature of all things, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant onely to sense or fancy, presently to satiate: no beauty can long please the eye, no melody the ear, no deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy the palate, no curiosity the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; a little time doth waste away, a small use doth wear out the pleasure, which at first they afford: novelty commendeth and ingratiateth them; distance representeth them fair and lovely; the want or absence of them rendreth them desirable; but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of them dulleth their grace, the possession of them deadneth the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:45924:98"/>
New objects with a gentle and gratefull touch warble upon the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal organs, or excite the spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a pleasant frisk of motion; but when use hath levigated the organs, and made the way so smooth and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie that the spirits pass without any stop, those objects are no longer felt, or very faintly; so that the pleasure ceaseth.</p>
               <p>Onely those things which reason (religious and sound reason) doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, do yield a lasting (undecay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unalterable) satisfaction; if we set our affections on them, we cannot fail of content: In seeking them we cannot be disappointed, for God (without any reservation or excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) hath promised to bestow them upon those who seriously and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently seek them: nor can we be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed of them; God will not take them away, and they lie beyond the reach of any other hand: Having them then we cannot but fully and durably be satisfied in the fruition of them; the longer we have them the more we shall like them; the more we taste them the better we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45924:99"/>
them: time wasteth not, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth the sense of their unfading beauty and indefectible sweetness.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It is of great influence toward contentedness with an earnest and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial regard to contemplate things, as they are in themselves, devested of tragical appearances, in which they are wrapt by our own inconsiderate fancy, or which vulgar prejudices do throw upon them: As all things, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon by the corporeal eye through a mist, do seem bigger than in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they are, so to the eye of our mind all things (both good and evil) seem hugely enlarged, when viewed through the foggs of our dusky ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, or of popular conceit. If we will esteem that very good, which with a gay appearance dazleth our imagination, or which the common admiration and applause of men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth, the most vain and worthless, the most dangerous, the most mischievous things often will appear such; and if we please to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt those things greatly bad which look ugly or horridly to imagination, which are defamed by the injudicious
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45924:99"/>
part of men; or which men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do loath, do fret at, do wail for, we shall take the best, most innocent, most usefull, most wholsome things for such; and accordingly these er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of our minds will be followed by a perverse practice, productive of dissatisfaction and displeasure to us. No man ever will be satisfied, who values things according to the price which fancy setteth on them, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rate they bear in the common market; who distinguisheth not between good and famous, bad and infamous; who is affected accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly with the want of those things, which men call good, with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of those, which they term bad.</p>
               <p>But if we judge of things as God declareth, as impartial and cautious reason dictateth, as experience dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently observed (by their fruits and consequences) discovereth them to be, we shall have little cause to be affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the want, or presence of any such thing which is wont to produce discontent.</p>
               <p n="12">12. We should to this purpose take especial care to search out through our
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45924:100"/>
condition, and pick thence the good that is therein, making the best we can of it, enjoying and improving it; but what is inconvenient or offensive therein declining it, diminishing it, tempering it so well as we may, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways forbearing to aggravate it. There are in nature divers simples, which have in them some part, or some juice very noxious, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing severed and cast away, the rest becometh wholsome food; neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is there any thing in nature so venomous, but that from it by art and industry may be extracted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what medicinal, and of good use, when duly applied; so in most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent evils lieth inclosed much good, which if we carefully separate (ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting away the intermixed dross and refuse) we shall find benefit and taste comfort thence; there is nothing so thoroughly bad, as being well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and opportunely ministred will not doe us much good: So if from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty we cast away or bear quietly that which a little pincheth the sense or grateth on the fancy, and enjoy the undistractedness of mind, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45924:100"/>
the leisure, the health, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from envy, obloquy, strife, which it affordeth, how satisfactory may it become to us? The like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences are in disgrace, disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and other such evils, which being improved may endear them to us: Even sin it self (the worst of evils, the onely true evil) may yield great benefits to us; it may render us sober and lowly in our own eyes, devout in imploring mercy, and thankfull to God for it; mercifull and charitable toward others in our opinions and censures; more laborious in our good practice, and watchfull over our steps: and if this deadly poison well admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred yieldeth effects so exceedingly beneficial and salutary, what may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther harmless (though unhandsome, and unpleasant) things doe, being skilfully managed?</p>
               <p n="13">13. It is a most effectual means of producing content, and curing discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to rowse and fortifie our faith in God, by with most serious attention reflecting upon the arguments and experiments, which assure us concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God's particular providence over
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:45924:101"/>
all, over us. It is really infidelity (in whole, or in part, no faith, or a small and weak faith) which is at the root as of all sin, so particularly of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: for how is it possible, did we firmly believe, and with any measure of attention consider, that God taketh care of us, that he tendereth our good, that he is ready at hand to succour us, (how then, I say, is it possible) that we should fear any want, or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously resent any thing incident? But we like St. <hi>Peter</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>of little faith,</hi> therefore we cannot <hi>walk on the sea;</hi> but in despair sink down: sometimes our faith is buried in oblivion or carelesness; we forget, or mind not that there is a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but look on things as if they sell out casually or fatally; thence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no redress from heaven, so tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into despair and disconsolateness. Sometimes because God doth not in our time and our way relieve us or gratifie us we slip into profane doubt, questioning in our hearts whether he doth indeed regard us, or whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny relief is to be expected from him; not considering, that onely God can
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:45924:101"/>
tell when, and how it is best to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; that often it is not expedient our wishes should be granted; that we are not wise enough, or just e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to appoint or chuse for our selves; that it is impossible for God to gratifie every man; that it would be a mad world, if God in his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof should satisfie all our desires.</p>
               <p>We forget how often God hath suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured us in our needs and straits, how continually he hath provided for us; how patiently and mercifully he hath born with us; what miracles of bounty and mercy he hath performed in our behalf; we are like that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trustfull and inconsiderate people, who <hi>remembred not the hand of God,</hi>

               <p>IN these words two things appear especially observable; a duty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied (the <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>patience)</hi> and a reason expressed, which enforceth the practice of that duty (the <hi>example</hi> of <hi>Christ.)</hi> We shall (using no more Preface, or circumstance) first brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in way of explication and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, touch the duty it self, then more largely describe, and urge the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:45924:103"/>
The word <hi>patience</hi> hath, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon usage, a double meaning, taken from the respect it hath unto two sorts of objects, somewhat different. As it respecteth provocations to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and revenge by injuries, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtesies, it signifieth a disposition of mind to bear them with charitable meekness; as it relateth to adversities and crosses disposed to us by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it importeth a pious undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sustaining them. That both these kinds of patience may here be understood, we may, consulting and considering the context, easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern: that which immediately prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>If when ye doe well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God,</hi> relateth to good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance of adversity; that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently followeth, <hi>who when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, reviled not again, when he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered he threatned not,</hi> referreth to meek comporting with provocations: The Text therefore, as it looketh backward, doth recommend the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of adversities, as forward, the patience of contumelies. But seeing both these objects are reducible to one
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:45924:103"/>
more general, comprizing both, that is, things seeming evil to us, or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive to our sense, we may so explicate the duty of patience, as to include them both.</p>
               <p>Patience then is that vertue, which qualifieth us to bear all conditions, and all events, by God's disposal inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to us, with such apprehensions and persuasions of mind, such disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and affections of heart, such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal deportments, and practices of life as God requireth, and good reason directeth. Its nature will, I conceive, be understood best by considering the chief acts which it produceth, and wherein especially the practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of consisteth; the which briefly are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:45924:109"/>
thereto, than that admirable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by which our Text doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it: some principal of those rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal inducements we shall cursorily touch, then insist upon this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>It will generally induce us to bear patiently all things incident, if we consider, That it is the natural right and prerogative of God to dispose of all things, to assign our station here, and allot our portion to us; whence it is a most wrongfull insolence in us, by complaining of our state, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test his right, or impeach his manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; That we are obliged to God's free bounty for numberless great benefits and favours; whence it is vile ingratitude to be displeased for the want of some lesser conveniences; That God having undertaken, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to support and succour us, it is a heinous affront to distrust him, and consequently to be dissatisfied with our condition; That seeing God doth infinitely better understand what is good for us, than we can do; he is better affected toward us, and more truly loveth us than we do our selves;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:45924:110"/>
he with an unquestionable right hath an uncontrollable power to dispose of us, it is most reasonable to acquiesce in his choice of our state; That since we have no claim to any good, or any pleasure, and thence in withholding any, no wrong is done to us, 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just and frivolous to murmur, or grumble; since we are, by nature, God's servants, it is fit the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our rank, our garb, our diet, all our accommodations, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his family, should be left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to his discretion and pleasure; That we being grievous sinners, <hi>less than the least of God's mercies,</hi> meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no good, but deserving sore pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment from him, it is just, that we should be highly content and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any thing on this side death and damnation; That our afflictions, being the natural fruits and results of our choice, or voluntary miscarriages, it is reasonable we should blame our selves rather than pick quarrels with Providence for them. That our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, be it what it will, cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duly estimated, be extremely bad, or insupportably grievous; for that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:45924:110"/>
as no condition here is perfectly and purely good (not deficient in some accommodations, not blended with some troubles) so there is none that hath not its conveniencies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; for that it is our fond conceits, our froward humours, our perverse behaviours, which create the mischiefs adherent to any state; for that also how forlorn soever our case is, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail, if we please, of a capacity to enjoy goods far more than counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing all possible want of these goods, or presence of these evils; we may have the use of our reason, a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, hope in God, assurance of God's love and favour, abundance of spiritual blessings here, and a certain title to eternal glory and bliss hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which if we can have, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition cannot be deemed uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. That indeed our adversity is a thing very good and wholsome, very profitable and desirable, as a means of breeding, improving and exercising the best vertues, of preparing us for, and entitling us to the best rewards. That our state cannot ever be despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, our adversity probably may not
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:45924:111"/>
be lasting (there being no connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the present and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vicissitudes being frequent, all things depending on the arbitrary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of God, who doth always pity us, and is apt to relieve us.) That however our affliction will not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live our selves, and certainly must soon expire with our life. That this world is not a place of perfect conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, or pure delight; we come not hither to doe our will, or enjoy our pleasure, we are not born to make laws, or pick our condition here; but that <hi>trouble</hi> is natural and proper to us <hi>(We are born thereto, as the sparks</hi>

That no adversity is in kind, or degree, peculiar to us, but if we survey the conditions of other men (of our brethren every where, of our neighbours all about us) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our case with theirs, we shall find, that we have many consorts, and associates in adversity, most as ill, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny far worse bestead than our selves;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:45924:111"/>
whence it must be a great fondness and perversness to be displeased that we are not exempted from, but expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bear a share in the common troubles and burthens of mankind. That it hath particularly been the lot of the best men (persons most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in vertue, and most deep in God's favour) to sustain adversity; and it therefore becometh us willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and chearfully to accept it. That, in fine, patience it self is the best remedy to ease us in, to rescue us from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity; for it cannot much annoy us, if we bear it patiently, God will, in mercy, remove it, if we please him, by demeaning our selves well under it; but that impatience doth not at all conduce to our relief, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed exasperate, and augment our pain: Such considerations may induce us to a patience in general respecting all sorts of evil.</p>
               <p>There are also reasons particularly disposing to bear injuries and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies from men calmly and meekly, without immoderate wrath, ranco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hatred, or spitefull revenge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them: Because they do proceed

from divine providence, disposing or permitting them (for the trial of our patience, the abasing our pride, the exercising of some other vertues, or for other good purposes) to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; Because vindication of misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours committed against us doth not appertain to us; we not being competent Judges of them, nor right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full executours of the punishments due to them; God having reserved to himself the right of decision, and power of execution: <hi>Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, I will repay</hi>

               <p>THE great Controversie, mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with such earnestness and obstinacy between God and Man, is this, whose will shall take place, his or ours: Almighty God, by whose constant protection and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:45924:125"/>
great mercy we subsist, doth claim to himself the authority of regulating our practice, and disposing our fortunes; but we affect to be our own masters and carvers; not willingly admitting any law, not patiently brooking any condition, which doth not sort with our fancy and pleasure: to make good his right, God bendeth all his sorces, and applieth all proper means both of sweetness and severity (persuading us by arguments, soliciting us by entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, alluring us by fair promises, sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us by fierce menaces, indulging ample benefits to us, inslicting sore corrections on us, working in us and upon us by secret influences of grace, by visible dispensations of providence) yet so it is, that commonly nothing doth avail, our will opposing it self with invincible resolution and stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>Here indeed the business pincheth; herein as the chief worth, so the main difficulty of religious practice consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, in bending <hi>that iron sinew;</hi> in bringing our proud hearts to stoop, and our sturdy humours to buckle, so as to surrender and resign our wills
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:45924:125"/>
to the just, the wise, the gratious will of our God, prescribing our duty, and assigning our lot unto us. We may accuse our nature, but it is our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; we may pretend weakness, but <note place="margin">

                  </note> it is wilfulness, which is the guilty cause of our misdemeanours; for by God's help (which doth always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our needs, and is never wanting to those who seriously desire it) we may be as good as we please, if we can please to be good; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within us that can resist, if our wills do yield themselves up to duty: to conquer our reason is not hard; for what reason of man can withstand the infinite cogency of those motives, which induce to obedience? What can be more easie, than by a thousand arguments, clear as day, to convince any man, that to cross God's will is the greatest absurdity in the world, and that there is no madness compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereto? Nor is it difficult, if we <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quodeunque sibi imperavit animus obti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit.</hi> Sen. <hi>de Ira.</hi> 2. 12.</note> resolve upon it, to govern any other part or power of our nature; for what cannot we doe, if we are willing? what inclination cannot we check, what appetite cannot we restrain,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:45924:126"/>
what passion cannot we quell or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate; what faculty of our soul, or member of our body is not obsequious to our will? Even half the resolution with which we pursue vanity and sin, would serve to engage us in the ways of wisedom and vertue.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in overcoming our will the stress lieth; this is that impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable fortress, which everlastingly doth hold out against all the batteries of reason and of grace; which no force of persuasion, no allurement of favour, no discouragement of terrour can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce: this puny, this impotent thing it is, which grappleth with Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and often in a manner baffleth it: And no wonder; for that God doth not intend to overpower our will, or to make any violent impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on it, but onely to <hi>draw it</hi> (as it <note place="margin">Hos. 11. 4.</note> is in the <hi>Prophet) with the cords of a man,</hi> or by rational inducements to win its consent and compliance; our service is not so considerable to him, that he should extort it from us; nor doth he value our happiness at so low a rate, as to obtrude it on us.

               </p>
               <p>Our will indeed of all things is most our own; the onely gift, the most proper sacrifice we have to offer; which therefore God doth chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:45924:127"/>
doth most highly prize, doth most kindly accept from us. Seeing then our duty chiefly moveth on this hinge, the free submission and resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our will to the will of God; it is this practice, which our Lord (who came to guide us in the way to happiness, not onely as a teacher by his word and excellent doctrine, but as a leader, by his actions and perfect example) did especially set before us; as in the constant tenour of his life, so particularly in that great exigency which occasioned these words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, renouncing and deprecating his own will, he did express an entire submission to God's will, a hearty complacence therein, and a serious desire that it might take place.</p>
               <p>For the fuller understanding of which case, we may consider, that our Lord, as partaker of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and, <hi>in all things</hi> (bating sin) <hi>like unto us,</hi> had a natural humane will, attended with senses, appetites and affections, apt from objects inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to receive congruous impressions of pleasure and pain; so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is innocently gratefull and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:45924:127"/>
to us, that he relish'd with delight, and thence did encline to embrace; whatever is distastfull and afflictive to us, that he resented with grief, and thence was moved to eschew; to this probably he was liable in a degree beyond our ordinary rate; for that in him nature was most perfect, his complexion very delicate, his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per exquisitely sound and fine; for so we find, that by how much any man's constitution is more sound, by so much he hath a smarter gust of what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable or offensive to nature: If perhaps sometimes infirmity of body, or distemper of soul (a savage ferity, a stupid dulness, a fondness of conceit, or stiffness of humour, supported by wild opinions, or vain hopes) may keep men from being thus affected by sensible objects; yet in him pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did work vigorously, with a clear apprehension and lively sense, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the design of our maker, when into our constitution he did implant those passive faculties disposing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to affect them so and so, for our need and advantage: if this be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meed weakness, it is a weakness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected

intent, legions of Angels had flown to his rescue; that word, which fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the worlds, which stilled the tempests, which ejected Devils, would immediately have scattered his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and dashed all their projects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; wherefore those words did not proceed from intention, but as from instinct, and for instruction; importing, that what our humane frailty was apt to suggest, that his divine vertue was more ready to smother; neither did he vent the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but that he might express the latter.</p>
               <p>He did express it in real effect; immediately with all readiness ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing himself to receive that unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory potion; he reached out his hand for it, yielding fair opportunity and advantages to his persecutours; he lifted it up to his mouth, innocently provoking their envy and malice, he drank it off with a most steady calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and sweet composure of mind, with the silence, the simplicity, the meekness of a lamb, carried to the slaughter; no fretfull thought rising up, no angry word breaking forth,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:45924:134"/>
but a clear patience, enlivened with a warm charity, shining in all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and through every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his passion.</p>
               <p>Such in his life, such at his death was the practice of our Lord; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity whereto we also readily should undertake whatever God proposeth, we gladly should accept whatever God offereth, we vigorously should perform whatever God enjoineth, we patiently should undergo whatever God imposeth or inflicteth, how cross soever any duty, any dispensation may prove to our carnal sense or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>To doe thus, the contemplation of this example may strongly engage us: for if our Lord had not his will, can we in reason expect, can we in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty desire to have ours? must we be cockered and pleased in every thing, whenas he was treated so coursely, and crossed in all things? can we grutch at any kind of service, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance; can we think much (for our trial, our exercise, our correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to bear a little want, a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, a little pain, when the Son of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:45924:134"/>
God was put to discharge the hardest tasks, to endure the sorest adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
               <p>But farther to enforce these duties, be pleased to cast a glance on two considerations. 1. What the will is to which, 2. Who the willer is to whom we must submit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is the will of God? is it any thing unjust, unworthy, or disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, any thing incommodious or hurtfull, any thing extremely difficult, or intolerably grievous that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us, to doe or bear? No: he willeth nothing from us, or to us, which doth not best become us, and most behove us; which is not atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with safety, with ease, with the solidest profit, the fairest reputation, and the sweetest pleasure.</p>
               <p>Two things he willeth, that we should be good, and that we should be happy; the first in order to the second, for that vertue is the certain way, and a necessary qualification to felicity.</p>

the defacements of God's image with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us should be repaired; that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of our Soul should be restored to their original integrity and vigour; that from most wretched slaveries we should be translated into a happy free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yea, into a glorious kingdom; that from despicable beggary and base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness we should be advanced to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial wealth, and sublime dignity; that we should be cleansed from the foulest desilements, and decked with the goodliest ornaments; that we should be cured of most loathsome diseases, and settled in a firm health of soul; that we should be delivered from those brutish lusts, and those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish passions, which create in us a hell of darkness, of consusion, of vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; which dishonour our nature, deform our soul, ruffle our mind, and wrack our conscience; that we should be endowed with those worthy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and affections, which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute in our hearts a heaven of light, of order, of joy and peace; dignifie our nature, beautifie our soul, clarifie and chear our mind; that we should eschew those practices, which never

Do we reject the will that would save us, and adhere to a will that would ruine us; a foolish and a senseless will, which slighting the immense treasures of Heaven, the unfading glories of God's Kingdom, the ineffable joys of eternity doth catch at specious no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, doth pursue mischievous tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles; a shadow of base profit, a smoak of vain honour, a flash of sordid plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; which passeth away like <hi>the mirth of fools,</hi> or <hi>the crackling of</hi>

               <p>So doth every relation of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend his will to us; and each of his attributes doth no less: for,</p>
               <p>It is the will of him, who is most holy, or whose will is essential recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: how then can we thwart it, without being stained with the guilt, and wounded with a sense of great ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity and iniquity?</p>
               <p>It is the will of him, who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly just; who therefore cannot but assert his own righteous will, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the violation thereof: is it then advisable to drive him to that point by wilfull provocation; or to run
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:45924:138"/>
upon the edge of necessary severity?</p>
               <p>It is the will of him, who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wise; who therefore doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly know what is best for us, what doth most besit our capacities and circumstances; what in the final result will conduce to our greatest advantage and comfort: shall we then prefer the dreams of our vain mind before the oracles of his wisedom; shall we, forsaking the direction of his unerring will, follow the impulse of our giddy humour?</p>
               <p>It is the will of him, who is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensely good and benign; whose will therefore can be no other than good will to us; who can mean nothing thereby but to derive bounty and mercy on us: Can we then fail of doing well, if we put our selves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely into his hands; are we not our own greatest enemies, in withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his gratious intentions?</p>
               <p>It is finally the will of him, who is uncontrollably powerfull; whose will therefore must prevail one way or other: either with our will, or against it, either so as to bow and satisfie us, or so as to break and plague us: for,
