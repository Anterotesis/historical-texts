            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A warning vnto France concerning her preſent calamities: together with the remedies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie</hi> for the ſame.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe three yeares and more hath <hi>France</hi> ben tormented with this war. The wiſer ſort did in their iudgements foreſee the miſhaps, and the fooliſh by the feeling thereof are waxen wiſe. As well the one as the other that do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them doo complaine both of the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the miſchiefe, and of the ſlacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the remedie: yea and which is more, weenning to haue ſuccour at the Phiſicians hande, they finde him intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the ſame diſeaſe, and ſo a patient himſelfe. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient (as we ſee in this extremitie) that all good French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhoulde gather their wits together, that the patient ſhould helpe the Phiſician, yea and in ſome ſort become a Phiſitian himſelfe: That he ſhould (I ſay) for the full attey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the cure enter into perfect notice, not ſo much of the diſeaſe which he doth but too much feele, as of the true cauſe that breedeth it. But we can not iudge either better or more ſoundly than if we aſcend to the originall of theſe troubles, and thence as it were with a full view ſet before the eyes of our mindes all that haue ſence happened as well on the one ſide as on the other.</p>
            <p>Truely it is euident, and all the world knoweth, that in the yeare 1585. about the month of March when the league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtirre, this realme was in tollerable eſtate, the king imagined onely how to eſtabliſh peace more and more: his ſubiectes gathered the fruites thereof vnder his obedience: his Maieſties minde was buſied, not ſo much about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidating of the wounds of his realme, which the peace had alreadie reduced into ſcarres, as to reſtore it into the former dignitie, force and ſtrength. The borderers began alreadie in part to reſpect her, and in part to feare her: and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly a few ſuch yeares would haue reduced our <hi>France</hi> into a ſtate rather to be enueied than enuious of the former.</p>
            <p>The league which had long bin practiſing againſt the ſtate of this realme did ſuddenly and to no purpoſe break off the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23265:3"/>
happie courſe that we had taken, whereof the houſe of <hi>Guize</hi> procured themſelues to be tearmed Captaines and leaders. A forreine houſe, neither was it meete (for it had beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature) that <hi>France</hi> ſhould be moleſted or ouerthrowen by other then ſtrangers, yea it ſeemes almoſt fatall that theſe men ſhould do it, whoſe fathers and vnkles had ſtirred vp all the former miſchieues in this Realme.</p>
            <p>It may be that ſome bitter iniurie might heereafter haue brought the ſubiect out of his right byas and wrongfully ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him againſt his Prince or countrie: or a mans deſperate eſtate, who willingly would amend himſelf with others loſſe. But theſe are vehement paſsions which do not alwaies har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto reaſon: howbeit in this caſe that was no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For thoſe of this houſe helde and did poſſeſſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt benefits and chiefe dignities of this realme, and all this through the bountie of our kinges: and as for fauour, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and credite about his maieſtie, they had more than the princes of his bloud, how catholikes ſoeuer, who neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe did in ſilence and patience beare therewith, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as alwaies they haue done, the leaſt teare or griefe of the people before their owne iuſt ſorrowes. Theſe men (as all the world knowe) did enioy their ſoules in libertie, their honours in authoritie, their liues in ſafetie, and their goods in tranquillitie. All cauſes that might breed diſcontentment were farre from them: and all ſuch as may make a ſubiect content, they had: yea they had them in ſuch meaſure that they wanted no more, but to reigne: and indeede (to ſay the truth) that alſo rather in title than in power or effect.</p>
            <p>Hereupon who ſo liſt well to conſider what might mooue them to ſtirre vp our eſtate which was in quiet, or not to be able to beare their owne which was as good as might be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſhall bee forced in theſe men to confeſſe an vnbrideled and infinite ambition which cannot be tamed by any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the ouerthrow of a ſtate, together with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme miſerie and calamitie of ſo many millions whom it entangleth, which likewiſe could neuer bee limited with ſo much authoritie, greatneſſe, and honour, ſufficient (as they were well diuided) to content all <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was (as it was very well noted euen at that time) corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23265:3"/>
to the auncient purpoſe of their predeceſſors who made themſelues <hi>Charlemagnes</hi> heires, ſo to ground a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to this realme, and perceiuing that they could find no hope to come to their purpoſe ſo long as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued whole, endeuoured by the continuation of the troubles, to ſcatter and deſtroy it. And indeede theſe men a yeare or two before procured a booke to be printed purpoſely, which (though falſely) prooued them to be diſcended from thence, and ſo conſequently true heires, and our kinges vſurpers of the crowne, for the which the auctor made amendes honorable in the kinges full counſaile. But when they ſee the Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> deceaſed, the king to haue no children, and the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> chiefe Prince of the bloud, through his religion (as they thought) eſtranged from the peoples fauour, they imagined the way to be then open to their extreeme ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ſeaſon to growe fitte for the hatching of their driftes. Then beganne they afreſh to kindle their practiſes and conuenticles to ſearch out all malcontentes, whether iuſtly or wrongfully, to treat with the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and ſuch other potentates as enuied our realme, wherof in ſhort ſpace ſprong vp this curſſed warre of the <hi>League,</hi> which ſince hath kindled and conſumed our poore eſtate. Then by their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like proteſtation they required the king to name his heire, and the ſame a catholike prince, namely, the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> ſo to exclude the king of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> This did they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that they knew that they could not climbe ſo high but by degrees, and they would either gouerne or rule in <hi>France</hi> vnder the wings of the ſaid Cardinall: and now imagine you what a preſuppoſition this was, had there beene no deceit, that the ſaid lord Cardinall a prince alreadie verie old, ſhould ſuruiue our king being in the flower of his age. The king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> whither by his right or by his vertue ſtopped their paſſage: hereupon they declare him to be an heretike, and ſo do pretend him to bee depriued of all the rights belonging to the blood of <hi>France:</hi> but note that the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies proteſted that he ſubmitted himſelfe to a free counſell, offering thereby to be inſtructed, and proteſting that vntill then he could not be deemed an heretike. They do ſo feare leaſt hee ſhoulde returne into the <hi>Romiſh church,</hi> and thereby
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23265:4"/>
their practiſes be ouerthrowen, that whereas were they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by charitie or religion, they ſhould open him the way, they do now ſhut the gate againſt him, denouncing him to be a relaps, &amp; fallen againe into hereſie, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incapeable to holde any dignitie, much leſſe to reigne in the Church. Alſo whereas he had pertinently anſwered, that whoſoeuer is not firſt denounced an heretike can not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared a relaps: that hauing ſubmitted himſelfe to a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, he can not, but by the ſame, be condemned: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that whatſoeuer hee did being forced by extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie can not bee ſo imputed vnto him as to make him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps.</p>
            <p>Contarie to all theſe ſo peremptorie reaſons: contrary to all the doctors, and contrarie to all the Cannons of the Church, they doo ſtirre vp Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> bull, the Popes (I ſay) whome they haue circumuented, as himſelfe hath confeſſed, who without anie formalitie, and contrarie to all forme dooth at once declare the ſaide lorde king and the late lorde Prince, vncondemned, vnheard, yea vncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to be heretikes, relapſed, and excommunicate, and ſo fallen from all rightes both preſent and to come. A bull whereby they pretende to haue a free iudgement to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe princes, who ſtopped them in the midde way: but indeede ſuch a one as contrariwiſe is alreadie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged both by the kings and parliaments of this realme, who haue condemned and openly reiected it, as erring both in matter and forme.</p>
            <p>Thus are they ridde, as they thinke, of theſe two the neereſt princes, but nowe there reſt the Catholike prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> againſt whome theſe exceptions cannot be oppoſed: for as for the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> it is enough for them that hee liue ſo long, as for the nouriſhing of their authoritie they ſhall ſtande in neede of him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt age and danger: thus thinke they to get them chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Then againſt the Catholike princes deſcended of the late lorde prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> they arme themſelues with another exception brought into conſequence out of the bull: That is, that the ſaide lorde prince their father died an heretike denounced, whereby hee had forfaited all his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23265:4"/>
rights and actions both for himſelfe and his: neither let the duke of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> or his poſteritie weene to eſcape, though being engendred of a father as deuout a Catholike prince as euer was, for hauing likewiſe followed their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garies in this point. For they of the league doo thinke by their principles to haue well enough prouided for them: in that they write that the crowne is theirs before either <hi>Merouee, Charlemaine,</hi> or <hi>Capet:</hi> This is then long before Saint <hi>Lewes,</hi> from whome they are deſcended: when by their bookes, they pretende that beyonde the tenth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, there is no longer ſucceſsion neither in heritage, fees nor kingdomes, and ſo conſequentlie wee muſt haue recourſe to a newe election: for all the reſt of the houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> are farre beyond that: When to the ende to raiſe vp the foundations of this eſtate they do by expreſſe bookes call into doubt the <hi>Salike</hi> law, whereby it hath ſo manie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges defended it ſelfe from ſtrangers, to the ende that after this no alteration may ſeeme ſtrange.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the diſcourſes which they publiſhed in their writings ſcattered among the people at the beginning of this warre, whereby their drifts did euidently appeare to all wiſe men. The king had no children, neither was there any great hope, thought they, that euer he ſhould get any. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>Bourbon</hi> was vnmarried, and vnder his ſhadow their power might ſerue againſt the reſt of the princes. The king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and late prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> were denounced here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes: the Lords princes of <hi>Contie,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>endoſme</hi> and Earle of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> deſcended of a prince that fancied hereſie, &amp; ſo by vertue of the bull, entangled in the like degradation: The duke of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> and princes of <hi>Ombes</hi> verie farre off, yea beyond the tenth degree, which (ſaid they) ſtopped vp their gate to the ſucceſsion, and opened another to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a newe prince. Thus you ſee, they haue ridde and ſwept the way to come to the crowne, neither is there anie other queſtion but to imploy labour and force whereby to bring the ſtate violently into their facultie.</p>
            <p>The enterpriſe was high &amp; difficult: for the Frenchmans nature ſtill draweth to the right: It was a harde matter thus to exclude a prince in reſpect of ſome diuerſitie in religion,

yea ſuch a one as craueth to bee inſtructed in a counſell: alſo the houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> hath ſo well theſe many ages deſerued of the ſtate, and that is ſo well imprinted in their minds, &amp; as it were incorporate into all good Frenchmen, that they were in great doubt, leſt the wrong that ſhoulde bee done thereto would bee verie ſenſible to all the degrees in <hi>France.</hi> It was therefore neceſſarie for them to be aſsiſted by ſome forreine, rich &amp; mighty prince, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that end they were to cal into part. Wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before the blow they practiſed with the king of <hi>Spaine</hi>: they got great ſums of mony from him, which they diſtributed among their partakers: they promiſed as a pledge of their faith to commit into his hands the beſt townes that they could take, namely <hi>Bourdeux</hi> and <hi>Marſeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> which they made ſure account of: farther alluring him with ſome hope to procure the crowne to fal into his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hands, by aboliſhing the <hi>Salique</hi> law: and to begin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, they ſhould bring him into <hi>Brittain.</hi> Matters diſcouered by their owne letters and remembrances: matters which the king and his eſpeciall ſeruants know well enough: yea they had gone ſo farre that the ſaid king of <hi>Spaine</hi> a while had his armie readie and vnder ſaile to fall thereupon, had he not in time beene preuented: yea hee had his reaſons readie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Spaniſh doctor, whereby he pretended to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his diſcent in <hi>Britaine,</hi> as by right vnto him appertaining, euen as hee had made his vſurpation in <hi>Portugall.</hi> Their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was (for they ſuppoſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be craftie enough to cauſe all the ambition in the world to bow vnder theirs) that this prince was old and decrepit, and could not liue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie yeares: that at his deceaſe hee ſhoulde leaue his eſtates ſcattered and in danger of troubles, which woulde keepe his heires from looking any farther: and that in the meane time they ſhould get helpe and ſuccour in their preſent neceſsitie, and that it reſted onelie hereafter to looke to that might happen.</p>
            <p>But this prince, who is but too ſkilfull in his owne affaires was wiſe enough to take his time for the obteining from them as an earneſt pennie, a great piece of ſeruice, yea ſuch as peraduenture will boile for euer in this realme. For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that his ſtates of the low countries had ſent their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23265:5"/>
to the king to yeeld themſelues into his armes and to giue him their perſons. For a firſt ſeruice that he demandeth of our maſters of the League, he willeth them to take armes at the verie inſtant that his maieſtie was to reſolue vpon the propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſaid eſtates, otherwiſe he proteſteth againſt them &amp; meaneth not in time to come any way to aſsiſt them with his habilitie: whereby they were driuen to haſten their entering into armes certaine monethes before their time: whereof it inſued that the ſtate was troubled, the ſaid depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſent away without doing any thing, and the crowne fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of that great and goodly increaſe that was then offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Hereby therefore let all <hi>France</hi> iudge of the nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſtrange of the captaines of this League, who to the end to warrant the K. of <hi>Spaine</hi> from an vncertaine loſſe, doo caſt this realme into an aſſured ſhipwracke: who do redeeme the Spaniards danger with the Frenchmans death and his dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, with the vtter ſubuerſion of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe their wicked intents did they cloake with verie beautifull pretences: for the vppermoſt painting was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine deuotion, a zeale to the church: as if the king, who was an example to all men, ſtoode in need of armed ſolliciters to bring him into the way: but this hypocriſie was likewiſe as ſoone deſcried through the viſarde. And indeede the king by an expreſſe decree declared them to be rebels and guiltie of treaſon: and ſo would haue all his good ſubiectes to take them: yea, and to the ſame end he writ to his courts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, to all his bailifs and ſtewards, and to his principal townes: and aduertiſed his ambaſſadors reſident with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine princes, charging them to lay open their conſpiracie againſt his perſon and crowne, expreſlie commanding all good Frenchmen to ouerrunne them and their adherents, and deſiring all princes his neighbours, allies, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates to aſsiſt him againſt theſe with both men and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Theſe diſpatches, I ſay, which his maieſtie ſent euerie way both within and without the realme, do faithfully ſhew what his iudgement was of them when he termed them <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of a publike peace vnder a falſe ſhadow of religion:</hi> when in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe termes he confeſſeth, that they ſhoot not at his crown onelie, but alſo at his perſon: likewiſe the ſpeeches which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23265:6"/>
with his own mouth, he vſed both in the Parliament &amp; town houſe, which wee all may yet remember. And this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was neither ſuborned nor wreſted by art or by ſorce, but put foorth of his owne and the moſt inward motion of his minde: for, as it hath ſufficientlie ſince appeared, what force or counſaile had hee about him to vrge him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the league, albeit contrariwiſe there were ſome neere to his maieſtie that vſed violence in their behalfes.</p>
            <p>And in deede his commandements were then ſo taken and conſtrued, neither was there anie ſubtiltie ſought out but according to the bare letter: for ſundrie companies of thoſe of the league that were in ſundrie places defeated by the gouernors and the dukes of <hi>Ioieuſe</hi> and <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> with his maieſties forces made open warre againſt them, as alſo the lord Marſhall <hi>Matignon,</hi> with the aduiſe of the court of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Bourdeux</hi> impriſoned the lord of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ailac</hi> their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, and thruſt him foorth of Caſtle <hi>Trompet,</hi> and likewiſe the lord great prior gouernour of <hi>Prouence,</hi> apprehended thoſe that had enterpriſed in the behalfe of the league a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the towne of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and were fauored with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of ſixe gallies of <hi>Florence</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which waited the execution of their purpoſe, to the ende, to take poſſeſsion in the king of <hi>Spaines</hi> name, whoſe proces was made by the Parliament of <hi>Aix</hi> with great ſolemnitie, according to the tenure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were put to death in <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> Theſe ſynodall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies and ſoueraigne decrees were ſufficient interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the kings intent againſt thoſe of the league, and the rather becauſe theſe witneſſes, iudges and executioners were the verie ſame that ſawe deepeſt into the kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward minde, as hauing ſhewed greateſt rigour to the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guonets</hi> in the former warres, and were therefore to them ſuſpected of ſtomacke in matter of their religion, but free from all ſuſpition, or exception to thoſe of the holy league.</p>
            <p>Now let vs note the behauiours and actions of the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> at the ſame time: hee ſee himſelfe perſonallie aſſaulted, hee perceiued that hee was both the ſubiect and obiect of thoſe of the league: The ſpeech was of no
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23265:6"/>
leſſe matter, then to take from him both his life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to murther all that hee loued, or that ioued him. This had beene enough in ſome to haue bred a ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie rather then a patience: It was enough to haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a warre abruptlie, much more to defend himſelfe from that which was alreadie mooued. On the other ſide hee perceiued the King highlie offended againſt the league: hee ſawe that hee daylie wrote vnto him, that hee tooke both the quarrell, and the warre to bee his owne: that hee perceiued that they ſhotte both at his eſtate and life: That his name and religion were but pretences: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that it was requiſite to let his people vnderſtande as much, whome vnder the falſe ſhadowe of religion they had miſcaried from their dueties. This, beſides the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the cauſe, had alſo beene enough to arme him both with title and authoritie againſt the League: And had hee thus taken armes, no man woulde haue blamed him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as through want of dooing it in time, hee nowe findeth himſelfe in trouble. In the meane time hee beſides the right and naturall feeling, being neuertheleſſe (as all men knowe) wiſe enough in each other thing, did yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue himſelfe from the Kings hande to waite for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for theſe miſchieues. Hee conteineth all his friendes and ſeruaunts in patience, and the Proteſtant townes in peace and ſilence: hee diſpoſeth himſelfe to ſerue his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie vppon his token, and in time conuenient: hee will not for his owne part vndertake anie thing, which may either kindle this war (which ſeemed to happen fitlie for him againſt the League) or that anie way may bee a let to the quenching thereof.</p>
            <p>Contrariwiſe (and indeede wee muſt needes remember it) theſe were the ſpeeches which for the maintenance of peace hee then vſed. In matter of religion hee declared to the King, alſo to the ſtates and all degrees of this realme that hee had beene therein euen from his youth brought vp: That after he came to yeares of diſcretion, he had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeene nor heard any thing that might turn him therfro, That he beleeued that hee was in the right way of ſaluation,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23265:7"/>
wherein hee had perſeuered in the midſt of dangers, and maugre the intiſements of the world: Neuertheleſſe that he was readie to learne of the <hi>Church</hi> in a free <hi>Councell,</hi> whether hee would bring both aptneſſe and attention to learne: for it did euidentlie enough appeare that his perſeuerance in his religion was neither ambition, nor obſtinacie: that ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he were therewith poſſeſſed, might be much better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied on the other ſide: as for obſtinacie, it was too preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vnto him, ſith it conſiſted vpon his quietnes, honour and ſtate. That at this day as well in this realme as through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſtendom theſe matters were growne to theſe termes wherein euen the colledge of <hi>Sorbonne</hi> was wont to ſay, that either part ſhoulde beare with other, without taxing each other with hereſie vntill a good counſell conſented vnto and accepted by both partes had concluded and decreed therupon: that is a great number of learned men of either ſide, townes, prouinces, nations, common wealthes, &amp; whole eſtates, holding as well for the one as for the other. A moſt certaine argument that all theſe will not of a iolitie damne themſelues: Arguments likewiſe that the controuerſie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in matter diſputable, ſith that among all nations and ſo contrarie climats, all ſortes of people doo cleaue thereto, yea after a thouſand torments euen to the death. Wherefore Chriſtiandome hath nowe as great neede as euer to haue a free and lawfull councell. That the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Trent</hi> could not bee alledged to haue been ſuch, wherein the parties were hearde: wherein alſo the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie moſt accuſed, and which needed greateſt reformation ſat as iudge: and againſt the which our moſt Chriſtian kings immediatly after the battell of <hi>Dreux,</hi> togither with many wiſe Princes, expreſly by their Embaſſadours proteſted nullitie, and namelie becauſe therein they woulde not deale with reformation of doctrine to the rule of the holie ſcriptures, but onely in outward ſhewe. Whereupon euen in the moſt rigorous times, and after the <hi>bloodie Barthol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew</hi> is was reiected both by the maſters of <hi>Sorbonne</hi> and the courtes of paliament of this realme: that in matters of leſſe conſequence the primitiue Church neuer denied the reiterating of counſailes. That the councell of <hi>Baſill</hi> had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23265:7"/>
bound the Pope and the church of Roome to holde a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell euerie tenne yeares, a tearme alreadie expired ſince that at <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe howe farre more ſeemely it were for the Church, and with howe much leſſe perill to this realme to reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a councell than a ciuill warre, a conference in wordes, than a battaile? That particularly his perſon and dignitie were of ſuch importance that they could not well denie him this path to iuſtice, conſidering that ſometime there had bin three or foure Councels holden for the reclaiming of ſome one priuate perſon onely: conſidering alſo that the ſtatutes of this realme, ſworne vnto the king and his counſell, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his courts of Parliament, &amp;c. had foreiudged of this caſe, forbidding the title of hereſie in both partes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely ſuſpending it vntill the deciſion of ſome free and holy Councell.</p>
            <p>Concerning their pretence of the ſtate, the ſaid lord King moſt humbly beſought his Maieſtie and admoniſhed all the ſtates of this realme to conſider how vnfit a thing it were of it ſelfe, and principally for theſe men to intrude themſelues into ſuch nouelties: that the king was not of any ſuch age, that with the knife at his throte he was to be forced to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate his ſucceſſour to this Realme, eſpecially conſidering what ſucceſſour they pretended to force him to name, whom they ought not to preſuppoſe to be able by the courſe of nature to out liue his Maieſtie. Alſo that in caſe matters were at that point, yet were there other more practiſeable meanes and ſuch as time out of mind had beene put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in this eſtate: but to anticipate a danger to come with a preſent one, an vncertaine with by an vnfallble, a ſuite of a matter not yet fallen, by a ciuill warre, was as much as to preuent a feare with death it ſelfe and a ſickeneſſe with a poyſon. That of this warre begunne vppon a iolitie muſt needes enſue the ouerthrowe of the people, the diminiſhing of the nobilitie, the empoueriſhment of the clergie, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulling of all godlineſſe, the baſtardie of iuſtice, the aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all good lawes, the totall corruption of manners: to be briefe, confuſion in al things and deſolation of the whole eſtate. So farre ſhould we be from looking for that beautifull
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23265:8"/>
reeſtabliſhment and new golden world which they promiſe: for euerie warre is an inſtrument of deſtruction, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ciuill, which is a headlong deſolation, as beeing the ſharpeſt diſeaſe of a ſtate. Moreouer albeit hee were of ſuch calling in this realme that whatſoeuer concerned him ought throughly to be conſidered as touching his Maieſtie and the common wealth, yet ſith they had taken him for their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, hee moſt humbly beſought his Maieſtie, either to the end to eſchew the danger of his perſon, to ſuffer him to end this warre with them, as being aſſured to finde friendes and ſeruants enough to compaſſe it, ſo as he ſhould not neede to troble himſelf therabout, either elſe for auoyding the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people, to determine it by a combate of his perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the D. of <hi>Guize</hi> &amp; the late lord Prince againſt the D. of <hi>Maine</hi> the captaines of this conſpiracie, as being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that God who ruleth the weapons, is able enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale his iudgementes in their puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Neither propounded he theſe thinges in any flying pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets ſubiect to diſaduow, as many of theirs are, but in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall and authenticall manner, viz. by declaration written &amp; ſigned with his owne hande bearing date the tenth of Iune 1585. and preſented to his Maieſtie by the lords of <hi>Clereuant</hi> and <hi>Chaſsincourt,</hi> and in a full aſſembly of the priuie Councell read word by word in his Maieſties preſence, the ſaid lords of <hi>Clereuant</hi> &amp; <hi>Chaſſincourt</hi> requiring his Maieſtie not to miſlike that it were exhibited to our Maſters of the court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris.</hi> As alſo to the ſame effect the ſaid lord king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> did write to our Maſters of the Court; whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to iudge and beare witnes of his behauiour, to our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the three eſtates, each one ſeuerally foretelling the miſchiefes that he foreſaw and which themſelues haue ſince ſeene: to our Maſters of <hi>Sorbonne</hi> who iudged his ſubmiſſions to be not pertinent, &amp; contrariwiſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned the raſhnes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt him. To the Princes &amp; common wealths, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, &amp; confederate with this eſtate, who partly by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour which they haue ſince ſent him for his defence, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their counſaile to the king, to miniſter iuſtice vnto him do ſufficiently ſhew what their iudgements are, as being far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our paſſions: of the ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the auctors of the league,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23265:8"/>
of the king of <hi>Nauarres</hi> moderation and patience, of the good entertainement that the one deſerueth at the kinges hands, and of the puniſhment due vnto the other.</p>
            <p>Finally the fatalitie which ſeemeth to thruſt forward this poore eſtate to her deſtruction: alſo the colluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bad cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, who willingly do ſet to their ſhoulders, &amp; are in troth fatalitie it ſelfe, cauſed that the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> might not be heard in his iuſt declarations, cauſed peace to be made with the league to his coſt, and cauſed that his patience was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him for a tranſgreſſion, and contrariwiſe, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of theſe of the league allowed and acknowledged for a notable ſeruice.</p>
            <p>The king of <hi>Nauar</hi> did through his diſcretion, conſidering the conſtellation that then reigned together with the mutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracies then practiſed, ſufficiently foreſee that they ment to diſſolue the whole cloud vpon him, for the ſafetie of others. To hold the roome that he held in this realme, &amp; to haue ſo great intereſt in all treaties the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made &amp; not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, neither ſo much as to be once ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withal, was ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make him beleeue that the tretie with thoſe of the league was indeed a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract againſt him, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding of a peace with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was a plain denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing of war againſt him. Neither wanted he aduiſe or perſwaſions from his partakers, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in euident danger reproued his ouerlong pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wherefore they ſaw well that they muſt ſuffer. Al which notwithſtanding he neuer ſtirred: but repoſed his confidence in God the protector of his right and innocencie, vpon the king &amp; Queene mothers word, who had ſo often &amp; expreſly promiſed him that they would neither doo nor ſuffer to be done any thing to his harme or the preiudice of the edicts of peace. And indeed who would haue imagined that for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſakes they would haue ſacrificed their own domeſticals? or ſtanched the inſatiable thirſt of thoſe of <hi>Loxraine</hi> with the ſhedding of the french bloud and loſſe of their owne?</p>
            <p>Well, peace was concluded with thoſe of the league: their edict of peace was a decree of baniſhment againſt the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the late lorde Prince and their partakers. To be briefe, al the war was at once &amp; without knowing any cauſe why, turned againſt this poore Prince and the french armies
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23265:9"/>
put into the hands of the houſe of <hi>Lorraine</hi> for the executing of this violent edict with all outrage. A matter neuer before heard of in any iuſtice: (but likewiſe who will ſeeke iuſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many iniuſtices) that the parties, conſidering their ſtomackes, ſhould be made both commiſſioners and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners in their owne plea? But will you plainely ſee that the cauſes which in their writinges they alleage for their iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, were but vaine pretences? They had promiſed reliefe to the people, reeſtabliſhment of dignitie to the Nobilitie, and the auncient authoritie and libertie to the Clergie, and to the ſame end of ſome they had gotten the perſons &amp; from others the coyne: howbeit when they came to treat, there is no ſpeech of any ſuch matter: they had ſworne to the lord Cardinall of <hi>Burbon</hi> that they would cauſe him to be nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated ſucceſſour to the crowne: yea they would rather be buried then depart therefro; that likewiſe they had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Their onely drift was, to be ſtill armed, vnder whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer pretence, and to place all their family in good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or in the ſtrongeſt holdes: and hauing once wonne that point they preſumed themſelues to the arbitrators of <hi>France.</hi> And in deede, for the compaſſing thereof they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the reſt, they renounce them to the people, to the Nobilitie and Clergie, to the eminencie of the ſtate, and to the zeale of the Church. But al this is found to be ſwallowed and drowned in their particular ambition, and ſince that time wee haue ſeene no more of it, there hath beene (I ſay) no mention or memorie thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus do we ſee on the one part theſe of the league tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough their violence armed with the kings name and armor, and on the other ſide, the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> furniſhed with the kinges will, (but vnarmed) againſt the league. All that hee can get is certaine ſecret excuſes: <hi>That they are verie ſorrie for it: but they could not otherwiſe rid their handes: that they muſt needes yeeld to this rage, &amp;c.</hi> In the meane time on euerie ſide they came vpon him: the edict of pacification is infringed in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the league: throughout the realme are nothing but proſcriptions and baniſhments: ſuch as aſſiſted the king a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the league, being both ſent for and commaunded by his Maieſtie, of good ſeruants, euen in one day, are become
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23265:9"/>
offenders: yet can he not at once abandon all patience: hee will commune with the D. of <hi>Montmerencie,</hi> a peere of <hi>France,</hi> and chiefe officer of the crowne, one that is not ſuſpected of religion. They meete at <hi>S. Paule</hi> of <hi>Cadeiouz</hi> in <hi>Alby:</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine there certaine dayes to conferre: his Maieſties depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are heard giue out the ſpeeches aforeſaide, whereupon they reſolue manfully to withſtande the miſchiefe, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe is remedileſſe, the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi>: the late lorde Prince and the Duke of <hi>Montmorencie,</hi> neuertheles by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe proteſtation of the tenth of Auguſt declaring that to their great greife through this precipitation they are forced to haue recourſe to weapons: that as all the world knoweth, they haue tollerated vntill all extremitie, but that ſeeing the enemie readie to fall vpon them they could doo no leſſe, but take counſaile both of neceſſitie and nature. That they had offered and againe did offer in matter of religion to yeeld to a free counſell, and in matters of ſtate to a lawfull conuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtates, yea to ſubmit themſelues to the hazard of a combate, albeit with their inferiors, rather then to ſee the deſolation of this ſtate and calamitie of ſo much people: but if either violence or bad counſaile had ſtopped vp their eares to their iuſt reaſons, that they declared before God and all the good ſubiects of this lande, that they had not taken armes but for the kinges authoritie and libertie manifeſtly oppreſſed, yea and that with his owne conſent voluntarily teſtified by ſo many his declarations, letters, decrees and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: that they neither haue nor will haue for enimies any other then thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his owne meere motion he had denounced enemies to his life and the peace of his realme: that in reſpect of religion they would make no diſtinction of the kings ſubiectes, but would cheriſh and embrace them all with like affection and countenance, only requiring them to the end to be the better diſtinguiſhed, to ſeparate themſelues both from the counſailes and dealings of the league: prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting all the miſeries and calamities that this eſtate is to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to be vnto them both ſenſible and ſorrowful, who are the bloud and members thereof, but not ſo to thoſe that are but grafted in &amp; that verie ſlightly, moreouer from the bottome of their ſoules calling for Gods wrath and curſe againſt the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23265:10"/>
authors of ſo many miſchiefes and vpon their practiſes and enterpriſes, a vow which God hath in troth heard, if we liſt to ſee it throughout the whole progreſſe of this warre of the league.</p>
            <p>Well, the war was earneſtly begun, &amp; ſee, we are now come to the third yeare: now let vs call to mind the goodly ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they then vſed to bring vs in taſt with it. The king <hi>Nauarre</hi> (ſaide they) within a fewe monthes would be ſhut vp in ſome one of his houldes without all hope of ſuccour and forced to forſake the realme, &amp; not to find any aſſured place where to ſoiourn. The Proteſtants hands within the firſt yere ſhould in part yeelde for feare at the firſt brunt of their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, &amp; in part be won by force if they obſtinatly durſt reſiſt.</p>
            <p>For the ſeconde yeare they ſhould not haue paſt three or foure left, &amp; thoſe, by their ſaying, rather to practiſe then to trouble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for their ſuccour, it was but in vaine to ſpeak of any: for they had taken ſo good order in <hi>Germany</hi> that there could be no leauie made for the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and if there ſhould, yet did they promiſe to fight with it, yea euen to go to ſeeke it to the verie borders of the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fooliſher ſort &amp; ſuch as with their paſſions were drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, beleeued theſe things and felt euen to the bottomes of their purſes to ſee theſe miracles, ſo ſtoutly affirmed by theſe triaclers. If wiſe men, &amp; experienced captains purpoſed to declare all theſe things to be vaine. If they alleaged that our kings had employed 25. yeres in vaine: that there was neuer a ſinew in this realme but had bin ſtrained, or neuer a veine but had bin launced &amp; drawen dry, then they ſaid that theſe enterpriſers were of a far other ſort, &amp; that they knew other ſecrets the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they found. So greatly doth the worlde delight to be deceiued at her own coſt, yea ſo far doth this age (enimie of her felicity) delight to abandon her ſelfe to the firſt potti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary. Now let vs ſee what this mountaine will bring forth.</p>
            <p>The kinges armies are deliuered to the authors of the league: the king abandoneth all his force and authoritie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands: they alſo without ſparing do put thereto as much as their credite wil reach. They haue <hi>Lancknights, Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> and <hi>Reiſters,</hi> the Clergie do endeuour themſelues to pay theſe armies, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſale of their temporalties, though
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23265:10"/>
not without repentance: the king and his people do ſpende foure yeares profit in one: the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> employeth one part of his <hi>Indies</hi>: to be briefe, in this realm we haue now that which was neuer ſeene before, viz. eight armies at once in the field, and euerie of them able to beſiege, euerie of them painfully employed, each in his quarter.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> hath all this while neither ſuccour nor aſſiſtance from any place: all his enimies haue condemned him to the death, and al that loued him do diſpaire of him. What may a iuſt cauſe do in the aſſurance of a courage againſt all endeuors? this Prince was neuer ſeene ſtoupe leſſe, &amp; that doth euery one know, or ſet himſelf more ſtiftely againſt aduerſity: but indeed, what is not the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty able to warrant thoſe that walke vprightly? He breathed vpon all theſe armies, and they ſcattered of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues before they had doone any thing: ſauing there was ſome ſconce or village take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which coſt vs millions, neither doth it appeare that euer they were, vnleſſe by the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the countrey or deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people. For in the weakening of the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> or of his partakers, nothing can be knowen.</p>
            <p>Now let vs (I pray you) grow to account &amp; leaue robbing of our owne purſe. In the gouernment of <hi>Guyen</hi> they haue both employed and diſplayed all their miracles and powers: who then would not rather haue <hi>Taillebourg, Royan, Talmont</hi> and <hi>Fontenay</hi> then <hi>Monſegur S. Bazeile</hi> &amp; <hi>Caſtillon?</hi> And <hi>Caſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> I ſay, the labor &amp; triumphes of the L. of <hi>Mayne,</hi> the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of ſo many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the bottomles gulph of ſo much coin, recouered againe by the L. of <hi>Turenne</hi> in one houre with ten ſhillings worth of ladders? In <hi>Languedocke</hi> who wold change <hi>S. Pons, Lodeue</hi> &amp; <hi>Capeſtan</hi> for <hi>Marueiolz?</hi> or in <hi>Dauphine</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall wee counterpeize <hi>Montlimar, Ambrun</hi> and <hi>Dic?</hi> And all this gotten in one night with ten pound of powder: whereas a ſmall caſtle muſt coſt vs both monethes, ſtore hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and armies: neither can we ſay that in recompence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they haue loſt more men. For it is well enough knowen that the aſſailant alwaies looſeth a hundred for tenne. The ouerthrow of the L. of <hi>Vius,</hi> the recouery of <hi>Montlimar</hi> &amp; the battaile at <hi>Coutraz</hi> would ſay ſomewhat hereof where we loſt ſo much nobility without any reciprocall loſſe on their ſide,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23265:11"/>
where alſo ſo much good French bloud was prodigally ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which might haue beene better employed elſe where, whereof alſo wee imagine our ſelues well comforted poore wretches that we are, when in the pallace they rore out vnto vs the ouerthrowe of the <hi>Switzers.</hi> And all this afore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned did he without any forreine ſuccour, albeit both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germanie</hi> did in the beginning make ſufficient ſhew there of their gooodwils to this prince and his affaires. Whome God thus guided through his wonderfull prouidence to the end euery man might well perceiue that the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and his alone &amp; without any ſupport might be able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themſelues againſt the league: that the people likewiſe might note their fraude and boaſting when they made this enterpriſe ſo eaſie, and ſo became wiſer and leſſe paſſionate hereafter: but eſpecially that ſuch as feare God and do aſſure themſelues to march vnder the conduct of his prouidence might the more euidently perceiue his bleſſing ouer the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and innocencie of this prince, more euidently (I ſay) in his weakeneſſe then in his force, and contrariwiſe his wrath and curſe ouer the violence &amp; iniuries of thoſe of the league in the greatnes of their power and vanitie of their effects.</p>
            <p>But marke now I pray you. Now that they be recreant &amp; able to do no more, the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> whom they ſhould haue choſen to the end of the world, doth in our view keepe the field, forceth out townes with the Canon, gathereth new ſtrength, and before our noſes in the middeſt of <hi>France</hi> dare giue vs battaile, and neuer vouchſafe to attende the ſuccour that he is farre of. Beholde alſo on the other ſide the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers came in with a mightie and terrible armie which theſe our maſters ſhould haue through their diligence choaked in <hi>Germanie,</hi> or at the leaſt haue defeated vppon the border of <hi>Rhine:</hi> and yet euen in their preſence it paſſeth the heart of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> goeth through all their gouernments without anie one alaram, and is felt euen in our bowels: and when theſe good marriners haue caſt vs into the ſtorme, or brought vs vpon the rocke, not knowing to what ſaint to vow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, they leaue vs to the oare, and without any ſpeech ſteale them ſelues into the skiffe, accounting themſelues ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with a <hi>ſaue who ſaue can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:23265:11"/>Truelie it is nowe therefore time for vs to thinke vpon our affaires, for we haue let our ſelues runne too farre after their wrongfull paſsions: Too late doo wee perceiue their malice and our raſhneſſe, for long ſince haue they purpoſed to take to themſelues ſpoile of our owne wrecke. It is high time for vs all with like endeuours to ſet hande vnto that holy anker which is able to warrant our veſſell from ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, and which onely in this perill may ſtand vs in ſteede of a hauen.</p>
            <p>To what purpoſe, will yee ſay, is all this large diſcourſe? Truelie to the end wee may rather late then neuer perceiue that we proſecute a wrongfull and vnprofitable warre, and therefore that by ſome end we ſhorten the courſe of our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Wrongfull I ſay, and therefore we are aſſured of Gods curſſe vpon our ſoules, vnprofitable alſo, for who can proſper againſt Gods will? And what haue wee in the courſe of theſe three parts ſeene, but a meere going backeward and fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals in liew of triumphes? But you will replie, In whome is the fault that we haue not peace? alſo howe often haue wee cauſed it to bee motioned? went not the queene into <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tou</hi> to the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi>? But this prince (men ſay) is ſhie, and will not eaſily bee handled: truely with all ſuch as haue not haunted him he is to bee pardoned though they thinke him not tractable: for conſidering howe hee hath euer ſince his youth beene intreated, they may haue good cauſe ſo to beleeue, ſith the moſt patient man in the world might haue growen out of patience, the moſt phlegmatike into choler, the eaſieſt and moſt tractable, to bee diſtruſtfull, backwarde and implacable.</p>
            <p>But let vs iudge of his humors by his behauiours: he came to the warre vpon great extremitie and that as late as hee could: it is then to bee beleeued that he will not be ſlacke to come to peace: he ſaw himſelfe and his partaker perſecuted with all rigor, confiſcate, baniſhed, diſgraded, condemned, executed, murdered, and all vnder colour of the religion which he profeſſed: all which notwithſtanding hee neuer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his manner of proceedings: hee neuer moleſted anie for religion: hee kept their promiſed liberties and ſafetie: hee preſerued vnder his protection ſuch Catholikes as were
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23265:12"/>
not of the League, yea he pardoned euen thoſe of the league and being taken after the heate of armes hee gratified them, and if he vſed a contrerigour wee could not tell what to ſay: for wee all doo ſufficientlie knowe that the firſt is guiltie of the ſecond. Wee muſt therefore confeſſe that hee hath a verie temperate minde, beſides his nature: hee I ſay, whome ſo manie wronges, griefes and iniuries could neuer make paſsionate or to alter. It hath alſo beene ſufficientlie noted that ſo long as there was anie hope to ſee him ouerthrowne: or that his enimies had anie aduantage of him, they were ſtill aſsiſted with all helpe, without anie ſpare: they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer propounded vnto him anie meete condition: albeit the next daie after a victorie of his, hee ſendeth to the King, hee bewaileth with him the ſhedding of ſo much blood as is ſpilt, hee offereth with all his heart to doo him ſeruice in the ſtanching thereof: hee returneth moſt of the priſoners of account, either infinitelie commending his curteſie, or if they conceale it, of all men condemned of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</p>
            <p>Truelie he, who being raſhlie delt with in ſo manie ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and yet was neuer ſeene out of courſe, no not being cauſed with full bridle, cannot but haue a ſure heade and mouth, neither is there any let, but in our good helpe, that he may do verie well. To be briefe, in his aduerſitie wee haue ſeene him victorious, in his proſperitie a conqueror of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: in the ſoreſt ſmart of his iniuries cleane from all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, in the ſwifteſt ſlidings of his good happe, void of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencie: alwaies readie to admit the reaſons of ſuch as haue offended him particularlie, and to giue ouer his moſt boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling paſsions to common benefite. Let vs then beleeue that hee flieth not from peace, but deſireth it: and that he is not ſo ſhie and malitious as men make him. But indeed the Roſe pricketh when we doo not take hold of it where we ſhould, and if we conſider well, we ſhall ſee that all that hath yet ben done, and as it ſeemeth of ſet purpoſe, hath tended onelie to driue him into diſpaire.</p>
            <p>To prooue this to bee ſo, let vs ſee howe they haue dealt with thoſe of the League, and howe with the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi>: hee a houſehold childe, they ſtrangers, not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23265:12"/>
ſo much as of the familie, though they bee of the realme. The <hi>Guizians</hi> are not ſo ſoone (though without cauſe) vp in armes, but the Queene, all thinges ſet aſide, goeth to them, yea ſhee ſeeketh after them euen to the lands ende: them, who had they beene couragiouſlie aſſailed were not able anie whit to abide it. Contrariwiſe the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> beeing for the ſafetie of his owne perſon, conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take armes, is left alone fifteene whole monethes to drie vp the blowes, hee is on all ſides ſhotte at, to make an ende of him: ſo long as they thinke to ſee him either beſieged or beaten, they ſpeake neuer a worde, but waite the ende: But when his enimies are no longer able to aſſaile him: when they haue diſcharged euen their laſt peece in vaine, when hauing long time fenced and borne off the blowes they ſee him ſounde and ſafe readie to repay them, then beginne they to vouchſafe to ſpeake vnto him, and that as it ſeemeth rather to hale the enimies out of the preaſe, then any way to content him.</p>
            <p>The Queene comming neere to the <hi>Guizians</hi> for feare of ſcarring them, cauſeth all her power to depart, ceaſeth all hoſtilitie, letteth ſcape all occaſions to harme them, giueth them leaſure to gather together both their ſpirits and helpes, yea, both <hi>Reiſtres</hi> and <hi>Suitzers</hi>: Contrariwiſe (and that was the good counſaile of the good French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that aſsiſted her) at the verie time of her comming to parley with the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> did the armie of the Lorde of <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> moſt force it ſelfe in <hi>Languedocke,</hi> where it put all that it coulde force to fire and ſworde, as alſo did the armie of the Lord of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> in <hi>Prouence</hi>: yea hardlie will ſhe permitte after manie formalities and iournies to and fro, that the Marſhall <hi>Biron</hi> ſhould ſtaie beyond <hi>Loire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queene, to content thoſe of the league, promiſeth that the Germaines that come to the Kings ſuccour ſhoulde not enter, and ſuſpendeth their leauie, albeit the iſſue of the negotiation were doubtfull: Contrariwiſe ſhee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> for a preamble, firſt of al vnder the vncertaine hope of an vncertaine peace to ſuſpende and ſtay his forreine armie.</p>
            <p>But wil you ſee after ſo many ceremonies what conditions
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23265:13"/>
are propounded vnto him. That is, <hi>That all exerciſe of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ceaſe in al the townes within his authoritie and part.</hi> That <hi>himſelf and all his reſolue with themſelues vtterlie to renounce the ſame, and neuer more to ſpeake of it,</hi> otherwiſe let him neuer looke for anie peace at the kings hands, whereas for ſatisfying thoſe of the league al exerciſe was taken from thoſe of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that is, ſo far as might be, they had giuen them both their bodies and ſoules. Theſe are the ſpeeches which the queene verie earneſtlie commanded the lord of <hi>Touraine</hi> to impart to the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> from the which ſhee neuer departed. And then thinke you what likelihood there was after fortie yeares fire, and fiue and twentie yeares warre that the <hi>Huguo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> woulde ſuffer themſelues to be brought backe to their A B C. yea imagine whether they whome ſo manie trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, namely theſe laſt, had made cannon proofe, who durſt abide the cannon in poore milnes rather then to force their conſciences, were capable of this article, and that a hundred townes more, which their beſt armies durſt not once looke vpon, would yeeld thereto. Thus was al broken off: and note in the inequalitie of the perſons and cauſes the arſiuerſie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie of the proceedings: that which ought to haue ſet forward this negotiation, was the cauſe to breake it off: For they of the league, who feare nothing ſo much as a peace feared alſo the ſhadow thereof: and indeede, to the ende to trouble it, the ſhuffeled they cardes anew, they procured the ſeiſing vpon ſome ſtrong holdes in <hi>Picardie</hi> miſſed of others: places free from ſuſpition, eſpecially farre from religion, yea by practiſes they attempted againſt the kings perſon and life: matters knowne both to their maieſties and all others, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Queene founded an argument to returne to his maieſtie to preuent it, and ſo did the negotiation reſolue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing, for feare of diſpleaſing them: whereas truely it had been the meanes to reunite al <hi>France</hi> into one: to ioyne togither againe all the blood againſt the common enimie of this eſtate, and to giue the abuſed euidentlie to weet, that there was no longer queſtion of religion, and that theſe men had bewrayed themſelues in ſeiſing vppon the Catholike townes, and in oppoſing themſelues againſt the king at that verie inſtant, when by their ſuggeſtion he warred moſt ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23265:13"/>
vpon the Proteſtants. Thus to the ende againe, to reſtore thoſe of the league to the countrie, was the whole treatie of peace, begunne with the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> ſet aſide, albeit the Queene had promiſed to ſende paſſeports for the ſafetie of the deputies whom the ſaide king purpoſed to ſend for aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes of that treatie, whereof we haue neuer ſince heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpeech.</p>
            <p>What then? muſt we, will you ſay, to the ende to obtaine peace, tollerate that religion? I would to God we were well ſo, and that we had no other matter then that to decide, We ſhall like wel enough that the Pope for a miſerable gaine ſhal ſuffer the <hi>Iewes</hi> freely in <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet be tearmed <hi>Moſt holie.</hi> That the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to the end to be at reſt with his <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> by expreſſe treatie ſhall not only graunt them their religion throughout their countrie, but alſo aboliſh his own, and yet be neuertheleſſe Catholike: And yet our king muſt forfeit his name of <hi>Moſt Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe he ſuffereth the Chriſtians that beleeue the ſame ſcriptures and beleefes that he doth: he may not forbeare, vntill the deciſion of a councell in conſideration of the Princes of his bloud, who offer thereby to bee inſtructed and taught in conſideration of ſo many thouſandes of ſoules that haue tryed both fire and ſworde, and that ſo manie yeares: not for the obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſome, I wot not what gaine, but for the redeeming of a totall loſſe: neither for the ſauing of ſome corner of an eſtate farre off, but for the warranting of al his owne realme from vtter and ineuitable ruine: yea, to be briefe, euen all that he is and all that he hath? And while wee diſpute and play the Sophiſters about the difference betweene a knights fee and a ſimple tenure, or betweene the ſuburbes, the citie, and the ſhire towne: wee perceiue not, like doltes as we are, that al retayneth into one, by the confuſion of the nobilitie fallen into villenage, the townes and ſuburbes into heapes of deſtruction, and this eſtate, if wee prouide not betimes, into peeces?</p>
            <p>Let vs not flatter our ſelues in the ſtate of our <hi>France,</hi> wee I ſay, who doo peraduenture corrupt our ſelues in her and with her can not well perceiue her diminution to be ſuch as it is, ſo as if we had taken a nappe of fiue and twentie yeares
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23265:14"/>
long, at our waking wee ſhould knowe neither her nor our ſelues. The manners diſſolued and neere to a Gangrene: the lawes no leſſe venall than the offices: the conſciences more than the benefites: the riches which aforetime haue beene a good ſtate of the bodie brought into a ſmall number, and that by bad wayes, tumours properly againſt nature and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie plagues to the bodie. The forces a token of weakeneſſe: our fathers regimentes thirtie yeares ago ſtronger than our armies: and their companies then our regiments: their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines more preſumpteous at their firſt iſſue out of their pageſhip then their fathers after three battailes: moreouer no reſpect either to labour, either to deſert, or to yeares, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to degrees of either honour or nature: no more reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the name of God, loue to the Prince or dutie to the countrie. Theſe are now the diſeaſes ſufficiently diſcerned in our eſtate, but who is he that careth for it? So farre is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one from ſetting to his hande earneſtly, but euerie mans delight is priuately to diſcourſe that the ſtate is ſicke, that it falleth into decay, that he muſt looke to his affaires, euerie man I ſay with his handes in his boſome ſtandeth gaſing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhipwrecke, giueth ouer his worke, looketh to caſt aſide ſome coffer or table for himſelfe, and thence thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hereditarie gouernments, one of a caſtle, an other of a towne, an other of a whole prouince. The ſmall waſters do march vnder the great, and the great for the atteyning to their purpoſe doe league themſelues vnder one head. O mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable eſtate! O miſerable king, when his owne either citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens or ſubiectes in lieu of dying for him, will abandon! O miſerable both citizens and ſubiects that build your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vpon their deſtruction: a deſtruction vndoubted (and who can warrant you from it) that will oppreſſe you all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Weene not that euer you, who vppon a rage rather then by diſcourſe, doo wiſh for it, ſhall euer bee able to haue anie ioy of it, The vapours of your ambition doo ingender thoſe dreames in you: kingdomes and mightie eſtates according to the proportion of their greatneſſe, haue alſo their periods long, whereto mans age cannot reach: Their criſes or iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not gathered vpon odde daies as ours are, for their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23265:14"/>
ſharpeſt diſeaſes doo outlaſt our whole dayes. After the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions haue giuen them ouer they burie them, yea before themſelues doo, they burie thoſe that are the cauſers of their death with all their ambition, vanitie and glorie. <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Ceſar</hi> are downe, but the ſenate was at iarre long time after, and the common wealth which they had wounded did ſtill pant. Theſe changes are whole worlds. The fathers do die by the way: The ſonnes after infinite calamities ſtaie at the borders, yea the childrens children: when they weene to haue woone all, they are readie to be beaten from all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prouerbe: To be at reſt you thinke peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that the vtter extinguiſhing of our race may breed your peace, and yet doo not marke that the eldeſt of them is yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then you, and when you ſhall be ſtroken in age they ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be yong. Or I pray you doo you thinke your ſelues onelie in this realme ambitious? Is there euer a gentleman in <hi>France</hi> but when you haue brought the crowne to ſpoile, will not thinke to haue as good right to it as you? hauing broken the lawes, as you goe about to doo the <hi>Salicke</hi> lawe, doo you not call in all the neighbours to eare <hi>France</hi> in peeces? euen thoſe that firſt married the kings daughters, who will bee more freſh, mightie and rich then you to defend their titles? At whoſe hands when you haue done your beſt, and indured much miſchiefe both you and your ſhalbe made bondmen, yea you ſhall become their mocking ſtocks, praie and ſpoile, and no man to mooue you. Howe many domages muſt this eſtate encurre during theſe alterations? how manie good families deſtroied, how manie good townes laid waſt? howe manie widowes and orphanes? how much land be vntilled? &amp; how many poore houſeholds muſt die for hunger? <hi>France</hi> through theſe long robberies will growe to a foreſt: The <hi>Gothes</hi> wil deuour the remainder of the <hi>Hunnes</hi>: and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> of the <hi>Gothes.</hi> Vpon this miſerable carreine will all the beaſts of the earth feed: A thouſand wormes, and a thouſand ſerpents ſhall breed therein, and there ingender to gnaw it: pettie tyrants in a countrey, in a caſtle and in a towne. To be briefe in lieu of a ſcorpion, a Baſiliſque: and for an adder, a viper. But I feare, I preach theſes curſes to the deafe. The childes mother, when <hi>Salomon</hi> commanded it to be deuided,

choſe rather to loſe it, yea to let her aduerſarie haue it, then to ſee it cut in ſunder: her blood was troubled as alſo were her bowels: the other reſpected not the diuiding of it: ſhee thought ſhee had enough if ſhee might haue her ſhare, albeit bloodie and vnprofitable: ſo ſenſible are the naturall and liuelie affections, whereas contrariwiſe the ſtrangers are dead vnſenſible and obſcure: yea ſo difficult is it for the French bloud to conceale her natural affection to <hi>France</hi> and for the ſtranger to borow, counterfeit or falſifie the ſame.</p>
            <p>Theſe miſchiefes which the courſe of theſe warres do bring in are euident, neither was there euer other end ſeene: miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, which if they be not ſpeedily preuented will growe mortall and incurable: miſchiefes which can not bee reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died but by peace, by a ſincere and faithfull peace, which hide not an other warre in her boſome, and is free from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoughtes, ſuch a peace as may grant hart burnings time to quaile, and duetie and amitie to recouer, which alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all hope and appetite from our perturbers to ſtirre, as not able to infring it without looſing themſelues. Such a one will it bee when the good frenchmen ſhall relie themſelues and one beare out an other, when they ſhall either grant or ſuffer to each other what ſo euer ſhall be requiſite to mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reſt, but why ſhould they denie this one to an other, ſith they all ſhoote at one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon marke of their ſaluation in the life to come? yea euerie of them for that hauing a common intereſt to liue or periſh together. Such ſhall it be when eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ſhall in this realme be accounted as he is: the king obeyed, the princes cheriſhed and honored, the houſeholde loued, the ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers in their places gratified, euery one paying &amp; receuing both what he oweth &amp; what is due to him, &amp; that he alſo think it reaſonable to preſerue thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god himſelf hath preferred by blood, by degree or by dignitie. God who in his councell hath fore iudged all this proces: God who doth al his works in order, and miniſtreth al his iudgements without paſsion, bring this to paſſe. Such, to be briefe ſhal it be when euerie man both for making and preſeruing therof, ſhall bring whatſoeuer he is or hath. The prince his faith, the magiſtrates their autoritie, &amp; the ſubiects each in his calling, their due obedience. God by his holy ſpirit grant vnto the

king (for it is he onely that holdeth it in his hande) that hee may ſhortly finde both the meanes and way. God grant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (for him muſt we winne with heartie deſire and humilitie) that the people may become eaſie and pliable to ſollicite the ſame with heartie deſire and burning zeale.</p>
            <p>God likewiſe grant all and euerie of vs well to remember all the miſchiefes that we haue indured, that wee may haue ſuch a feeling as may neuer decay, to the end wee may deteſt all ciuill miſeries, and no leſſe abhorre the authors then the effects.</p>
            <p>That alſo we may ſhortly in peace with one heart and mind in the vocation whereto God hath called vs, ſeeke the good and perfite health of this realme, the puritie and ſinceritie of Gods ſeruice, and redreſſe of good manners and health ſome lawes, the perfite bonds of the king to the people and the ſuperiours to the inferiours, whereof doo depend the weale, peace and proſperitie of the king, ſubiects and ſtate. Amen.</p>
