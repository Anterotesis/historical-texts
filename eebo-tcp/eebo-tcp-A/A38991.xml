            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>His Excellency hath also sent to the Lord of Stamford the like Message, desiring him to be in a readinesse, and to have a diligent care that the Kings Party do not enter into those parts, or in that County; because it is reported and given out, that the Lord Digby is comming that way, and is resolved to give him a charge about the City of <hi>Hereford.</hi>

            <p>UPon Monday last his Excellency advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from Windsor, where hee tooke his leave of these worthy Peers, Namely, the Earl of Northumberland, the Earl of Holland, the Earl of Pembroke, the Lord Wharton, and the Lord Sey, who went to take their leaves of his Excellencie, before hee set forward his Iourney.</p>
            <p>Upon Monday towards Evening he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took his Forces, where they marched most part of that night, because his Excellencies Desire was to be as neer the Kings Army as he could
<pb facs="tcp:62107:4"/>
for fear the Kings Army should get ground of him and his Army, and the more because hee would execute the desires of both Houses of Parliament, and the Citysens of this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable City.</p>
            <p>Upon Tuesday his Excellencie marched to Stoken-Church, where he found some oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, there being about three thousand Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leers billeted near to the said Town, but after one hours fight the Kings Army retreated, and his Excellencies Forces pursued them as farre as Aston in Oxfordshire, killing about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them, with the losse of eight men, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother or two wounned.</p>
            <p>Upon Wednesday his Excellency marched to Tedstot ten miles on this side Oxford, and hath strongly intrenched himself there, making many Breast-Works and Half-Moons, and hath also sent Colonell Goodwyn with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Foote and five Troopes of Horse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Abington, where they now lye with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danted valour and courage, although the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be within one mile of them.</p>
            <p>Colonell Sir Iohn Meldrum, and Colonel Langham with their two Regiments of Blew are also got beyond Oxford, and have taken up their Quarters neer to Woodstocke, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout sixe miles from Oxford, having also seven Troopes of horse, and nine pieces of Ordnance, and about four small Drakes, the enemy being near unto them.</p>
