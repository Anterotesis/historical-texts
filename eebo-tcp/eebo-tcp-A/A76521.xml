            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Souldery having ſince the beginning of theſe late unnanatural Wars (being ſoothed up by long expected Liberty) hazarded their Blood and ſucceeding Fortunes for promoting of Equity and Juſtice; and having from time to time evidenced their unalterable Affections to theſe primitive Principles, <note n="*" place="margin">Dem. turned ſtateſman,</note> though by an unworthy matchivilian Pen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are termed a changing and mutable Crew, ready to embrace all Governments; and that their miſcarriages are no ways pardonable. Give us but leave in the plain language of Souldiers to publiſh our Vindication to the known and unbiaſſed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe Nations, to whom we are willing to ſubmit our Caſe, leſt we be judged raſh in rendring thoſe that are really culpable guilty without reaſon, and fools if we conceal what may conduce to a general good.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of theſe inteſtine and clandeſtine broyles, mens minds and conſciences were ſo much abuſed for want of Liberty, that the godly of theſe Nations were enforced to engage in an unanimous way, to petition firſt the Almighty for thoſe endeared promiſes of Soul-comforts; and thereafter the lawful Power by him eſtabliſhed; but ſeeing it pleaſed God either for the puniſhment of the then power, their paſſing by the faults of Great Ones and men in Authority, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the poor needy Subject, or the Nations in general for their murmurings and back ſlidings, we dare not judge: But thus it fell out, that the late King and Parliament did ſo far diſagree, that Armies were raiſed on both ſides; the King to defend his Power and Laws by him eſtabliſhed; the Parliament to remove the iniquities then uſed by the Clergy, and ſupercilious carriages of many high minded, and Biſhop-oppreſſors, who to the diſgrace both of their Church, King and Country; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed not only the wealth of the Land, but carried themſelves above the gravity and dignity of their Functions; as alſo the removal of bad Councel from him, who were known ſome of them, to be the moſt blaſpeming and unworthy Atheiſts ever God (whoſe name ſhould and muſt be glorified by all men) ſuffered to live under Heaven. Albeit, on the other hand (though Jeſuitical and Helliſh Pamphlels renders us incapable of charity) we do really expreſs the integrity of our Soules, that we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend there were as good, ſober, religious and pious men with him, as ever ſhall ſucceed them, of the undoubtedly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Britain.</hi> But he being obſtinate and unwilling to curb thoſe inſolencies which introduced theſe untimely inſurrections againſt him and his poſterity; until he found his own time, was ſo far from yeilding to the reaſonable deſires of the godly at that time (whoſe integrities were as candid to the welfare of theſe now diſtracted and impoveriſhed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to the ſalvations of their own ſouls) that he gave way both to forraign and domeſtick Intereſts to blow the bellow and to enflame all. But the Wars being bloody, inhumane, and barbarous in many reſpects, ſeeing Country men murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another, nay more, the Father Warr'd againſt the Son, and the Son againſt the Father, yea, and Brother againſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. After the loſs of ſo many thouſands of innocents, ſome Matchivilians muſt ſtill (to promote their helliſh ends) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the King one while from his condeſcendency to the Parliaments juſt demands; and the Parliaments in another way to hear his reaſons to the contrary: But thus Heaven frowning at the unworthineſs of ſuch juggling brings things ſo to paſs, that he is overthrown, and we become Maſters of the field: all which hazardous and hard encounters the poor Souldiery were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced cheerfully to undergo; and did with loyal hearts and hands endure. Then was it our expectation to ſee Liberty flouriſh, and all corrupt Judicatories removed; but on the contrary, we now ſee (as we are fellow ſufferers) our poor Countries to be more cheated than before, and we ſlighted in the higheſt nature; nor dare we ſollicit the Supream Court of Juſtice to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them of the tyrannies committed againſt us and theſe Nations from time to time, becauſe of ſelf-ſeeking-men ſet over us, who by our means were raiſed from the meaneſt Mechanicks to Lord-like Inheritances.</p>
            <p>Nay, this is not enough, but when we offer in the leaſt to commiſerate our conditions, or make known our Caſes to our Maſters the Parliament, for whom we have expended our lives and fortunes, we are enjailed, beaten, and abuſed by our Officers, in a moſt barbarous manner. All which we truſt the Almighty will conſider, and impower us to redreſs both the injuries of you the good people of theſe Nations, and our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Thus have we lived to aboliſh the tyrannies and oppreſſions of paſt times, but never expected to have erected and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed worſe, as their Succeſſors, whoſe maskt deſigns and ſpecious pretences, are not only made known to the meaneſt of the Nation, but will appear more palpable every day. Now we beſeech the Lord of life to pardon both your and our ſins, and to enable us more and more to make diſcoveries of ſuch Apoſtates, ſeeing Religion conſiſts more in the Practique, than in the Theorick.</p>
