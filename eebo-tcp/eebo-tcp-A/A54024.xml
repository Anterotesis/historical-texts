         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>THere was a glorious day, and bright appearance of truth in the
times of the Apoſtles. They had the true Comforter, who led
them into all truth, and kept them alive in truly, and truth alive in them.
By this Spirit they, as living ſtones, were built up a ſpirituall houſe,
founded upon <hi>Sion</hi> the holy mount, into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the holy City,
which is the church of the living God, the pillar and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound of truth.
And here they had their converſation in heaven, with God the Judge of
all, with Chriſt the Mediatour, and with the Spirits of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſt men and the
holy Angels, which alwayes behold the face of God. They lived in the
Spirit, they walked in the Spirit, they prayed in the Spirit, they ſung in
the Spirit, they worſhipped in the Spirit, and in that underſtanding
which the truth had made free, and had God dwelling with them, and
Chriſt walking in the midſt of them; and by the preſence and power
of his life in them; were truly dead unto ſin, and alive unto God, they
being not ſtrivers againſt ſin with mans legall ſpirit, but by the power
of grace, which made them more then conquerours through him that
loved them. This was part of the glory of that ſtate, in that day of the
Sunſhine of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But behold, a thick night of darkneſſe overſpread the beauty of this?
Some falſe brethren went out from the true Church into the world, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Sheeps cloathing, making a great outward appearance, and
drew the world after them, yea and ſome from the very Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
(how hard was the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſain to plead with the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
about his own Apoſtleſhip and Doctrine that he might preſerve
that Church from the falſe Apoſtles!) And when they had gathered a
ſufficient party in the world, they made head againſt the true ſheep &amp;
lambs of Chriſt, fought with them, and overcame, them. And when
they had overcome them that had the living teſtimony of Jeſus, and the
true power and preſence of the Spirit among them, they ſet up their
own dead form making a cry all over the nations of the earth, <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ceaſed,</hi> there is no looking now for ſuch an infallible ſpirit, and
ſuch immediate teachings as the chriſtians had in the Apoſtles dayes, who
had the anointing to teach them all things: but they point men to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
to the church, as they call it (which title the whore hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed
ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles) or to ſearchings of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and reading expoſitions upon it, and bodies of divinity, formed
by the underſtanding part in man to inſtruct the underſtading part.
Thus the whole courſe of religion and of the knowledge of God, came
<pb facs="tcp:109701:3"/>
to be out of that Spirit and life wherein it firſt came forth (and wherein
it firſt ſtood) and conſiſted in doctrines of men, and a form of worſhip
and knowledge which the wiſdome of man had framed, in an imitation
of that which formerly ſtood in the life.</p>
            <p>And now men being gone from the life, from the Spirit and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
teachings, into an outward form of knowledge and worſhip of
God in the wrong nature; now Antichriſt is got up, and the Dragon
ſits in the Temple, appearing there as if he were God, giving out laws
and ordinances of worſhip in publique, and putting men upon duties
and exerciſes of devotion in private, and he is obeyed and bowed down
to in the obſervation of theſe; but the true living God is not known;
nor his ſecret ſtill voyce (which calls out of theſe) heard, becauſe of
the great noiſe which the Dragon makes in his Temple (for ſo it is now,
he having gained it, though it was once Gods) about his laws and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of worſhip, which he would have all compelled to, and none
ſuffered to teſtifie againſt them that they are his, and not the Lords.</p>
            <p>Yet it pleaſed the Lord, all the night of this darkneſſe, to raiſe up
ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> witneſſes againſt the Dragon, and all his invented forms of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
though they were ſtill hunted, perſecuted, knocked down, and
their teſtimony cryed out againſt as error, hereſie, ſchiſm and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and the wayes, worſhips and ordinances of the whore the beaſt and
the dragon ſtill cryed up as the truth. Thus the Papiſts, they cryed out
againſt the Proteſtanus as heretiques and ſchiſmatiques, who were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
againſt them; and the Proteſtants, they cryed out againſt the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts,
ſeperatiſts and browniſts, who were witneſſes againſt them;
and every ſect cries out moſt againſt them, who are led further from the
apoſtacy, and raiſed up by the Lord as witneſſes againſt them, againſt
their ſetting down in their forme, and not purſuing the guidance of that
ſpirit, which would lead them quite out of the darkneſſe, and not have
them ſit down by the way.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord God in theſe latter dayes, hath not only raiſed up
witneſſes againſt the Whore, the Dragon, the Beaſt, the falſe Prophets,
with all their inventions which they have ſet up inſtead of the truth:
but hath aſſayed, and begun to deliver his people out of this Egyptian
darkneſſe; and to bring them back to the light of the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
And now great enemies have appeared, the ſons of the night exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
ſtrengthening themſelves to keep out the day light, every one cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his own form, and all joyning hand in hand againſt the power:
yea &amp; that ſpirit, which firſt tempted from God, is exceeding buſie to
cauſe thoſe whom the Spirit the Lord hath been drawing out of the
<pb facs="tcp:109701:3"/>
land of darkneſſe, to make a Captain to return to <hi>Egypt,</hi> or at leaſt to ſit
down in ſome form, or ſome pleaſant notion of things by the way &amp; not
to follow the Lord, through all his intricate leadings in the vaſt howling
Wildernes, til he bring them into the poſſeſſion of the true reſt. What a
work there was to quench that ſpirit w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſtired in the Proteſtants againſt
Popery, &amp; to fix the in Epiſcopacy, &amp; in the uſe of the Common prayer
book? When that was detected &amp; turned from, then Presbittery endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to take its place, &amp; to bring it its directory: but the purſuit of the
Lord was ſo hot againſt that, that it ſtunk preſently, &amp; his mighty hand
would not ſuffer that ſo much as to ariſe Much about the ſame time, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency
and Anabaptiſm appeared and contended; and there was a
more ſimple and honeſt thing ſtirring there, then in the other: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the bleſſing of the Lord (which was not to the form, but to
the life that was ſtirring within) did appear more among them But they,
fixing there, loſt the life and ſimplicity to which the bleſſing was, and
met with the death and the curſe, which is the proper reward of the
form: for any form out of the life, kils the life; and its reward is death
to it ſelfe. The form kils the life, which ſtirred underneath, and made
it appear with ſome freſhneſs; and when the life, from which it had
its ſeeming beauty and luſtre dyes, then it ſoon withers and dyes alſo:
ſo that the living principle being once ſlain, there remains nothing but
the dead ſpirit feeding on the dead form. There was one more pure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
and neerer to the Kingdom then all theſe, which was of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and waiting: but death overcame this alſo, making a form of it,
and ſtealing in ſome obſervations from the letter of the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Kingdom, whereby their eyes were with held from behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingthe
inward principle and ſeed of life within, to look for ſome great
appearance of power without (ſuch as was among the Apoſtles) to ſet
things to rights; and ſo they were held captive by the ſame ſpirit in
their ſeeking and waiting, whereby the others are held in their forms.
Thus have perſons generally miſſed the following of that good Spirit,
which began to lead them out <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the dark Land; and looſing
their guid, have fixed ſomewhere or other by the way, reſting in ſome
form, or in ſome notion or expectation of things (according as in their
wiſdome they have imagined from their skill in the letter) ſhort of the
life it ſelfe. Thus have their carkaſſes fallen in the Wilderneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now this I have to ſay to you all. All you who reſt in any form what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
or reſt in any notion or apprehenſion of things ſhort of the life
it ſelfe, ye had een as good have ſtayed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as to fix by the way,
and to take up a reſt in the Wilderneſſe, ſhort of <hi>Canaan.</hi> In plain terms,
<pb facs="tcp:109701:4"/>
ye had as good have abided in Popery or in Epiſcopacy, ye had been as
acceptable to God there, as here. Not that I ſay your forms of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedency,
Anabaptiſm, or ſeeking, are as bad as Popery, Epiſcopacy, or
Presbittery; nay they are all ſomewhat neerer, and the laſt of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much neerer: but your fixing there, and the dead ſpirit feeding there
on the dead thing, is as remote from life, as if it had gone quite backe
again. And this dead ſpirit is as hatefull to God here, as it is among
the Papiſts, yes and in one ſence more, becauſe it makes a pretence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
them.</p>
            <p>And the truth is, ye have gone back againe, though not in the direct,
form, yet into that very ſpirit, wherein Poperey's ſtrength and kingdom
lies, &amp; ſo are becom one of the beaſts names, &amp; your ſtrength &amp; defence
lies in the beaſts horns, either in the outward powers of the earth, or in
that inward knowledge of things and wiſdome from the letter, which is
out of the life, and ſo are not yet come out of the City <hi>Babilon.</hi> For
mark, The ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it that fixeth in a form ſhort of the life, is the ſame that
whored from the life: and the ſame ſpirit is the whore ſtill, in what form
ſoever ſhe be. The ſpirit that roſe up in the life, againſt the death and
corruption whereof Popery wholly corſiſted, was a good ſpirit, and this
ſpirit would paſſe through all forms, till it meet with the life: it is the
other ſpirit that ſayes to thee, thou hoſt gone far enough, and ſo tempts
to ſtay by the way. And he who hearkens to this ſpirit, and ſtaies any
where by the way, he is caught with the old whore in a new dreſſe, and
is drinking the cup of fornication afreſh. And then like the Papiſts, he
runs to the powers of the earth, to defend his form, againſt the witneſſes
of God (and that's his cover under which he perſecutes, and there he
lyes hid) or at leaſt to his own wiſdom and reaſon, to ſtrengthen himſelf
with arguments for fixing here, and againſt going any further. And
then he grows wiſe in the fleſh, and cryes out againſt them, who are ſtil
led by the ſame ſpirit to preſſe on further, as weak, ſilly, giddy, Unſetled,
ſeduced people, that can never know when they are well. Thus the wiſe
Epiſcopalians revlied the ſimple-he-arted non-conformiſts, who purſued
further then they: and the non conformiſts, when they loſt their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and begun to ſtick, reviled thoſe that purſued beyond them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
thus at this day, thoſe who are preſſing on in the ſpirit, are diſdained by
thoſe who have took up their ſtation in the fleſh, and with their two
great horns, of earthly power and earthly wiſdome, are they puſhing
at them.</p>
            <p>Look about you, look about you, all ſorts of devout profeſſors, ſee
where ye are: are you not dead in your forms? is not the good old
<pb facs="tcp:109701:4"/>
puritan principle (wherein once was true life in its meaſure) dead and
buried there? Conſider with your ſelves, hath that grown in your

which is neereſt to it, and not that which is neereſt to truth. And this is
the great error of this age, men with a gathered knowledge from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-words,
without the true faith and life, go about to meaſure that
life and knowledge which comes from the faith: and becauſe it ſuites
not with the apprehenſions which they have taken into their minds, they
condemn it. And thus being in the ſtumbling wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hearken therefore to my exhortation, as ye love your ſouls, Come
out of popery indeed and in truth, come out of the ſpirit of popery;
burn the whore in her new forms, as well as in her old: Caſt off all
theſe new names of the Beaſt, under which the old ſpirit has made a
prey of the life in your own particulars, and lies lurking to make a prey
of the life in others, and to force it into its own deceitfull forms of death,
and ſlay it. Leave defending your faith and church by the Beaſts horns,
and come to that faith and church which is received, gathered, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

by Chriſt the one horn of ſalvation. Leave your reaſonings and
diſputings in that wiſdome which has ſlain the life, and come to that
wiſdome which comes from the life, and ſprings up in the life; and ye
will find more certainty and ſatisfaction in one touch of true life, then in
all the reaſonings and diſputes of wiſe men to the worlds end. The
ground wherein mens religion grows (even of the moſt zealous) is bad,
even the ſame ground wherein the <hi>Phariſees</hi> religion ſtood and grew;
and it hath brought forth ſuch kind of fruit, namely, ſuch a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the letter, as theirs was, which ſtands in the underſtanding
and will of man, rearing up a pleaſant building there, but keeps from the
life, and from building in it. But the true religion ſtands in receiving a
principle of life, which by its growth forms a veſſell for it ſelfe ſ and all
the former part, wherein ſin on the one hand, or ſelfe righteouſneſſe on
the other hand ſtood and grew, paſſeth away.</p>
            <p>Theſe things following ſtrike at the King of <hi>Babilon</hi> himſelfe, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

that can mild y receive the ſtroake of, may feel the true Spirit of life
(which lies ſlain underneath) ſpring up in him, and give life to his ſoul;
which, when it is delivered, will be able truly to know and rejoyce in
the Lord its Saviour. And when the root of that ſpirit is cut downe

            <head>A
Diſtinction between the faith
which is of man, and the faith which is of
GOD: One whereof is the Faith of Sion, the
other the Faith of Babilon; the one laying hold
on Chriſt, as he is revealed the King of life in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the other layes hold on an Hiſtoricall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt, the fame whereof hath ſounded
in Babilon.</head>
            <p>THere is a faith which is of a mans ſelfe, and a faith
which is the gift of God; or a power of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
which is found in the nature of fallen man,
and a power of believing which is given from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.
As there are two births, the firſt and the
ſecond; ſo they have each their faith, and each
beleeve with their faith, and ſeem to lay h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld on the ſame thing
for life; and the contention about the inheritance will not be
ended, till God determine it. <hi>Cain</hi> will ſacrifice with
his faith,
and he beleeves he ſhall be accepted: if he had not beleeved ſo,
he would not have been ſo angry when he found it otherwiſe.
And the <hi>Cainiſh</hi> ſpirit in man, the vagabond from the life of God,
which hath not an habitation in God, nor the eternall life of God
abiding in him, he is buſie with the ſame faith at this day, and
hath the ſame expectation from it, as <hi>Cain</hi> had.</p>
            <p>This is the root of the falſe religion, of the falſe hope, of the
falſe peace, of the falſe joy, of the falſe reſt, of the falſe comfort,
of the falſe aſſurance, as the other is the root of the true. In this
faith which is of man, and in the improvement of it ſtands all the
knowledge, zeal, devotion, and worſhip of the world in generall,
and of the worldly part in every man in particular: but the true
knowledge, the true zeale, the true devotion, the true worſhip
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109701:6"/>
ſtands in the faith which is given of God, to them which are born
of the immortall ſeed, which li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es in God, and in which God
lives for ever.</p>
            <p>Now it deeply concerns every man to conſider, from which of
theſe his knowledg, religion, and worſhip proceed, and in which
of them they ſtand: for if they proceed from, and ſtand in the faith
which is of man, they cannot pleaſe God, nor conduce to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the ſoule; but though they may taſt very pleaſantly to
mans pallate now, and adminiſter much hope, and ſatisfaction to
him at preſent, yet they will faile at the time of need: For as
Chriſt ſaid concerning the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,
ſo may I ſay concerning this faith: <hi>Except your faith, with
the works of it, exceed that faith and all the works of it</hi> (even to the
utmoſt improvement thereof) <hi>which is to be found in mans nature,
it will never lead you to the kingdom of God, nor be able to give you
any right to the inheritance of life;</hi> For he that will inherit, muſt be
the right heir, muſt have the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the faith of <hi>Iſaac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
which ſprings up from the root of life in the ſeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this leads
the ſeed into that ſpring of life (out of which it ſhot forth as a
branch) which is the inheritance promiſed to the ſeed. And here
is Chriſt, <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> in every particular ſoul, where life is
begun and perfected, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unning its courſe through time, back to
that which was before the beginning.</p>
            <p>Therefore obſerve and conſider well, what this faith which is
of a mans ſelfe can doe, and how far it may goe in the changing of
man, and in producing a conformity of him to the letter of the
Scriptures. And then conſider where it is ſhut out, what it cannot
do, what change it cannot make, what it cannot conform to, that
ſo the true diſtinction may be let into the mind, and not a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
layed of ſo great a miſtake in a matter of ſo great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>1. A man may beleeve the hiſtory of the Scriptures, yea, and
all the doctrines of them (ſo far as he can reach them with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding)
with this faith which is of man. As by this faith a
man can believe an hiſtory probably related to him; ſo by this
faith may he beleeve the hiſtoryes of the Scriptures, which are
more then probably related. As by this faith a man can receive
doctrines of inſtruction out of Philoſophers books, ſo by the ſame
faith he may receive doctrins of inſtruction out of the Scriptures.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109701:6"/>
Reading a relation of the fall of man, of the recovery by Chriſt,
that there is no other way to life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This faith can beleeve the
relation of theſe things, as well as it can beleeve the relation
of other things.</p>
            <p>2. This being believed from the relation of the hiſtory of theſe
things, this naturally ſets all the powers of man on work (kindling
the underſtanding will and affections) towards the avoiding of
miſery, and the attaining of happineſſe. What would not a man
doe, to avoid perpetuall extremity of miſery on ſoul and body for
ever, and to obtain a crowne of everlaſting bleſſedneſſe? This
boils the affections to an height, and ſets the underſtanding on
work to the utmoſt, to gather all the rules of Scripture, and to
practiſe all the duties and ordinances therein mentioned? What
can the Scripture propoſe to be believed, that he will not believe?
What can it propoſe to be done, that he will not do? Muſt he
pray? he will pray. Muſt be heat? he will hear. Muſt he read?
he will read. Muſt he meditate? he will meditate. Muſt he deny
himſelfe and all his own righteouſneſſe, and duties, and hope on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for ſalvation in the merits of Chriſt? he will ſeeme to do that
to, and ſay, when he has done all he can, he is but an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
ſervant. Does the Scripture ſay he can doe nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Spirit? he will acknowledge that too, and he hopes he
has the Spirit; God hath promiſed the Spirit to them that aske
it: and he has asked long, and asks ſtill, and therefore he hopes
he has it. Thus man by a naturall faith grows up, and ſpreads in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great tree, and is very confident, and much pleaſed, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the defect in his root, and what all his growth here will
come to.</p>
            <p>3. This being done with much ſeriouſnes and induſtry, there
muſt needs follow a great change in man: his underſtanding will
be more and more enlightened, his will more and more conformed
to that, to which he thus gives himſelfe up, and to which he thus
bends himſelfe with all his ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his affections more and more
warmed, he will find a kind of life, and growth in this according
to its kind. Let a mans heart be in any kind of ſtudy or knowledg,
applying himſelfe ſtrictly to it, he gathers underſtanding in his
mind, and warmth in his affections: ſo it is alſo here. Yea this
being more excellent in it ſelfe, muſt needs produce a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
underſtanding, and a more excellent warmth, and have a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109701:7"/>
greater power and influence upon the will.</p>
            <p>4. Now how eaſie is it for a man to miſtake here, and call this
the truth? Firſt, he miſtakes this for the true faith, and then he
miſtakes in applying to this all that which belongs to the true
faith: and thus entring into the ſpirit of error at firſt, he errs in the
whole courſe of his religion, from the beginning to the end. He
ſees a change made by this in him, and this he accounts the true
converſion and regeneration. This leads him to ask and ſeek and
pray, and this he counts the true praying, the true ſeeking, the
true asking. This cleanſeth (after its kind) his underſtanding, will,
and affections, and this he takes for the true ſanctification. The
juſtification which is to the true beleever, he alſo aplyes to this
faith: &amp; ſo he has a peace, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſatisfaction, a reſt here, and an hope of
happineſſe hereafter. Thus he receives what is already revealed,
&amp; he waits for what may be further revealed, which he can em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
and conform to, turning ſtill upon this center, and growing
up from this root. And he that does not come hither in religion,
falls ſhort of the improvement of mans nature and of the faith
that grows there, (which naturally leads all the powers of nature
hither, and fixes them here) which is but dead. And now this man
is ſafe, he is a beleever, he is a worſhipper of God, he is a Chriſtian,
he is an obſerver of the commands of Chriſt: when the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
ſcourge comes, it ſhall not touch him: all the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
plagues, threatnings in the Scripture belong not to him, but
to the unbelievers, to them that know not God, to them that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
not God, to them that obſerve not the commands of Chriſt:
thus by his untempered morter, from his falſe faith; he has built
up a wall againſt the deluge of wrath, which wall will tumble
down upon him when the wrath comes. The growth of this faith,
and great ſpreading of it into all this knowledg, zeal, and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath not changed the nature of it all this while, but it is the
ſame that it was at the beginning, even a power of nature in the
firſt birth, and all theſe fruits are but the fruits of the firſt nature,
which is ſtill alive under all this. All this can never kill the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
out of which it grows, but feeds it more and fattens it for
the ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>Thus far this faith can go: But then there is ſomewhat it is ſhut
out of at the very firſt. There is ſomewhat this faith cannot
receive, beleeve, or enter into. What is that? It is the life, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109701:7"/>
power, the inward part of this. Though it may ſeem to have unity
with all the Scriptures in the letter, yet it cannot have unity with
one Scripture in the life: for its nature is ſhut out of the nature of
the things there witneſſed. As for inſtance, it may have a litterall
knowledge of Chriſt, according as the Scripture relates: of his
birth, preaching, miracles, death, reſurrection, aſcention, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, but the thing ſpoken of, it knoweth not. The
nature of Chriſt (which is the Chriſt) is hid from that eye. So it
may have a litterall knowledg of the blood of Chriſt, and of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
but the life of the blood which livingly juſtifieth, that
birth cannot feele; but can only talk of it, according to the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it reads in the Scripture. So it may have a litterall knowledge
of ſanctification, but the thing that ſanctifieth, it cannot receive
into it ſelfe. So for redemption, peace, joy, hope, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may
get into the outward part of all theſe, but the inward part, the life,
the ſpirit of them, it is ſhut out of, and cannot touch or come neer,
nor can it witneſſe that change, which is felt and knowne here.
And here is the great contention in the world, between theſe two
births, the one contending for their knowledge in the letter, and
the other contending for their knowledge in the life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up their faith from the naturall part, calling it ſpirituall, and
the other who have felt the ſtroake of God upon this (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
come to know the difference) ſetting up the faith of the true
heir, which faith hath a different beginning, and a different growth
from the other, and will be welcomed into the Land and Kingdom
of life, when the other will be manifeſted to be but the birth of
the bondwoman, and be thruſt forth with its mother to ſeek their
bread abroad: for the ſeed of the bondwoman is not to inherit
with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the ſeed of promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What then is that faith which is the gift of God, and
which is diſtinct from this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is that power of beleeving which ſprings out of the
ſeed of eternall life, and leavens the heart, not with notions of
knowledge, but with the powers of life. The other faith is drawn
out of mans nature, by conſiderations which affect the naturall
part, and is kept alive by naturall exerciſes of reading, hearing,
praying, ſtudying, meditating in that part; but this ſprings out
of a ſeed of life given, and grows up in the life of that ſeed, and
feeds on nothing but the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, in which is the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109701:8"/>
living vertue, and immortall nouriſhment of that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.
This faith at its firſt entrance, ſtrikes that part dead in
which the other faith did grow: and by its growth perfects that
death, and raiſeth up a life which is of another nature, then ever
entred into the heart of man to conceive. And by the death of
this part in us, we come to know and enjoy life: and by the life
we have received, know, and enjoy, we come to ſee that which
other men call life (and which we our ſelves were apt to call life
formerly) to be but death. And from this true knowledg, we give
a true teſtimony to the world of what we have ſeen and felt, but
no man receiveth our teſtimony. It grieves us to the heart, to ſee
men ſet up a periſhing thing as the way to life, and our bowells
are exceedingly kindled, when we behold an honeſt zeal and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
betrayed, and in tender love do we warn men of the pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>,

               </gap> bitter enemies
becauſe we tell them the truth, and the moſt neceſſary truth for
them to know; which they can bear neither in plain words, nor yet
in parables. Yet be not rough and angry, but meekly wait to read
this following parable aright, and it will open into life. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
is briefly this.</p>
            <p>That which ſold the birth-right, ſeeks the birth right, with tears
and great pains, but ſhall never recover it: but there is one which
lies dead (which hath the promiſe) which ſtirs not, which ſeeks
not, till he is raiſed by the power of the fathers life, and then he
wreſtles with the father, prevails, and gets the bleſſing from him.
Therefore know that part which is up firſt, and is ſo buſie in the
willing and in the running, and makes ſuch a noiſe about duties,
and ordinances, and graces, to keep down the life which it hath
ſlain: and know that ſeed of life which is the heir, which lyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
all this, and muſt remain ſlain, while this lives; but if ever
ye hear the voice of the Son of God, this will live, and the other
dye. And happy for ever will he be, who knows this! but miſery
will be his portion, who cannot witneſſe a thorow change by the
Almighty power of the living God, but hath only painted the old
nature and Sepulcher, but never knew the old bottle broken, and
a new one formed, which alone is able to receive and retain the
new wine of the Kingdom, whereas the other (Phariſee like) can
only receive a relation of the letter concerning the Kingdom.</p>

<hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. Therefore they that never yet heard the immediate
voice of Chriſt, are ſtill dead in their ſins, and have not yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the true living knowledge, but a dead litterall knowledge,
which gives a falſe ſhining of things in the dead part, but kills the
life. Indeed the proper uſe of all means, is to bring to the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
voice, life, and power; and till this be done, till the ſoule
come to that, to hear that, to feele that, to be rooted there, there
is nothing done that will ſtand, but men ſtick by the way, crying
up the means the means, and never knowing, taſting, or enjoying
the thing which the means point to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he that knows God, comes
into the immediate preſence; and he that dayly lives in God,
lives in the immediate life; and the true faith leads to this, giving
the ſoul ſuch a touch and taſt of it at firſt, as makes it unſatisfiable
without it. By this Chriſt cuts off the <hi>Jewes</hi> with all their zeale
and knowledge, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 37, 38. <hi>Ye have not heard his voyce at any
time, nor ſeen his ſhape<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ye have not his word abiding in you.</hi>
Theres the hearing of the voyce, the ſight of the ſhape, and the
having of the word of God abiding in the heart, which gives both
the hearing of the voyce, and the ſight of the ſhape, and keeps the
ſoule quick and living in the life. The voyce gives life, the ſight of
the ſhape daily conforms into the image, which is beheld by the
eye of life, and the word abiding in the heart nouriſhes, and feeds
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109701:9"/>
the living ſoul with the pure bread of life. But the <hi>Jews</hi> knew not
this, but were crying up their Sabbaths, the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the
ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Temple of God, the inſtituted worſhip
of God, and ſo were ſhut out of the thing it ſelfe, (which thoſe
things ended in) and out of a capacity of receiving it. And thus
many zealous ones at this day, not having come to this, no more
then the <hi>Jews</hi> did, but ſticking in the letter of the Goſpel, as the
<hi>Jews</hi> did in the letter of the Law, ſtumble at the preſent diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

gift,</hi> and is not that power of beleeving which is to be found in
mans nature, but of another nature, even of the nature of the giver.
And when man is called to beleeve, he is not called to put forth
that faith wherewith he beleeveth other things, but to receive
and exerciſe the gift of faith which is from above. That
which is to be believed in, is ſpirituall: and that muſt be ſpirituall
which believes in it. Man, with all the powers of his nature, is
ſhut out: it is another thing, diſtinct from man, which is let into
life, and which lets man in. For man receiving the faith, entering
into the faith, and becoming new-formed in the faith, then he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
may enter: but till then he is ſhut out, and knoweth not the
life, let him beleeve, and read, and pray, and hear, and exerciſe
himſelf in that which he cals duties and ordinances never ſo much:
for all theſe, ſet up in the wrong part in man, they onely feed the
wrong part; and that withall its food and nouriſhment, falls ſhort

that power, which ſlayes mans naturall ability and propenſity to
beleeve, that ſo the gift of the true faith may be received: for
there is no riſing up and living of the ſecond, without the death

                  <hi>That by this faith alone which is the gift, which is from above,</hi>
(and not that faith which grows either in the wilderneſs or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the old nature, and is fed by the oldneſs of the letter, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109701:10"/>
not by the newneſſe of the Spirit) <hi>is Chriſt received.</hi> For Chriſt
can be received, by the faith alone that comes from him: and
that faith which comes from him, cannot but receive him. Mans
faith refuſeth him: it receiveth a litterall knowledge of him from
what it heareth from men, or from what it readeth related in the Scripture concerning him, but refuſeth the nature of the thing:
and it cannot be otherwiſe; for mans faith not being of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it, cannot but refuſe it. But this faith, which is given of
God, which is from above, being of the ſame life and nature with
Chriſt, cannot refuſe the ſpring of its own life, but receiveth him
immediately. There is no diſtance of time, but ſo ſoon as faith is
received, Chriſt is received, and the ſoul united to him in the faith.
As unbeliefe immediately ſhuts him out, ſo faith lets him in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
and centers the ſoul in him: and the immortall ſoule
feeles the immortall vertue, and rejoyces in the proper ſpring of
its own immortall nature. But the faith of man never reaches this,
never receives Chriſt, but only a relation of things concerning him:
and with that faith which ſtands in the letter, oppoſes that faith
which ſtands in the life. And here's the ſpirit of Antichriſt, here's
the miſtery of iniquity working out of one forme into another:
for Antichriſt does not directly deny Chriſt, or deny the letter, but
cryes up Chriſt, cryes up the letter, cryes up ordinances, but ſo as
they may feed the faith of his own nature, and maintain an hope
there. And thus the ſpirit of man is at unity with what will feed
his own, with what interpretations his own underſtanding can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of the Scriptures. And thus can he cry up Chriſt, and ſay
he hopes to be ſaved by him, while the ſpirit of enmity againſt the
nature of Chriſt lodgeth in his heart. This is Antichriſt, where
ever he is found, and this is his faith, and great is his knowledg, and
many are his coverings; but the Lord is ſearching him out, who
will ſtrip him, and make his nakedneſſe appear.</p>

                  <hi>That Chriſt is received as a grain of muſtard ſeed.</hi> Chriſt is ſuch
a thing, as every eye, but the eye of this faith deſpiſeth. He is the
ſtone, which the wiſdome of the builders in all ages hath rejected.
They look for a glorious Meſſiah, but they know him not in his
humiliation in the little ſeed, out of which he is to grow up into
his glory: and ſo they miſſing of the thing, build up only with high
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109701:11"/>
imaginations in the airy mind concerning the thing. As when
God ſent Chriſt in the fleſh, there was no form nor beauty in him;
The <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe hope and expectation lay there, yet ſaw no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of comelineſſe, no deſireableneſſe in him: Even ſo is it now;
When God comes to offer him to thoſe, that think they place all
their hopes in him, they ſee no lovelineſſe in him, but refuſe him
daily. What this little thing, ſmall like a grain of muſtard-ſeed,
can this be the glorious Chriſt, which the Scriptures have ſpoke
ſo much of? why we know the deſcent of this (its father mother
and kindred are with us) we find this in our own nature. Thus,
like the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, they make a great noiſe about Chriſt, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
the thing it ſelfe. And this is for want of the true eye of faith,
for if they had that eye, they would ſee the vertue in the little
ſeed, and receive him in his humiliation in their hearts, where he
knocks daily for entrance, and be content to wait till this grain of
muſtard-ſeed grow up into a great and glorious tree. But for want
of this eye, they keep him out, and let in the painted murtherer,
who dwells in them, and covers himſelfe, with a knowledg, a zeal,
a faith, an hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the old nature, in the old veſſel, in the
old underſtanding: &amp; thus they give God and Chriſt good words,
while the evill ſpirit has their hearts, and dwells there, bringing
forth his own old evill fruit under an appearance of devotion and
holineſſe. Hear now, ye wiſe in the letter, but ſtrangers to the
life; There is a twofold appearance of Chriſt in the heart. There
is an appearance of him as a ſervant to obey the law, to fulfill the
will of the Father in that body, which the father prepares there
for him: and there is an appearance of him in glory, to reign in
the life and power of the Father. And he that knows not the
firſt of theſe in his heart, ſhall never know the ſecond there. And
he that knows not theſe inwardly, ſhall never know any outward
viſible coming to their comfort. For if Chriſt ſhould come out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
to reign (as many expect) yet to be ſure he would not
reign in thee, whoſe heart he hath not firſt entred into and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
to himſelf, which is only to be done by his appearance there
firſt as a ſervant, and then as a King. But what eſtate are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
(ſo called) now in, who know not him in them who is able to
ſerve the Lord, but are ſtriving and fighting in that nature where
ſin hath the power, and which can never overcome, being not in
union with, but ſtrangers to that life and power which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109701:11"/>
Therefore let all conſider in the depth of their heart,
for this is infallibly true: They that never received the ſeed of
life in their hearts, never received Chriſt; and ſuch ſhall never
and ſuch ſhall never be free from ſin while they live (for having
not received the ſon, who makes free, how can they be free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed?
nor be free from wrath when they are dead: For that
faith concerning Chriſt will not ſave them hereafter, which did
not bring them to receive Chriſt here.</p>

ſpirit which tempts to ſtick by the way, and to rear up buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
and forms of knowledge from the letter of the Scriptures,
and not to come to feel after, unity with, and live in Chriſt the

the thing it ſelfe, ye are at a diſtance from that to which all

forth in this age, at which all that ſtick in the letter cannot but
ſtumble; and there is no poſſibillity of knowing or receiving it,

and ordinances, proper to that ſtate wherein they were, and to
that thing to which the miniſtry was: But all this was to be done
away, and to end in that which all this repreſented. So that to
Chriſtians, Chriſt the ſubſtance being come, which is the end of all
theſe ſhadows, the true <hi>Jew</hi> being raiſed in the immediate life, now
there is a neceſſity of the immediate life for the rule. To them
under the Goſpel, to them who are come to the ſubſtance, to them
who are begotten and born in the life, there can be norule propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to their ſtate, but Chriſt the ſubſtance, Chriſt the life, here
he alone is the light, the way, the truth, the rule, the Spirit is here
the rule, the new creature the rule, the new covenant the rule, all
which are in unity together, and he that hath one of them, hath
them all, and he that hath not them all, hath none of them. So that
directions taken out of the Scripture, cannot be the rule to him
who is the true Chriſtian, but the meaſure of grace, the meaſure of
light, the meaſure of the Spirit, the meaſure of the gift received
into the living ſoule from the ſpring of life, this is the alone rule
of life. But Chriſtians in the degeneration have loſt this, and ſo
have taken up words for a rule, (which were not given to that
end) and ſo with deductions by the earthly part, they feed the
earthly part. What is fed by mens Scripture knowledge, but the
earthly underſtanding? the earthly will heated, the earthly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
warmed; and of the fruits of this earth they bring ſacrifices

doth not open to thee, and ſo art found adding and diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p>Now he that is adder, he that is the diminiſher, he cryeth
out againſt the Spirit of the Lord, and chargeth him with adding
and diminiſhing: for man being judge, he will judge his own
way to be true, and Gods to be falſe. That which is the adding
and diminiſhing, he calls the true expounding of the place: but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109701:14"/>
if the Spirit of the Lord immediately open any thing to any ſon
or daughter, he cries this is an adding to the word: The Scripture
is written, there are no more revelations to be expected now, the
curſe ſaith he, is to them that adde. Thus he removes the curſe
from his own Spirit, and way of ſtudy and invention to which it
appertains, and caſts it upon the Spirit of the Lord. And man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly avoid this in the way that he is in: for having firſt
judged his own darkneſſe to be light, then in the next place he
muſt needs judge the true light to be darkneſſe. He that hath
aforehand ſet up his own invented meaning of any Scripture to be
the true meaning he muſt needs oppoſe the true meaning, and call
it falſe, and ſo apply himſelfe to forme all the arguments he can
out of other Scriptures, to make it appear falſe. Thus man, having
begun wrong in his knowledge of the Scriptures, ſtands engaged
to make uſe of them againſt the Lord, and againſt his own ſoul;
and yet really in himſelf thinks that he makes a right uſe of them,
and that he ſerves the Lord, and that he is not oppoſing his truth,
but oppoſing error and hereſie; while he himſelfe is in the error,
and in the hereſie, and againſt the truth, being a ſtranger to that
Spirit, in whoſe immediate life and preſence the truth grows.</p>
            <p>Did the Lord in theſe words, of forbidding to adde or diminiſh
upon ſo great a penalty, lay a reſtraint and limit upon his owne
ſpirit, that it ſhould no more hereafter ſpeak in his ſons &amp; daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or did he intend to lay bounds upon the unruly ſpirit of man?
Did God leave mans ſpirit at liberty to invent and form meanings
of his words, and bind up his owne ſpirit from ſpeaking further
words afterwards? When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, thou ſhalt not adde nor
diminiſh, was this to be any ſtop to the Prophets, in whom God
ſhould ſpeake afterwards? Is not this one of the ſubtle Serpents
inventions, to keep up the eſteem of mans invented meanings as
the true ſence, and to make a fortification againſt the entrance of
that ſpirit, which can diſcover all his falſe interpretations of the
true words of God, and to make him ſee that he is the adder and
the diminiſher, and that his name will not be found in the book
of life, when the true light is held forth to read by.</p>
            <p>But this is generall, extending to all Scriptures, my drift is more
particular concerning adding to the things, or diminiſhing from
the words of the book of this prophecy.</p>
            <p>There are two things chiefely ſpoken of in this book, Miſtery-<hi>Sion,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:109701:14"/>
Miſtery-<hi>Babilon:</hi> the true Church, the falſe Church: the
Lambs wiſe, the whore: the hiding of Miſtery-<hi>Sion,</hi> the appearing
of Miſtery-<hi>Babilon</hi> in her place: the flying of the Church out of
her heaven into the wilderneſs, leaving all behind her which ſhe
could not carry along with her, even all the ordinances and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of Chriſt, wherein once ſhe appeared worſhipping and
ſerving God; and the ſtarting of the falſe Church into her place;
taking up all that ſhe had left, even all the ordinances and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Chriſt in the letter, thus covering her ſelfe with the form
of godlineſſe, with the ſheeps cloathing, that ſhe might paſſe the
better for the true Church: And the Dragon, who mannaged the
war againſt the woman and her ſeed, raiſeth up firſt one beaſt, and
then another, and ſets this whore on the top of them, who with
the cup of fornication makes all the earth drunk, all nations, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
kindreds, tongues, languages. And the beaſt he has his horns
every where, his marks every where, his names every where, and
alſo his image in every part of <hi>Babilon.</hi> And who will not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him, he fights with; yea ſuch as are led by God to rent from
the whore, he calls ſchiſmaticks, hereticks, blaſphemers, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes
them as perſons not worthy to live. Thus the ſtate of things
is quite changed, the power of truth loſt, the form ſet up without
it; thoſe that ſeek after the power hated, perſecuted and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
thoſe that lye ſtill under any of the beaſts forms, they go
for good Chriſtians; for members of the viſible Church, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
called by them.</p>
            <p>Now mark: He that calls any thing the Church, but what this
book calls the Church, he adds: he that doth not know the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
and own the Church in the wilderneſſe, he diminiſhes:
The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the Church in the wilderneſſe, the
Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is not the Church is the wilderneſſe, the
Church of <hi>England</hi> is not the Church in the wilderneſſe, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
gathered Churches are none of them the Church in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs:
all theſe have ſprung up ſince the Churches flight, and
have appeared in her ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it to themſelves, but God (who gave it to the Church) hath not
given it them; and ſo they muſt looſe it again, when God brings
back the Church out of the wilderneſſe. So he that calls thoſe,
which formerly w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re the inſtitutions and ordinances of Chriſt,
which the woman left behinde her, and which the harlot hath
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109701:15"/>
got and attired her ſelf with, which ſhe now appears in, and
wherewith the Dragon is now worſhipped, he adds to this book,
which ſayes the outward court was given to the Gentiles, and the
true Church had nothing left her but the inward temple, wherein
alone the true worſhippers worſhipped: and they that worſhip
elſewhere, are the falſ worſhippers worſhipping in falſe Temples,
in Temples of the whoriſh ſpirits building take it either outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or inwardly, for it holds true in both: He that makes the beaſts
names fewer then they are, or his marks fewer then they are, or
his hornes fewer then they are, or his image leſſe then it is, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes.
And the danger hereof is not ſmall. <hi>For if any man
worſhip the beaſt and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead,
or in his hand, the ſame ſhall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God,
which is powred out without mixture into the cup of his indignation,
and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of
the holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb: and the ſmoak of
their torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever. And they have no reſt
day nor night, who worſhip the beaſt and his image, and whoſoever
receiveth the mark of his name,</hi> Rev. 14. 9. <hi>c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this I affirm, whoſoever has not the name of <hi>Sion,</hi> the
mark of <hi>Sion,</hi> which he received of her in the wilderneſſe, where
the living God is with her, and where he is taught by God the
laws of the wilderneſſe-worſhip, and in ſome meaſure to teſtifie
againſt all the corrupted ordinances, and inſtitutions which have
the beaſts marks, and go now abroad in the world under the beaſts
name: I ſay, whoever has not the true mark of <hi>Sion,</hi> it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for him to avoid the mark of <hi>Babilon:</hi> and he who avoids not
the mark, cannot eſcape the plagues. But he that hath the mark
of <hi>Sion,</hi> he by a ſecret inward inſtinct of true life, is led from the
marks of <hi>Babilon:</hi> and if he faithfully follow the guidance, from
out of all the names, and from under all the horns.</p>
            <p>It is nor enough to rent from Popery, and ſit down under the
power and government of the ſame ſpirit in another form, or to
rent from Epiſcopacy, and the ſame ſpirit ſit down in Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitery;
or to rent from Presbitery, and the ſame ſpirit ſit down
in a form of Independency, or Anabaptiſme; or to rent from theſe,
and the ſame ſpirit ſit down in a way of ſeeking and waiting, and
reading of words of Scripture, and gathering things from thence
without the life: but the true religion conſiſts in knowing, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109701:15"/>
following a true guide to the Church in the wilderneſſe, and
there to receive the marke, the living marke, which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
out of all inventions, and further progreſſe of the dead
ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Now therefore look about you, know the ſpirit of whoredom,
and ſee how ye have been begotten in the adultery, and born of
the whore, and have ſerved the Dragon, and worſhipped his dead
idols, and not the living God. And be not ſatisfied with changing
of forms &amp; dreſſes) which are but the ſeveral deceitful appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the whore (but put off that ſpirit; leaſt when ye have hated
the whore, and burnt her fleſh as ſhe appeared in one form, ye give
your ſelves up to her again, when ſhe appears in another forme:
for the plagues are not ſo much to the form wherein the whore
appears, as to the whoriſh ſpirit: and whoſoever is found under
her dominion, in any of her territories, under any of her formes,
with that mark of hers upon them which belongs to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

            <p>Therefore tremble all ſorts of people, pluck off your falſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings,
ſee the ſhame of your nakedneſſe, while it may be for
your advantage ſo to doe. The Angel is gone forth, the corn is
reaping and gathering into the garner, many Lambs are brought
into the fold of everlaſting reſt, <hi>Sion</hi> is redeeming, the true life
is riſing, the whoriſh ſpirit is judging, the dore of life is yet open:
doe not lye ſecure in the whores wiſdome! Do not lye ſlumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and reaſoning, and diſputing from the letter of the Scripture,
till the gathering be finiſhed, till the doore be ſhut, till the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how may I avoid adding to the things, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
from the words of this prophecy, and of other Scriptures,
that I may not meet with the weight of this curſe, or miſſe of the
bleſſing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doſt thou ask this queſtion from thy heart, in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
out of the fleſhly wiſdome? then hearken with that ear,
and thou ſhalt ſet thy ſeal to mine anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. Wait for the key of knowledge, which is Gods free gift.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109701:16"/>
Do not go with a falſe key to the Scriptures of truth, for it will
not open them. Man is too haſty to know the meaning of the
Scriptures, and to enter into the things of God, and ſo he climbs
up over the doore with his own underſtanding, but he has not
patience to wait to know the door, and to receive the key which
opens and ſhuts the doore: and by this means he gathers death,
out of words which came from life. And this I dare poſitively
affirme, that all that have gone this way to work, have but a dead
knowledge, and it is death in them that feeds upon this knowledg,
and the life is not raiſed. Conſider now the weight of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill
in the true ballance! There is no opening of the Scriptures, but
by the true key: nor is there any coming at the key, till the Lord
pleaſe to give it. What then is to be done, but only to wait (in
the ſilence of that part which would be forward, and running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand) till the key be given, and to know how to receive it,
as it is offered in the light, and not to wait in the will, or expect to
receive it according to obſervations in the fleſhly wiſdome from
the letter?</p>
            <p>2. Let not thy underſtanding have the mannaging of this key,
when it is given, but know the true opener, the skilfull uſer of the
key, the hand which can only turn the key aright: and let him have
the mannaging both of his own key, and of thine underſtanding.
Do not run in thine own underſtanding, or in thine owne will to
ſearch out the meaning of Scripture: for then thou feedeſt with
the Scripture, that which it is the intent all words of life to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy:
but as thou waiteſt for the key at firſt, ſo continually wait
for the appearances and movings of the uſer of the key, and he wil
ſhut out thy underſtanding and will continually, which would ſtil
be running after the litterall part of Scriptures, and let thee into
the life both of the prophecies and doctrines thereof. Man when
he hath received a true gift from God, he would be mannaging
of it himſelfe, and to be ſure he will mannage it for himſelfe (for
the gratifying and pleaſing of himſelf, and not for God) and then
God, being provoked, takes away the ſubſtance, and leaves him
the ſhell. Therefore he that hath received a gift, muſt be very
watchfull againſt that which would betray, or he may eaſily looſe
it: for though the gifts and caling of God are without repentance,
yet if that lay hold of the gift which was not called, and to which
it was not given, the Lord will thruſt that by, and take away his
gift from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:109701:16"/>
3. Do not graſt any of the fruit of the tree of life upon the tree
of knowledge, for it will not grow there: an appearance, a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the true fruit may grow there, but the true fruit it ſelfe
will not. My meaning is, doe not make a treaſury of knowledge
in the underſtanding part which is to periſh, but know the true
treaſury of all the things of life, which is in the life it ſelfe, and in
that underſtanding which is formed, kept, and lives in the life. Lay
no manna by to feed upon in the old ſtore houſe (leſt the fleſhly
part ſhould be running thither, when its fleſhly appetite is kindled
after food) but daily receive the continuall bread from the hand
of life. The wiſdom of the life ſtrikes at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hy wiſdom and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and if ever thou wilt grow wiſe any more there, thou looſeſt
this, and canſt not poſſibly retaine it: for that part is then getting
up in thee, in which it cannot be held, but only a ſhadow, an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
a reſemblance and likeneſſe of it, which feeds and pleaſes
that part, which fain would have life, but cannot know it, and
therefore is neceſſitated to make images and likeneſſes, of things
in Heaven or things in earth, that it might have ſomewhat.</p>
            <p>4. Take not up a reſt in openings of things, though by the true
key. Take heed of over-valluing that kind of knowledge: for
that part which over-vallues that knowledge, will preſently be
poſt up with it: but there is a more excellent, and ſafer kind of
knowledge to be preſſed after, which is a knowledge of things by
receiving of them. There is a knowledge of things, by the Spirits
opening the words which ſpeake of them (or by inward imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
prophecies from the word of life in the heart:) this is an
excellent knowledge, and not to be found in the earthly part of
man; yet the earthly part (when this knowledge is given) is
very apt to be ſwelled and exalted with it: but then there is
alſo a knowledge, which ariſeth from the gift of the thing it ſelfe.
This knowledge is very precious, and much more full and certain
then the other, having the nature and immediate power of life in
it ſelf, and ſo is perfectly able to preſerve. As for inſtance, to make
it more plaine: There may be a knowledge of Juſtification, by
the Spirits opening the words written in Scripture concerning
juſtification, and the blood of ſprinkling, (and this is a good
knowledge, where there is a true opening of it from the Spirit:)
but then there is a knowledg by feeling of the blood of ſprinkling
in the heart, and by ſeeing with the new eye the way of its juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109701:17"/>
and in this knowledge is the power and the cleanſing of
the life received, which in the other was but ſpoken of. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reſt not in openings, or prophecies, or true meanings of theſe
things (though this kind of knowledge is very excellent, and
hath been very rare) but wait to feele the thing it ſelfe, which
the words ſpeak of, and to be united by the living Spirit to that,
and then thou haſt a knowledge from the nature of the thing it
ſelfe: and this is more deep and inward, then all the knowledge
that can be had from words concerning the thing.</p>
            <p>5. When thou feeleſt things, then ſeek their preſervation in the
proper ſpring of their own life. Let the root bear thee, and all thy
knowledge, with all thats freely given thee of God. When thou
feeleſt thy ſelfe leavened with the life, and become a branch ſhot
out of the life, then learn how to abide in the life, and to keep all
thats given thee there, and have nothing which thou maiſt call
thine own any more, but to be loſt in thy ſelfe, and found in him.
Know the land of the living, wherein all the things of life live, and
can live no where elſe.</p>
            <p>Now in all this, in this whole courſe, from the very firſt ſtep of
it, there's certainty, there's ſtability, there's infallibility. From
the very firſt opening of the true key, I begin to learne ſomwhat
of God, and to learn certainly, and feel an aſſurance and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in it: and growing up here, I grow up in the true learning,
and in the true ſettlement, and ſo I am not unlearned and unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
wreſting the Scriptures to my own deſtruction: for I take
none of the knowledge of the Scriptures from my ſelfe, from my
own underſtanding, from my own ſtudy and invention, or from
the ſtudies of other expoſitors, but from a certain hand. And how
can he reſt Scripture, who is kept ſingle, and has no deſire to have
any thing to be the meaning of it, but what is the meaning, nor no
will to know the meaning, further then the good wil of him whoſe
Spirit penned it, thinks good to give forth the meaning to him;
and who waits to receive this, not to feed the luſtfull knowing pare
in himſelfe, but to feed the life with it? and when the life hath no
uſe for it, he is content to have it ſhut up, and to be without it:
I ſay, how is it poſſible for this man to wreſt Scriptures? But now,
a man that hath taken in a body of knowledge already, he goes to
the Scripture, and bends it to make it ſpeak anſwerable to that:
and where it ſpeaks contrary, he invents a way to make it comply,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109701:17"/>
and ſo wreſts Scriptures forward &amp; backward, to make them ſpeak
agreable to what he has already received and beleeved. Thus
every ſort of perſons, papiſts and proteſtants, bend the Scriptures,
to make them ſpeak conformable to their opinions and practiſes,
not having <hi>the true, learning,</hi> which gives to read them in the true
Originall, where the knowledge of what they ſpeak and meane is
certaine: and ſo they are alſo <hi>unſtable,</hi> and ſubject to be ſhaken
by a wind of reaſon which is ſtronger then their own. And this
wreſting of Scripture is <hi>to their own deſtruction;</hi> for that part,
which is ſo much as deſirous to bend a Scripture, is to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and that part cannot receive the true knowledge, but ſtumbles
in its own wiſdome and way of ſeeking, at the wiſdome of Cod,
and at the true way of finding.</p>
            <p>But the foregoing councill, faithfully hearkened unto, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
out of this, and alſo bring to the true means, and to the true
uſe of the means, which all nations, who have drunk of the whores
cup, have erred concerning, and taken the falſe for the true. The
ſtrength of this wine hath made all nations, peoples, tongues and
languages to miſtake, who in the heat of their drinke have cryed
up the means, the means, the ordinances, the ordinances <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not
perceiving how this heat came from the ſpirits of the whores
wine, and not from the ſober, meek, calm, gentle leadings of the
Spirit of Chriſt, and ſo in a fleſhly zeale have ſet up the whores
means inſtead of the lambs means, and contend for them with the
whores ſpirit and weapons. Now it is impoſſible for any man ſo,
much as to know the true means, till the whores wine be purged
out of him: for that will make him erre in judgment, and take
the falſe for the true. And which way ſhall he ever come to the
Kingdome, which has lighted upon the wrong means? or how
ſhall he ever come to the true means, who never yet ſaw the
witchery of the whoriſh ſpirit from the life, and how he himſelfe
has been bewitcht, and coſened with the falſe inſtead of the true?
as for inſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayer, that is generally taken for a means,</hi> Aske, and it ſhall be
given you; ſeek and ye ſhall find: knock and it ſhall be opened to you.
If Parents, which are evill, know how to give good gifts to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
how much more ſhall the heavenly Father give the holy Spirit
to them that aske him. <hi>This therefore is an undoubted thing, that
prayer is a means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:109701:18"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, there is a prayer which is a means, and there is a
prayer which is not a means. There is a prayer which is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and there is a prayer which is an invention. There is a
prayer which is the breath of the true child, and there is a prayer
which is the breath of the fleſhly part, a breath of the whoriſh
ſpirit. There is a prayer of the firſt birth, and there is a prayer of
the ſecond birth, both which cry and weep to God for the ſame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Now the one of theſe is the true means, the other not: one
of them is Chriſts ordinance, the other is antichriſts ordinance.
Now the queſtion is, which of theſe thy prayer is? whether it be
thine own breath, or Gods breath? whether it come from the
renewings of the Spirit of life, or from thine own naturall part
painted? for accordingly, it is either the true means, or the falſe
means. If it be the true means, it ſhall have the thing, the Spirit,
the life, the kingdome it prayes for: if it be the falſe means, it
can never obtain it. Papiſts, they pray; Proteſtants, they pray;
ſome in forms, ſome without forms; ſome meditating before hand,
ſome not meditating: are all theſe the true means, or are any of
them the true means? The breath of the true child is the only true
prayer; and he prayes only in the moving, and in the leading of
that Spirit that begat him: and this is a prayer according to the
will, in the life, and from the power. But all mens prayers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to times they ſet the themſelves. or according to formings
of deſires in their own minds, which they offer up to God with the
nature and heart that ſinneth againſt him, theſe are falſe means,
and may ſatisfie the drunken ſpirit erred from the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, but are no
means to the truth.</p>
            <p>Canſt thou pray? how cameſt thou to learn to pray? waſt
thou taught from above? or didſt thou gain the skill and abillity,
by the exerciſe and improvement of thine, own naturall part?
Didſt thou begin with ſighs and groans, ſtaying there, till the
ſame ſpirit that taught thee to groan, taught thee alſo to ſpeak?
Waſt thou ever able to diſtinguiſh the ſighs and groans of the
Spirits begetting, from the ſighs and groans of thy own naturall
and affectionate part? and hath that part, with all its ſighing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
groaning, deſires, endeavours, &amp;c been thruſt aſide, and the ſeed
immortall raiſed, by the Spirit of eternall life, which teacheth to
cry and mourn, and at length to ſpeak to the Father for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
and nouriſhment of its life? If it hath been thus with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109701:18"/>
thee, then thou haſt known that prayer which is the true means.
But if otherwiſe, though thou pray never ſo long, and with never
ſo great affections and ſtrong deſires, this is all but the falſ means,
with its falſ warmth from the fall fire, this is but the means which
the whoriſh Spirit (which is not in union with the life and power,
but keeps the ſeed in bandage) has ſet up inſtead of the true means.
And this can never lead to truth, but keeps alive Gods enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

God, but as it is from another ſpirit, ſo it is to another ſpirit.</p>
            <p>O learn to be ſober! come out of this drunken fury, and conſider
things mildly and ſeriouſly. Do not make a great outcry of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
ordinances; the means, the means. This is the voyce of the
clamorous woman, who with her loud noiſe, would fain keep you
from liſtning after the ſtill voyce of true wiſdome, which cannot be
heard in the midſt of this great noiſe and hurry in your ſpirits; but
conſider which are the true ordinances, which are the true means;
which are the likeneſſes man has framed, and which is the true
thing it ſelf. And if ye could once be mild, gentle and calm, &amp; turn
from your own wiſdome and fleſhly knowledge of things it might
pleaſe God to remove your ſtumbling blocks, and to open that
eye in you which can ſee the antichriſtian nature, and diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the coverings, which it hath formed to hide its deceitfull ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
under, and the true garment and cloathing of life. But the ſeed of
the Kingdome is little, and ye are great, how can ye enter into it?
the pearl lies hid in the field, and ye are gazing up to Heaven how
can ye ſee it? Chriſt is deſcended into the lower parts of the earth,
and ye are uſing means to aſcend upwards in the wrong nature,
how can ye meet with him? the Goſpel hath been hid, the Sun
hath not ſhined, it hath been night, and ye have got many falſ can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles;
which way can ye acknowledge the little glimmering of the
day ſtar, who have ſuch ſatisfaction in the warmth of your falſe
fires? ye are far from the true light, who have not yet received ſo
much of it, as to diſcover the darkneſſe of the night! Ye are too
high, too wiſe, too knowing for Chriſt, or for the ſight and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of the true means which lead to life. And if ye
could once come to ſee this, there might be ſome hope but in that
wiſdome wherein your life and knowledge ſtands, ye are ſhut out:
and ye are reaſoning and ſtumbling at the ſtone, while others (who
are broken in ſpirit, and in meekneſſe and humility led to try) find
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109701:19"/>
it a ſure foundation, even a foundation of eternall life for the true
ſeed of life, and are built into the living City, which is made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hands, and without any of the tools of mans wiſdome.</p>

            <head>A
Brief Hiſtory of the ſtate of the Church ſince
the dayes of the Apoſtles, with the living ſeal to
it, which he that hath eternall life abiding, in
him, can read and witnes; but that wiſdom zeal
and devotion which is in the death, cannot.</head>
            <p>AFter the univerſal degeneration and corruption of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi>
ſtate, and the putting an end to the ſhadows thereof, by
the appearance and ſucceſſion of the ſubſtance, it pleaſed God to
diſſolve that people, ſtate and pollicy, and by the power of his
life (without either the wiſdome or ſtrength of man) to ſet upon
the heatheniſh world, which he ſubdued and brought under the
power of his life. By his Apoſtles and meſſengers, who preached
the everlaſting Goſpel, the word of eternall life, he gathered aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
up and down the nations, whom the nations by all their
perſecutions could not ſubject; but they reigned over them in the
power, authority, and dominion of God: For they were Kings
and Prieſts to God in the ſight of all the Nations, and they did
reign upon the earth; in ſomuch as the heatheniſh ſpirit of man,
obſerving their order in the Spirit, and the wiſdom and power of
the Spirit among them, who by his living light was able to ſearch
the hearts of thoſe that came to obſerve them, could not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that God was in them of a truth.</p>
            <p>Now the next thing to be expected, is Satans oppoſition againſt
this power of life, &amp; his ſtratagems to undermine it. He withſtood
the growth and ſettlement of the Church, all that he could by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
force, making uſe both of the heatheniſh devout worſhippers,
who fought for their <hi>Jupiter,</hi> their <hi>Diana,</hi> and other gods and
goddeſſes, and of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> devout worſhippers, who fought for
their Temple-worſhip, with the Laws and ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
which were now expired. But neither of theſe would doe, but the
Church in the power of life gained ground upon him, and did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thrive and increaſe, then diminiſh by this oppoſition. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109701:19"/>
now he falls to this ſtratagems, he gets ſome falſe brethren out
of the Church (<hi>they went out from us</hi>) theſe he cloaths as Angels of
light, puts the ſheeps cloathing on their wolviſh nature, makes
them appear as like the Apoſtles as may be, endues them with an
excellent taking knowledge of life and ſpirituallity in appearance,
forms in them an image of the truth, and inſpires this image with
the ſpirit of his own life, and with theſe he goes forth into the
world, and gathers the world about him. Now the world was
preſently taken with this <hi>(the world went after him)</hi> for this is that
the world would have, an appearance of religion, an image of
truth, but their own ſpirit in it. The worldly ſpirit, that flies off
from the life, from the power, can readily cloſe with this, becauſe
it is its own. Bring forth never ſo high notions of religion and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
wiſdome, the world will hug them, the world will feed on
them, the world will cloath it ſelfe with them. The world can
ſwallow, and digeſt any thing but life. Any pleaſant picture of
things in heaven will down with the world: but the nature, the
life, the truth, the Spirit, Chriſt in his true arid living croſſe, this
will not down with the world.</p>
            <p>Now the Devil having thus ſet up his falſe image in the world,
and gathered a party after him, then he ſets upon the Church:
and the battel goeth very hard, life ſtriving to defend, and death
to overcome, How hard did the Apoſtles ſtrive in their day, to
keep their converts to the ſimplicity of truth, &amp; to the way ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
(which even then began to be evill ſpoken of) writing Epiſtles
to the Churches, warning them of the falſe Apoſtles, and wiſhing
them to ſtand their ground! yea Chriſt himſelfe writes ſeverall
Epiſtles from heaven to ſome of them, cheking their backſlidings
and encouraging them to renew their zeal and ſtrength, putting
them in mind of the Crown which attended the victory. But at
length the Divill with his ſtratagems prevails, gets the poſſeſſion
of the Churches territories, and the Church is faine to fly for her
preſervation: and ſuch of her ſeed as are left behind her, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
makes war againſt, ſlayes, drinks their bloud.</p>
            <p>Now here's an end of all the glory of that ſtate: now the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
hath gained the world again: The ſame ſpirit, that loſt it under
the heatheniſh power (for there he was conquered) recovers it
under an Antichriſtian appearance; ſetting up the ſame wickednes,
and the ſame courſe and current of death under forms of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109701:20"/>
religion, as he had done before under forms of Heatheniſh
devotion.</p>
            <p>Thus the Devil being conquerour, having gained the field, he
divides the ſpoils among his army: he tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s whatever was the
Churches, and make, his own, and ranks them in his way of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
religion and devotion: ſo that now hence forward, thoſe
things which were once Chriſts and the Churches, they are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
all his, and diſtributed by him among his followers. He gives the
name Church to the whore which he ſets up, he gives the name
Chriſtian to his Diſciples, he preſcribes baptiſme, and the Supper
(which he calls Sacraments) and praying, and preaching, and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which he calls publique ordinances, and be preſcribes private
duties and exerciſes of devotion; and he gets the letter of the
Scriptures, and forms multitudes of meanings and expoſitions, and
has lying ſigns and wonders for ſuch as need them, that he might
keep all the ſeverall Brigades of his army quiet under his pay, and
might have ſome pleaſing wares of traffick for every ſort of his
Merchants in his <hi>Babilon.</hi> For this is the City of that King which
he built aſter his conqueſt over the life, and which he hath enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ſpoils from the life. And here all his ſubjects ſhall
have content, they ſhall have what they will, if they will but be
faithſull to him in the main. Call for what likeneſſe, what inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what appearance of truth they will, they ſhall have it, ſo
they will but be content without life. No notion about the Spirit
wil be deny them, ſo they will be content with the notion without
the preſence of the living Spirit. They ſhall have light in their
underſtandings, warmth in their affections, joy, peace, hope, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
out of the Scriptures. They ſhall apply as many promiſes
to themſelves as they will, have what they will, do what they will,
ſo they keep out of the feeling of the living principle: but if once
that ſtir, and there be any hearkning after that, then he begins to
ſhew his tyranny on the one hand to force them back, and his
ſtratagems on the other hand to tempt them aſide from it.</p>
            <p>The devil having thus gained the form, and enriched himſelf with
the Churches ſpoils, and ſlain them which had the living teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
then he falls to corrupting the form: For that filthy ſpirit,
though he can cloath himſelf with the form to deceive from the
life, &amp; abid there, to keep down the life; yet he does not much love
it, he loves his own form better: and when he is out of feare of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109701:20"/>
aſſaults from the life, then he returns to his own form againe, or
patches up a garment more ſuitable to his own nature, taking i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ſomewhat of the other with it, to make his own paſſe the better
(for if he ſhould have returned to the direct heatheniſh forms of
idolatry and falſe worſhip he could not ſo well have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ayn hid:
therefore he makes a mix u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of ſomewhat which was preſcribed
the <hi>Jews,</hi> with ſome things ſound practiſed among the Chriſtians.)
Thus he brought in inventions of croſſes, and images, and beads,
and pictures, and reliques, and ceremonies beyond number, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as not only the life and power was loſt, but the true likeneſs
alſo, even ſo loſt, that it is impoſſible for all the wiſdome of man,
to recover the knowledge of the likeneſſe againe. Men have ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
much, but they never could form a true likeneſſe of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church, and the way thereof.</p>
            <p>Now, though it is the deſire of the Devill to keep men in the
groſsneſſe of darkneſs, yet rather then looſe them, he will let them
have ſome part of the form again: nay he will tempt them with a
gaudy appearance of the form, to keep them from meeting with
the power and life, when he perceives true ſecret inward ſtirrings
in them, which will not be quieted without ſomwhat. Thus, when
there was a ſtirring againſt Popery, he tempted a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e into Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy:
when that would hold no longer, then to Presbitery:
when that will not ſerve, into Independancy: when that will not
keep quiet, but ſtill there are ſearchings further, into Anabaptiſm:
if that will not doe, into a way of ſeeking and waiting: if this will
not ſatisfie, they ſhall have high notions, yea moſt pleaſant noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning the Spirit, and concerning the life, if they will be
but ſatisfied without the life: yea they ſhall have all the liberty in
the creatures they can deſire (the beſt painted liberty) if they will
but be ſatisfied without that liberty, which ſtands not in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
out of the life, but over the creatures in the life. And he that
turns aſide to any of theſe, he is ſtill under the dominion of that
ſpirit, and there he holds his knowledge, and there he performes
his worſhip, and there he has his unity, his liberty, his life, his reſt,
his peace, his joy, his hope. Now no man can worſhip God, till
he comes out of every part of this <hi>Babilon,</hi> and his feet touch <hi>Sion,</hi>
though there may be a ſecret panting, and an unknown ſafety, and
an acceptation of the poor mourning ſoul in the paſſage Yea, all
ſorts of people, here ye were accepted, in your ſtirrings after life,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109701:21"/>
in hearkning to the leadings of life from out of the Babiloniſh
Spirit: but your turning aſide to the Babiloniſh wiſdome in a new
dreſſe, and ſitting down in a new form of her inventing, hath
brought you to a loſſe of life, and hath made you hatefull to the
living God, who hath drawn his ſword againſt you, and hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
his vialls, his thunders, his plagues, his woes: and ye muſt
drink of his cup with ſorrow, as ye have drunk of the whores cup
with pleaſure. Ye that have found a bed of pleaſure in any of your
forms, or in any of your notions, and ſo have found eaſe in the
<hi>Sion</hi> of the whores painting; ye muſt be caſt into the bed of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and know the fire the Gods <hi>Sion,</hi> and the furnace in his <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
if ever ye become an habitation for God, or expect to feed
on his holy mountaine.</p>
            <p>The condition of the Church all this while (all this time of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
reigne in forms of knowledg and worſhip) hath been very
lamentable, and is expreſſed in Scripture by parables and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
of a ſad ſtate. She hath been as a City pulled down, like
a ruined City, which needs rebuilding, before ſhe can come to be
a City again, (<hi>when the Lord ſhall build up Sion.</hi>) She hath been
like a wilderneſſe, barren, undreſſed, unregarded. She hath been
like a mournfull widow, whoſe husband hath been rent from her,
and her children ſlain. She hath loſt all her ornaments, all her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
all her ordinances, all her appearances and wayes of life,
in ſomuch as <hi>the wayes of Sion mourn.</hi> But <hi>Babilon,</hi> the mother
of harlots, ſhe has got all the beauty, all the glory, all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
attire, all the Churches ordinances, and all the trade and traſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
runs thither, and ſhe is cryed up for the true Church; and if
any dare ſpeak a word againſt her, &amp; for the true Church indeed,
they are exclaimed againſt for ſchiſmaticks, and hereticks, and war
prepared againſt them, and ſome or other of the beaſts horns pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
puſhing at them. Thus it has gone all the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy,
the whore has flouriſhed with the name of the Church ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
great merchandize of ſouls, ſelling their formall ſtuff for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and abundance of children hath the whore brought forth, and
nouriſhed with her milk of deceit: but the true woman, the Lambs
wife with her ſeed, and the living food from her living breaſts, have
had no place on the earth.</p>
            <p>But this ſtate of things is ended in part, and ending apace. The
Lord God of life is ariſen out of his holy habitation to aſſault the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109701:21"/>
Dragon, to diſcover and ſtrip the whore, to recover a poſſeſſion
for his life in the earth, to make roome in the world for
his Church, which he is bringing out of the wilderneſſe. The bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
is begun, the territories of Antichriſt are aſſaulted, the Lamb
hath appeared on his white horſe, and hath gathered many of his
called, faithfull and choſen about him, the Enſign is li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted up:
the light (which ſearcheth the inwards of the enemies dominions)
hath appeared, and his inmoſt power and wiſdome is not feared,
but the Lord God is feared, and the Dragons arm withers, and the
head of his pollicy (whereby he enſnared &amp; intangled from the
life) is cruſhing, glory to the endleſſe power of life for ever and
for ever.</p>
            <p>Be wiſe now therefore, &amp; looſe not your ſhare in the immortal
Crown. Take heed how ye be found fighters againſt the Lamb, in
the wiſdom &amp; power of <hi>Babilon</hi> which is to fall, Painting will not
paſſe now: That bloud of the Lamb is felt, which waſhes off the
whores paint, even all her painted notions of the blood of chriſt,
&amp; of ſanctification and redemption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the whoriſh nature being
diſcovered underneath all theſe. Ye have got the name of Church,
the name of Chriſtians, the name of ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the whores
help, but the nature of life ye want: and the living power is come
to recover the name from you, and we, his living witneſſes, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
to your faces, that ye ſhall not enjoy it, but the name and the
thing ſhall go together; and he that hath not the thing, ſhall
alſo looſe the name. Yea, your eyes ſhall ſee that ye have been
the ſacrilegious ones, who have ſtoln holy names and tirles, which
ye never received from the hand of God; but the whoriſh ſpirit
(which out of the life, and an enemy to the life) hath handed
them to you. And this is told you in dear and tender love, that
ye might not periſh, but have eternall life abiding in your hearts,
and the new name written by the Spirit of life on your foreheads,
which all that know the writing of the life, may be able to read
and acknowledge.</p>
            <p>There are ſeverall touches of theſe things, in diverſe of of the
Epiſtles of the Apoſtles: but the full relation is given forth in that
book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which was penned by the Spirit of God,
to be read in the light of the Spirit, and ſo to be a preſervative
againſt the overſpreading contagion of Antichriſtianiſm. Adn it
is ſaid, at the entrance into it, <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth, &amp; they that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109701:22"/>

                  </gap>p thoſe things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are written
therein.</hi> But men having loſt the Spirit, have not been able to read
it, and having loſt the right ear, they have not been able to heare
the words it ſpeaks: and how then could they keepe the things
written therein? He that doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ot underſtand what he is warned
againſt, how is it likely he ſhould be preſerved by the warning?
The Spirit of God judged this warning neceſſary but the ſpirit of
deceit cryes it is a deep thing, not to be medled with. Now this
is a plain demonſtration, that men generally are overtaken with
the whoredom, and drink of the whores cup, &amp; ſubmit themſelves
to the beaſt, and exalt his horns, and receive his mark, and ſome
or other of his names; becauſe they have not the knowledge of
that which diſcovers theſe things, and was given by the Spirit of
God to forewarn, and ſo to preſerve out of them. He that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the miſtery of iniquity working under a form of godlines,
may not he eaſily be deceived with the miſtery of iniquity? He
that knoweth not what is become of the true Church &amp; miniſtry,
and where to look for them, may not he eaſily own a fall Church
and miniſtry? He that knoweth not the Spirit of the Scriptures,
which the Church carried with her, when ſhe left the letter behind
her, may not he eaſily ſet up the letter for his rule? He that
knoweth not the living mark and name of a Chriſtian, with which
the Spirit of life ſeals all the Lambs, of Chriſt in the life, may not
he eaſily give this name to himſelf, and to others who have not
this mark, but the beaſts mark? He that knoweth not the true
faith, the true love, the true hope, the true joy, the true peace, the
true reſt, the true conſolation in Chriſt the life (the true meeknes
and patience of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or likneſſes of theſe (which he gathers from the letter of the
Scriptures, and the promiſes thereof, receiving the knowledge of
them into the wrong part, &amp; applying them to the wrong thing)
inſtead of theſe? Ah poor hearts! The book of the Revelation is
eaſie to that Spirit that wrote it: and it was not given forth to be
laid by as uſeleſſe; but to be ſerviceable in the hand of the Spirit,
for the ages after the dayes of the Apoſtles; and in the true light
it is eaſily read: and they that can read it, can ſee that in it, which
they that cannot read it, cannot beleeve. And this is plainly ſeen,
That the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e is but the Spirit of truth, and the Spirit of deceit: but
the Lambs wife, and the whore (which hath whored from the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109701:22"/>
Spirit, which hath made uſe of the lotter, to run a whoring from
that Spirit that wrote it:) that there is but the true Church, and
the falſe Church: but life, and death: but form, and power: but
Chriſt the miſtery of godlineſſe, and Antichriſt the miſtary of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:
but God, and the dragon: God in the Church or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the Wilderneſſe, and the dragon in the worlds, churches and
temples, appearing there as if he were God, giving ſorth lawes
and ordinances like God: and all the world falls down before
him, and worſhips him as if he were God; and hopes by this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
which they perform to him, and by their faith and hope
which they receive from him, to be ſaved at laſt. I ſay there are
but theſe two: and he that is joyned to the one of theſe, is not
joyned to the other. Let him that readeth, underſtand: which
he may eaſily doe by the wiſdome of the Spirit, but never can by
the wiſdome of the letter. For though we know how to join theſe
two in the life, yet there is a neceſſity of ſeperating them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,

(if it be poſſible) to tempt the ſimple ſoul, and keep it ſatisfied
therewith, in ſome of his chambers of darkneſſe and imagery, out
of the life and power.</p>
            <p>Therefore now be warned and look about you, and be not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened
with any of the wares of <hi>Babilon,</hi> where the marchandize
and traffique is for ſouls, and where all the wares of deceit are,
which are proper to coſen ſouls: but ſeeke for the nature of that
thing, which the inward pantings of your heart at any time have
been after; and waif for the opening of that eye, which can ſee,
through all manner of paint, to that nature: and keep low in the
life, ſimple and honeſt-hearted, and then gawdy appearances will
not take with you; for they are only temptations to the aſpiring
part, which is lifted up above the pure, low, humble principle:
and if that part were brought down, ye would be ſafe: but while
that ſtands, ye will not be out of the danger of temptations. Now
this know:</p>
            <p>There is nothing whereof <hi>Sion</hi> is built, but the likeneſſe of it is
in <hi>Babilon:</hi> and the likeneſſe is very taking, even more taking to
that eye which is open in men, then the truth it ſelfe. The truth
is a plain ſimple thing, it is not gawdy in appearance, its excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
lies in its nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the appearances of truth which Satan
paints, are very gawdy, very glorious, ſeemingly very ſpirituall,
very pure, very precious, very ſweet; they, many times, even ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109701:23"/>
that underſtainding and thoſe affections, that are out of the
life, Oh what ſhall I ſay! ſhall I ſpeake a little of the wares of
<hi>Babilon?</hi> where is there an ear which can hear me? yet he that
opens my mouth, can open thine ear. Therefore ſet me ſpeak a
little plainly.</p>
            <p>1. There are many glorious falſ births in <hi>Babilon.</hi> There is no
inheriting the Kingdome, but by being born againe. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
the king of <hi>Babilon</hi> preacheth: he is ſain to do ſo, elſe the
letter of the Scripture would overthrow his kingdome. Now
therefore to keep from the true new birth, he hath his images of
the new birth, his ſeverall falſe births. A great while outward
baptiſme, and a formall knowledge was enough to make a man a
chriſtian: but now ſince that is diſcovered, and will not do, he
brings forth better births; he hath inward changes of the minde
(multitudes of them) fit for every one who is ſeeking after the
life, to be tempted from the life with: and he tempts every one
with a proper bait, with that which is taking to him in his preſent
eſtate. What changes any kind of knowledge by vertue of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(with the devills quickning power added to it) can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in any man, the Devill can transform man into. Yea many
are theſe changes: and he that doth not know the nature of the
true birth, may eaſily be deceived with that which is juſt like the
thing he looks for. A man looks for a new birth, for an inward
change: he looks for a knowledge to change him: he ſhall have
juſt the very likeneſſe of that which his heart deſires, the lively
likeneſe, the devill is ready at hand to furniſh him with it:
which way can the man, who never ſaw the true thing, eſpy the
cheat?</p>
            <p>2. There are many glorious deſires in <hi>Babilon,</hi> many pantings,
many breathings after that which this birth of <hi>Babilon</hi> takes to be
life. The devil hath theſe wares, theſe images in his ſhop too.
As he hath a falſe birth in imitation of the true, ſo he hath falſe
breathings for his falſe birth. If his child could not ſeemingly
breath towards God (as if he were a naturall child of God)
he would ſoon be detected: therefore he inflames him with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of growth, with deſires of enjoyment of that which he calls
life, with ſeeming deſires of ſerving and glorifying God: and
here come in the prayers of the fleſhly birth, which are many
times carryed on with exceeding great earneſtneſſe of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

part to which alſo the father of this birth given anſwers. And
now which way can deceit be ſo much as ſuſpected here? And
yet here alſo the deceiver lodgeth, and herein he worketh, raiſing
ſtrong deſires in that part wherein he dwels, that he may alla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
thoſe pure deſires, which otherwiſe would be ariſing from the
life underneath, and which (notwithſtanding all this) ſometimes
doe ariſe, eſpecially when the ſoul is in anguiſh.</p>
            <p>3. There's falſe food in <hi>Babilon,</hi> falſe knowledge to feed this
wrong nature with. There's <hi>knowledge falſely ſo called.</hi> There's
ſeverall appearances of all the truths in <hi>Sion.</hi> There's outward
knowledge of the letter, and there's inward miſticall knowledges
and each of theſe have their warmth, and their freſhneſſe, and do
nouriſh up this child, and cauſe it to grow. Yea what knowledge
and experience; (which at firſt ſprang from the true life) this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
makes a prey of, and daily brings into his <hi>Babilon,</hi> therewith
to feed and fatten that which is born of him, and to cover the old
deceitfull nature under, which is not ſlain thereby, but daily lives
and moves and puts forth it ſelfe: this is certainly felt by that,
which is made ſenſible in the life, but hard to be ſpoken, becauſe
the deceived heart is ſo groſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ear ſo heavy Now here the
painted whore, which hath dealt treacherouſly with the life, fits
as a Queen, and ſaves, ſhe ſhall ſee no ſorrow: This knowledge is
certain to her, theſe experiences, ſhe hath had the feeling of, and
knows they can never be ſhaken. But O thou Princeſſe of <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
the Lord will ſtrip the, the Lord will unbare thy inwards, &amp;
thine own eyes ſhall ſee they nakedneſſe, which ſhall be for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
reproach among all the inhabitants of <hi>Sion:</hi> and then thy
dark deceitfull ſpirit, ſhall have no more to ſay againſt thoſe,
who now ſee through thy covering to thy nature, in the light;
and judge thee (not of themſelves, nor in their own wills and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings)
but from the true power, and in the true guidance
of the life, whoſe work it is to purſue, overtake and judge dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h
even to death. For all this knowledge, and all theſe experiences
in thee (though thou ſeeſt it not, nor canſt ſee it with that eye
wherewith thou lookeſt to ſee) are held captive by that which
tranſgreſſed and hath erred from the life, and are made uſe of to
keep thy ſoul in bands: and as they are thus held, death and the
curſe muſt overtake them, or that life in thee, from which they firſt
ſprang, can poſſibly ariſe. Graſp not after the knowledge of this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:109701:24"/>
in the underſtanding part, but wait for the ſence of it from that
life, which lyes ſlain underneath theſe, and by that part which
exalt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> theſe.</p>
            <p>4. There are falſe keys to open the ſeveral chambers of image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in <hi>Babilon.</hi> This food man cannot gather of himſelfe, it muſt
be given to him: this knowledge man cannot get into by himſelf,
but as this ſpirit leads him, and opens to him: for he hath the keys
of death, and opens into the treaſures of death. Now this hugely
confirms a man in the deceit, without the leaſt ſuſpition of it.
Why, ſaith he, I had not this knowledge from my ſelfe, I came
not to it by mine own skill or underſtanding, but it was given me,
it was opened to me: and it came in freſh, and warmed my heart,
begetting ſweet and pure diſires in me, and hath made me eye
the glory of God, and not my ſelfe. Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, it might come thus in
the likeneſſe, and work the likeneſſe of this in thee; and yet it
ſelf not be truth, nor be able to work the truth of this to thee
and this is proper to deceive thy very heart, and make thee
a pleaſant inhabitant of <hi>Babilon,</hi> and a joyfull worſhiper of
the Kingt thereof, whom through this deep deceit, and moſt ſubtle
falſe appearances in thy heart, thou miſtakeſt for the King of
<hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. This falſe ſpirit hath his falſe croſſes, his ſelfe combats and
fightings. The very Papiſts have not only their wooden and ſtone
croſſes, but they have alſo then wayes of ſelf-deniall, their wayes
of croſſing the naturall part, of reſignation to the divine will (as
they call it) of fighting againſt corruption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is manifeſt,
that a man muſt deny himſelfe, or elſe he cannot be a Chriſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
(his own will muſt not, cannot live, if he truly give himſelfe up
to Chriſt:) therefore that ſpirit, which lyeth lurking to deceive,
hoth ſeverall wayes of ſelf denyall to teach (all which muſt have
ſome hardneſſe in them to the naturall part, or elſe they would
not paſſe:) and theſe may produce great, and conſtant conflicting
in the fleſh, and yet the fleſhly nature be ſtill kept alive under all
theſe conflicts and exerciſes of ſelfe deniall. He hath a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
knife, which cuts off a great deale, but alwayes ſpares the
nature: and as long as the nature is ſpeard, the Devil ſtill hath
that wherein he can dwell.</p>
            <p>6. He hath his falſe love to God and man, and his falſe zeale
for God Love and zeale are two diſtinguiſhing things. All men
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109701:25"/>
conclude, that love determines a man to be a Chriſtian, and ſo they
take up ſome appearance or other of love, ſomewhat that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
themſelves that their love is right, both to God and
man. The very Papiſts, who are full of blood and cruelty, yet
pretend to love: they have an image of love which contents
them. But there are far higher images, even images of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
love and ſweetneſſe, which no eye can perceive, but that
which knows the truth. And take one word from me, ye to
whom it belongs: all ye that cry up univerſall love, from the
ſweet ſenſe of its image, ye ſhall one day know, that one act of
particular love from the true nature, exceeds this in its utmoſt
extent.</p>
            <p>7. He hath his falſe life. The devil hath not only a dead
formall religion, but he hath a reſemblance, and imitation of the
quicknings of the Spirit. The devill puts his life into this image,
where need requires. He hath not only a dead litterall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but he hath paintings of the life: he draws a thing to the
life: he makes his dead image of truth, as like the living ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of truth, as poſſibly he can; inſomuch as his images of
life, at a diſtance, without being beheld in the true life, cannot
but be taken for living. Now here is the depth of deceit, when
the devils images of life in the heart, are taken for the living thin,
for the life it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>8. He hath his falſe liberty. There is a glorious liberty in
the Goſpell: there is perfect freedome in the ſervice of the life:
there is liberty in the power of the life over all the creatures.
God made all things for man, and he denies him nothing, he
being in ſubjection to him in the life, and uſing all in the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the life. Now the devil paints a liberty like this, yea
a liberty that ſeems greater then this, even a liberty wherein the
fleſhly part (whoſe very nature is eternally ſhut out of the
nature of true liberty) hath ſcope; which liberty is not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded,
nor cannot be ſurrounded by the power of life, as this is:
and in this painted liberty, that ſpirit which painted it lives, which:
paint the true liberty takes off, ſlaying that which calls it liberty,
and gathering in the name of liberty from this falſe appearance,
to that which is liberty indeed. And by the way, he that can read
this, let him: The perfection of the true liberty lies in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of bonds, in the perfect binding down of that which is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109701:25"/>
out of the life: for the true liberty, is the liberty of the life, and of
nothing elſe: and when all that is contrary to the life, is perfectly
bound down, then the life hath its ful ſcope, without the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
of the fleſhly pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t: and when the life lives, then that which
is joyned to the life lives alſo.</p>
            <p>Now here's the miſtery of iniquity, here's the inward Kingdom
of darkneſſe, here's the glory of <hi>Babilon!</hi> Here's he that contends
for the Kingdome, for the inheritance! Here the ſon of the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
(thus dreſſed, thus furniſhed, thus filled within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out)
will have it go for granted that he is the right heir: and
yet all this while wants the nature of that which is to inherit, and
cannot poſſibly receive that nature into himſelfe, but only ſuch
images afore mentioned. And if in tender love to his ſoule, from
a clear ſight of this thing, we warn him, and bid him look about,
he cries doe not judge. He really thinks he is right in the main,
and he ſeemes willing to refer it to the day of tryal. Ah poor
hearts! the eye is opened which can ſee. That which hath judged
the deceit in us, can alſo judge the deceit in thee. Cannot the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

               <hi>Object.</hi> How difficult doe you make the way to life, if not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
impoſſible? If all this be true, who can be ſaved?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The way to life is very difficult, yea and impoſſible
to that part in man, which is ſo buſie in willing and running to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
life: but it is as eaſie on the other hand, to that which the
father begetteth, raiſeth up, &amp; leadeth. <hi>The wayfairing man though
a fool ſhall not erre.</hi> The wiſeſt and richeſt Merchant in <hi>Babilon,</hi>
connot ſet one ſtep in it: the leaſt child in <hi>Sion</hi> cannot erre there.
Therefore know that in thy ſelfe, to which it is ſo hard; and
know that which God hath given to thee, which will make it
eaſie.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt a living talent given thee by God, let not thine eye
be drawn from that; but joyn to that: keep there, and thou art
ſafe: and that will open thine eye to ſee all deceits, juſt in the very
ſeaſon and hour of temptation. For thou muſt expect to meet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109701:26"/>
with all theſe temptations, as thy growth makes thee capable of
receiving them. And as they come, the true eye being kept open,
they will be ſeen: and being ſeen, they will eaſily be avoided in
the power of life, for in vain the net is ſpread in ſight of the bird.
Therefore that thou mayſt be ſafe.</p>
            <p>1. Know the light, the eternall light of life, the little glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and ſhinings of it in thy ſoul. This comes from the rock, to
lead thee to the rock: and if thou follow it, it will fix thee upon
the rock where thou canſt not be ſhaken.</p>
            <p>2. Keep in the light, keep within the the hedge, ſtep not out
of thine own, keep out of the circumference of the ſpirit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
the power of whoſe witchery and ſorcery extends all over
the regions of darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>3. Love ſimplicity, love the nakedneſſe of life, ſtand ſingle in
the honeſty of the heart, out of the intricate ſubtle reaſonings, and
wiſe conſultings about things: for by theſe means the ſerpent
comes to twine about and deceive thy ſoul: but in the ſimplicity
of the movings of life, in the light, lies the power, the ſtrength,
the ſafety.</p>
            <p>4. Lye very low continually, even at the foot of the loweſt
breathing and appearances of the light. Take heed of being above
that wherein thy life lyes: for the wiſdome, the power the
ſtrength, yea the great glory lyes in the humility: and thou muſt
never be exalted, thou muſt never come out of the humility, but
find and enjoy the honour and glory of the life in the humility.</p>
            <p>5. Mind the reproofs of the light, for that will ſtill be ſetting
thee to rights. That will ſtill be bringing down that which would
get up above, and there lyes the preſervation. Oh the chaſtnings
of the light, the ſweet chaſtenings of the love by the light! Theſe
are healing ſtripes. This brings down the exalter, and that in thee
which loves to be exalted, and to be ſeeking the honour of the
ſpirituall riches, before the humility is perfected.</p>
            <p>Thus in love to ſouls, have I powred out my ſoul before the
Lord, and held forth gentle leadings, even to the moſt ſtubborn
and ſtiffe-necked.</p>
