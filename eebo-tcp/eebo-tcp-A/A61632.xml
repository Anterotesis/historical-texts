         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that after all the Service
B. <hi>Jewel</hi> had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Papists,</hi> upon
his Preaching a Sermon
at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s-<hi>Cross,</hi> in

               <hi>That
what he then said, was neither to please

                     </gap>red.</hi> p. 255.</note> 
               <hi>nor to displease others, but to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Peace and Unity among Brethren.</hi> I am
far from the vanity of thinking, any thing I
have been able to do, in the same <hi>Cause,</hi> fit to be
compared with the Excellent Labors of that
Great Light, and Ornament of this Church,
(whose Memory is preserved to this day, with
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:95208:3"/>
due Veneration in all the <hi>Protestant Churches;)</hi>
but the hard Usage I have met with, upon the
like occasion, hath made such an Example more
observable to me; especially when I can make
the same Protestation, with the same sincerity as
he did. For, however it hath been Maliciously
suggested by some, and too easily believed by
others, that I was put upon that <hi>Work,</hi> with
a design to inflame our Differences, and to raise
a fresh persecution against <hi>Dissenting Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants;</hi>
I was so far from any thought tending
that way, that the only <hi>Motive</hi> I had to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it, was, my just Apprehension, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> under a
Pretence of Zeal against <hi>Popery,</hi> was one of
the most likely ways to bring it in. And I have
hitherto seen no cause (and I believe I shall not)
to alter my opinion in this matter; which was
not rashly taken up, but formed in my Mind from
many years Observation of the Proceedings of
that <hi>Restless Party</hi> (I mean the <hi>Papists)</hi> among
us; which hath always Aimed at the Ruine of
this <hi>Church,</hi> as one of the Most Probable Means,
if others failed, to compass their Ends. As to
their Secret and more Compendious ways of doing
Mischief, they lie too far out of our View, till
the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> at the same time, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
and disappoints them; but this was
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:95208:3"/>
more open and visible, and although it seemed
the farther way about, yet they promised them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
no small success by it. Many Instruments
and Engines they made use of in this design;
many ways and times they set about it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they met with several disappointments,
yet they never gave it over; but, Would it
not be very strange, that when they can appear
no longer in it, others, out of meer Zeal against
<hi>Popery,</hi> should carry on the Work for them?</p>
            <p>This seems to be a great <hi>Paradox</hi> to unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
People, who are carried away with meer
Noise and Pretences, and hope those will secure
them most against the <hi>Fears</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> who
talk with most Passion, and with least Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
against it; whereas no persons do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
give them greater advantages than these
do. For, where they meet only with intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Railings, and gross Misunderstandings of
the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Controversies</hi> between them
and us (which commonly go together) the
more subtle Priests let such alone to spend their
Rage and Fury; and when the heat is over,
they will calmly endevour to let them see, how
grosly they have been deceived in some things,
and so will more easily make them believe, they
are as much deceived in all the rest. And thus
the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> may meet at last; and the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:95208:4"/>
most furious <hi>Antagonists</hi> may become some of
the easiest <hi>Converts.</hi> This I do really fear
will be the case of many Thousands among us,
who now pass for most <hi>zealous Protestants;</hi> if
ever, which <hi>God forbid,</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> should
come to be Vppermost in <hi>England.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of mighty consequence for preventing the
<hi>Return</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> that Men rightly understand
what it is. For, when they are as much afraid
of an <hi>innocent Ceremony,</hi> as of <hi>real Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi>
and think they can <hi>Worship Images,</hi>
and <hi>Adore</hi> the <hi>Host</hi> on the same grounds, that
they may <hi>use the Sign of the Cross,</hi> or <hi>Kneel
at the Communion;</hi> when they are brought
to see their mistake in one case, they will sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
themselves deceived in the other also. For
they who took that to be <hi>Popery</hi> which is not,
will be apt to think <hi>Popery</hi> it self not so bad
as it was represented, and so from want of right
understanding the <hi>Differences</hi> between us, may
be easily carried from one <hi>Extreme</hi> to the other.
For, when they find the undoubted <hi>Practices</hi> of
the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> condemned as <hi>Popish</hi> and
<hi>Antichristian</hi> by their <hi>Teachers,</hi> they must
conclude <hi>Popery</hi> to be of much greater <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
than really it is; and when they can
Trace it so very near the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, they
will soon believe it setled by the <hi>Apostles</hi>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:95208:4"/>
themselves. For, it will be very hard to perswade
any considering Men that the <hi>Christian Church</hi>
should degenerate so soon, so unanimously, so
universally, as it must do, if <hi>Episcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
and the use of some <hi>significant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi>
were any parts of that <hi>Apostacy.</hi>
Will it not seem strange to them, that when
some Human <hi>Polities</hi> have preserved their
<hi>First Constitution</hi> so long, without any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Alteration, that the <hi>Government</hi> institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Christ,</hi> and setled by his <hi>Apostles,</hi> should
so soon after be changed into another kind, and
that so easily, so insensibly, that all the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Churches</hi> believed, they had still the very
<hi>same Government</hi> which the <hi>Apostles</hi> left
them? Which is a matter so incredible, that
those who can believe such a part of <hi>Popery</hi>
could prevail so soon in the <hi>Christian Church;</hi>
may be brought upon the like grounds to
believe, that many others did. So migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a prejudice doth the Principles of our
<hi>Churches Enemies,</hi> bring upon the <hi>Cause</hi> of
the <hi>Reformation.</hi> And those who foregoe the
<hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as all the Opposers
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> must do, must una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
run into insuperable <hi>difficulties</hi> in
dealing with the <hi>Papists,</hi> which the <hi>Principles</hi>
of our <hi>Church</hi> do lead us through. For we
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:95208:5"/>
can justly charge <hi>Popery</hi> as an unreasonable
<hi>Innovation,</hi> when we allow the undoubted
<hi>Practices</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Ancient
Church,</hi> for many <hi>Ages</hi> after <hi>Christ.</hi> But it
is observed by Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> That those
who reject the <hi>Usages</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi>
and <hi>Antichristian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface to 2d Vol. of Serm. Sect. 11.</note> when Assaulted by
<hi>Papists,</hi> will be apt to conclude <hi>Popery to be
the old Religion, which in the purest and
Primitive Times was Professed in all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Churches throughout the World. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the sober English Protestant, is able, by
the Grace of God, with much Evidence of
Truth, and without forsaking his Old Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
to justifie the Church of</hi> England
<hi>from all imputation of Heresie or Schism,
and the Religion thereof, as it stood by Law
established, from the like imputation of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty.
Wherein</hi> he professes <hi>to lay open the
inmost thoughts of his heart in this sad busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
before God and the World.</hi> I might
shew, by particular Instances, from my present
<hi>Adversaries,</hi> that to defend their own <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
they are driven to maintain such <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
as by evident <hi>consequences</hi> from them,
do overthrow the <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> of the
<hi>Reformation;</hi> but I leave those things to be
observed in their proper places: Yet I do not
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:95208:5"/>
question the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of many Mens <hi>Zeal</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Popery,</hi> who, out of too eager a desire
of upholding some particular Fancies of their
own, may give too great advantage to our
Common Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Three ways Bishop</hi> Sanderson <hi>observes,</hi>

               <hi>our</hi>
Dissenting Brethren, though not intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
and purposely, yet really and eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
have been the great Promoters of the

to their helping hand to the pulling
down of Episcopacy. And, <hi>saith he,</hi> it is
very well known to many what rejoycing
that Vote brought to the Romish Party:
How even in <hi>Rome</hi> it self they Sung their
Jo-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aeans upon the Tidings thereof, and
said Triumphantly, Now the day is ours;
Now is the Fatal-Blow given to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion in <hi>England.</hi> (2) By op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Interest of <hi>Rome</hi> with more Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
than Reason. (3) By frequent mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the Question; but especially
through the necessity of some false Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or other, which, having once imbibed,
they think themselves bound to maintain:
<hi>whatever becomes of the Common</hi> Cause <hi>of our</hi>
Reformation. <hi>Which may at last suffer as
much through some Mens folly and indiscretion,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:95208:6"/>
who pretend to be the most</hi> Zealous Protestants,
<hi>as by all the Arts and Designs of our open Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
For, as the same Learned and Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Bishop, hath said in this case,</hi> Many a
Man, when he thought most to make it
sure, hath quite marred a good business, by
over-doing it. <hi>Thus when the</hi> Papists <hi>of late
years, have not been able to hinder the taking
many things into consideration, against their
interest, it hath been observed, that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
have been for the most violent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
knowing, that either they would be wholly
ineffectual, or if they were pursued, they might
in the end bring more advantage than preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to their Cause. And it is to be feared,
they may still hope to do their business, as</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
<hi>observe the</hi> Devil <hi>doth; who, when he
finds one extreme will not do, he tries whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he can compass his end by the other:
And no doubt they will extremely rejoyce, if
they can make some Mens Fears of</hi> Popery,
<hi>prove at last an effectual means to bring it
about. As some of the</hi> Jews <hi>of old, out of a
rash and violent zeal for the preservation of
the</hi> purity <hi>of their</hi> Religion <hi>(as they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
by opposing the Sacrifices offer'd by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and denying the use of the lawful Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of their Country, brought the</hi> Roman
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:95208:6"/>
               <hi>Power upon them, and so hasten'd the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
both of their</hi> Religion <hi>and</hi> Countrey
<hi>too. I do not mention this, as though we
could take too great care by good and wholsom
Laws to strengthen the</hi> Protestant Interest,
<hi>and by that means, to keep out</hi> Popery; <hi>but
only to shew, what mighty prejudice an indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Zeal at this time may bring upon us; if
Men suffer themselves to be transported so far
as to think that overthrowing the</hi> Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>of this</hi> Church <hi>will be any means to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the</hi> Protestant Religion <hi>among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, What is it which the <hi>Papists</hi> have
more envied and maligned than the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England?</hi> What is it they have more wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to see broken in pieces? As the late <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
Barberini</hi> said in the hearing of a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi>
who told it me, <hi>He could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
there were no Priests in</hi> England, <hi>so
there were no Bishops;</hi> for then he supposed,
their Work would do it self. What is it
they have used more Arts and Instruments to
destroy, than the <hi>Constitution</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of this <hi>Church?</hi> Did not <hi>Cranmer</hi>
and <hi>Ridley,</hi> and <hi>Hooper,</hi> and <hi>Farrar,</hi> and
<hi>Latimer,</hi> all <hi>Bishops</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> suffer
<hi>Martyrdom</hi> by their Means? Had not they
the same <hi>kind of Episcopacy</hi> which is now
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:95208:7"/>
among us; and which some now are so busie
in seeking to destroy; by publishing one Book
after another, on purpose to represent it as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi>
and <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the <hi>Primitive
Institution?</hi> Is all this done for the <hi>honor</hi> of
our <hi>Reformation?</hi> Is this the way to preserve
the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> among us; to fill
Mens Minds with such Prejudices against the
first settlement of it; as to go about to make
the World believe, that the <hi>Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
then established was repugnant to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
of <hi>Christ;</hi> and that our <hi>Martyr-Bishops</hi>
exercised an unlawful Authority over
<hi>Diocesan Churches?</hi> But, Whither will
not Mens Indiscreet Zeal, and love of their
own Fancies carry them, especially after 40
<hi>years prescription?</hi> I do not say such Men
are set on by the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> but I say, they do their
Work as effectually, in blasting the credit of the
<hi>Reformation,</hi> as if they were. And yet after
all these pains, and <hi>Forty years</hi> Meditations, I
do not question but I shall make it appear, that
our present <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> is agreeable to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the best and most flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Churches. And, Wherein doth our
<hi>Church</hi> differ from its first Establishment?
Were not the same <hi>Ceremonies</hi> then appointed?
the same <hi>Liturgy</hi> in Substance then used?
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:95208:7"/>
concerning which Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> who then suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<hi>Martyrdom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, <hi>Tom. 3. p.</hi> 171.</note> publickly declared; <hi>That
the whole Church-Service was set forth in
King</hi> Edward'<hi>s days, with great deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the Advice of the best Learned Men
in the Realm, and Authorised by the whole
Parliament, and Received and Published
gladly through the whole Realm; which
Book was never Reformed but once, and
yet by that one Reformation, it was so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfected, according to the Rules of our
Christian Religion in every behalf, that no
Christian Conscience could be offended
with any thing therein contained, I mean,</hi>
saith he, <hi>of that Book Reformed.</hi> Yet this
is that Book, whose <hi>constant use</hi> is now plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by some, together with our <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as
a ground for the necessity of <hi>Separation</hi> from
our <hi>Churches</hi> Communion.</p>
            <p>But if we trace the Footsteps of this <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
as far as we can, we may find strong
probabilities, that the <hi>Jesuitical Party</hi> had a
great influence on the very first beginnings of
it. For which, we must consider, that when
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was restored in Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, there was no open <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
from the <hi>Communion</hi> of it, for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
years, neither by <hi>Papists,</hi> nor <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.</hi>
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:95208:8"/>
At last, the more Zealous Party of the
Foreign <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesuits,</hi> finding this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
would in the end utterly destroy the
<hi>Popish Interest</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> they began to
draw off the secret <hi>Papists</hi> from all <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
with our <hi>Church,</hi> which the old Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Priests allowed them in: this raised
some heat among themselves, but at last the way
of <hi>Separation</hi> prevailed, as the more <hi>pure</hi> and
<hi>perfect way.</hi> But this was not thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
by these busie Factors for the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> unless they could, under the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> draw off <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
from the <hi>Communion</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi>
too. To this purpose Persons were imployed
under the disguise of <hi>more Zealous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
to set up the way of <hi>more Spiritual
Prayer,</hi> and greater <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> than
was observed in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England:</hi>
that so the People, under these Pretences, might
be drawn into <hi>Separate Meetings.</hi> Of this
we have a Considerable Evidence lately offer'd
to the World,<note place="margin">Foxes and Firebrands. 1680.</note> in the <hi>Examination</hi> of a <hi>Priest</hi>
so imploy'd at the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> A. D. 1567.
being the 9th of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
from the <hi>Lord Burleighs</hi> Papers, which
were in the hands of <hi>Arch-Bishop Usher,</hi> and
from him came to Sir <hi>James Ware,</hi> whose Son
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:95208:8"/>
brought them into <hi>England,</hi> and lately caused
them to be Printed. Two years after, one
<hi>Heath</hi> a <hi>Jesuit</hi> was Summon'd before the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
of <hi>Rochester</hi> on a like account, for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging
the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up <hi>Spiritual Prayers</hi> above them; and
he declared to the Bishop, <hi>That he had been
six years in</hi> England, <hi>and that he had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to refine the Protestants, and to take
off all smacks of Ceremonies, and to make
the Church purer.</hi> When he was seized on,
a <hi>Letter</hi> was found about him from a <hi>Jesuit</hi>
in <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein he takes notice, <hi>how he was
admired by his Flock;</hi> and tells him, they
looked on this way of <hi>dividing Protestants</hi> as
the most effectual to bring them all back to the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and in his Chamber, they
found a <hi>Bull</hi> from <hi>Pius V.</hi> to follow the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions</hi>
of the <hi>Society</hi> for <hi>dividing the
Protestants in England;</hi> and the <hi>License</hi>
from his <hi>Fraternity.</hi> There is one thing in
the <hi>Jesuits Letter</hi> deserves our farther consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
which the Publisher of it did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand:
which is, that <hi>Hallingham, Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and <hi>Benson</hi> are there mentioned, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
imploy'd <hi>to sow a Faction among the
German Hereticks;</hi> which he takes to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the <hi>Sects in Germany;</hi> but by the
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:95208:9"/>
               <hi>German Hereticks</hi> the <hi>English Protestants</hi>
are meant, <hi>i.e. Lutherans:</hi> and these very
Men are mentioned by our Historians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing of this <hi>Letter,</hi> as the most active
and busie in the beginning of the <hi>Separation.
Of these</hi> (saith Fuller) <hi>Coleman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Church Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>l. 1. p.</hi> 81. History of Presbyter. <hi>l. 6. p.</hi> 257.</note>

And both these had it from a much better

               <hi>Camden I</hi> mean;
who saith, <hi>That while Harding, Sanders,
and others attacked our Church on one side;
Coleman, Button, Hallingham, Benson, and
others were as busie on the other; who,
under pretence of a purer Reformation, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the Discipline, Liturgy, and Calling
of our Bishops, as approaching too near
to the Church of Rome.</hi> And he makes
these the <hi>Beginners</hi> of those <hi>Quarrels</hi> which
afterwards brake out with great violence. Now,
that there is no improbability in the thing, will
appear by the suitableness of these Pretences
about <hi>Spiritual Prayer,</hi> to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:95208:9"/>
               <hi>Practices</hi> of the <hi>Jesuits.</hi> For they are profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
despisers of the <hi>Cathedral Service,</hi> and are
excused from their attendance on it by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi>
of their <hi>Order;</hi> and are as great
admirers of <hi>Spiritual Prayer,</hi> and an <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick
way</hi> of <hi>Preaching,</hi> as appears by the
History of the first Institution of their Order, by
<hi>Orlandinus</hi> and <hi>Maffeius.</hi> They who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with their <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Spiritual
Prayer,</hi> will find that which is admired and
set up here, as so much above <hi>Set-Forms,</hi> to be
one of the lowest of <hi>three sorts</hi> among them.
That <hi>Gift of Prayer</hi> which Men have, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the <hi>Exercise</hi> of their <hi>own Gifts</hi> to stir
it up, they call <hi>Oratio acquisita, acquired
Prayer;</hi> although they say, the <hi>Principle</hi> of it
is <hi>infused.</hi> The Second is, by a <hi>special im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
influence of the Holy Ghost upon
the Mind, with the concurrence of infused
habits.</hi> The Third is far above either of these,
which they call the <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>Contemplation,</hi>
and is never given by way of <hi>habit</hi> to any; but
lies in <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>unexpressible unions.</hi>
All these I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould easily shew to be the Doctrine

especially by those who pretend to greater <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>Spirituality</hi> than others. But this is
sufficient to my purpose, to prove, that there is
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:95208:10"/>
no improbability that they should be the first
setters up of this way in <hi>England.</hi> And it is
observable, that it was never known here, or
in any other <hi>Reformed Church</hi> before this
time: and therefore the beginning of it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
father'd by some on <hi>T. C.</hi> But by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it was begun, it met with such great
success in the zeal and warmth of devotion
which appeared in it, that no <hi>Charm</hi> hath been
more effectual, to draw injudicious <hi>People</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a contempt of our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and admiring
the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Separation.</hi> When by such Arts
the People were possessed with an Opinion of a
more <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Way of Worship</hi>
than was used in our <hi>Church,</hi> they were easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawn into the admiration of those, who
found fault with the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
that were used among us; and so the
<hi>Divisions</hi> wonderfully increased in a very
short time. And the <hi>Papists</hi> could not but
please themselves to see that other Men did
their VVork so effectually for them. For the
Authors of the <hi>Admonition 14 Elizab.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<hi>They would have neither Papists
nor others constrained to Communicate:
which although,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Defence of the Answer, p. 605.</note> as <hi>Arch-Bishop Whitgift</hi>
saith, <hi>they intended as a Plea for their own
Separation from the Church, yet,</hi> saith he,
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:95208:10"/>
               <hi>the Papists could not have met with better
Proctors.</hi> And elsewhere he tells them, <hi>That
they did the Pope very good service,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 55.</note> 
               <hi>and
that he would not miss them for any thing.
For what is his desire but to have this Church
of</hi> England <hi>(which he hath Accused) ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
defaced and discredited, to have it by
any means overthrown, if not by Forrein
Enemies, yet by Domestical Dissention.
And, What fitter and apter Instruments
could he have had for that purpose than you,
who under pretence of zeal, overthrow that
which other Men have builded, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
of Purity, seek to bring in Deformity,
and under the Cloke of Equality and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
would usurp as great Tyranny and
lofty Lordliness over your Parishes, as ever
the Pope did over the whole Church?</hi> And
in another place, he saith, <hi>They were made
the Engines of the Roman Conclave, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they intend to overthrow this Church by
our own Folly, which they cannot compass

            <p>But that which more particularly reaches

given to <hi>F. Young,</hi> by <hi>Seignior Ballari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
concerning <hi>the best way of managing the
Popish Interest in England, upon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Restauration,</hi> wherein are several
very remarkable things. This Letter
was found in <hi>F. Young</hi>'s Study, after his
death, and was translated out of <hi>Italian,</hi> and
printed in the Collection before mention'd;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The First</hi> Advice <hi>is,</hi> To make the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Settlement their great design,
especially upon the Fundamental Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Kingdom, whereunto if things
should fall, they would be more firm
than ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:95208:12"/>
(2.) <hi>The next thing is,</hi> To remove the
jealousies raised by Prin, Baxter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of their
design upon the late Factions; and to set
up the prosperous way of Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of the King and Bishops.</p>
            <p>(3.) To make it appear under-hand, how
near the Doctrine, Worship, and Discipline
of the Church of England comes to us: at
how little distance their Common-Prayer is
from our Mass; and that the wisest and
ablest Men of that way are so moderate,
that they would willingly come over to us,
or at least meet us half way; hereby the
more stayed Men will become more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and others will run out of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for fear of Popery.</p>
            <p>(4.) Let there be an Indulgence promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Factious, and seconded by
you.</p>
            <p>(5.) That the Trade and Treasure of the
Nation may be engrossed between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and other discontented Parties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:95208:13"/>
(6.) That the Bishops and Ministers of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> be Aspersed, as either
Worldly and Careless on the one hand; or
so Factious on the other, that it were well
they were removed.</p>
            <p>These are some of those excellent <hi>Advices</hi>
then given, and how well they have been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
we all know.</p>
            <p>For, according to this Counsel, when they
could not hinder the <hi>Settlement</hi> then, The
great thing they aimed at for many years,
was, the <hi>breaking in pieces</hi> the <hi>Constitution</hi>

<hi>Principles,</hi> such as they are, to justifie their

I grant some of them did not, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

            <p>
               <pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:95208:15"/>
This notable <hi>Book,</hi> with some few Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Alterations, hath been since Printed,
and with great sincerity called, <hi>An Answer to
my Sermon.</hi> And the Times being changed
since, the former Passage is thus alter'd,
<hi>The Papist is one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 32.</note> 
               <hi>whose Worship to us is
Idolatry, and we cannot therefore allow
them the liberty of Publick Assembling
themselves, as others of the Separation.</hi> Is
it <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and not to be <hi>tolerated</hi> in 1680?
And was it <hi>Idolatry</hi> and to be <hi>tolerated</hi> in
1675? Or was it <hi>no Idolatry</hi> then, but is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so now, and <hi>intolerable Idolatry</hi> too?
The latter passage hath these Alterations; in
stead of, <hi>He is to us as other Separatists,
and so comes under the like Toleration;</hi>
these are put in, <hi>He is to us, in regard of
what he doth in private, in the matter of his
God, as others who likewise refuse to come to
Common Prayer.</hi> Now we see <hi>Toleration</hi>
struck out for the <hi>Papists;</hi> but it was not only
visible enough before, but that very <hi>Book</hi> was
Printed with a Design to present it to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
which was the highest way of own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>Concurrence</hi> with the <hi>Papists</hi> for a
general <hi>Toleration.</hi> And the true reason of
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:95208:15"/>
this alteration is, that then was then, and now
is now.</p>
            <p>And to shew yet farther, what influence the
<hi>Jesuitical Counsels</hi> have had upon their <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
as to the <hi>Course</hi> of <hi>Separation;</hi> I shall
produce the <hi>Testimony</hi> of a very considerable
Person among them, who understood those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
as well as any Man, viz Mr. <hi>Ph. Nye.</hi>
VVho, not long before his Death, foreseeing
the Mischievous Consequence of those Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Heats, the People were running into,
VVrote a <hi>Discourse</hi> on purpose, <hi>to prove it
lawful to hear the Conforming Ministers,</hi>
and Answers all the Common Objections against
it; towards the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nclusion he wonders, <hi>how
the differing Parties came to be so agreed,
in thinking it unlawful to hear us Preach;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 250.</note>
but he saith, <hi>He is perswaded it is one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
design of Satan in the variety of ways
of Religion he hath set on foot by Jesuits
among us. Let us therefore be more aware
of whatsoever tends that way.</hi> Here we
have a plain Confession of a Leading Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> That the <hi>Jesuits</hi> were
very busie among them, and that <hi>they and the
Devil joyned together</hi> in setting them at the
greatest distance possible from the <hi>Church</hi> of
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:95208:16"/>
               <hi>England;</hi> and that those who would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the <hi>Devil and the Jesuits,</hi> must avoid
whatever tends to that height of <hi>Separation</hi>
the <hi>People</hi> were run into. And Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
in those days, <hi>viz.</hi> but a little before the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi>
came out, was so sensible of the <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi>
of <hi>Separation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface to the Defence of the Cure, p. 17.</note> that he saith, <hi>Our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
gratifieth the Papists, and greatly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardeth
the Protestant Religion, and that
more than most of your seem to believe, or
to regard.</hi> VVhere he speaks to the <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
People.</hi> And among other great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
of <hi>Separation,</hi> which he mentions,
this is one,<note place="margin">Defence of the Cure of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, intro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duction, p. 52, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That Popery will get by it so
great advantage as may hazard us all, and
we may lose that, which the several Parties
do contend about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two ways especially Popery will grow
out of our Divisions.</p>
            <p>(1.) By the odium and scorn of our
disagreements, inconsistency, and multiplied
Sects: they will perswade People, that we
must come for Unity to them, or else run
Mad, and crumble into dust and individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.
Thousands have been drawn to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or confirmed in it by this Argument al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:95208:16"/>
and I am perswaded, that all the
Arguments else in <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and all other
Books that ever were Written, have not done
so much to make Papists in <hi>England,</hi> as the
Multitude of Sects among our selves. Yea,
some Professors of Religious strictness, of
great esteem for Godliness, have turned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
themselves, when they were giddy and
wearied with turnings; and when they had
run from Sect to Sect, and found no consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
in any.</p>
            <p>(2.) Either the Papists by increasing the
Divisions, would make them be accounted
Seditious, Rebellious, dangerous to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace; or else when so many Parties are
constrained to beg and wait for liberty, the
Papists may not be shut out alone, but have
Toleration with the rest. And, <hi>saith he,</hi>
Shall they use our hands to do their Works,
and pull their Freedom out of the Fire? We
have already unspeakably served them, both
in this, and in abating the Odium of the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder
Plot, and their other Treasons, Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
and Spanish Invasion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus freely did Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>VVrite at that
time; and even after the</hi> Indulgence, <hi>he hath
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:95208:17"/>
these passages, concerning the</hi> Separating <hi>and</hi>
Dividing Humor <hi>of</hi> their People; It sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
it grieveth us to see and hear from
<hi>England,</hi> and from <hi>New England</hi> this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cry,<note place="margin">Sacrilegious desertion, p. 103, 104.</note> We are endanger'd by Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
principally because the Self-conceited
part of the Religious People, will not be
ruled by their Pastors, but must have their
way, and will needs be Rulers of the Church
and them. <hi>And soon after he saith to them,</hi>
You have made more Papists than ever you
or we are like to recover. Nothing is any
whit considerable that a Papist hath to say,
till he cometh to your case, and saith, Doth
not experience tell you, that without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Unity and Force, these People will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be ruled, or united? It is you that tempt
them to use Fire and Faggot, that will not
be ruled nor kept in concord, by the Wisest,
and holyest, and most Self-denying Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
upon Earth. <hi>(Are not these kind words
for themselves, considering what he gives to
others?)</hi> And must you, even you, that
should be our comfort, become our shame,
and break our hearts, and make Men Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
by your Temptation? Wo to the
World because of offences, and wo to some
by whom they come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:95208:17"/>
Let now any impartial Reader Iudge, who
did most effectually serve the <hi>Papists Designs,</hi>
those who kept to the <hi>Communion</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or those who fell into the
<hi>Course</hi> of <hi>Separation?</hi> I will allow, what
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Defence of the Cure, p. 53.</note> 
               <hi>That they might use their
endeavors to exasperate the several Parties
against each other;</hi> and might sometimes press
the more rigorous execution of <hi>Laws</hi> against
them; but then it was to set them at the greater
distance from us, and to make them more plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a <hi>General Toleration</hi> And they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
complained, that those who were most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
to this, found themselves under the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Law, when more tractable Men es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped;
which they have weakly imputed to the
<hi>implacable temper</hi> of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> when they
might easily understand the true Cause of such
a discrimination: But from the whole it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that the <hi>grand Design</hi> of the <hi>Papists</hi>
for many years, was to break in pieces the
<hi>Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi>
which being done, they flatter'd themselves
with the hopes of great Accessions to their
strength and Party; and in order to this, they
inflamed the differences among us to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
height, on purpose to make all the <hi>Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:95208:18"/>
Parties</hi> to joyn with them for a <hi>General
Toleration;</hi> which they did not question
would destroy this <hi>Church,</hi> and advance their
Interest. Whether they did judge truly in this, I
am not to determine; it is sufficient that they
went upon the greatest Probabilities. But, Is
it possible to imagine such skilful <hi>Engineers</hi>
should use so much Art and Industry to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and blow up a <hi>Bulwark,</hi> unless they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to gain the place, or at lest some very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
advantage to themselves by it? And
it is a most unfortunate condition our <hi>Church</hi>
is in, if those who design to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi>
and those who design to keep it out, should both
conspire towards its destruction.</p>
            <p>This, which I have represented, was the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of our <hi>Church-Affairs,</hi> when the late hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<hi>Plot</hi> of the <hi>Papists,</hi> for <hi>Destruction</hi> of
the <hi>Kings Person,</hi> and <hi>Subversion</hi> of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
came to be discover'd. It seems, they
found the other methods tedious and uncertain;
and they met with many cross accidents, many
rubs and disappointments in their way; and
therefore they resolved upon a <hi>Summary way</hi> of
<hi>Proceeding,</hi> and to do their business by one
blow. VVhich, in regard of the circumstances
of our Affairs, is so far from being incredible,
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:95208:18"/>
that if they <hi>had</hi> no such design, it is rather a
VVonder, they had not; especially considering
the allowed Principles and Practices in the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Upon the discovery of the
<hi>Plot,</hi> and the Means of <hi>Papists</hi> used con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the <hi>Truth</hi> of it (knowing our great prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to <hi>Infidelity)</hi> by the Murder of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Gentleman who received the <hi>Depositions,</hi>
the Nation was extremely Alarm'd with the
apprehensions of <hi>Popery,</hi> and provoked to the
utmost detestation of it. Those who had been
long apprehensive of their restless designs, were
glad to see others awaken'd; but they seemed
like Men roused out of a deep sleep, being ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
and confounded, fearful of every thing, and
apt to mistrust all persons who were not in such
a <hi>Consternation</hi> as themselves. During this
heat, some of us, both in Private, and Publick,
endeavor'd to bring the <hi>Dissenters</hi> to the sense
of the necessity of <hi>Union</hi> among <hi>Protestants,</hi>
hoping the apprehension of present danger, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to us all, would have disposed them to a
better inclination to <hi>the things which belong
to our Peace.</hi> But finding the Nation thus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
bent against <hi>Popery,</hi> those who
had formerly carried it so smoothly and fairly
towards the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>innocent Papists</hi>
(as they then stiled them) and thought them
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:95208:19"/>
               <hi>equally capable of Toleration with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
now they fly out into the utmost rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them; and others were apt, by <hi>sly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations,</hi>
to represent those of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> (some of whom had appeared with
vigor and resolution against <hi>Popery,</hi> when they
were trucking underhand for <hi>Toleration</hi> with
them) as <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>Masquerade.</hi> But now
they tack about, and strike in with the violent
<hi>Rage</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and none so fierce against
<hi>Popery</hi> as they. VVhat influence it hath had
upon others I know not, but I confess it did not
lessen my esteem of the <hi>Integrity</hi> of those of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that they were not
so much transported by sudden heats, beyond
the just bounds of <hi>Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Decency,</hi>
and <hi>Humanity,</hi> towards their greatest <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
having learnt from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> That, <hi>the
wrath of Man worketh not the righteousness
of God.</hi> They expected as little favor from
them as any, if they had prevailed, and I doubt not
but some of them had been made the first Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of their <hi>Cruelty.</hi> However, this was
interpreted to be want of Zeal, by those who
think there is no Fire in the House, unless it
flame out at the VVindows; and this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
was taken by the inveterate Enemies of
our <hi>Church,</hi> to represent us all as secret friends
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:95208:19"/>
to the <hi>Papists</hi> (so improbable a Lie, that the
Devil himself would Blush at the Telling of
it, not for the Malice, but the Folly and Ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of it) and those who were more <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,</hi>
were content to allow 3 or 4 among
the <hi>Bishops</hi> to be <hi>Protestants,</hi> and about 4 or
5 among the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>London</hi> To feed this
humor (which wonderfully spread among more
of the <hi>People</hi> than we could have believed to
have been so weak) most of the Malicious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
and dispersed, and new ones added to
them. Among the rest, one Translated out of
<hi>French,</hi> to prove the <hi>Advances of the Church
of England towards Popery;</hi> but so unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
managed, that those Persons are Chiefly Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
who had appeared with most zeal
against <hi>Popery.</hi> Yet, so much, had the Arts
of some Men prevailed over the Iudgments of
others, that even this Discourse was greedily
swallowed by them. But I must do the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
of it that Right, to declare, that before
his Death, he was very sensible of the Injury
he had done to some Worthy <hi>Divines</hi> of our
<hi>Church</hi> therein; and begged God and them
Pardon for it. Wherein, as he followed the
Example of some others, who were great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to our <hi>Church</hi> while they lived, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:95208:20"/>
of it, when they came to die; so, I
hope, others, upon better consideration, will
see reason to follow his. But this was but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
trifle in comparison of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
We were still in hopes, that Men <hi>so
Wise, so Self-denying</hi> as the <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
Ministers</hi> represent themselves to the
World, would, in so <hi>Critical</hi> a time, have
made some steps or advances towards an <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
with us; at lest to have let us known
their Sense of the Present State of things, and
their Readiness to joyn with us, as far as they
could, against the <hi>Assaults</hi> of a <hi>Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi>
In stead of this, those we Discoursed
with, seemed farther off than before; and
when we lest expected such a Blow, under
the Name of a <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> out comes a
<hi>Book,</hi> which far better deserved the Title of
a <hi>Plea for Disorder and Separation,</hi> not
without frequent, sharp, and bitter Reflections
on the <hi>Constitution</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and the
<hi>Conformity</hi> required by <hi>Law;</hi> as though it
had been designed on purpose, to Represent the
<hi>Clergy</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> as a Company of Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Perjured Villains,</hi> for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
established among us; for there are no
fewer than 30 <hi>Tremendous Aggravations of
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:95208:20"/>
the Sin of Conformity</hi> set down in it. And
all this done, without the lest Provocation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on our side; when all our <hi>Discourses</hi>
that touched them, tended only to <hi>Union,</hi> and
the <hi>Desirableness</hi> of <hi>Accommodation.</hi> If
this had been the single Work of one Man, his
Passion and Infirmities might have been some
tolerable excuse for the <hi>indiscretion</hi> of it; but
he Writes in the Name of a Whole <hi>Party</hi> of
Men, and delivers the <hi>Sense of all his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;</hi>
and if those <hi>Principles</hi> be owned,
and allowed by them, there can hardly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
any such thing as a <hi>National Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but all <hi>Churches</hi> must be heaps of Sand,
which may lie together till a puff of Wind dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perses
them; having no firmer Bond of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than the <hi>present humor</hi> and <hi>good will</hi> of
the <hi>People.</hi> But of the Principles of that
Book, I have Discoursed at large, as far as
concerns the business of <hi>Separation</hi> in the
Second and Third <hi>Parts</hi> of the following <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, as though this had not been enough,
to shew what Enemies to <hi>Peace</hi> Men may be
under a Pretence of it; not long after, the same
<hi>Author</hi> sets forth another <hi>Book,</hi> with this
<hi>Title, The true and only Way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:95208:21"/>
of all the Christian Churches.</hi> As
though he had been Christ's <hi>Plenipotentiary</hi>
upon Earth, and were to set the <hi>Terms</hi> of
<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>War</hi> among all <hi>Christians;</hi> but
I wish he had shewed himself such a Pattern of
Meekness, Humility, Patience, and a Peaceable
Disposition, that we might not have so much
Reason to Dispute his <hi>Credentials.</hi> But this
is likewise Fraught with such impracticable
Notions, and dividing Principles; as though
his whole design had been, to prove, That
there is <hi>No True Way of Concord among
Christians:</hi> for if there be no other, than what
he allows; all the <hi>Christian Churches</hi> this day
in the World, are in a mighty mistake. When
I looked into these <hi>Books,</hi> and saw the Design
of them, I was mightily concerned, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
surprised, that a Person of his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Piety, of his Age, and Experience in
the World, and such a <hi>Lover of Peace,</hi> as
he had always professed himself; and one
who tells the <hi>World</hi> so often of his <hi>Dying, and
of the Day of Judgment,</hi> should think of
leaving two such <hi>Firebrands</hi> behind him, as
both these <hi>Books</hi> will appear to any one who due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considers them, which have been since fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by 4 or 5 more to the same purpose, so
that he seems resolved to leave his <hi>Life</hi> and
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:95208:21"/>
               <hi>Sting</hi> together in the Wounds of this Church.
And it made me extremely pity the case of this
poor Church, when even those who pretend to
<hi>Plead</hi> for <hi>Peace,</hi> and to bring <hi>Water</hi> to quench
her <hi>Flames,</hi> do but add more Fuel to them This
gave the first occasion to those thoughts, which
I afterwards delivered in my Sermon; for since
by the means of such <hi>Books,</hi> the zeal of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>People</hi> was turned off from the <hi>Papists</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those of our <hi>Church,</hi> I saw a plain necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that either we must be run down by the
Impetuous Violence of an Enraged, but Vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
Company of Men, or we must venture
our selves to try, whether we could stem that
Tide, which we saw coming upon us. And
it falling to my Lot to Preach in the most pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>Auditory</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> at a more than usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Appearance, being the first <hi>Sunday</hi> in the
<hi>Term,</hi> I considered the Relation I stood in
under our Honored <hi>Diocesan,</hi> to the <hi>Clergy</hi> of
the <hi>City,</hi> and therefore thought my self more
obliged to take notice of what concerned <hi>the
Peace and Welfare</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> therein.
Upon these Considerations, I thought fit to take
that opportunity, to lay open the due sense I
had of the <hi>Unreasonableness</hi> and <hi>Mischief</hi> of
the Present <hi>Separation.</hi> Wherein I was so
far from intending to reflect on <hi>Mr. B. as
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:95208:22"/>
Preaching in the Neighborhood of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi>
that to my best remembrance, I never
once thought of it, either in the making or
Preaching of that Sermon. And yet through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his <hi>Answer</hi> he would insinuate, <hi>That I
had scarce any one in my eye but himself.</hi>
His <hi>Books</hi> indeed had made too great an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on my Mind for me easily to forget
them: But it was the great, the Dangerous,
the Vnaccountable <hi>Separation,</hi> which I knew
to be in and about the <hi>City,</hi> without regard to
the Greatness or Smallness of Parishes, to the
Abilities or Piety of their Ministers, or to the
Peace and Order of the Church we live in;
which made me fix upon that Subject; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I knew it to be so sore a place, that the
Parties most concerned, could hardly endure to
have it touched, though with a Soft and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hand. However, I considered the Duty
which I owe to <hi>God,</hi> and this <hi>Church,</hi> above
the esteem and good words of Peevish and
Partial Men; as I had before done in my deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the <hi>Papists;</hi> and I resolved to give
them no Iust Provocation by Reproachful Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
or Personal Reflections; but if <hi>Truth</hi>
and <hi>Reason</hi> would Anger them, I did not hold
my self obliged to study to please them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xli" facs="tcp:95208:22"/>
But, against this whole Vndertaking, there
have been two common Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That it was Unseasonable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it was too Sharp and
Severe.</p>
            <p>To both these I shall Answer;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As to the <hi>Unseasonableness</hi> of it.
What! Was it <hi>Unseasonable</hi> to perswade
<hi>Protestants</hi> to <hi>Peace and Unity?</hi> That surely
is very seasonable at any time, and much more
then. And I appeal to any one that Reads
it, whether this were not the chief, and only
Design of my <hi>Sermon.</hi> And, to say, <hi>This was
Unseasonable,</hi> is just, as if a Garrison were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd
by an Enemy, and in great danger of
being surprised, and although they had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
notice of it given them, yet many of the
Soldiers were resolved not to joyn in a common
body, under Command of their Officers, but would
run into Corners, a few in a Company, and do
what they list, and one should undertake to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them to return to their due obedience, and
to mind the Common Interest, and some Grave
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:95208:23"/>
by-standers should say, <hi>It is true, this is good
Counsel at another time, but at this present
it is very Unseasonable.</hi> When could it be
more <hi>seasonable,</hi> than when the sence of their
danger is greatest upon them? At another
time it might have been less necessary; but
when the common danger is apparent to all,
Men of Sense, or common ingenuity, could not
but take such advice most kindly at such a <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
But this advice was not given to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but to the Magistrates and Judges,
and that made it look like a design to stir
them up to a persecution of them.</hi> There
had been some color for this, if there had been
the left word tending that way through the
whole <hi>Sermon.</hi> But this objection is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made by those who never read the <hi>Sermon,</hi>
and never intend to read it; and such I have
found have spoken with the greatest bitterness
against it. They resolved to condemn it, and
therefore would see nothing that might have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
their Sentence. It is enough, <hi>it was
Preached before the Magistrates and Judges,
and therefore it must be for persecution of
Dissenters.</hi> No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e are so incapable of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as those who presently determine what a
thing must be, without considering what it is.
Is it not possible for a Man to speak of <hi>Peace</hi>
               <pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:95208:23"/>
before <hi>Hannibal,</hi> or of <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
before <hi>Julius Caesar?</hi> Must one speak
of nothing but <hi>Drums</hi> and <hi>Trumpets</hi> before,
great <hi>Generals?</hi> Which is just as reasonable
as to suppose, that a Man cannot Preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Dissenters</hi> before <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi>
but he must design to stir them up to the severe
<hi>Execution</hi> of <hi>Laws?</hi> But it is to no purpose
for me to think to convince those by any <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi>
who will not be at the pains to read
the <hi>Sermon</hi> it self, for their own satisfaction.
<hi>But the Dissenters themselves were not
there to hear it.</hi> And must we never Preach
against the <hi>Papists</hi> but when they are <hi>present?</hi>
It seems they soon heard enough of it, by the
Noise and Clamor they made about it. <hi>Yet
still this gives advantage to the Papists, for
us to quarrel among our selves.</hi> Would to
God this advantage had never been given
them! And <hi>Woe be to them by whom
these offences come.</hi> And what must we
do? Must we stand still with open Arms, and
naked Breasts to receive all the Wounds they are
willing to give us? Must we suffer our selves
to be run down with a Popular fury, raised by
Reviling Books, and <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> and not open
our Mouths for our own Vindication, lest the
<hi>Papists</hi> should overhear us? Which is, as
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:95208:24"/>
if the unruly Soldiers in an Army must be let
alone in a Mutiny, for fear the Enemy should
take notice, and make some advantage of it.
But which will be the greater advantage to
him, to see it spread and increase, or care taken
in time to suppress it? If our <hi>Dissenters</hi>
had not appeared more Active, and busie than
formerly; if they had not both by publick
Writings, and secret Insinuations, gone about
to blast the Reputation of this <hi>Church,</hi> and
the <hi>Members</hi> of it, so disingenuously, as they
have done; there might have been some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for the <hi>Unseasonableness</hi> of my <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
But when those things were notorious,
to say it was <hi>Unseasonable</hi> to Preach such a
<hi>Sermon</hi> then, or now to defend it; is, in effect
to tell us, they may say and do what they will
against us, at all seasons; but whatever we
say or do for our own Vindication is <hi>Unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;</hi>
Which, under favor, seems to be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
less than a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Persecution</hi> on our
side; for it is, like setting us in the <hi>Pillory,</hi>
for them to throw <hi>dirt</hi> at us, without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us any means to defend our Selves.</p>
            <p>But some complain of the too <hi>great sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and severity</hi> of it. But, Wherein doth
it lie? Not, in raking into old Sores, or look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back to the proceedings of former times?
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:95208:24"/>
Not, in exposing the particular faults of some
Men, and laying them to the charge of the
whole Party? Not, in sharp and provoking
reflections on Mens Persons? All these I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely,
and with care declined. My design be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not to exasperate any; but to perswade and
argue them into a better disposition to <hi>Union,</hi>
by laying open the common danger we are in,
and the great <hi>Mischief</hi> of the present <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
But I am told by one,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>O.</hi> Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>There are
severe reflections upon the sincerity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
of the Designs of the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter out of the Country, p. 7.</note>
by another, <hi>that indeed I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak
for them, Gibbets, Whipping-posts,
and Dungeons; nor (directly) any thing
grievous to their flesh; but I do not pass any
gentle doom upon them, in respect of their
Everlasting State.</hi> God forbid, that I should
Iudge any one among them, as to their present
sincerity, or final condition; <hi>to their own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
they must stand or fall;</hi> but, my business
was to consider, the nature and tendency of
their Actions. My Iudgment being, that a
causless breaking the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> we
live in, is really as great and as dangerous a
<hi>Sin,</hi> as <hi>Murder;</hi> and in some respects aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
beyond it; and herein, having the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of the <hi>Divines</hi> of greatest reputation
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:95208:25"/>
both Ancient and Modern: Would they have
had me represented that as no sin, which I
think to be so great a one; or those as not
guilty, whom in my Conscience I thought to be
guilty of it? Would they have had me suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this <hi>Sin</hi> to have <hi>lain upon them</hi> without
<hi>reproving it;</hi> or, Would they have had me
found out all the soft and palliating considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to have lessen'd their sense of it? No, I
had seen too much of this already: and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
prejudice done thereby to Men, otherwise scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
and conscientious, that seem to have
lost all <hi>Sense</hi> of this <hi>Sin;</hi> as if there neither
were, nor could be any such thing; unless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they should happen to quarrel among
themselves in a particular Congregation. Which
is so mean, so jejune, so narrow a Notion of
<hi>Schism,</hi> so much short of that <hi>Care</hi> of the
<hi>Churches Peace</hi> which <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ist</hi> hath made so
great a <hi>Duty</hi> of his Followers; that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but wonder that Men of understanding
should be satisfy'd with it, unless they thought
there was no other way to excuse their own
actings. And that I confess, is a shrew'd temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
But, so far as I can judge, as far as
the Obligation to preserve the <hi>Churches Peace</hi>
extends, so far doth the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Schism</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>each;
and the <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>preserve the Peace of
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:95208:25"/>
the Church</hi> extends to all lawful <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
in order to it; or else it would fall short
of the <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>Civil Peace,</hi> which is <hi>as
far as is possible,</hi> and <hi>as much as lies in us.</hi>
Therefore to break the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> we
live in, for the sake of any <hi>lawful Orders</hi> and
<hi>Constitutions</hi> made to preserve it, is directly
the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Schism,</hi> or an unlawful breach of the
<hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And this is not to be
determined by Mens fancies, and present ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions;
which they call the <hi>Dictates</hi> of
<hi>Conscience;</hi> but upon plain and evident
grounds, manifesting the repugnancy of the
things required to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Institutions</hi>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that they are of that importance
that he allows Men rather to divide from such
a <hi>Communion,</hi> than joyn in the practice of
such things. We were in a lamentable case, as
to the <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> if we had
nothing more to plead against the Impositions of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> than they have against
ours: and I think it impossible to defend the
<hi>lawfulness</hi> of our <hi>Separation</hi> from them, if we
had no better grounds to proceed upon, than
they have against our <hi>Church.</hi> For the proof
of this, I refer the <hi>Reader</hi> to the <hi>BOOK</hi> it
self. This then being my opinion concerning
their Practices, Was this a fault in me, to
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:95208:26"/>
shew some reason for it? And How could I do
that without proving those Practices to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?
and if they were sinful, How could they
who knowingly and deliberately continue in the
Practice of them be innocent? What influence
the prejudices of Education, the Authority of
Teachers, the almost Invincible Ignorance of
some weaker People, and the Vncurable Biass
of some Mens Minds may have to lessen their
Guilt, I meddle not with; but the <hi>Nature</hi> of
the <hi>Actions,</hi> and the <hi>Tendency</hi> of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
I then declared to be <hi>Sinful;</hi> and I am so far
from being alter'd in my Iudgment by any of
the <hi>Answers</hi> I have seen (and I have read
all that have been published) that I am much
more confirmed in it. But Dr. O. saith, <hi>He
had seen a Collection made of severe refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
by the hand of a Person of Honor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 4.</note>
               <hi>with his Judgment upon them.</hi> I wish the
Doctor had favour'd me with a sight of them;
but at present it is somewhat hard for me to
make the <hi>Objections</hi> and <hi>Answers</hi> too. And
it was not so fairly done to mention them,
unless he had produced them. Therefore, to
the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nknown Objections,</hi> I hope no <hi>Answer</hi>
is expected.</p>
            <p>But there is one expression wherein I am
charged <hi>with a Scurrilous Sarcasm, or a very
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:95208:26"/>
Unchristian Judging Mens hearts, or a Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
piece of Nonsense,</hi> viz. When I say,
<hi>That the most godly People among them
can the lest endure to be to told of their
Faults:</hi> Now,<note place="margin">Mischief of Impos. end of the Preface.</note> saith Mr. <hi>A. How can they
be most Godly, who cannot bear reproof
of their Faults, which is a main part of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</hi>
I am really sorry, some of my <hi>Answerers</hi>
have so much made good the Truth of that
Saying in its plainest Sense. But there needs
no more to clear my Intention in it, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
of whom it is spoken; <hi>viz.</hi> of those, who
will not bear being told of the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by their own Teachers.</hi> For my Words
are, <q>Is it that they Fear the Reproaches of
the People? which some few of the most E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Persons among them, have found
they must undergo, if they touch upon this
Subject (for I know not how it comes to
pass, that the most Godly People among them
can the lest endure to be told of their Faults.)</q>
In all which words I had a particular respect
to the <hi>Case</hi> of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> who, after he had,
with great honesty, published his <hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,</hi>
and therein sharply rebuked the <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating,
Dividing Humor of the People,</hi> who
pretended most to <hi>Religious Strictness,</hi> he met
with bitter Reproaches from them for the sake
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:95208:27"/>
of this Freedom, that he was foced to Publish
a <hi>Defence</hi> of his <hi>Cure</hi> in Vindication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from them; wherein he saith, <hi>He was
judged by them to be too Censorious of
them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface, p. 11, 13.</note> 
               <hi>and too sharp in telling them of that
which he did not doubt to be their Sin: And</hi>
again, <hi>If I be mistaken, Should you be so
impatient, as not to bear with one, that in
such an Opinion differeth from you? And
why should not you bear with my Dissent,
as well as I do with yours?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 15.</note> Again, <hi>Why
should not you bear with lesser contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when others must bear with far greater
from you? Will you proclaim you selves
to be the more impatient? You will then
make Men think, you are the most guilty.</hi>—
And a little after, <hi>And yet you that should
be most patient, take it for a heinous crime
and injury, to be told, that you wrong
them, and that you judge too hardly of
them; and that their Communion is not
unlawful.</hi> And when we joyn to this, what
he saith elsewhere, that they are the <hi>most
Self-conceited Professors who will not be
ruled by their Ministers, but are most given
to Division and Separation:</hi> in a passage
before mention'd; there needs no more to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the truth of this saying, than to shew,
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:95208:27"/>
that the <hi>most Self-conceited</hi> do often pass for
<hi>the most Godly</hi> among them; which is a <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi>
so common, so easie to be understood, that
it needs no more Apology, than our <hi>Saviours</hi>
calling the <hi>Pharisees Righteous Men,</hi> and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they were <hi>so whole,</hi> as <hi>to need no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician.</hi>
And I cannot think such <hi>figures</hi> which
were used by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> unfit for a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all the care I took to
prevent giving any just occasion of Offence, my
<hi>Sermon</hi> had not been long abroad, but I heard of
Great Clamors against it. At first it went down
quietly enough, and many of the People began to
Read and Consider it, being pleased to find so
weighty and so necessary a Point debated, with
so much Calmness, and freedom from Passion.
Which being discerned by the Leaders, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers
of the Parties, it was soon resolved,
that the <hi>Sermon</hi> must be cried down, and the
People Disswaded, by all means, from Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. If any of them were Talked with about
it, they shrunk up their Shoulders, and looked
Sternly, and shook their Heads, and hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
some Bitter Words both of the <hi>Author</hi>
and the <hi>Sermon.</hi> Vpon this followed a great
Cry and Noise, both in <hi>City and Country,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; and some honest persons really pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:95208:28"/>
me, thinking I had done some very ill
thing; so <hi>many People were of a sudden so
set against me,</hi> and <hi>spoke so bitterly of my
Sermon.</hi> I Asked, What the matter was?
What False Doctrine I had Preached? Did
they suspect I was turn'd <hi>Papist,</hi> at such a
Time, when all the <hi>Nation</hi> was set against
<hi>Popery?</hi> who had Written so much against
it, when others, who are now so fierce, were
afraid to appear? <hi>It was something, they
said, had Angred them sorely, but they could
not tell What:</hi> which made me Read my
<hi>Sermon</hi> over again, to see what Offensive
Passages there might be in it; after all, I could
see no just cause for any Offence, unless it were,
that I perswaded the Dissenters to <hi>Submit</hi> to
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and not the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Submit</hi> to them. And this, I
believe, lay at the bottom of many Mens Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks.
They would have had me Humor'd
the Growing Faction, which, under a Pretence
of <hi>Zeal</hi> against <hi>Popery,</hi> Designed to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> or, at lest
have Preached for <hi>Alterations</hi> and <hi>Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and taking away <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and
<hi>Subscriptions,</hi> and leaving them full Liberty
to do what they pleased; and then I might
have gained their good opinion, and been thought
<pb n="liii" facs="tcp:95208:28"/>
to have Preached a very <hi>Seasonable Sermon.</hi>
But supposing my own private opinion were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much for some <hi>Abatements</hi> to be made,
that might tend to strengthen and unite <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
and were consistent with our <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Settlement;</hi> Had it been seasonable to
have spoken of the <hi>Alteration</hi> of <hi>Laws</hi> before
<hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> who are tied up to
the <hi>Laws</hi> in being? Is it fit for private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
when <hi>Laws</hi> are in force, to take upon
them to Iudge what <hi>Laws</hi> are fit to continue,
and what not? I think the Alteration of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
<hi>Laws,</hi> which concern the <hi>Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> one of the
Weightiest things that can be taken into Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
And although the Arguments are
very plausible one way, yet the Objections are
very strong another. The <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
the <hi>Ease</hi> of <hi>Scrupulous Consciences,</hi>
the <hi>providing for so many poor Families of
Ejected Ministers,</hi> are great <hi>Motives</hi> on our
side; But,</p>
            <p>1. The Impossibility of satisfying all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters.</p>
            <p>2. The Vncertainty of gaining any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
number by Relaxations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="liv" facs="tcp:95208:29"/>
3. The Difficulty of keeping Factions out
of the Church, considering the Vngoverna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of some Mens Tempers and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>4. The danger of breaking all in pieces by
<hi>Toleration;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The Exposing our selves to the <hi>Papists,</hi>
and others, by Receding too far from the first
<hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Frame</hi> of our <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> 6. The Difficulty of keeping out
<hi>Priests,</hi> pretending to be allowed Dissenters, are
very weighty <hi>Considerations</hi> on the other
side.</p>
            <p>So that, whatever Men talk of the <hi>easiness
of taking away the present Impositions,</hi> it is
a sign they look no farther than their own case;
and do not consider the <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> of
a <hi>National Settlement,</hi> and the <hi>necessity</hi>
thereof to keep out <hi>Popery;</hi> and, How much
easier it is to break things in pieces, than to
set them in order again; for, new Objections
will still be raised against any <hi>Settlement,</hi> and
so the result may be nothing but <hi>Disorder</hi> and
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:95208:29"/>
               <hi>Confusion.</hi> Of what moment these things may
be thought to other persons, I know not; but
they were great enough to me, to make me think
it very <hi>unseasonable</hi> to meddle with <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
Law's;</hi> but on the other hand, I could
not but think it <hi>seasonable</hi> to endeavor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
such <hi>Scruples</hi> and <hi>Prejudices,</hi> as hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the People most from <hi>Communion</hi> with
our <hi>Churches;</hi> for, as I said in the <hi>Epistle</hi>
before the <hi>Sermon,</hi> 
               <q>If the People be brought
to Vnderstand and Practice their Duty, as to
Communion with our Churches, other diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
which obstruct our Union, will more
easily be removed.</q> 
               <hi>This passage,</hi> Mr <hi>A.</hi>
tells me,<note place="margin">Mischief of Imposition Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face towards the end.</note>

Stranger to the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of those places; but I
see Mr. <hi>A.</hi> is able to give me an Account of the
Sage Discourses upon Points of <hi>Divinity</hi> there.
But if those pleasant Gentlemen would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the difference between <hi>Lay-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Ministerial Conformity,</hi> they might
have apprehended the meaning of that passage.
For, I am of Opinion, if the <hi>People</hi> once thought
themselves bound to do, what they may lawfully
do, towards <hi>Communion</hi> with us; many of
the <hi>Ministers</hi> who seem now most most forward to
defend the <hi>Separation,</hi> would think of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:95208:30"/>
a fairer Construction upon many things
than now they do. And therefore I thought it
fittest to handle the <hi>Case</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> who
are either over-violent in these matters, without
ever considering them, or have met with ill-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structors,
who have not faithfully let them know
what the <hi>terms</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
were. For the <hi>Scruple</hi> of the <hi>Surplice</hi>
seems to be worn out; <hi>Kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is generally allowed by the more Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Non-conformists;</hi> and the only Scruple, as
to them, about <hi>the Sign of the Cross,</hi> is not,
whether it be lawful for the Minister to use it,
but <hi>whether it be lawful for them to offer
their Children to be Baptized where it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;</hi>
and, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> resolves the case;
<hi>Baptism is Gods Ordinance,</hi>

to the <hi>Use of the Liturgy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Defence of Cure of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis. Introd. p. 55.</note> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
saith, <hi>He that Separateth from all Churches

of our Liturgy, doth Separate
from them on a Reason Common to All,
<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:95208:30"/>
or almost All Christian Churches upon
Earth; the thoughts of which he is not
able to bear. And although the New Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi>
he saith, <hi>makes their Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Conformity harder than formerly;
yet the Peoples Conformity is the same
(if not easier, by some Amendments of
the Liturgy) as when Separation was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confuted by the Old Non-conformists.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib. &amp; p. 88.</note>
               <hi>And the most Learned and Worthy of
them,</hi> he saith, <hi>Wrote more against Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
than the Conformists: and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Non-conformists have not more Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Learning, or Holiness than they.
But,</hi> he saith, <hi>they did not only urge the
People against Separation, but to come to
the very beginning of the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
preferring it before their private
Duties.</hi> What ground was there now, to
make such a Hideous. Out-Cry about a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
which perswaded Men to no more,
than the Old Pious, and Peaceable <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi>
would have done; who talked
more sharply against the <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Mischief</hi> of
<hi>Separation,</hi> than I have done; as may be seen
in the <hi>First Part</hi> of the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lviii" facs="tcp:95208:31"/>
But as if they had been the <hi>Papists</hi> Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to execute the fury of their Wrath and
Displeasure against me, they Summon in the
Power of their Party, and resolve, with their
full might, to fall upon me. And, as if it
had not been enough to deal with me by open
Force, which is more Manly, and Generous;
they made use of mean and base Arts, by
Scurrilous <hi>Rimes,</hi> by Virulent and Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Libels</hi> sent to me without Names; by
Idle Stories, and False Suggestions, to rob
me at once, of my Reputation, and the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
of my Mind. But I thank <hi>God,</hi> I
despised such pittiful Artifices, and such
Vnmanly and Barbarous Usage; which made
no other Impression on my mind, but to make
me understand, that other Men could use me,
as Bad, or Worse, than the <hi>Papists.</hi> But
this brought to my Mind a Passage of <hi>Arch-Bishop
Whitgift,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> Whitgift'<hi>s Defence,</hi> &amp;c. p. 423.</note> concerning their Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
usage of <hi>Bishop Jewel;</hi> after he had so
stoutly defended this <hi>Church</hi> against the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.
But,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is their manner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you please their humor in all things,
though you otherwise deserve never so well,
all is nothing with them, but they will
Deprave you, Rail on you, Backbite you,
Invent Lies of you, and spread False Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
<pb n="lxix" facs="tcp:95208:31"/>
as though you were the Vilest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
upon Earth</hi> I could hardly have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
so ill a Character of Men pretending to
any kind of <hi>Religion,</hi> had I not found so
just a parallel; abating only the due allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that must be made as to my Case, with
respect to the far greater deserts of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
<hi>Bishop.</hi> But notwithstanding all
their hard Censures of me, I do assure them,
I am as firm a <hi>Protestant</hi> as ever I was, and
should be still as ready to Promote the <hi>Interest</hi>
of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> yea, and to do
any Real Kindness to the <hi>Dissenters</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that may be consistent with the <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Settlement</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
of our <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a while, they thought fit to draw their
Strength into open Field, and the <hi>First</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
against me, was Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> who treated
me with that Civility, and Decent Language,
that I cannot but Return him Thanks for it;
however, I was far from being satisfied with
his <hi>Reasoning,</hi> as will appear in the <hi>Book</hi> it
self. The next was Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who appeared
with so much Anger, and unbecoming Passion;
that I truly pittied him; and was so far from
being transported by it, that it was enough
to cure an inclination to an indecent passion, to
<pb n="lx" facs="tcp:95208:32"/>
see, how ill it became a Man of his Age, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and Reputation. At first he sent me
some Captious Questions for a Trial of Skill;
I Returned him Answer, <hi>They were not
to the business; but if he intended to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
my Sermon</hi> (as I perceived by his
<hi>Letter</hi> he was put upon it, and I knew how
hardly he could abstain from Writing however)
<hi>I desired him not to make too hasty a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi>
But he, who seldom takes the Advice of
his Friends, was, I suppose, the more provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
by this Good Counsel; and seems to have
Written his whole <hi>Book</hi> in one continued fit
of Anger; and by some <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Civility</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to himself, he published my Private <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
without so much as letting me know that
he intended it. Whatever Injurious and
Spiteful Reflections he hath made upon me
through his <hi>Book,</hi> I can more easily forgive
him, than he can forgive himself, when he
looks them over again with a better mind.
And therefore I pass over the <hi>Scurrility</hi> of his
<hi>Preface,</hi> wherein, after he hath in 20 <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>
described, the <hi>most Unskilful, Proud,
Partial, Obstinate, Cruel, Impertinent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries</hi>
he could think of <hi>places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
or <hi>Similitudes</hi> for, he then concludes;
<hi>But although all this be not the case of the
<pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:95208:32"/>
Reverend Doctor.</hi> What a malicious way
of Reproaching is this? To name so many
very ill things, and to leave it to the <hi>Reader</hi>
to apply as much as he pleases; and when he
is charged with any one to say, he meant not
that, for he added, <hi>although all this be not
the case of R. Dr.</hi> If this be the <hi>Justice,</hi>
the <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity</hi> of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and
his <hi>Brethren,</hi> who put him upon <hi>Writing,</hi>
they must give me leave to think, there are
some <hi>Non-conformist Ministers,</hi> that are not
<hi>the Wisest, the Meekest,</hi> nor <hi>the most Self-denying
Men upon Earth.</hi> He seems much
concerned about <hi>my being likely to have the
last Word:</hi> which I am very willing to let
him have, hoping he may come to himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he Dies; and may live to <hi>Repent</hi> of the
<hi>Injuries</hi> he hath done to his <hi>Brethren</hi> and the
<hi>Mischiefs</hi> he hath done to the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> by so industriously exposing the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi>
of it, and laying the <hi>Foundation</hi> for
<hi>Endless Separation,</hi> as will appear in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third who entred the Lists, was one,
who seemed to Write more like a Well-disposed
<hi>Gentleman,</hi> than like a <hi>Divine;</hi> he <hi>wishes</hi>
very well to the <hi>Cause</hi> he undertakes; he di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Gravely and Piously, without Bitterness
<pb n="lxii" facs="tcp:95208:33"/>
and Rancor, or any sharp Reflections, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with a great mixture of Kindness towards
one; for which, and his <hi>Prayers for me,</hi> I do
heartily Thank him. What I find Material to
the business in his <hi>Book,</hi> I have consider'd in
its due place.</p>
            <p>The Fourth comes forth with a more than
<hi>ordinary briskness;</hi> and seems to set up rather
for a sort of <hi>Wit,</hi> than a <hi>Grave Divine.</hi> His
<hi>Book</hi> resembled the <hi>Bird</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> for it seems
to be made up of <hi>Face</hi> and <hi>Feathers:</hi> For, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aside his Bold Sayings, his Impertinent
Triflings, his hunting up and down for any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of venting his little Stories and Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
there is very little of <hi>Substance</hi> left in him;
but what he hath borrowed from Dr. <hi>O.</hi> or
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Methinks, such a light, vain, scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Way of Writing, doth not become such a
<hi>Tenderness of Conscience</hi> as our <hi>Dissenting
Brethren</hi> pretend to. There is a sort of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness
of Wit which serves to entertain the
Reader in the rough and deep Way of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies;
but certainly there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Raillery and Good Humor of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and the Iests of Porters and Watermen. But
this <hi>Author</hi> seems to be Ambitious of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of a <hi>Second Martin,</hi> whose way he imitates,
and whose Wit he equals. Yet this is not his
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:95208:33"/>
greatest Fault, for he deals with me as a Man
that was by any means to be run down, without
regard to common Ingenuity. For, suppose <hi>I
had mistaken the Sense of my Text,</hi> which I
am certain I did not; yet I am not the only
Person in the World that Talks Impertinently.
Suppose <hi>there had been a Fault in my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,</hi>
methinks the sense of Humane Frailty
should make Men not grow Insolent upon such a
Discovery: and yet I do not know one thing
which he hath made it in; as will appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
But, Will nothing serve but to Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
me to the World as a kind of <hi>Atheistical
Hypocrite,</hi> i. e. as a secret underminer of the
<hi>proof of a Deity,</hi> under the pretence of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it? Yet, this he doth more than once: which
was so remote from his Business, that nothing but
a Wretched, Malicious Design of Exposing me,
could make him draw it in: He gives a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Touch at it in his <hi>Preface,</hi> to prepare the
Readers Appetite; but <hi>p.</hi> 70. he charges me
<hi>with proceeding upon such Principles, as
plainly render it impossible by any certain
Argument to prove the existence of a Deity.</hi>
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had unhappily said, and without the least
ground, <hi>that my Principles overthrow all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
and Mr. <hi>A.</hi> vouches it, and undertakes
to prove it for him. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> begins his Plea
<pb n="lxiv" facs="tcp:95208:34"/>
for Peace with a saying of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> (he
meant St. <hi>Hierom) that no Man ought to
be patient under the accusation of Heresy:</hi>
What should a Man then be under the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>being guilty of overthrowing all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and rendring it impossible, by any
certain Argument, to prove that there is a
God?</hi> According to all Rules of Iustice, a
Charge of so high a nature ought not to be
brought against any Man, without such evidence,
as appears clear and convincing to him
that brings it. But I very much mistrust in
this case, that Mr. <hi>A.</hi> in his Conscience knew,
his Proofs to be weak and insufficient; What
then can we think of him that charges another
with so high a Crime, when he knows that he
cannot prove it? His first Proof, he takes from
my <hi>Popish Adversaries, about the inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of proving a Deity, by such Infallible
Arguments, as must suppose the existence
of what we prove;</hi> as all <hi>infallibility</hi> from
<hi>Divine Assistance</hi> must do. But did I ever
say, there was no Certainty without Infallible As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance?
And yet this whole matter about <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Several Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, <hi>p.</hi> 258, &amp;c.</note>
as to the <hi>Proof of a God, and the
Christian Religion,</hi> I had so lately cleared in
my last Answer to the <hi>Papists,</hi> which he refers to
in this very place, that he could not but be
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:95208:34"/>
convinced of the Impertinency of it. His
Main Argument he pretends to bring from a
Principle of my own; for his words are,
<hi>He lays down this for a Principle, that
the Foundation of all Certainty lies in the
necessary Existence of a being Absolutely
Perfect; How then,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall we
come to prove his Existence by such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
Cui non potest subesse fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum?</hi>
And then he adds, <hi>That I have
excluded all Demonstration from the
Works of God, because we must first
know, that there is an invisible God,
before we can certainly know, that there
is a visible World.</hi> But if I make it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that I lay down no such <hi>Principles</hi>
of my own; and that I do particularly insist
upon the <hi>certainty of proving a God from
his Works,</hi> What doth this Man deserve for
his Calumnies?</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That which he saith I lay down
for a</hi> Principle, <hi>I only propose as an i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
from the</hi> Hypothesis <hi>of other Men.
For my words are,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Orig. Sucr.</hi> l. 2. ch. 8. p. 220.</note> And if that Principle
be supposed, as the foundation of all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Certainty, as to the Being of things,
that there is a God:—I say, if that
<pb n="lxvi" facs="tcp:95208:35"/>
Principle be supposed. <hi>From hence appears
a double Falsification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That I make it <hi>the Principle of all
certainty,</hi> whereas I expresly set down in their
Hypothesis <hi>Physical Certainty as to the being
of things;</hi> but, Is there no <hi>certainty</hi> but
what is <hi>Physical?</hi> What thinks he of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical,</hi>
or <hi>Metaphysical Certainty?</hi> so
that there might be a <hi>Mathematical</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical
Certainty</hi> of the <hi>Being of God,</hi>
though this <hi>Principle</hi> were allowed. How
then doth this prove, that <hi>I render it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
by any Certain Argument, to prove
the Existence of a Deity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That I make it <hi>a Principle of my own,</hi>
whereas I only suppose it as following from a
<hi>Principle</hi> of others. To clear this, it will be
necessary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> lay down the <hi>scope</hi> of that <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi>
which was to prove, that there is a
<hi>certainty of Faith, as well as of Sense;</hi> and
to that end I shewed from the nature of the
<hi>certainty of sense,</hi> that it doth fall short of
<hi>Mathematical Demonstrations;</hi> which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done from other Arguments, I then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> who derive <hi>all Physical
Certainty from the knowledge of God, who
<pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:95208:35"/>
will not suffer Mens Minds to be deceived in
clear perceptions;</hi> then from this Principle
being supposed, I infer several things for the
advantage of the <hi>certainty of Faith. 1. That
the Foundation of all Certainty,</hi> i. e. such
as was before spoken of, <hi>lies in the necessary
Existence of a being absolutely perfect.</hi> Which
I deduce as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>just inference</hi> from the former
<hi>Hypothesis;</hi> and therefore on this <hi>Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
something above our <hi>Comprehension,</hi> viz.
<hi>Absolute perfection,</hi> must be made the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
of our <hi>certain knowledge of things,</hi>
and so the <hi>difficulty</hi> of our <hi>conception</hi> of <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith,</hi> ought to be no hindrance to the
<hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> 2. That we have as great,
or greater reason to believe, that <hi>God</hi> will not
suffer us to be deceived in <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi>
as in the <hi>objects</hi> of our <hi>Senses</hi> because as I
there Argue, there is no sue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> great danger of
being deceived, or in being deceived in the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
of <hi>Sense,</hi> as in the <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> Let
any Man now Iudge, whether this be the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of one <hi>that rendred it impossible, by
any certain Argument, to prove the Existence
of a Deity?</hi> or that I laid down that as a
<hi>Principle of my own,</hi> from which being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
I deduce such <hi>inferences</hi> as prove the
<pb n="lxviii" facs="tcp:95208:36"/>
               <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> hath no greater difficulties,
than the <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I am so far from excluding the
<hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>Argument</hi> from <hi>the Works
of God to prove his Being,</hi> that I particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
and largely insist upon it from <hi>p.</hi> 401. to
<hi>p.</hi> 411. but he pretends <hi>that I bring no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
but from the Idea of God in our
minds,</hi> wich is so false, that</p>
            <p>(1.) <hi>I make use of that</hi> Argument <hi>only to
slex,</hi> that the notion of a God hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency
in it, nothing repugnant to the
faculties of our Minds: <hi>as appeas by that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
place he quotes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Orig. Sacr.</hi> p. 367, 368.</note>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) <hi>The main Arguments I insist upon, are,</hi>
That the things in the World are the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
effects of Divine Wisdom, Goodness
and Power: and that there be such things
in the World which are unacceptable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Deity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let any Man now Iudge, with what</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<hi>or</hi> ingenuity, <hi>this Man hath managed
such an</hi> Accusation <hi>against me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as that I go
upon such Principles, as plainly render it
impossible, by any certain Argument, to prove
the Existence of a Deity.</p>
            <p>But it may be he will pretend, that he did
<pb n="lxix" facs="tcp:95208:36"/>
not design to prove me <hi>Atheistical,</hi> but only to
shew, <hi>that I acted very unreasonably, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
a greater certainty in them, as to
the Principles of Separation, than I do allow
in far greater things.</hi> As to his design I
leave the <hi>Reader</hi> to Iudge by his way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in it. As to the colour he hath to bring
it in, on the account of the <hi>Grounds</hi> of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
it is only this; <hi>The Sub-Committee
of the Assembly arguing against the Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Brethren,</hi> saith he, <hi>I say, That such ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of Conscience, as ariseth out of an
Opinion (cui potest subesse falsum) which
may be false, is not a sufficient ground,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>to justifie Separation.</hi> But here is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the middle of a Sentence, which
made me look again into the <hi>Papers,</hi> and there I
find such words left out, as fully explain and
determine the sense; for the whole Sentence
runs thus.<note place="margin">Papers for Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, <hi>p.</hi> 51.</note> 
               <hi>We much doubt, whether such
tenderness of Conscience, as ariseth out of
an Opinion,</hi> Cui potest subesse falsum, <hi>when
the Conscience is so tender, as that it may
be withal an erring Conscience, can be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
ground to justifie such a material Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
as our Brethren plead for.</hi> Where
we see, the force is not laid upon the <hi>bare
possibility of Deception</hi> (for then no <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
               <pb n="lxx" facs="tcp:95208:37"/>
could be allowed in any case, since all
Men are <hi>fallible)</hi> but upon the <hi>supposition</hi>
of an <hi>actual deception,</hi> which an <hi>Erroneous
Conscience</hi> supposes. For it is such a <hi>decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
as doth suppose <hi>Tenderness of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
which doth not arise from a <hi>possibility</hi> of
<hi>being deceived,</hi> but from an <hi>Error of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>
The Plea is, <hi>Tenderness of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi>
the Question is, <hi>Whether this Plea
be sufficient to justifie Separation? We
much doubt it,</hi> say they, Why so? the other
Reply; <hi>Our Reason is, Because this Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
may arise from an Erroneous Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
But why should you suspect an Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Conscience in the Case? <hi>Because Persons
are liable to be deceived in the Dictates of
Conscience: especially when they go meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon their own apprehensions, without
producing Arguments ex Naturâ rei.</hi> For all
the debate between them about <hi>Tenderness of
Conscience</hi> proceeded upon this. So that
their meaning is not here to be taken as to the
bare <hi>possibility of deception,</hi> but of such an
Opinion, as carried a great <hi>probability</hi> along
with it, that they were <hi>actually deceived.</hi> And
what coherence is there now between this, and
the Proof that I bring for the <hi>Existence of a
Deity?</hi> so that, it is apparent, that this was
<pb n="lxxi" facs="tcp:95208:37"/>
an occasion sought after, to lay as much load up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me as he could. And by this tast let the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
Iudge, what <hi>Ingenuity</hi> I am to expect
from this Man.</p>
            <p>The Last who appeared against my <hi>Sermon</hi>
is called, <hi>the Author of the Christian Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
I was glad to find an <hi>Adversary</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that; having found so little of it in the
<hi>Answers</hi> of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>A.</hi> His business is,
<hi>To commit the Rector of Sutton with the
Dean of St. Paul's:</hi> which was enough to make
the Common People imagine, this was some bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
<hi>Justice</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> who had taken them both at
a <hi>Conventicle.</hi> The whole Design of that <hi>Book</hi>
doth not seem very agreeable to <hi>the Christian
Temper</hi> which the <hi>Author</hi> pretends to. For
it is to pick up all the Passages he could meet
with (in a Book written twenty years since)
with great tenderness towards the <hi>Dissenters,</hi>
before the <hi>Law's</hi> were <hi>Establish'd. As though,</hi>
as <hi>Mr Cotton</hi> once answered in a like case, <hi>there
were no weighty Argument to be found, but
what might be gather'd from the weakness
or unwariness of my Expressions.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer to <hi>R. Williams,</hi> p. 129.</note> And, Have
you not very well requited the <hi>Author</hi> of that
<hi>Book</hi> for the tenderness and pitty he had for
you, and the concernment he then expressed, to
have brought you i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, upon <hi>easier terms</hi> than
<pb n="lxxii" facs="tcp:95208:38"/>
were since required? And, Hath he now deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this at your hands, to have them all <hi>thrown
in his face,</hi> and to be thus upbraided with his
former kindness? Is this your <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> your
<hi>Gratitude,</hi> your <hi>Christian Temper?</hi> Are you
afraid of having too many <hi>Friends,</hi> that you thus
use those, whom you once took to be such?</p>
            <p>Methinks herein you appear very <hi>Self-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
but I cannot take you to be any of <hi>the
Wisest Men upon Earth.</hi> When you think
it reasonable, that upon longer time, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consideration, those <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
who then opposed <hi>Separation,</hi> should change
their Opinions; Will you not allow one <hi>single
Person,</hi> who happen'd to Write about these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
when he was <hi>very young;</hi> in <hi>twenty
years</hi> time of the most busie and thoughtful part
of his life, to see reason to alter his Iudgment?
But after all this, wherein is it that he hath
thus contradicted himself? Is it in the Point of
<hi>Separation,</hi> which is the present business? No,
so far from it, that in that very <hi>Book,</hi> he speaks
as fully concerning the <hi>Unlawfulness</hi> of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
as in this <hi>Sermon.</hi> Which will appear
by these particulars in it.</p>
            <p>(1.) That it is unlawful to set up new
Churches,<note place="margin">Irenic. p. 123.</note> because they cannot conform to
<pb n="lxxiii" facs="tcp:95208:38"/>
such practises which they suspect to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
            <p>(2.) Those are New Churches when Men
erect distinct Societies for Worship under
distinct and peculiar Officers, governing by
Laws, and Church Rules, different from that
form they separate from.</p>
            <p>(3.) <hi>As to things in the Judgment of the
Primitive and Reformed Churches left unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in'd
by the Law of God, and in matters
of meer order and decency, and wholly as to
the Form of Government, every one, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
what his private judgment may
be of them, is bound for the Peace of the
Church of God, to submit to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the lawful Governors of the Church.</hi>
Allow but these Three <hi>Conclusions,</hi> and defend
the present <hi>Separation</hi> if you can. Why then
do you make such a stir about other passages in
that <hi>Book,</hi> and take so little notice of these, which
are most pertinent and material? Was it not
possible for you to espy them, when you ransacked
every Corner of that <hi>Book,</hi> to find out some
thing which might seem to make to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
And yet the very first <hi>passage</hi> you quote
is within two Leaves of these;<note place="margin">Page 5.</note> and Two passages
more you soon after quote, are within a <hi>Page</hi> of
them;<note place="margin">Page 6, 7.</note> and another in the very <hi>same Page;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 8.</note>
               <pb n="lxxiv" facs="tcp:95208:39"/>
and so many up and down so very near them,
that it is impossible you should not see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them? <hi>Yes he hath at last found some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
very near them;</hi> for he quotes the very
Pages where they are. <hi>And,</hi> he saith, <hi>he will
do me no wrong, for I do distinguish, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses,
between Non-communion in unlawful
or suspected Rites or Practises in a Church,
and entering into distinct Societies for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
This is doing me some right however, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he doth not fully set down my meaning.
But he urges another passage in the same place,
viz. <hi>That if others cast them wholly out of
Communion, their Separation is necessary—</hi>
That is no more, than hath been always said by
our <hi>Divines</hi> in respect to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.
But, Will not this equally hold against our
Church, if it Excommunicates those who
cannot conform?</hi> I Answer, (1.) Our <hi>Church</hi>
doth not cast any <hi>wholly out of Communion</hi>
for meer <hi>Scrupulous Non-conformity</hi> in some
particular Rites. For, it allows them to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi>
in other <hi>parts of Worship;</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by all the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> of former
times, who constantly joyned in <hi>Prayers</hi> and
other <hi>Acts of Worship,</hi> although they scrupled
some particular Ceremonies. (2.) The case is
vastly different, as to the <hi>necessity</hi> of our <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi>
               <pb n="lxxv" facs="tcp:95208:39"/>
upon being <hi>wholly cast out</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
by the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of others <hi>Separating from us, supposing
a general Excommunication ipso facto</hi> against
those <hi>who publickly defame the Orders of
this Church</hi> For that is all which can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from the <hi>Canons.</hi> For, in the former
case, it is not a <hi>lesser Excommunication</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
as it is only in our case against <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and scandalous Offenders</hi> (which is no
more than is allowed in all <hi>Churches;</hi> and
is generally supposed to lay no obligation, till it
be duly executed, though it be <hi>latae sententiae
&amp; ipso facto)</hi> but in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
we are cast out with an <hi>Anathema,</hi> so as to
pronounce us <hi>uncapable of Salvation,</hi> if we do
not return to, and continue in their Communion;
and this was it which that <hi>Author</hi> meant, by
being <hi>wholly cast out of Communion,</hi> i. e.
with the greatest and highest <hi>Church Censure.</hi>
(3.) That <hi>Author</hi> could not possibly mean, that
there was an equal reason in these cases, when
he expresly determines, that in the case of our
<hi>Church, Men are bound in Conscience to
submit to the Orders of it;</hi> being only about
matters of <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> and such things
which in the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Primitive</hi> and
<hi>Reformed Churches</hi> are left undetermined by
<pb n="lxxvi" facs="tcp:95208:40"/>
the <hi>Law of God.</hi> Although therefore he might
allow a scrupulous forbearance of some <hi>Acts</hi> of
<hi>Communion,</hi> as to some <hi>suspected Rites,</hi> yet
upon the Principles there asserted, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
allow Mens proceedings to a <hi>Positive Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
from the <hi>Communion</hi> of our <hi>Church.</hi>
And so much shall serve to clear the Agreement
between the <hi>Rector</hi> of <hi>Sutton</hi> and the <hi>Dean</hi> of
St. <hi>Pauls.</hi> But if any thing in the following
<hi>Treatise,</hi> be found different from the sense of
that <hi>Book,</hi> I do intreat them to allow me that
which I heartily wish to them, <hi>viz.</hi> that in
<hi>Twenty years</hi> time we may arrive to such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
of thoughts, as to see reason to change our
opinion of <hi>some things;</hi> and I wish I had not
Cause to add, of <hi>some Persons</hi> too.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more which this <hi>Author</hi>
takes notice of, and the rest do not (for else
he offers little or nothing but what is in the
others) which is, that when I say our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
are condemned by the wiser Protestants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
he saith, <hi>if it be so, they may thank their
Friends at home, that have misrepresented
them to the World.</hi> Therefore, to give sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
as to the judgment of some of the
most eminent and learned <hi>Protestant Divines</hi>
abroad now-living, I have subjoyned to the
<hi>following Treatise,</hi> some late <hi>Letters</hi> of theirs,
<pb n="lxxvii" facs="tcp:95208:40"/>
to a <hi>Person</hi> of great <hi>Honor and Dignity</hi> in
our <hi>Church,</hi> to shew the <hi>Unlawfulness</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
from the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church
of England.</hi> Which were not written by such,
who had only a partial representation from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
at a distance, but two of them by those
who have been among us, and have been curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
observers both of the <hi>Separate Meetings</hi>
and of the <hi>Customs</hi> of our <hi>Churches;</hi> and the
Third by the Famous and Excellent <hi>Monsieur
Claude.</hi> And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a <hi>Council</hi> could be called
of all the <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> in <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
we should not doubt of their Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Unlawfulness</hi> of the <hi>Present Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But before I conclude this</hi> Preface, <hi>there is
a great</hi> Objection <hi>yet to be removed, which
concerns</hi> the Time of Publishing this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise;
which some do seem to think, to be
very unseasonable; when there is so much
talk of Union among Protestants, and there
appears a more General Inclination to it
than formerly. And what, <hi>say they,</hi> can the
laying open the Weakness of Dissenters
tend to, but to Provoke and Exasperate them,
and consequently to obstruct the Union so
much desired? In so doing, I shall appear to
resent more the Injuries done to my Self,
<pb n="lxxviii" facs="tcp:95208:41"/>
than the Mischief which may come to the
Protestant Religion, if this opportunity
be not embraced for making an Union
among Protestants. <hi>This is the force of the</hi>
Objection. <hi>To which I Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God forbid that I should either design, or
do any thing which tended to obstruct so Blessed
a Work, as a Firm and Lasting Vnion among
Protestants would be. But my Business is, to
shew the Vnreasonableness of those Principles
and Practises, which hinder Men from such an
Vnion, and lay a Foundation for Perpetual and
Endless Separations. For upon the Principles
laid down by some of our <hi>Dissenting Brethren,</hi>
let the Constitution be made never so easie to
themselves, yet others may make use of their
Grounds, and carry on the Differences as high
as ever. Which will render all Attempts of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
vain; and leave the same Weapons ready
to be taken up by others. If the Vnion so much
talked of, be such as tends to the lessening, and
not to the increasing of our Differences; if it be
for strengthning and supporting the Protestant
Religion, and not rather for weaking and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
it, by laying it more open to the
Assaults of our Enemies; no Man shall be
more ready to promote it than I; no Man
will rejoyce more in the Accomplishment of it:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxxix" facs="tcp:95208:41"/>
But universal liberty is quite another thing from
Union; as much as looseing is from binding up;
and it is strange if that which the <hi>Papists,</hi> not
long since, thought the best means to bring in
<hi>Popery,</hi> should now be looked on as the most
effectual way to keep it out. But suppose the
<hi>Indulgence</hi> be at present strictly limited to
<hi>Dissenting Protestants;</hi> are we sure it shall
always so continue? Will not the same Reasons, as
to scruple of Conscience, suffering for Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
extend farther when occasion serves, and the
<hi>Popish Religion</hi> get footing on the <hi>Dissenters
grounds?</hi> Where hath the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
more Labourers, and a greater harvest, than
under the greatest Liberty of Conscience? Let
the State of the <hi>Northern Kingdoms,</hi> as to
this matter, be Compared with the Number of
<hi>Papists</hi> in the <hi>United Provinces.</hi> And it
will be found impossible to Root out <hi>Popery,</hi>
where Toleration is allowed. <hi>(1)</hi> Because of
the various ways of creeping in under several
disguises, which the Priests and <hi>Jesuits</hi> have;
and can never be prevented, where there is a
general Indulgence for <hi>Dissenters,</hi> and an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<hi>Church Power</hi> is allowed to separate
<hi>Congregations. (2)</hi> Because it will be
thought great hardship, when Mens heats are
over, for them only to be deprived of the Liberty
<pb n="lxxx" facs="tcp:95208:42"/>
of their Consciences, when the wildest Fanaticks
are allowed it. <hi>(3)</hi> Because the diversity of
Sects which will be kept up by this means, will
be always thought a plausible argument to draw
Men to the <hi>Popish pretences</hi> of <hi>Unity. (4)</hi>
Because the allowed Sects will in probability grow
more insolent upon a <hi>Legal Indulgence,</hi> and bid
defiance to the settled Constitution; as we have
seen already by the yet visible effects of the former
<hi>Indulgence.</hi> If Laws would alter the temper
of Mens minds, and make proud, selfwilled,
froward and passionate Men, become meek, and
humble, gentle and peaceable, then it were great
pitty, some Men had not had the Law on their side
long ago. But is this to be looked for? are we to
expect the Laws of Men should work more upon
them than the Grace of God? If such then
continue peevish and quarelsome, full of wrath
and bitterness against all that are not of their
minds; and they meet with Men as froward and
contentious as themselves; will this look like
the <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Protestants?</hi> And By-standers
will be apt to say, if this be all that you mean by
<hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Protestants, viz.</hi> a Liberty to <hi>Pray</hi>
and <hi>Preach,</hi> and to <hi>Write</hi> and <hi>Dispute</hi> one
against another, there seems to be much more of
sense and reason in the <hi>Papal</hi> pretence to <hi>Unity</hi>
and <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxxxi" facs="tcp:95208:42"/>
But what then? Is there nothing to be
done for Dissenting Protestants, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with us in all Doctrinal Articles of
our Church; and only scruple the use
of a few Ceremonies, and some late
Impositions? shall these differences still be
continued, when they may be so easily
removed? And so many useful Men be
incouraged and taken into the Constitution?
Do we value a few indifferent Ceremonies,
and some late Declarations, and doubtful
expressions, beyond the satisfaction of Mens
Consciences, and the Peace and Stability
of this Church?</p>
            <p>As to this material Question, I shall crave
leave to deliver my opinion freely and impartially;
and that,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> With respect to the Case of the People;
the Terms of whose <hi>Union</hi> with us, is acknowledged
by our Brethren to be so much easier than their
own. But these are of two sorts:</p>
            <p>1. Some allow the use of the Liturgy,
but say they cannot joyn in Communion
with us, because the participation of the
Sacraments hath such Rites and Ceremonies
annexed to it, which they think unlawful;
and therefore till these be removed or left
indifferent, they dare not joyn with us in
<pb n="lxxxii" facs="tcp:95208:43"/>
Baptism or the Lords Supper; because in
the one the Cross is used, and in the other
Kneeling is required. <hi>As to these I answer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1) Upon the most diligent search, I could make
into these things, I find no good ground for any scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Conscience, as to the use of these Ceremonies;
and as little as any as to the Sign of the Cross, as it
is used in our <hi>Church;</hi> notwithstanding all the
noise that hath been made about its being a <hi>New
Sacrament,</hi> and I know not what, but of this at
large in the following Treatise.</p>
            <p>(2) I see no ground for the Peoples separation
from other Acts of Communion, on the account
of some Rites they suspect to be unlawful. And
especially when the use of such Rites is none of
their own Act, as the <hi>Cross</hi> in <hi>Baptism</hi> is
not; and when such an Explication is annexed
concerning the intention of <hi>Kneeling of the
Lords Supper,</hi> as is in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> after
the <hi>Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3) Notwithstanding, because the use of
<hi>Sacraments</hi> in a <hi>Christian Church</hi> ought to be
the most free from all exceptions, and they ought
to be so Administred, as rather to invite than dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
scrupulous Persons from joyning in them; I
do think it would be a part of <hi>Christian Wisdom</hi>
and Condescension in the Governours of our
<hi>Church,</hi> to remove those Bars from a freedom
<pb n="lxxxiii" facs="tcp:95208:43"/>
in joyning in full Communion with us, which
may be done, either by wholly taking away
<hi>the Sign of the Cross;</hi> or if that may give
offence to others, by confining the use of it to
the publick administration of <hi>Baptism;</hi> or by
leaving it indifferent, as the Parents desire
it. As to <hi>Kneeling at the Lords Supper,</hi>
since some Posture is necessary, and many
devout People scruple any other, and the
<hi>Primitive Church</hi> did in antient times,
receive it in the Posture of Adoration; there
is no Reason to take this away, even in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Churches; provided, that those who
scruple Kneeling do receive it, with the least
offence to others, and rather standing than
sitting, because the former is most agreeable to the
practise of Antiquity, and of our Neighbour
Reformed Churches. As to the <hi>Surplice</hi> in
<hi>Parochial Churches,</hi> it is not of that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
as to bear a Dispute one way or other.
And as to Cathedral Churches, there is no
necessity of alteration. But there is another
thing which seems to be of late much scrupled
in Baptism, <hi>viz. the Use of God-fathers
and God-mothers excluding the Parents.</hi>
Although I do not question but the Practice of
our Church may be justified (as I have done
it towards the End of the following Treatise)
<pb n="lxxxiv" facs="tcp:95208:44"/>
yet I see no necessity of adhering so strictly to
the <hi>Canon</hi> herein, but that a little alteration
may prevent these scruples, either by permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Parents to joyn with the Sponsors,
or by the Parents publickly desiring the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
to represent them in offering the Child to
Baptism; or, which seems most agreeable to
Reason, that the Parents offer the Child to
Baptism, and then the Sponsors perform the
Covenanting part, representing the Child; and
the charge after Baptism be given in common
to the Parents and Sponsors.</p>
            <p>These things being allowed, I see no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
remaining, as to a full <hi>Union</hi> of the
Body of such Dissenters with us, in all Acts of
Divine Worship, and Christian <hi>Communion,</hi>
as do not reject all <hi>Communion</hi> with us as
unlawful.</p>
            <p>2. But because there are many of those,
who are become zealous Protestants, <hi>and plead
much their Communion with us in Faith
and Doctrine, although they cannot joyn
with us in Worship, because they deny the
lawfulness of Liturgies, and the right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of our Churches;</hi> their case de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
some consideration, whether and how
far they are capable of being made serviceable
to the common Interest, and to the Support of
the Protestant Religion among us?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxxxv" facs="tcp:95208:44"/>
To their <hi>Case</hi> I answer,</p>
            <p>First, That a general <hi>unlimited Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to <hi>dissenting Protestants,</hi> will soon bring
<hi>Confusion</hi> among us, and in the end <hi>Popery,</hi>
as I have shewed already; and a suspension of
all the penal Laws that relate to Dissenters is
the same thing with a <hi>boundless Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If any present Favours be granted
to such, in consideration of our circumstances,
and to prevent their conjunction with the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
for a <hi>general Toleration,</hi> (for if ever
the <hi>Papists</hi> obtain it, it must be under their
Name) if, I say, such favour be thought fit
to be shewed them, it ought to be with such
restrictions and limitations, as may prevent
the Mischief which may easily follow upon it.
For all such Meetings are a perpetual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to our Churches, by their declaring,
that <hi>our Churches are no true Churches,</hi>
that <hi>our Manner of Worship is unlawful,</hi>
and that <hi>our Church-Government is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian;</hi>
and that <hi>on these accounts they
separate from us, and worship God by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
But if such an <hi>Indulgence</hi> be thought
fit to be granted, I humbly offer these things to
consideration.</p>
            <p>1. That none be permitted to enjoy the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of it, who do not declare, <hi>that they
<pb n="lxxxvi" facs="tcp:95208:45"/>
do hold Communion with our Churches to
be unlawful.</hi> For it seems unreasonable to
allow it to others, and will give countenance
to endless and causeless Separations.</p>
            <p>2. That all who enjoy it, besides taking the
<hi>Test</hi> against <hi>Popery,</hi> do subscribe the 36
<hi>Articles</hi> of our Faith, because the pretence
of this Liberty is joyning with us in <hi>Points</hi>
of <hi>Faith;</hi> and this may more probably prevent
<hi>Papists</hi> getting in amongst them.</p>
            <p>3. That all such as enjoy it, must declare
the particular Congregations they are of, and
enter their Names before such <hi>Commissioners</hi>
as shall be authorised for that purpose; that
so this may be no pretence for idle, loose, and
profane persons, never going to any Church
at all.</p>
            <p>4. That both Preachers and Congregations
be liable to severe penalties, if they use any
bitter or reproachful words, either in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
or Writings, against the established Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of our Churches; because they desire
only the freedom of their own Consciences;
and the using this liberty will discover, it is
not Conscience, but a turbulent factions humour,
which makes them separate from our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>5. That all indulged Persons be particularly
<pb n="lxxxvii" facs="tcp:95208:45"/>
obliged to pay all legal Duties to the Parochial
Churches (lest meer covetousness tempt Men
to run among them) and no persons so indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
be capable of any publick Office. It not
being reasonable, that such should be trusted
with Government, who look upon the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
established by Law as unlawful.</p>
            <p>6. That no other penalty be laid on such
indulged persons, but that of <hi>Twelve Pence</hi>
a Sunday for their absence from the <hi>Parochial
Churches,</hi> which ought to be duly collected
for the Vse of the Poor, and cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of as any heavy Burden, considering
the <hi>Liberty</hi> they do enjoy by it.</p>
            <p>7. That the <hi>Bishops,</hi> as <hi>Visitors</hi> appointed
by Law, have an exact Account given to them,
of the Rule of their <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi>
and of all the persons belonging to the
indulged Congregations, with their Qualities
and Places of Abode; and that none be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a Member of any such Congregation
without acquainting their <hi>Visitor</hi> with it,
that so means may be used to prevent their
leaving our <hi>Communion,</hi> by giving satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to their scruples. This <hi>Power</hi> of the
<hi>Bishops</hi> cannot be scrupled by them, since
herein they are considered as <hi>Commissioners</hi>
appointed by <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxxxviii" facs="tcp:95208:46"/>
8. That no indulged persons presume under
severe penalties to breed up <hi>Scholars,</hi> or to
teach Gentlemens Sons <hi>University Learning;</hi>
because this may be justly looked on as a design
to propagate <hi>Schism</hi> to <hi>Posterity,</hi> and to lay
a <hi>Foundation</hi> for the disturbance of <hi>future
Generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. As to the <hi>Case</hi> of the <hi>ejected Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi>
I have these things to offer,</p>
            <p>1. That bare <hi>subscription</hi> of the <hi>Thirty
six Articles</hi> concerning <hi>doctrinal Points,</hi> be
not allowed as sufficient to qualifie any man for
a <hi>Living,</hi> or any <hi>Church-preferment,</hi> for
these Reasons,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Any <hi>Lay-man</hi> upon these Terms may
not only be capable of a <hi>Living,</hi> but may take
upon him to <hi>Administer the Sacraments;</hi>
which was never allowed in any well constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Christian World.</hi> And
such an allowance among us, in stead of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and uniting us, will immediately bring
things into great <hi>confusion,</hi> and give mighty
advantage to the <hi>Papists</hi> against our <hi>Church.</hi>
And we have reason to fear, a Design of this
Nature, under a pretence of <hi>Union of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
tends to the subversion of this
<hi>Church,</hi> and throwing all things into <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,</hi>
which at last will end in <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxxxix" facs="tcp:95208:46"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This will bring a <hi>Faction</hi> into
the <hi>Church,</hi> which will more endanger it
than external opposition. For such Men will
come in triumphantly, having beaten down
<hi>three</hi> of the <hi>Thirty nine Articles;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in legal possession of their Places, will be
ready to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fie and contemn those who submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the rest, and to glory in their Conquests,
and draw Followers after them, as the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Confessors against <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi>
And can they imagin those of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> will see the Reputation
of the <hi>Church,</hi> or their <hi>own,</hi> to suffer so
much, and not appear in their own <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</hi>
Things are not come to that pass, nor
will they suddenly be, that the <hi>Friends</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> will be either afraid,
or ashamed to own her Cause. We do heartily
and sincerely desire <hi>Union</hi> with our Brethren,
if it may be had on just and reasonable Terms;
but they must not think, that we will give up
the <hi>Cause of the Church</hi> for it, so as to
condemn its <hi>Constitution,</hi> or make the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
unlawful,</hi> which have been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
observed and practised in it. If any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
can be found out for the ease of other
Mens Consciences, without reflecting on our
own; if they can be taken in, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="xc" facs="tcp:95208:47"/>
or dishonour to the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the
<hi>Church;</hi> I hope no true Son of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> will oppose it. But if the Design
be to bring them in as a <hi>Faction</hi> to bridle and
controll the <hi>Episcopal Power,</hi> by setting up
<hi>forty Bishops</hi> in a Diocese against <hi>one;</hi> if it
be for them to trample upon the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> and not to submit to its <hi>Order</hi> and
<hi>Government</hi> upon fair and moderate terms,
let them not call this a Design of <hi>Union,</hi> but
the giving <hi>Law</hi> to a <hi>Party</hi> to oppose the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And what the success
of this will be, let wise Men judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If a <hi>subcription</hi> to <hi>Thirty six
Articles</hi> were sufficient by the Statute 13 <hi>El.
c.</hi> 12. I do not understand how by virtue of that
Statute a Man is bound publickly to read the
<hi>Thirty nine Articles in the Church, and the
Testimonial of his Subscription, on pain
of being deprived</hi> ipso facto, <hi>if he do not.</hi>
For the L. Ch. I. <hi>Coke</hi> faith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Co.</hi> Iast. 4. Part. 323, 324.</note> 
               <hi>That subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the 39 Articles is required by force of
of the Act of Parliament 13 Eliz. c.</hi> 12.
And he adds, <hi>That the Delinquent is disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and deprived</hi> ipso facto; <hi>and that a
conditional subscription to them was not
sufficient, was resolved by all the Judges
in</hi> England. But how a Man should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="xci" facs="tcp:95208:47"/>
               <hi>ipso facto,</hi> for not subscribing, and
Reading the 39 Articles, as appears by the Cases
mentioned in <hi>Coke;</hi> and yet be required onely to
subscribe to 36, by the same <hi>Statute,</hi> is a thing
too hard for me to conceive.</p>
            <p>2. But notwithstanding this, if any temper
can be found out, as to the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that may give ease to the <hi>scruples</hi> of
our Brethren, and secure the <hi>Peace</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> the desired <hi>Union</hi> may be attained
without that apparent danger of increasing the
Factions among us.</p>
            <p>And this I suppose may be done, by an absolute
subscription to all those <hi>Articles</hi> which concern
<hi>the Doctrine of the true Christian Faith,
and the Use of the Sacraments;</hi> and a
<hi>solemn Promise under their hand, or
Subscription of Peaceable submission,</hi>
as to the rest, so as not to oppose or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
them, either in <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Writing;</hi>
upon the same penalty as if they had not subscribed
to the 36. Which may be a more probable means
to keep the <hi>Church</hi> in quiet, than forceing a
more rigorous <hi>subscription</hi> upon them, or leaving
them at their full liberty.</p>
            <p>3. As to the other <hi>subscription</hi> required,
1. <hi>Jac.</hi> to the 3 <hi>Articles.</hi> The first is provided
for, by <hi>the Oaths of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</hi>
               <pb n="xcii" facs="tcp:95208:48"/>
The third is the same with the
<hi>subscription</hi> to the 39 <hi>Articles.</hi> And as to
the second, <hi>about the Book of Common
Prayer, &amp;c.</hi> It ought to be considered,</p>
            <p>(1) Whether, for the satisfaction of the
scrupulous, some more doubtful and obscure
passages may not yet be explained or amended?
Whether the <hi>New Translation</hi> of the <hi>Psalms</hi>
were not fitter to be used, at least in <hi>Parochial
Churches?</hi> Whether <hi>portions</hi> of <hi>Canonical
Scripture</hi> were not better put in stead of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crypha
Lessons?</hi> Whether the <hi>Rubrick</hi> about
<hi>Salvation of Infants,</hi> might not be restored
to its former place, in the <hi>Office of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
and so the present exceptions against
it be removed? Whether those expressions which
suppose the strict exercise of <hi>Discipline,</hi> in
<hi>Burying the Dead,</hi> were not better left at
liberty in our present Case? Such a <hi>Review</hi>
made by <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Peaceable Men,</hi> not given
to <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Disputing,</hi> may be so far from
being a dishonour to this Church, that it may add
to the Glory of it.</p>
            <p>(2) Upon such a <hi>Review,</hi> whether it be not
great <hi>Reason</hi> that all Persons who Officiate in the
Church, be not only tied to a constant <hi>Use</hi> of it in
<hi>all Publick Offices;</hi> (as often as they admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
them) which they ought in Person frequently
<pb n="xciii" facs="tcp:95208:48"/>
to do, but to declare at their first entrance
upon a <hi>Parochial Charge,</hi> their <hi>approbation</hi>
of the <hi>Use</hi> of it, after their own <hi>Reading</hi> of
it, that so the <hi>People</hi> may not suspect them to
carry on a factious Design, under an outward
pretence of <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Rules</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> they live in.</p>
            <p>(3) Whether such a solemn <hi>Using</hi> the <hi>Liturgy,</hi>
and <hi>approbation</hi> and <hi>promise</hi> of the <hi>Use</hi> of
it, may not be sufficient, in stead of the late
<hi>Form</hi> of declaring <hi>their Assent and Consent,</hi>
which hath been so much <hi>scrupled</hi> by our
Brethren?</p>
            <p>These are all the things which appear to me
reasonable to be allowed in order to an <hi>Union,</hi>
and which I suppose may be granted without
detriment or dishonour to our <hi>Church.</hi> There
are other things very desireable towards the
<hi>happiness</hi> and <hi>flourishing</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi>
as the exercise of <hi>Discipline</hi> in <hi>Parochial
Churches,</hi> in a due subordination to the <hi>Bishop;</hi>
the <hi>Reforming</hi> the <hi>Ecclesiastical Courts</hi> as
to <hi>Excommunication,</hi> without prejudice to the
excellent <hi>Profession</hi> of the <hi>Civil Law;</hi> the
Building of more <hi>Churches</hi> in great <hi>Parishes,</hi>
especially about the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> the
retrenching <hi>Pluralities;</hi> the strictness and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of <hi>Ordinations;</hi> the making a <hi>Book</hi>
               <pb n="xciv" facs="tcp:95208:49"/>
of <hi>Canons</hi> suitable to this Age, for the better
Regulating the <hi>Conversations</hi> of the <hi>Clergy.</hi>
Such things as these, might facilitate our <hi>Union,</hi>
and make our <hi>Church</hi> in spite of all its Enemies
become a <hi>Praise in the whole Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Zeal I have for the <hi>true Protestant
Religion,</hi> for the <hi>Honour</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi>
and for a firm <hi>Union</hi> among <hi>Brethren,</hi> hath
Transported me beyond the bounds of a <hi>Preface;</hi>
Which I do now conclude with my hearty Prayers
to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> that he, who is <hi>the God
of Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Fountain of Wisdom,</hi>
would so direct the Counsels of those in Authority,
and incline the hearts of the People, that we
may neither run into a <hi>Wilderness</hi> of <hi>Confusion,</hi>
nor be driven into the <hi>Abysse</hi> of <hi>Popery;</hi> but
that the <hi>true Religion</hi> being preserved among us,
we may with one heart and mind serve the <hi>only
true God,</hi> through his only Son <hi>Jesus Christ
the Prince of Peace,</hi> and our <hi>alone Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and Mediator.</hi> Amen.</p>

the <hi>State</hi> of this <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi>
it will be necessary to
Premise these Two Things.</p>
                  <p>1. That although the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Reasons for Separation
would have held from the beginning of our Reformation,
yet, no such thing was then practised, or allowed, by
those who were then most zealous for Reformation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95208:54"/>
2. That when Separation began, it was most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
opposed by those Non-conformists who disliked ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in our Church, and wished for a farther Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
<hi>And from a</hi> true Account of the State <hi>of the</hi>
Controversie <hi>then, it will appear, that the</hi> Principles
<hi>owned by them, do overthrow the present practise
of</hi> Separation <hi>among us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the making out of these, I shall give a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of this <hi>Controversie</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Communion</hi> of our <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I. <hi>That although the present Reasons for Separation
would have held from the beginning of the Reformation,
yet no such thing was then practised, or allowed by those
who were then most zealous for Reformation.</hi> By <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
we mean nothing else, but <hi>Withdrawing from
the constant Communion of our Church, and Ioyning
with Separate Congregations for greater Purity of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and better means of Edification.</hi> By <hi>the present
Reasons for Separation</hi> we understand such as are at
this day insisted on, by those who pretend to justifie
these Practises; and those are such, as make the
<hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> with our <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>be unlawful.</hi>
And not one of all those, which my Adversaries at
this time hope to Justifie the <hi>present Separation</hi> by,
but would have had as much force in the beginning
of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> For our <hi>Church</hi> stands on the
same Grounds; useth the same Ceremonies (only
fewer;) prescribes the same Liturgy (only more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected;)
hath the same constitution and frame of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
the same defect of Discipline; the same
manner of appointing Parochial Ministers; and at
least as effectual means of Edification, as there were
when the <hi>Reformation</hi> was first established. And
what advantage there is, in our present circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95208:54"/>
as to the Number, Diligence and Learning of
our Allowed Preachers; as to the Retrenching of
some Ceremonies, and the Explication of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of others; as to the Mischiefs we have seen
follow the practice of <hi>Separation,</hi> do all make it
much more unreasonable now, than it had been
then.</p>

but they were such things, as are the
least scrupled now.<note place="margin">

disliked some things in the first <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi>

there seemed to be little or no dissatisfaction left
in the Members of our Church; at least, as to those
things which are now made the <hi>grounds</hi> of <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
For we read of none, who refused <hi>the constant
use of the Liturgy,</hi> or to comply with those very few
Ceremonies which were retained, as <hi>the Cross in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and Kneeling at the Communion,</hi> which are
now thought such <hi>Bugbears</hi> to scare People from our
<hi>Communion,</hi> and make them cry out in such a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
manner of the <hi>Mischief of Impositions;</hi> as though
the Church must unavoidably be broken in pieces by

<hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> which were imposed by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
and other Reformers, and which are only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
by us, do, as this <hi>Author</hi> saith, <hi>Create a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Separation;</hi> how then it came to pass, that
in all King <hi>Edward</hi>'s dayes, there was no such thing
as Division in our Church about them?</p>
                  <p>And even Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> who searched as carefully as
any into this matter,<note place="margin">Fresh suit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, <hi>p.</hi> 467.</note> can bring no other Instances of
any differences then, but those of <hi>Rogers</hi> and <hi>Hooper:</hi>
he adds indeed, <hi>That</hi> Ridley <hi>and others agreed with</hi>
Hooper. Wherein? What, in opposing our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
when <hi>Hooper</hi> himself yielded in that which he
at first scrupled? <hi>No, but there was a perfect reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
between them, before they suffered.</hi> And what
then? Is there any the least colour of Evidence, that
before that Reconciliation, either <hi>Hooper</hi> or <hi>Rogers</hi>
held Separate Assemblies from the Conformists, or
that <hi>Ridley</hi> ever receded from his stedfast adhering
to the <hi>Orders</hi> of this <hi>Church?</hi> This is then a very
mean Artifice, and disingenuous Insinuation. For
although <hi>Ridley,</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Hooper,</hi> out of his
great Modesty and Humility, seems to take the
blame upon himself, by attributing the greater <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95208:55"/>
to <hi>Hooper</hi> in that difference; yet he doth not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
his Opinion, but only declares the hearty love
that he bore to him for his constancy in the Truth.
Neither do we find that ever <hi>Hooper</hi> repented of his
Subm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a far better man than to do so. But if the whole

miscarry in a matter of such might importance to
the Souls of Men? Could not <hi>Latimer,</hi> or <hi>Bradford,</hi>
or such holy and mortified men as they, discern so
much as a <hi>Mote</hi> of <hi>unlawfulness</hi> in those times, which
others espy such <hi>Beams</hi> in now? What makes this
wonderful difference of eye-sight? Were they
under a cloudy, and dark, and <hi>Iewish</hi> Dispensation;

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95208:56"/>
and zeal for Religion, who burnt at the Stake for it?
Doth God reveal his Will to the meek, the humble,
the inquisitive, the resolute Minds? And would he
conceal such weighty things from those who were so

The true ground whereof is commonly much

between those which strove for the</hi> English <hi>Liturgy, and
others that were for a free-way of praying,</hi> i.e. as he
explains it, <hi>from the present sense and habit of the
Speaker:</hi> but that this is a great mistake, will appear
from the account published of them, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1575. by
one that was a Friend to the Dissenting Party. From
which it appears, That no sooner were the <hi>English</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at <hi>Frankford,</hi> but the Minister of the <hi>French
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95208:57"/>
Congregation</hi> there, came to them and told them, he
had obtained from the Magistrates the freedom of a
Church for those who came out of <hi>England,</hi> but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for the <hi>French;</hi> they thanked him and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi>
for so much kindness, but withal let them
understand this would be little benefit to the <hi>English,</hi>
unless they might have the liberty of performing all
the Offices of Religion in their own Tongue Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an Address made to the Senate, this request was
granted them; and they were to make use of the
<hi>French Church</hi> at different times, as the <hi>French</hi> and
they could agree, but with this express <hi>Proviso, that
they should not dissent from the French in Doctrine, or
Ceremonies, lest they should thereby Minister occasion of
offence.</hi> But afterwards, it seems, the Magistrates did
not require them to be strictly tied up <hi>to the French
Ceremonies, so they did mutually agree.</hi> Upon this,
they perused the <hi>English Order,</hi> and endeavour'd to
bring it as near as they could to the <hi>French Model,</hi> by
leaving out the <hi>Responses,</hi> the <hi>Letany, Surplice,</hi> and
many other things; and adding a larger <hi>Confession,
more suitable to the State and Time;</hi> after which a
<hi>Psalm</hi> was Sung; then the <hi>Minister,</hi> after a short
Prayer for Divine Assistance (according to <hi>Calvins
Custom)</hi> was to proceed to the <hi>Sermon;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ended, then followed a <hi>General Prayer for all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,</hi>
particularly for <hi>England,</hi> ending with the
<hi>Lords Prayer;</hi> and so repeating the <hi>Articles of the
Creed,</hi> and another <hi>Psalm</hi> Sung, the People were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
with the Blessing. By which we see, here
was not the least controversie, <hi>whether a Liturgy or
not;</hi> but whether the <hi>Order of Service</hi> was not to be
accommodated, as much as might be, to the <hi>French
Model.</hi> However, when they sent to the <hi>English</hi> in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95208:58"/>
other places to resort thither, by reason of the great
Conveniencies they enjoy'd, and acquainted them
with what they had done; it gave great offence to
them, which they expressed in their Letters. Those
of <hi>Zurick</hi> sent them word, <hi>They determined to use no
other Order, than that which was last established in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
and in another Letter, <hi>They desire to be assured
from them, that if they removed thither, they should all joyn
in the same Order of Service concerning Religion, which
was in</hi> England <hi>last set forth by King</hi> Edward. To
this the <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Frankford</hi> returned Answer,
<hi>That they could not, in all points, warrant the Full Vse
of the Book of Service, which they impute to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Circumstances, in which they suppose such Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
would be allowed; but they intended not hereby to
deface the worthy Lawes and Ordinances of King</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
These Learned Men of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their resolutions, send <hi>Grindall</hi> to them with a
<hi>Letter</hi> subscribed by 16; wherein they intreat them,
<hi>To reduce the English Church there, as much as possible,
to the Order lately set forth in</hi> England, <hi>lest,</hi> say they,
<hi>by much altering of the same, they should seem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the chief Authors thereof, who, as they now suffer,
so are they most ready to confirm that fact with the
price of their Bloods; and should also both give occasion
to our Adversaries to accuse our Doctrine of Imperfection,
and us of Mutability; and the Godly to Doubt of that
Truth wherein before they were perswaded, and to hinder
their coming thither, which before they had purposed.</hi>
And to obtain their desire, they tell them, <hi>They had
sent Persons for that end to Negotiate this Affair with
the Magistrates, and, in case they obtained their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
they promised to come and joyn with them; and
they did not question the English in other places would
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95208:58"/>
do the same.</hi> Notwithstanding the weight of these
Reasons, and the desireableness of their Brethrens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in that time of Exile, they persist in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
resolutions, not to have the <hi>Entire English Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;</hi>
for by this time <hi>Knox</hi> was come from <hi>Geneva,</hi>
being chosen <hi>Minister of the Congregation:</hi> However,
they returned this Answer to <hi>Strasburg, That they
made as little Alteration as was possible;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 19.</note> 
                     <hi>for, certain Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
the Country would not bear; and they did not
dissent from those which lie at the Ransom of their
Bloods for the Doctrine, whereof they have made a most
worthy Confession.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 21.</note> About this time, some suggested,
that they should take the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Geneva, as far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
from Superstition;</hi> but <hi>Knox</hi> declined this, till
they had advised with the Learned Men at <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,
Zurick, Emden,</hi> &amp;c. knowing, that the <hi>Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
of it would be thrown upon him. But finding
their Zeal and Concernment for the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi>
he, with <hi>Whittingham,</hi> and some others, drew up an
<hi>Abstract</hi> of it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Calvin,</hi> Ep. 164.</note> and sent it to <hi>Calvin,</hi> desiring his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it. Who, upon perusal of it, being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heated in a Cause, that so nearly concerned him,
writes a very sharp Letter, directed to the <hi>Brethren
at Frankford;</hi> gently Rebuking them for their <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
Contentions about these matters,</hi> but severely
Reproving the <hi>English Divines</hi> who stood up for the
<hi>English Liturgy,</hi> when the <hi>Model</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi> stood in
Competition with it. And yet after all his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of it, he Confesses. The things he thought
<hi>most unfit,</hi> were <hi>Tolerable;</hi> but he blames them, <hi>if
they did not choose a better, when they might choose;</hi>
but he gives not the least incouragement to <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
if it were continued; and he declares for his own
part, <hi>how easie he was to yield, in all indifferent things,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95208:59"/>
such as External Rites are.</hi> And he was so far, in his
Judgment, from being for <hi>Free Prayer,</hi> or making
<hi>the constant use of a Liturgy a Ground of Separation,</hi>
as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> doth, that when he delivered his Opinion,
with the greatest Freedom, to the then <hi>Protector,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the best method of <hi>Reformation,</hi> he declares,
<hi>That he did mightily approve a Certain Form, from which
Men ought not to vary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ep. 55.</note> 
                     <hi>both to prevent the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
which some Mens folly would betray them to,</hi> in
the free way of Praying; <hi>and to manifest the General
Consent of the Churches in their Prayers; and to stop
the vain affectation of some who love to be shewing some
new things.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> now Judge, Whether it
were likely that the <hi>Controversie</hi> then at <hi>Frankford,</hi>
was, as he saith, between them that were for the <hi>English
Liturgy,</hi> and others that were for a <hi>free way of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
when <hi>Calvin,</hi> to whom the <hi>Dissenters</hi> appealed,
was so much, in his Judgment, against the latter.
And it appears,<note place="margin">Ep. 165.</note> by <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Cox and his
Brethren,</hi> that the State of the Case at <hi>Frankford</hi> had
not been truly represented to him; which made him
Write with greater sharpness than otherwise he would
have done; and he expresses his satisfaction, that the
matter was so composed among them, when by Dr.
<hi>Cox</hi> his means, the <hi>English Liturgy</hi> was brought
into use at <hi>Frankford.</hi> And to excuse himself for
his liberal censures before, he mentions <hi>Lights,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by the Book, which were not in the second
<hi>Liturgy</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth. So that either they
deceived him, who sent him the <hi>Abstract;</hi> or he was
put to this miserable shift to defend himself; the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being ended contrary to his expectation. For,
although upon the receipt of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Letter, the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of <hi>Geneva</hi> had like to have been presently voted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95208:59"/>
in,<note place="margin">Tr. of Fr. p. 30.</note> yet there being still some Fast Friends to the <hi>English
Service,</hi> they were fain to compromise the matter,
and to make use of a Mixt Form for the present.
But, Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> and others, coming thither from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and misliking these Alterations, declared. That
they were for having <hi>the Face of an English Church</hi>
there;<note place="margin">Page 31.</note> and so they began the <hi>Letany</hi> next <hi>Sunday;</hi>
which put <hi>Knox</hi> into so great a Rage, that in stead
of pursuing his <hi>Text</hi> (which was directly contrary)
he made it his business, <hi>to lay open the nakedness of
our Church,</hi> as far as his Wit and Ill Will would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
him. He charged the <hi>Service-Book</hi> with <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Impurity,</hi> and <hi>Imperfection;</hi> and the <hi>Governors
of our Church with slackness in Reformation, want of
Discipline,</hi> with the business of <hi>Hooper,</hi> allowing
<hi>Pluralities;</hi> all the ill things he could think on. When
<hi>Cox</hi> and his <hi>Party</hi> (with whom, at this time, was our
excellent <hi>Iewel)</hi> were admitted among them, they
presently forbad <hi>Knox</hi> having any thing farther to
do in that Congregation; who being complained of
soon after for <hi>Treason</hi> against the <hi>Emperor,</hi> in a Book
by him Published, he was forced to leave the City,
and to retire to <hi>Geneva;</hi> whither most of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
followed him. And thus saith <hi>Grindal,</hi> in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to Bishop <hi>Ridley, The Church at</hi> Frankford <hi>was
well quieted by the Prudence of Mr.</hi> Cox, <hi>and others,
which met there for that purpose.</hi>

of Bishop</hi> Jewel (before his Works) <hi>that this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
was not carried with them out of</hi> England,<note place="margin">Letters of the Martyrs, p. 60.</note> 
                     <hi>but
they received New Impressions from the places whither
they went.</hi> For as those who were Exiles in <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth's time (as particularly <hi>Hooper,</hi> who lived
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95208:60"/>
many years in <hi>Switzerland)</hi> brought home with them
a great liking of the Churches Model, where they
had lived (which being such as their Country would
bear, they supposed to be nearer <hi>Apostolical Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
being far enough from any thing of <hi>Pomp,</hi> or <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony)</hi>
which created in them an aversion to the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments</hi>
and <hi>Vestments</hi> here used: So now, upon
this new Persecution, those who had Friendship at
<hi>Geneva,</hi> as <hi>Knox,</hi> and <hi>Whittingham,</hi> or were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
much obliged by those of that way, as the other
<hi>English</hi> were, who came first to <hi>Frankford,</hi> were soon
possessed with a greater liking of their Model of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service,</hi> than of our own. And when Men are
once engaged in Parties, and several Interests, it is
a very hard matter to remove the Prejudices which
they have taken in, especially when they have great
Abettors, and such, whose Authority goes beyond
any Reason with them. This is the True Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Unhappy Differences, which have so
long continued among us, about the <hi>Orders</hi> and
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> of our Church. For when <hi>Calvin</hi> and
some others found, that their Counsel was not like
to be followed in our <hi>Reformation,</hi> our <hi>Bishops</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
more out of Reverence to the <hi>Ancient
Church,</hi> than <hi>meer opposition to Popery</hi> (which some
other Reformers made their Rules) they did not cease
by Letters, and other wayes, to insinuate, that our
<hi>Reformation</hi> was imperfect, as long as any of the
<hi>Dregs of Popery</hi> remained. So they called the <hi>Vse</hi> of
those <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which they could not deny to have
been far more <hi>Ancient</hi> than the great <hi>Apostasy</hi> of the
<hi>Roman Church. Calvin,</hi> in his Letter to the <hi>Protector,</hi>
Avows this to be the best Rule of <hi>Reformation, To go
as far from Popery as they could;</hi> and therefore <hi>what
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95208:60"/>
Habits and Ceremonies had been abused in the time of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
were to be removed, lest others were hardened in their
Superstition thereby:</hi> but at last he yields to this <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi>

only <hi>the Cross after Baptism;</hi> which was not so used

is used in the <hi>Scrutinies</hi> before <hi>Baptism;</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing</hi>
with the <hi>Chrysm in vertice</hi> after it; in stead
of these, our <hi>Church</hi> made choice of <hi>the Sign of the

and not used till the <hi>Child</hi> is <hi>Baptized.</hi> In the

                  <p>I will here give a Just and True Account of the

or to Apoint these <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Out of a due Reverence to Antiquity.</hi> They
would hereby convince the <hi>Papists</hi> they did put a
difference between the Gross and Intolerable <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions</hi>
of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the Innocent <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises</hi>
which were observed in the <hi>Church</hi> before. And
What could more harden the <hi>Papists,</hi> then to see
Men put no difference betwen these? It is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
Advantage which those do give to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95208:61"/>
                     <hi>Papists,</hi> who are for Reforming 1600 years back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and when they are pinch'd with a <hi>Testimony</hi>
of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> presently cry out of the <hi>Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
working in the Apostles times:</hi> as though every
thing which they disliked, were a part of it. Next
to <hi>the taking up Arms for Religion,</hi> which made Men
look on it as a <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Design,</hi> there was scarce
any thing gave so great a check to the <hi>Progress</hi> of the
<hi>Reformation</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> especially among Learned and
Moderate Men, as the putting no difference between
the <hi>Corruptions</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the innocent <hi>Customs</hi> of
the <hi>Ancient Church.</hi> For the time was when many
Great Men there, were very inclinable to a <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi>
but when they saw the <hi>Reformers</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the undoubted Practises of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> equally
with the <hi>Modern Corruptions,</hi> they cast them off, as
Men guilty of an unreasonable humor of <hi>Innovation;</hi>
as may be seen in <hi>Thuanus,</hi> and <hi>Fran. Baldwins Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Commentaries,</hi> and his Answers to <hi>Calvin</hi>
and <hi>Beza.</hi> But our Reformers, although they made
the <hi>Scripture</hi> the only <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and rejected all
things <hi>repugnant</hi> thereto; yet they designed not to
make a <hi>Transformation</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> but a <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of it; by reducing it as near as they could, to that
state it was in, under the first <hi>Christian Emperors,</hi> that
were sound in Religion; and therefore they retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
these few <hi>Ceremonies</hi> as <hi>Badges</hi> of the Respect they
bore to the <hi>Ancient Church.</hi>

                     <hi>II.</hi> To manifest the Iustice and Equity of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
<hi>by letting their Enemies see, they did not
Break</hi> Communion <hi>with them for</hi> meer indifferent things.
<hi>For some of the</hi> Popish Bishops <hi>of that time were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and learned Men, as</hi> Gardiner, Heath,
Tonstall, <hi>&amp;c. and nothing would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
them more, than to have seen our</hi> Reformers
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95208:62"/>
                     <hi>boggle at such</hi> Ceremonies <hi>as these; and they would
have made mighty advantage of it among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Of which we have a clear instance in the case
of</hi> Bishop Hoopers <hi>scrupling the</hi> Episcopal Vestments.
Peter Martyr <hi>tells him plainly,</hi> That such needless scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulosity
would be a great hindrance to the Reformation.
<hi>For, saith he,</hi> since the People are with difficulty enough
brought to things necessary, if we once declare things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to be unlawful, they will have no patience to
hear us any longer. And, withall, hereby we condemn
other Reformed Churches, and those Ancient Churches,
which have hitherto to been in great esteem.</p>

of their forward and zealous <hi>Preaching,</hi> which
at that time was very needful; and therefore many

against <hi>the Livery of Antichrist,</hi> as they called <hi>the

and therefore some examples were thought fit

made them presumptuous, so this severity made
them clamorous; and they sent bitter complaints
to <hi>Geneva. Beza,</hi> after much importunity, undertook
to give an Answer to them; which being of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to our present business, I shall here give a
fuller account of it. We are then to understand,

<hi>Beza</hi> takes notice of in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Grindal</hi> Bishop

                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> London <hi>first Rebuked them for their</hi>

Severing themselves from the Society of other Christians,
they not only Condemned them, but also the whole State
of the Church Reformed in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s dayes, which
was well Reformed according to the word of God; yea,
and many Good Men have shed their. Blood for the
same, which your doings Condemn. Have ye not, <hi>saith
he,</hi> the Gospel truly Preached, and the Sacraments Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
accordingly, and good order kept, although we
differ from other Churches in Ceremonies, and in indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
things, which lie in the Princes Power to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
for Order sake? <hi>To which one of them An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,</hi>
That as long as they might have the Word
freely Preached, and the Sacraments Administred,
without the preferring of Idolatrous Gear about it, they
never assembled together in Houses: but their Preachers
being displaced by Law for their Non-conformity, they
be thought themselves what was best for them to do;
and calling to mind, that there was a Congregation
there in the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which followed the
Order of <hi>Geneva,</hi> they took up that, and this Book and
Order, <hi>saith he,</hi> we hold. <hi>Another Answered,</hi> That
they did not refuse Communion for Preaching the Word,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95208:63"/>
but because they had tied the Ceremonies of Antichrist to
it; and set them up before it, so that no Man may
Preach, or Minister the Sacraments without them.
<hi>Things being come to this height, and</hi> Separation <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to break out, the Wiser Brethren thought
not fit to proceed any farther, till they had Consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their</hi> Oracle <hi>at</hi> Geneva. Beza <hi>being often solicited
by them,</hi> with doleful Complaints of their hard usage,
and the different Opinions among themselves, what they
were to do, <hi>at last resolves to Answer; but first he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,</hi>
How unwilling he was to interpose in the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of another Church, especially when but one Party
was heard; and he was afraid, this was only the way
to exasperate and provoke more, rather than Cure this
evil, which he thought was not otherwise to be Cured,
<hi>but</hi> Precibus &amp; Patientiâ, by Prayers and Patience.
<hi>After this General Advice,</hi> Beza <hi>freely declares his
own judgment, as to the</hi> Reformation <hi>of several
things he thought amiss in our</hi> Church; <hi>but as to the
case of the</hi> Silenced Preachers, <hi>and the</hi> Peoples Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<hi>he expresses his Mind in that manner, that the</hi>
Dissenters <hi>at this day, would have published their
Invectives against him, one upon the back of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For (1.)</hi> As to the Silenced Ministers, <hi>he saith,</hi>
That if the Pressing Subscription continued, he perswades
them rather to live privately than to yield to it. For,
they must either act against their Consciences, or they
must quit their Imployments; for, <hi>saith he,</hi> the Third
thing that may be supposed, <hi>viz.</hi> That they should exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their Function against the Will of the Queen and the
Bishops, we Tremble at the Thoughts of it, for such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as may be easily understood, though we say never a
word of them. <hi>What! Is</hi> Beza <hi>for</hi> Silencing, <hi>and
stopping the Mouths of such a number of Faithful
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95208:64"/>
and able Ministers; and at such a time, when the</hi>
Church <hi>was in so great</hi> Necessity <hi>of Preaching, and so
many</hi> Souls <hi>like to be</hi> famished <hi>for the want of it?
when St.</hi> Antholins, <hi>St.</hi> Peters, <hi>St.</hi> Bartholomews, <hi>at
which</hi> Gilby <hi>saith their great</hi> Preaching <hi>then was,
were like to be left destitute of such Men? Would</hi>
Beza, <hi>even</hi> Beza, <hi>at such a time, as that, be for</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing
<hi>so many</hi> Preachers, <hi>i. e. for their</hi> sitting quiet,
<hi>when the Law had done it; And would not he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to Preach, when they ought to have done
it, though against the Will of the</hi> Queen <hi>and the</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops?
<hi>It appears that</hi> Beza <hi>was not of the Mind of
our</hi> Adversaries, <hi>but that he was of the contrary, it
appears plainly by this, That before he Perswades
the</hi> Dissenting Ministers rather to live privately than to
subscribe; <hi>and that he expresses no such terrible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
at their</hi> quitting their Places, <hi>as he doth
at</hi> their Preaching in Opposition to the Laws. (2) <hi>As
to the case of the</hi> People, <hi>his Advice was,</hi> As long as
the Doctrine was sound, that they should diligently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon it, and receive the Sacraments devoutly, and
to joyn Amendment of Life with their Prayers, that by
those means they might obtain a through Reformation.

<hi>than what is here said by</hi> Beza: <hi>for, even as to
the</hi> Ministers, <hi>he saith,</hi> Though he did not approve the
Ceremonies, yet since they are not of the nature of things
evil in themselves, he doth not think them of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they should leave their Functions for the sake
of them; or that the People should forsake the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
rather than hear those who did Conform. <hi>Than
which words, nothing can be plainer against</hi> Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>And it further appears, by</hi> Beza'<hi>s Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a case concerning a</hi> Schism <hi>in the</hi> French
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95208:64"/>
Church <hi>then in</hi> London; That he looked on it as a
Sin, for any one to Separate from a Church, wherein
Sound Doctrine, and a Holy Life, and the Right use of
the Sacraments is kept up. And, by Separation, <hi>he
saith, he means,</hi> Not meerly going from one Church to
another, but the Discontinuing Communion with the
Publick Assemblies, as though one were no Member of
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beza</hi>'s Authority being so great with the <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

<hi>Stop</hi> to the <hi>Course</hi> of <hi>Separation,</hi> which they

Assertions, being so Openly Avowed to the World,
by the <hi>Leaders</hi> of the <hi>Dissenting Party,</hi> gave the
true <hi>Occasion</hi> to the following practise of <hi>Separation.</hi>
For when these things were not only published in
the name of the <hi>Party,</hi> being the <hi>Pleas for Peace</hi> at
that time, but stifly maintained with greater Heat,
than Learning, It is easie to imagine, what <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi>
such things would make on the common sort
of <hi>People;</hi> who have still a good Inclination to find
fault with their <hi>Governors,</hi> especially in the <hi>Church,</hi>
and to Admire those that Oppose them. And
these they Courted most, having their <hi>Opinions</hi> so
suited to <hi>Vulgar capacities,</hi> that they apprehended
their <hi>Interest</hi> carried on together with that of <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of <hi>Reformation.</hi> Hence they pleaded then, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do at this day, for the <hi>Peoples right to choose
their Bishops and Pastors against the Vsurpations,</hi> as
they accounted them, of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Patrons;</hi> hence
they railed against the <hi>Pomp and Greatness of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
which is always a Popular Theme; and so would
the exposing the inequality of Mens <hi>Estates</hi> be, if
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95208:66"/>
Men durst undertake it, with as great hopes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.
Besides, it was not a Little Pleasant to the
<hi>People,</hi> to think, what a share they should come
to in the New <hi>Seigniory,</hi> as they called it, or <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi>
to be erected in every <hi>Parish;</hi> and what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
they should Exercise over their <hi>Neighbours,</hi>
and over their <hi>Minister</hi> too by their double Votes.
By such Arts as these, they complied with the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Humors of the <hi>People,</hi> and so gained a mighty
Interest amongst them; as the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
and <hi>Switzerland</hi> at first did, upon the like Grounds.
Which made <hi>Bullinger,</hi>

here, to whom nothing seemed pure enough in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
from whence they brake out into Separation,
and had their Conventicles among us, upon which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Sects and Schisms, which made great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to our Common Enemies, the Papists.</hi> Just
thus it happened here, these hot <hi>Reformers</hi> design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no <hi>Separation</hi> at present; which they knew

for, that was laying the Reins on the Peoples ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and they would run whither they pleased, without
any possibility of being well managed by them; but
since these Men would <hi>Refine</hi> upon the present <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
of our <hi>Church,</hi> there soon arose another sort
of Men, who thought it as fit to <hi>Refine</hi> upon <hi>them.</hi>
They acknowledged they had good <hi>Principles</hi> among
them, but they did not <hi>practise</hi> according to them:
If our <hi>Church</hi> were so bad as they said, that there
was neither <hi>right Ministery,</hi> nor <hi>right Government,</hi>
nor <hi>right Sacraments,</hi> nor <hi>right Discipline;</hi> What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95208:66"/>
say they, from hence, <hi>but that we ought to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the Communion of so corrupt a Church, and
joyn together to make up new Churches for the pure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of all Gospel Ordinances?</hi> The <hi>Leaders</hi>
of the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> finding this Party growing
up under them, were quickly apprehensive of the
danger of them; because the <hi>Consequence</hi> seemed so
<hi>Natural</hi> from their <hi>own Principles;</hi> and the People
were so ready to believe, that nothing but World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considerations of <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> kept them
from practising according to them. Which was a
mighty prejudice against them in the Minds of the

the chief Christian Vertues, and Godly Duties, as

full of Love and Mercy, to deal Vprightly and Iustly,
to Guide their Families in the Fear of God, with Whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Instructions, and to stand fast in the Calling in
which God hath set them, give themselves wholly to this,
even as if it were the Sum and Pith of Religion, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to Argue and Talk continually against Matters in
the Church, against Bishops and Ministers, and one
against another on both sides. Some are proceeded to
this, that they will come to the Assemblies to hear the
Sermons and Prayers of the Preacher, but not to the
Prayers of the Book, which I take to be a more grievous
sin than many do suppose. But yet this is not the worst,
for sundry are gone further, and fallen into a Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Schism; and the same so much the more fearful
and dangerous, in that many do not see the foulness of
it, but rather hold them as Godly Christians, and but
a little over-shot in these matters. <hi>But that this Man

think they could satisfie their Consciences in</hi> Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>unless they proved our</hi> Churches <hi>to be</hi> no true
Churches. <hi>For, here they assign the Four Causes of
their</hi> Separation <hi>to be;</hi> Want of a right gathering our
Churches <hi>at</hi> first; False Worship; Antichristian
Ministery <hi>and</hi> Government: These Reasons, <hi>say they,</hi>
all Men may see prove directly these Parish Assemblies
not to be the true established Churches of Christ, to which
any faithful Christian may joyn himself in this estate;
especially, when all Reformation unto the rules of <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Testament is not only denied, but resisted, blasphemed,
persecuted. <hi>These are the words of the</hi> First, <hi>and</hi>
Chiefest Separatists, <hi>who suffered death rather than
they would foregoe these Principles.</hi> We condemn
not, <hi>say they,</hi> their Assemblies, barely for a mixture of
good and bad, which will alwayes be, but for want of an
orderly gathering, or constitution at first: we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95208:70"/>
them not for some faults in the Calling of the
Ministry, but for having and reteining a false Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Ministry imposed upon them: we forsake not their
Assemblies for some faults in their Government, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
but for standing subject to a Popish and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Government. Neither refrain we their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for some light imperfections, but because their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is Superstitious, devised by Men Idolatrous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that patched Popish Portuise their Service-Book;
according unto which their Sacraments, and
whole Administration is performed, and not by the
Rules of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Testament. <hi>So that these poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
Creatures saw very well, that nothing but
such a Charge, which overthrew the very being
and constitution of our Churches (the Doctrine of
Faith being allowed to be sound) could justifie their</hi>
Separation: <hi>not meer promiscuous</hi> Congregations, <hi>nor
mixt</hi> Communions; <hi>not defect in the</hi> Exercise <hi>of</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;
<hi>not some</hi> Corruptions <hi>in the</hi> Ministry <hi>or</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
<hi>but such gross corruptions as took away the</hi>
Life <hi>and</hi> Being <hi>of a</hi> Church; <hi>as they supposed</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Worship, <hi>and an</hi> Antichristian Ministry <hi>to do.</hi>
If Mr. <hi>Giffard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> saith <hi>Barrow,</hi> can prove the Parish
Assemblies in this estate true and established Churches,
then we would shew him how free we are from Schism.

Ainsworth <hi>frames his</hi> Argument <hi>for</hi> Separation <hi>thus.</hi>
That Church which is not the true Church of <hi>Christ</hi> and
of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ainsworth</hi>'s Counter-poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, p. 3. Ib. p. 87.</note> ought not, by any true Christian, to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,

proved, not to be the true Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of God,
therefore it ought to be separated from, <hi>&amp;c. By which we
see, the Greatest</hi> Separatists <hi>that were then, never
thought it</hi> Lawful <hi>to</hi> Separate <hi>from our</hi> Churches, <hi>if
they were true. On the other side, those who opposed
the</hi> Separation, <hi>with greatest zeal, thought nothing
more was necessary for them, to disprove the</hi> Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<hi>then to prove</hi> our Churches to be true Churches.
R. Brown <hi>(from whom the Party received their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination)
thought he had a great advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>
Cartwright <hi>(the</hi> Ringleader <hi>of the</hi> Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists)
<hi>to prove the</hi> Necessity <hi>of</hi> Separation, <hi>because
he seemed to</hi> make Discipline Essential to a Church;
<hi>and therefore since he complained of the</hi> want <hi>of</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
<hi>here, he made</hi> our Church <hi>not to be a</hi> true
Church, <hi>and consequently</hi> that Separation was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.

builded by Faith only on <hi>Christ</hi> the Foundation, the

is not able to put that Assembly from the right
and title of so being the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> For that
Faith can admit no such thing, as giveth an utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
and turning upside down of the truth. <hi>His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, wherever the</hi> true Doctrine of Faith <hi>is received
and professed, there no</hi> defects <hi>or</hi> corruptions <hi>can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the</hi> being <hi>of a</hi> True Church, <hi>or</hi> Iustifie Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>from it.</hi> For, <hi>he addeth,</hi> although besides Faith
in the Son of God, there be many things necessary for
every Assembly; yet be they necessary to the comely and
stable being, and not simply to the being of the Church.

beside the maym of Discipline, which is common to our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95208:71"/>
Churches, are grossely deceived in the matter of the

the Return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> the City of the Great King,

Church, because it hath not received this Discipline,
methinks is all one with this, as if a Man would say,
It is no City, because it hath no Wall: or that it is no
Vineyard, because it hath neither Hedge, nor Ditch. It
is not, I grant, so sightly a City, or Vineyard, nor yet
so safe against the Invasion of their several Enemies
which lie in wait for them; but yet they are truly both
Cities and Vineyards. <hi>And whereas</hi> T. C. <hi>seemed to

was,</hi> To Prove our Churches to be True Churches.
<hi>As in a Book, Entituled,</hi> Certain Positions h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ld and
maintained by some Godly Ministers of the Gospel, against
those of the Separation; <hi>which was part of that Book,
afterwards Published by</hi> W. R. <hi>and called,</hi> A Grave
and Modest Confutation of the Separatists. <hi>The</hi> Ground-work
whereof, <hi>as Mr.</hi> Ainsworth <hi>calls it, is thus
laid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a True Church of
<hi>Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Counterpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, p. 117.</note> and such a one, as from which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Wittingly and Continually Separateth
himself, Cutteth himself off from <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:95208:71"/>
If this was <hi>the Ground-work</hi> of the <hi>Non-conformists</hi>
in those days; those who live in ours, ought well to
consider it, if they regard their <hi>Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, for this Assertion of theirs, they bring
Three <hi>Reasons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. For that they Enjoy, and Ioyn together in the
Vse of these outward Means, which God in his Word
hath ordained for the Gathering of an Invisible Church;
<hi>i. e.</hi> Preaching of the Gospel, and Administration of
the Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>2. For that their Whole Church maketh Profession
of the True Faith: and Hold and Teach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all Truths
Fundamental. <hi>So we put their Two</hi> Reasons <hi>into
One, because they both relate</hi> to the Profession of the
Truth Faith; <hi>which, say they,</hi> is that which giveth life
and being to a Visible Church: and upon this Profession
we find many that have been incorporated into the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church, and admitted to the Priviledges thereof,
even by the Apostles themselves. So the Church of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus,</hi>
though it did Tolerate Gross Corruptions in it:
yet because it kept the Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> was still called
the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>3. For that all the known Churches in the World
acknowledge that Church for their Sister, and give unto
Her the Right hand of Fellowship.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>H. Iacob</hi> undertook <hi>Fr. Iohnson</hi> upon this
Point of <hi>Separation,</hi> the Position he laid down was
this,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:95208:72"/>
That the Churches of <hi>England</hi> are the True Churches
of God. <hi>Which he proved by this</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever is sufficient to make a particular Man a
true Christian, and in state of Salvation; that is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make a Company of Men, so gathered together,
to be a True Church.</p>
                  <p>But the whole Doctrine, as it is Publickly Professed,
and Practised, by Law in <hi>England,</hi> is sufficient to
make a particular Man a true Christian, and in state of
Salvation; and our Publick Assemblies are therein ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is sufficient to make the Publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
True Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in the Defence of this Argument, against the</hi>
Reasons <hi>and</hi> Exceptions <hi>of</hi> Iohnson, <hi>that whole</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is spent. <hi>And, in latter times, the Dispute
between</hi> Ball <hi>and</hi> Can, <hi>about</hi> the necessity of Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>runs into this,</hi> Whether our Church be a True Church
or not; <hi>concerning which,</hi> Ball <hi>thus delivers his

the outward Society of the Church, and so to make a
visible Church: Neither were sufficient means want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                  <p>III. That our Ministery was Antichristian. <hi>To
this they Answer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That Antichrist is described in Scripture,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Arthur Hildershams</hi> Letter against Separation, Sect. 2. high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. <hi>J. Cotton,</hi> in his Preface before his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, on 4 <hi>John.</hi>
                     </note> not by
his unlawful outward Calling, or Office, that he should
exercise in the Church; but <hi>First</hi> by the False Doctrine
he should Teach; and <hi>Secondly</hi> by the Authority
he should Vsurp, to give Laws to Mens Consciences, and
to Rule in the hearts of Men as God. Which two Marks
of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> as they may evidently be discerned in the
Papacy, so admit all the outward Callings and Offices
in the Church of <hi>England</hi> exercised, were faulty, and
unwarrantable by the Word, yet you in your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
know, that these Marks of <hi>Antichrist</hi> cannot be
found among the worst of our Ministers. For neither
do the Laws of our Church allow any to teach False
Doctrine; and we all Profess <hi>Christ</hi> to be the only
Law-giver to Conscience; neither is any thing among us
urged to be done, upon pain of Damnation, but only
the Word and Law of God.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Office,<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. Sect. C, 7, 8.</note> which our Laws call the Office of
Priesthood, is the very same in substance with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
Office described in the Word;<note place="margin">V. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to <hi>Johnson.</hi>
                     </note> and the manner of
outward Calling unto that Office, which the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
is the very same in substance which is set down
in the VVord. Doth the VVord enjoyn the Minister to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95208:74"/>
Teach diligently? so, by our Laws, he is expresly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at his Ordination to do, and forbidden to Teach
any thing, as required of necessity to Salvation, but
that which he is perswaded may be concluded and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Scripture: yea, it Commandeth him, with
all faithful diligence, to banish, and drive away all
Erroneous and strange Doctrines, that are contrary to
Gods VVord. Doth the VVord Authorise him, to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
the Sacraments? So doth our Law. Doth
the VVord require that the Minister should not only pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
Teach, but also oversee, and look to the Peoples Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
Exhorting, Admonishing, Reproving, Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them as well privately as publickly? So doth
our Law. Lastly, Doth the VVord Authorise the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to execute the Censures and Discipline of
Christ? our Law doth also command the same. So
that, although many, to whom the execution of these
things appertain, do grievously fail in the practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
yet you see the Office which the Law enjoyneth to the
Minister, is the same in substance, with that which
the VVord layeth upon him. Tell us not then, That the
same Name is given to our Office, as to the Popish Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.
Do you think the worse of your self because you
are called <hi>Brownists?</hi> And, Shall the Holy Office and
Calling, which is so agreeable to the VVord, be misliked,
because it is called a Priesthood? considering, that
though it agree in Name, yet it differeth in Nature

Light doth from Darkness.</p>
                  <p>IV. That Discipline is wanting in our Church. <hi>To
which they Answer.</hi>

of <hi>Christ,</hi>

                        <hi>Hildershams</hi> Letter, Sect. 3.</note> which concern the Discipline of his
Church, and the outward calling of his Ministers, is no
such sin, as can make either the Ministers, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
of our Church <hi>Antichrist,</hi> or our Church an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi>
and False Church. <hi>And Mr.</hi> H. <hi>adds,</hi> That
no one place of Scripture can be found, wherein he is
called an <hi>Antichrist,</hi> or <hi>Antichristian,</hi> who holding the
Truth of Doctrine, and professing those Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that are Fundamental, as we do, doth swerve,
either in Iudgment, or Practice, from that Rule, which
<hi>Christ</hi> hath given for the Discipline of his Church.
Neither can you find any <hi>Antichrist</hi> mentioned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
whose Doctrine is sound. If then the Doctrine of
our Church be sound, VVhat VVarrant have you to call
us <hi>Antichrists?</hi> If our Pastors offer to lead you unto
Salvation, through no other door than <hi>Christ,</hi> How
dare you, that say you are <hi>Christ</hi>'s, refuse to be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them? If our Assemblies be built upon that
Rock, How can you deny them to be True Churches?</p>

by Law, ought to be in all our Assemblies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we cannot justly be said to be without the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline

both the Exercise of the Churches Censures, and some
of those Officers which <hi>Christ</hi> hath appointed to exercise
them by, yet might we be a True Church notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
as there was a True Church in <hi>Judah</hi> all the days
of <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> yet was not the Discipline Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
there till the latter end of <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi>'s Reign.
The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was a True Church, even when
the Apostle blamed them for want of Discipline. The
Congregation at <hi>Samaria</hi> is called a Church,<note place="margin">Acts. 8, 12, 19, 31.</note> before the
Discipline was established there. And even in <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
there was a famous visible Church of <hi>Christ</hi> long before
sundry parts of the Discipline (for want whereof they
Condemn us) were established there; yea, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that by the Apostles themselves divers Churches
were gathered some good space of time, before the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
was setled, or exercised: by all which it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that how necessary soever those parts of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
(which we want) be, to the Beauty and Well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or preservation of the Church; yet are they not
necessary to the being thereof; but a True Church may
be without them.</p>
                  <p>4. That it doth not belong to private persons to set
up the Discipline of the Church against the Will and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Christian Magistrate,<note place="margin">Grave Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 51. 52.</note> and Governors of the
Church:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Giffard</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, p. 59. 95, 100, 101, 102.</note> Nay, they declare, that in so doing, they should
highly offend God. Giffard <hi>saith,</hi> That the Fetters and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95208:76"/>
Chains, can no faster bind the hands and feet of <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
then the hands of private Men are bound with the
bands of Conscience, and the Fear of God, from presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to take upon them Publick Authority. And if all
the <hi>Brownists</hi> in the Land should come together, and
choose a Minister and Ordain him, it would make him
no more a Minister before God, then if all the Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
in <hi>London,</hi> taking upon them to choose a Lord
Mayor, and Minister an Oath unto him, should make
him a Lord Mayor. <hi>But of this more afterwards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>V. That the Ministers of our Church stand under <hi>(as
they speak)</hi> an Antichristian Hierarchy. <hi>To which
they Answer,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Grave Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 19.</note> They deny that our Bishops can be called An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian,
since they do, and by the Laws of the Land
ought to hold and teach all Doctrines that are Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; yea, some of them have Learnedly and Soundly
maintained the Truth against <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say'd
it; some have not only by their Doctrine and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
Converted many to the Truth, but have suffered
Persecution for the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppose it were an Antichristian Yoke,
which they deny; yet this doth not destroy the being of
a True Church, or Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>istry under it. Since both the
<hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Churches, have frequently born
such a Yoke, and yet have been the True Churches of
God still.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That there is nothing unlawful, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
in the Office of Bishops, if they consider them
as the Kings Visitors and Commissioners, to see that the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95208:76"/>
Pastors do their Duties. And that this cannot destroy
the nature of a Visible Church, to cast many particular
Churches,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bradshaw</hi>'s Answer to <hi>Johnson,</hi> p. 65. Ed. 1642.</note> under one Provincial, or Diocesan Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Yea, Mr.</hi> Bradshaw <hi>undertakes to prove this,
not only</hi> lawful, <hi>but</hi> expedient, to that degree, that he
thinks the Magistrate cannot well discharge his Duty, as
to the Oversight and Government of the Churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Dominions, without it: <hi>as is implyed in the seven</hi>
Quaeries <hi>he propounds to</hi> Fr. Iohnson <hi>about it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 49.</note> But
supposing them to be Pastors of the Churches under
them, this, <hi>saith he,</hi> doth not overthrow the Office of
Pastors to particular Congregations, so long as under
them they perform the main and substantial Duties of
True Pastors; which all the Ministers of our Church-Assemblies
do, and by the Laws cought to do.</p>
                  <p>These Particulars I have laid together with all
possible brevity and clearness, from the <hi>Authors</hi> of
best reputation on both sides, that we might have
a distinct view of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Controversie</hi> about

<hi>But one of their own Party at</hi> Amsterdam <hi>takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of a</hi> Third Cause <hi>of these</hi> Dissentions, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Iudgment of God upon them. I do see, <hi>saith he,</hi> the
hand of God is heavy upon them, blinding their Minds,
and hardening their Hearts, that they do not see his
Truth, so that they are at Wars among themselves, and
they are far from that true Peace of God which followeth
Holiness.</p>
                  <p>There were two great Signs of <hi>this hand of God
upon them.</hi>

still one upon the other, as long as the course of
<hi>Separation</hi> continued; and were only sometimes hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from shewing themselves, by their not being
let loose upon each other; For then the <hi>Firebrands</hi>
soon <hi>appear,</hi> which at other times they endeavour to
cover.</p>
                  <p>Their great <hi>Obstinacy</hi> appears, by the Execution
of <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Greenwood,</hi> who being Condemned
for <hi>Seditious Books,</hi> could no ways be reclaimed;
rather choosing to Dye, than to Renounce the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> R. Williams urged
Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> with an apparent inconsistency between

all this, Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> doth assert the <hi>Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

<hi>That though a Man may joyn in Hearing, and Prayer,

Yet, after all, he will not deny our <hi>Churches</hi> to be
<hi>True Churches.</hi> But, if they remain <hi>true Churches,</hi> it
appears from the former Discourse, they can never
justifie <hi>Separation</hi> from them; upon the <hi>Principles</hi> of

Way</hi> seem to be more moderate, as to some
of their <hi>Principles,</hi> then the old <hi>rigid Separatists;</hi>
yet they do not consider, that by this means they

their Judgment, concerning our <hi>Parochial Churches.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95208:80"/>
And for our own Congregations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apologet. Narrative, p. 5, 6.</note> viz. <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>we
have this sincere Profession to make before God and all
the World, that all that Conscience of the Defilements,
we conceived to cleave to the true Worship of God in them,
or of the Vnwarranted Power in Church Governors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
therein, did never work in us any other thought,
much less opinion, but that Multitudes of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
and Parochial Congregations thereof, were the
True Churches and Body of</hi> Christ, <hi>and the Ministery
thereof a True Ministery: much less did it ever enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our hearts, to Iudge them Antichristian; we saw, and
cannot but see, that by the same reason, the Churches
abroad in</hi> Scotland, Holland, <hi>&amp;c.(though more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)
yet for their Mixture, must be in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Iudged no Churches also; which, to imagine, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
is, and hath ever been an horror to our thoughts.
Yea, we have always professed, and that in those times
when the Churches of</hi> England <hi>were the most, either
actually overspread with Defilements, or in the greatest
danger thereof; and when our selves had least, yea no
hopes of ever so much as visiting our own Land again
in peace and safety to our persons, that we both did
and would hold Communion with them as the Church
of</hi> Christ. This is a very fair Confession from the
<hi>Dissenting Brethren;</hi> but then the difficulty returns
with greater force; <hi>How comes Separation from these
Churches to be lawful?</hi> If they had gone upon the
<hi>Brownists Principles,</hi> all the Dispute had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the truth or falshood of them; but their truth
being supposed, the necessity of <hi>Separation</hi> followed;
whereas now, upon altering the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie</hi>
by the <hi>Independents,</hi> though their <hi>Principles</hi>
seem more Moderate, yet their <hi>Practice</hi> is more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable.
It is therefore a vain pretence used at
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95208:81"/>
this day, to justifie the <hi>Separation,</hi> That <hi>they do not
deny our Churches to be true Churches, and that therein
they differ from the old Separatists;</hi> It is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that
Opinion they do; but in <hi>Separation</hi> they agree,
which is the more unjustifiable in them, since they

<hi>Independent Brethren,</hi> whose <hi>Separation</hi> themselves

                     </note> because (1.)
They agreed with the old <hi>Separatists</hi> in the Main
Principle of <hi>Popular Church Government, Which,</hi>
they say, <hi>is inconsistent with the Civil Peace; as may
be seen,</hi> say they, <hi>in the Quarrels both at</hi> Amsterdam,
<hi>and</hi> Rotterdam; <hi>and the Law-Suites depending before
the Magistrates there.</hi> (2.) They overthrow the
Bounds of <hi>Parochial Churches,</hi> as the <hi>Separatists</hi> did,
and think such a Confinement Unlawful. (3.)
They make <hi>true Saintship</hi> the necessary Qualification
of <hi>Church Members,</hi> as the <hi>Separatists</hi> did: <hi>Whereby,</hi>
say they, <hi>they confound the Visible, and Invisible Church,
and make the same essential form of both.</hi> (4.) They
renounce the <hi>Ordination</hi> received in our <hi>Church,</hi>
but all the allowance they make of a <hi>true Ministry,</hi>
is, by vertue of an <hi>explicit or implicit Call,</hi> grounded
on the Peoples <hi>explicit or implicit Covenant,</hi> with
such a Man as their Pastor. For when they first began
to set up a <hi>Congregational Church,</hi> after the New
Model, at <hi>Rotterdam, Ward</hi> was chosen <hi>Pastor,</hi>
and <hi>Bridges Teacher,</hi> but they both Renounced
their <hi>Ordination</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and some say, <hi>They

ordained one another;</hi> others, <hi>That they had no other

be set up in <hi>Holland,</hi> upon these <hi>Principles;</hi> but they

renouncing his <hi>Ordination,</hi> was admitted a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
member</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> but he
grew soon unsatisfied with the <hi>Orders</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi>
and thought too great a Restraint was laid upon
the private Members, as to the <hi>exercise</hi> of <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying;</hi>
and so he, and those who joyned with him,
complaining of the <hi>Mischief</hi> of <hi>Impositions,</hi> were
ready for a <hi>Separation,</hi> if that restraint were not
speedily removed. Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> yields to the thing,
but not as to the time, viz. <hi>On the Lords Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sermon;</hi> this gives no satisfaction, for they must
have their will in every thing, or else they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cease complaining of the <hi>Mischief of Impositions.</hi>
And so Mr. <hi>Simpson,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answer to the <hi>Antapologia</hi> p. 245.</note> and his Party, set up a <hi>New

deny; for <hi>Mr.</hi> Simpson, saith he, <hi>upon dislike of some
persons and things in that Church, whereof Mr.</hi> Bridge

apprehend the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>Impositions,</hi> and the <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi>
of a <hi>Separating dividing humor.</hi> But the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

had it seems given Offence to some of the <hi>Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by Preaching the same Sermons there, which he had
Preached before at</hi> Norwich; this, and some other
frivolous things, were thought Intolerable <hi>Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
and therefore against the <hi>Will</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bridge,</hi>
they Depose Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> from his Ministery. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a fresh discovery of the great inconveniency of
<hi>Popular Church Government,</hi> gave a mighty alarm to
the Brethren: which occasion'd a Meeting of <hi>the
Messengers from other Churches</hi> (as they called them)
for closing up of this wound; but they durst not
search deep into it, but only skinn'd it over, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the great reproach and scandal of it. From these
things, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> inferred the necessity of
<hi>Civil Authorities</hi> interposing;<note place="margin">Anatomy of <hi>Independ.</hi> p. 49.</note> and of not leaving all
to <hi>Conscience. For,</hi> say they, <hi>Conscience hath been
long urging the taking away that Scandal occasion'd at</hi>
Rotterdam <hi>by that Schism, where divers Members left
the one Church, and joyned to the other, so disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wherein even the Rulers of one Church had a deep
Charge; yet as that could not then be prevented,
so there had been many Meetings, Sermons, and all
means used to press the Conscience of taking it off, by a
Re-union of the Churches, and yet the way to do it could
never be found, till the Magistrates Authority and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
found it.</hi> These things I have more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
Not, as though bare Dissentions in a Church
were an Argument of it self against it; but, to shew
(1.) That Popular Church Government naturally
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95208:83"/>
leads to Divisions, and leaves them without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;
and (2.) That humerous and factious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
will always complain of the <hi>Mischief of Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
though the things be never so just and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
and (1.) That this Principle of <hi>Liberty of
Conscience,</hi> will unavoidably lead Men into <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi>
For when Men once break the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and <hi>Government in a Church,</hi> they run down the
Hill, and tumble down all before them. If Men
complain of the <hi>Mischief</hi> of our <hi>Impositions,</hi> the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of their own <hi>Churches,</hi> may on the same grounds,
complain of theirs; and as the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> cannot
Answer the <hi>Independents,</hi> as to the <hi>Pretence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi>
so it is impossible for either, or both of
them, to Answer the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who have as just
a <hi>Plea</hi> for <hi>Separation</hi> from them, as they can have
from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>

which their <hi>Independent Brethren</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dissenting Brethren</hi> finding themselves thus

with being the <hi>Occasion</hi> of so many <hi>Errors</hi> and

<hi>Vindication</hi> of themselves, wherein (as is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
they endeavour to purge themselves from the

on some of our Churches as True Churches, and our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,

                  </p>
                  <p>To this the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Answered,</p>
                  <p>

                     <note place="margin">Observations and Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Apologetical Narration, p. 17.</note> That they did not understand by them,
in what Sense they allowed <hi>our Churches to be true
Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If they did, what Necessity there was
for any <hi>Separation,</hi> or what need of <hi>Toleration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As to the Sense in which they owned</hi> our Churches
to be true Churches; either they understood it of a
bare Metaphysical Verity, as many of our Divines, <hi>say
they,</hi> grant it to the Romish Church; That she is a True
Church, as a rotten Infections Strumpet is a True Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
and then they thank them for their Favour, that
they hold our Churches in the same Category with <hi>Rome:</hi>
or else they understand it in a Moral sense for sound
and pure Churches, and then, <hi>say they,</hi> Why do ye not
joyn with us, and Communicate as Brethren? Why de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
ye a Toleration? Yes, <hi>say the</hi> Dissenting Brethren,
we own you to be True Churches, and Communicate with
you in Doctrine. <hi>To which the others reply'd,</hi> If
you own it by External Act of Communion, ye must Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with us in Sacraments: <hi>but this ye refuse;
therefore ye must return to the old</hi> Principles <hi>of</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
<hi>For where there was such a refusal of</hi>
Communion, <hi>as there was in them towards all Churches
besides their own,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sermon at St. <hi>Paul's, Feb.</hi> 8. 1645. p. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>there must lie at the bottom the
same Principle of Separation which was in the</hi> Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists.
<hi>And, as Mr.</hi> Newcomen urged them, their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95208:85"/>
with us in Doctrines that are Fundamental, their
holding one Head, and one Faith, doth not excuse them
from being guilty of breach of Vnity, and downright
Schism, as long as they hold not one Body, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.
For when Men make different Assemblies, and
Congregations, and draw Men into Parties, it is not
their owning the same Doctrine doth excuse them from
Schism, as he proves from St. <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Beza.
Of which afterwards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But still they denied themselves to be</hi> Brownists,
or Rigid Separatists, because they separated from our
Congregations as no Churches, and from the Ordinances
dispensed as Antichristian, and from our People as no
Visible Christians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which the other Replyed,</hi> That there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a Difference among the Separatists themselves,
some being more rigid than others; <hi>and as to the</hi> last
Clause, <hi>none since</hi> Barrow had owned it. <hi>But, for
the rest,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Narrative of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Postscript,</hi> p. 52.</note> 
                     <hi>only putting</hi> Vnlawful <hi>for</hi> Antichristian; <hi>and
by</hi> Ordinances, <hi>understanding</hi> Church-Ordinances,
<hi>they own the very same Principles as the others did.
And although in words they seem to own</hi> our Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Congregations to be true Churches; <hi>yet having the
same Opinions with the more moderate</hi> Brownists,
<hi>touching</hi> Church-Constitution, Matter, Form, Power,
Government, Communion, Corruptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
must be, <hi>say they,</hi> that we have no true Churches,
and that our Ordinances are all unlawful. <hi>And the
less cause they have to plead for their</hi> Separation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Baylies</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive, p. 104.</note> by
acknowledging our Churches to be True Churches, their
Separation is so much the more culpable, and the grosser
and more inexcusable the Schism. For, it is a greater
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95208:86"/>
sin, <hi>saith</hi> Bayly, to depart from a Church, which I profess
to be True, and whose Ministry I acknowledge to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
than from a Church which I conceive to be False,
and whose Ministers I take to have no calling from
God; nor any Blessing from his hand.</p>
                  <p>So that the <hi>Independents</hi> were then charged with
<hi>Schism</hi> for these two things.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>For</hi> refusing Communion with those Churches,
<hi>which they confessed to</hi> be true Churches. <hi>For, say
the</hi> Members <hi>of the</hi> Assembly,<note place="margin">Papers for Accommod. p. 47.</note> Thus to depart from
True Churches, is not to hold Communion with them as
such, but rather by departing, to declare them not to
be such.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> For setting up <hi>different Congregations,</hi>
where they confessed there was <hi>an Agreement in
Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>

to understand the <hi>True State</hi> of this <hi>Controversie</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Separation,</hi> between the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Assembly,</hi>
and the <hi>Independents,</hi> I shall here give a fuller ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it from the <hi>Debates</hi> between them.</p>
                  <p>The desire of the <hi>Independents,</hi> as it was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by themselves at the <hi>Committee</hi> for <hi>Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
Dec. 4. 1645. was this,</p>
                  <p>That they may not be forced to Communicate as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in those Parishes where they dwell; but may have
liberty to have Congregations of such Persons who give
good Testimonies of their Godliness, and yet out of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95208:86"/>
of Conscience, cannot Communicate in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
but do voluntarily offer themselves to joyn in such
Congregations.</p>
                  <p>To which the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Assembly</hi> Answered,
<hi>Decemb.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>This Desire is not to be granted them, for these
Reasons.</p>
                  <p>1. Because it holds out a <hi>plain and total Separation
from the Rule;</hi> as if in nothing it were to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with; nor <hi>our Churches</hi> to be communicated
with in any thing, which should argue Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
More could not be said, or done, against
<hi>False Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It plainly holds out, <hi>The lawfulness of gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Churches out of true Churches,</hi> yea out of such <hi>True
Churches,</hi> which are endeavouring farther to reform
according to the word of God; whereof we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
there is not the least hint of any example in
all the Book of God.</p>
                  <p>3. This would give Countenance to <hi>A perpetual Schism
and Division in the Church,</hi> still drawing away some from
the <hi>Churches</hi> under the <hi>Rule,</hi> which also would
breed many Irritations among the Parties going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and those whom they leave; and again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Church</hi> that should be forsaken, and that
to which they should go.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Decemb.</hi> 23. The <hi>Dissenting Brethren</hi> put in their
<hi>Reply</hi> to these <hi>Reasons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:95208:87"/>
                     <hi>To the</hi> First Reason, <hi>they say,</hi> (1.) That ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
into other Congregations such, who cannot, out
of tenderness of Conscience, partake as Members in their
Churches, for the purer enjoyment (as to their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
of all Ordinances yet still maintaining Communion
with them as Churches, is far from Separation, much
less a plain and total Separation. And this is not set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up Churches against Churches, but Neighbour Sister
Churches of a different Iudgment. For, <hi>say they,</hi> if
the purest Churches in the World (unto our Iudgment,
in all other respects) should Impose as a Condition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, any one
thing; that such tender Consciences cannot joyn in (as
suppose kneeling in the <hi>Act</hi> of Receiving, which was
the case of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England)</hi> if they remove
from these Churches, and have Liberty from a <hi>State</hi> to
Gather into other Churches, to enjoy this and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
this is no Separation.</p>
                  <p>(2.) That it is not a plain and total Separation from
the Rule, unless they Wholly in all things differ, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up altogether different Rules of Constitution, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Government; but they shall practice the most of
the same things; and these the most substantial, which
are found in the <hi>Rule</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p>(3.) That they would maintain Occasional Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with their Churches, not only in Hearing and
Preaching, but Occasionally, in Baptising their Children
in their Churches, and receiving the Lords Supper
there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, Would not all this clear them from the
<hi>Imputation</hi> of <hi>Schism?</hi> Not <hi>agreeing in the main
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95208:87"/>
things?</hi> Not <hi>owning their Churches to be true?</hi> Not
maintaining <hi>Occasional Communion</hi> with them? Let
us hear, what the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Assembly</hi> think of
all this.</p>
                  <p>Thus they <hi>Answer,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That although <hi>Tenderness of Conscience</hi> may
bind Men to <hi>forbear,</hi> or <hi>suspend the Act of Communion</hi>
in that Particular, wherein Men conceive they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>hold Communion</hi> without sin, yet it doth not
bind to follow such a positive Prescript, as possibly
may be divers from the Will and Counsel of God,
of which kind we conceive this of <hi>Gathering Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Churches out of True Churches,</hi> to be one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is one thing to remove to a <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
which is under <hi>the same Rule,</hi> another to a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi>
of a <hi>different Constitution</hi> from the <hi>Rule;</hi> in
the former case a Man retains his Membership; in
the latter he renounceth his Membership upon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Judgment, touching the very <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Churches,</hi> from and unto which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If a <hi>Church</hi> do require that which is evil of
any Member, he must forbear to do it, yet <hi>without
Separation.</hi> They who thought <hi>Kneeling</hi> in the <hi>Act</hi>
of <hi>Communion,</hi> to be unlawful, either in <hi>England,</hi> or
<hi>Scotland,</hi> did not <hi>Separate,</hi> or Renounce <hi>Membership,</hi>
but did, some of them, with Zeal and Learning, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<hi>our Church</hi> against those of the <hi>Separation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:95208:88"/>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Notion of <hi>Separation</hi> is not to be
measured by Civil <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> but by the <hi>Word of
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To leave all <hi>Ordinary Communion</hi> in any
Church with dislike, when Opposition or Offence
offers it self, is to <hi>Separate</hi> from such a <hi>Church</hi> in the
Scripture Sense.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> A <hi>total difference</hi> from <hi>Churches</hi> is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to make a <hi>total Separation;</hi> for the most <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid
Separatists</hi> hold the same rule of <hi>Worship,</hi> and
<hi>Government</hi> with our <hi>Brethren;</hi> and under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<hi>Novatians, Donatists,</hi> all that ever were
thought to Separate, might shelter themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> If they may <hi>occasionally</hi> exercise these
<hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> with us once, a second, or third
time, without sin, we know no reason why it may
not be ordinary without sin; and then <hi>Separation</hi>
and <hi>Church-Gathering</hi> would have been needless. To
<hi>Separate</hi> from those Churches ordinarily and visibly,
with whom occasionally you may joyn without sin,
seemeth to be a most Unjust Separation.</p>
                  <p>To the Second Reason, <hi>The Dissenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
gave these Answers.</p>
                  <p>1. That it was founded upon this supposition, That
nothing is to be tolerated which is unlawful in the
Iudgment of those who are to Tolerate: <hi>Which the</hi>
Divines <hi>of the</hi> Assembly <hi>denied; and said, It was
upon the supposition of the</hi> unlawfulness, to tolerate
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95208:88"/>
gathering of Churches out of true Churches: <hi>which they
do not once endeavor to prove lawful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That if after all endeavors, <hi>Mens Consciences</hi>
are <hi>unsatisfied,</hi> as to Communion with a Church, they
have no Obligation lying upon them to continue in that
<hi>Communion;</hi> or on the Churches to withold them from
removing to purer Churches; or if there be none such to
gather into <hi>Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Assembly</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                  <p>I. That this opened a <hi>Gap</hi> for all <hi>Sects</hi> to challenge
such a Liberty as their due.</p>
                  <p>II. This <hi>Liberty</hi> was denied by the <hi>Churches</hi> of
<hi>New-England;</hi> and they have as just ground to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it as they.</p>
                  <p>To the third <hi>Reason</hi> they Answered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That the abuse of the word Schism hath done
much hurt in the Churches; that the signification of it
was not yet agreed upon by the State, nor debated by
the Assembly.</p>
                  <p>To which the others Reply;</p>
                  <p>That if the word <hi>Schism</hi> had been left out, the
Reason would have remained strong, <hi>viz.</hi> That this
would, give countenance to <hi>Perpetual Division</hi> in the
<hi>Church,</hi> still drawing away <hi>Churches</hi> from under the
<hi>Rule.</hi> And to give countenance to an unjust, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95208:89"/>
causless <hi>Separation</hi> from Lawful <hi>Church Communion,</hi> is not
far from giving countenance to a <hi>Schism;</hi> especially
when the grounds, upon which this <hi>Separation</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
are such, upon which all other possible scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which erring Consciences may, in any other
case, be subject unto, may claim the priviledge of a
like <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and so this Toleration being the
first, shall indeed but lay the foundation, and open
the Gap, whereat as many <hi>Divisions</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi>
as there may be Scruples in the Minds of Men, shall,
upon the self-same Equity be let in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This will give <hi>Countenance</hi> only to <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Peoples</hi> joyning in other <hi>Congregations</hi> for their
greater Edification, who cannot otherwise, without sin,
enjoy all the Ordinances of <hi>Christ;</hi> yet so, as not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
those Churches, they joyn not with, as false;
but still preserving all Christian Communion with the
Saints, as Members of the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> of the
Church Catholick; and joyn also with them in all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Worship,</hi> which belong to <hi>particular Churches,
so far as they are able;</hi> and if this be called <hi>Schism,</hi> or
<hi>Countenance</hi> of <hi>Schism,</hi> it is more then we have yet
learned from Scriptures, or any approved Authors.</p>
                  <p>To this, the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Assembly</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>1. This desired forbearance is a perpetual <hi>Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in the <hi>Church,</hi> and a perpetual drawing away from
the Churches under the <hi>Rule.</hi> For, upon the same
pretence, those who scruple <hi>Infant-Baptism,</hi> may
withdraw from <hi>their Churches,</hi> and so Separate into
another <hi>Congregation;</hi> and so in that some practice
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95208:89"/>
may be scrupled, and they Separate again: Are
these Divisions, and Sub-Divisions, say they, as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as they may be infinite? or, Must we give that
respect to the Errors of Mens Consciences, as to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their Scruples, by allowance of this liberty to
them? And, Doth it not plainly signifie, that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of Conscience is a protection against Schism?</p>
                  <p>2. The not condemning of <hi>our Churches as false,</hi>
doth little extenuate the <hi>Separation:</hi> for, divers of
the <hi>Brownists,</hi> who have <hi>totally separated</hi> in former
times, have not condemned <hi>these Churches as false;</hi>
though they do not pronounce an Affirmative Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against us, yet the very <hi>Separating</hi> is a tacit
and practical condemning of our <hi>Churches,</hi> if not <hi>as
false,</hi> yet <hi>as impure, eous<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan>
                     </hi> as that in such Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
they cannot be by them, as Members, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
with, without sin. And when they speak
of Communion with us, as <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Church
Catholick,</hi> it is as full a declining of <hi>Communion</hi> with
us as <hi>Churches,</hi> as if we were <hi>false Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. We do not think differences in Judgment in
this, or that Point, to be <hi>Schism,</hi> or that every incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
unto every thing used or enjoyned is <hi>Schism,</hi>
so that <hi>Communion</hi> be preserved; or that <hi>Separation</hi>
from <hi>Idolatrous Communion,</hi> or <hi>Worship, ex se</hi> unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
is <hi>Schism:</hi> but to joyn in <hi>Separate Congregations</hi>
of another Communion, which succession of our
Members is a manifest rupture of our <hi>Societies</hi> into
others, and is therefore a <hi>Schism</hi> in the <hi>Body:</hi> and
if the Apostle do call those <hi>Divisions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
wherein <hi>Christians</hi> did not Separate into divers <hi>form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Congregations,</hi> of several Communion in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:95208:90"/>
of the <hi>Lords Supper Schismes,</hi> much more may
such <hi>Separation</hi> as this desired, be so called.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Scruple</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> is no cause of <hi>Separating,</hi>
nor doth it take off <hi>causeless separation</hi> from being
<hi>Schism,</hi> which may arise from <hi>Errors</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi>
as well as carnal and corrupt reasons; therefore we
conceive the causes of Separation must be shewn to
be such <hi>exnaturâ rei,</hi> will bear it out; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we say, that the granting the liberty desired will
give countenance to <hi>Schism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. We cannot but take it for granted upon evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Reason, and Experience of all Ages, that
this <hi>Separation</hi> will be the <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Nurse</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
Strifes, Envyings, Confusions,</hi> and so draw
with it that breach of Love, which may endanger
the heightning of it into formal <hi>Schism,</hi> even in the
sence of our <hi>Brethen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. What is it that approved Authors do call <hi>Schism,</hi>
but the breaking off <hi>Members</hi> from their <hi>Churches,</hi>
which are lawfully constituted <hi>Churches,</hi> and from
<hi>Communion</hi> in <hi>Ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. without just and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cause, <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> to justifie such secession,
and to joyn in other Congregations of Separate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
either because of personal failings in the
Officers, or Members of the <hi>Congregation</hi> from which
they separate, or because of causeless Scruple of
their own Conscience, which hath been called
setting up <hi>altare contra altare:</hi> from which they quote
St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and <hi>Camenon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:95208:90"/>
Thus I have faithfully laid down the <hi>State</hi> of this
<hi>Controversie</hi> about <hi>Separation,</hi> as it hath been mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in former times among us. From whence there
are these things to be considered by us, which may
be of some use in our following Discourse.</p>
                  <p>(1.) That all the old <hi>Non-conformists</hi> did think
themselves bound in Conscience to Communicate
with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and did look upon <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
from it to be Sin, notwithstanding the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
they supposed to be in it. This I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with so great evidence in the forgoing Discourse;
that those who deny it, may, with the help of the
same <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> deny, That the <hi>Sun</hi> shines.</p>
                  <p>(2.) That all Men were bound in Conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
preserving the <hi>Vnion</hi> of the <hi>Church, to go as
far as they were able.</hi> This was not only Asserted
by the <hi>Non-formists,</hi> but by the most <hi>rigid Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
of former times, and by the <hi>Dissenting Brethren</hi>
themselves. So that the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>Separation,</hi>
where <hi>Communion is lawful,</hi> and thought so to be by
the persons who <hi>Separate,</hi> is one of the Newest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of this Age; but what new Reasons they
have for it, besides Noise and Clamour, I am yet
to seek.</p>
                  <p>(3.) That bare <hi>Scruple</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> doth not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
<hi>Separation,</hi> although it may excuse <hi>Non-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
in the particulars which are scrupled; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that they have used the best means for a right
information.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:95208:91"/>
(4.) <hi>That where</hi> occasional Communion is lawful,
constant Communion is a Duty. <hi>Which follows from
the</hi> Divines <hi>of the</hi> Assembly <hi>blaming</hi> the Dissenting
Brethren <hi>for allowing the lawfulness of</hi> occasional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<hi>with our</hi> Churches, <hi>and yet forbearing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Communion with them. For, say they,</hi> to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from those Churches ordinarily and visibly, with
whom occasionally you may joyn, seemeth to be a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
Separation.</p>
                  <p>(5.) <hi>That withdrawing from the</hi> Communion <hi>of a</hi>
True Church, <hi>and setting up</hi> Congregations for purer
Worship, <hi>or under</hi> another Rule, <hi>is</hi> plain and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Separation; <hi>as is most evident from the</hi> Answer
<hi>of the</hi> Divines <hi>of the</hi> Assembly <hi>to the</hi> Dissenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="16" type="section">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. From all this it appears, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Separation</hi> can never be justified, by
the old <hi>Non-conformists Principles;</hi> nor by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>Divines.</hi> The former is clear
from undeniable Evidence, and the latter is in effect
confessed by all my Adversaries.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Baxter</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, p. 89. Dr. <hi>O.</hi> p. 50.</note> For, although they
endeavour all they can, to blind the Readers Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with finding out <hi>the disparity of some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi>
which was never denied; yet not one of
them can deny, that it was their Judgment, <hi>That
the holding of Separate Congregations for Worship,
where there was an agreement in Doctrine, and the
substantials of Religion, was Vnlawful, and Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>
And this was the point, for which I produced
their Testimony in my Sermon: and it still stands
good against them. For their resolution of the case,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95208:91"/>
doth not depend upon the particular circumstances
of that time, but upon General Reasons drawn from
the Obligations to preserve <hi>Vnity</hi> in Churches;
which must have equal force at all times, although
there happen a great variety, as to some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For whether the greater purity of Worship be
pleaded, as to one circumstance, or another, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
case, as to Separation, is the same: whether
the Scruples do relate to some Ceremonies required,
or to other Impositions as to Order and Discipline;
if they be such as they pretend to, a necessity of
Separation on their Account; it comes at last to
the same point. Was it unlawful to desire a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of <hi>Separate Congregations,</hi> as <hi>the Dissenting
Brethren</hi> did, because of <hi>some Scruples of Conscience
in them?</hi> and is it not equally unlawful in others,
who have no more but <hi>Scruples</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> to plead,
although they relate to different things? I will put
this case as plain as possible, to prevent all subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges
and slight evasions. Suppose five Dissenting
Brethren now, should plead the necessity of having
<hi>Separate Congregations,</hi> on the account of very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>Scruples</hi> of <hi>Conscience;</hi> one of them pleads, that
his Company scruple the <hi>use of an imposed Liturgy:</hi>
another saith, His People do not scruple that,
but they cannot bear <hi>the Sign of the Cross, or Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Communion;</hi> a third saith, If all these were
away, yet if their <hi>Church</hi> be not <hi>rightly gather'd</hi> and
<hi>constituted,</hi> as to <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form,</hi> they must have a
<hi>Congregation</hi> of their own; a fourth goes yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and saith, Let their <hi>Congregation</hi> be <hi>constituted</hi>
how it will, if they allow <hi>Infant-Baptism,</hi> they can
never joyn with them; nor, saith a fifth, can we, as
long as you allow Preaching by <hi>set forms,</hi> and your
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95208:92"/>
Ministers stint themselves by <hi>Hour-glasses,</hi> and such
like Human Inventions: Here are now very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>scruples of Conscience;</hi> but, Doth the nature of
the case vary, according to the bare difference of the
<hi>Scruples?</hi> One Congregation scruples any kind of
<hi>Order</hi> as an unreasonable Imposition and restraint of
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is <hi>Separation</hi> on that account <hi>lawful?</hi> No,
say all other Parties against the <hi>Quakers;</hi> because
their <hi>scruples</hi> are <hi>unreasonable.</hi> But is it lawful for a
<hi>Congregation</hi> to separate on the account of <hi>Infant-Baptism?</hi>
No, say the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi>
that is an <hi>unreasonable Scruple.</hi> Is it lawful for Men
to Separate to have greater <hi>purity</hi> in the frame and
order of <hi>Churches,</hi> although they may <hi>occasionally
joyn</hi> in the duties of <hi>Worship?</hi> No, saith the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi>
this makes way for all manner of <hi>Schism's</hi> and
<hi>Divisions,</hi> if meer <hi>scruple</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> be a sufficient
ground for <hi>Separation:</hi> and if they can joyn <hi>occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi>
with us, they are bound to do it <hi>constantly;</hi>
or else the obligation to Peace and Unity in the
Church signifies little: <hi>No Man's Erroneous Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
can excuse him from Schism.</hi> If they alledge
grounds to justifie themselves, they must be such as
can do it <hi>ex naturâ rei,</hi> and not from the meer er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
or mistake of <hi>Conscience.</hi> But, at last, the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
themselves come to be required to joyn with
their Companies in Communion with the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> and if they do not, either they must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
a <hi>separate Congregation,</hi> on the account of their
Scruples, as to the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and then the former
Arguments unavoidably return upon them. (For
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath as much occasion to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
those <hi>Scruples Vnreasonable,</hi> as they do those
of the <hi>Independents, Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Quakers,)</hi> Or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95208:92"/>
else they declare, They can joyn <hi>occasionally</hi> in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with our Church, but yet hold it lawful to
have <hi>separate Congregations</hi> for <hi>greater Purity</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi>
and then the obligation to <hi>Peace and Vnity</hi>
ought to have as much force on them, with respect
to our <hi>Church,</hi> as ever they thought it ought to have
on the <hi>dissenting Brethren,</hi> with respect to themselves.
For no <hi>disparity,</hi> as to other <hi>Circumstances,</hi> can alter
the nature of this Case; <hi>viz.</hi> That as far as Men
judge <hi>Communion lawfull,</hi> it becomes a <hi>Duty,</hi> and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
a Sin; under what denomination soever the
persons pass. For the fault doth not lie in the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,</hi>
but in the nature of the Act; because
then <hi>Separation</hi> appears most unreasonable, when
<hi>occasional Communion</hi> is confessed to be <hi>lawful.</hi> As
will fully appear by the following Discourse. Those
Men therefore speak most agreeably to their present
practice, although least for the <hi>honor</hi> of the <hi>Assembly,</hi>
who confess,<note place="margin">Mischief of Impos. p. 58, 68, 69.</note> 
                     <hi>That they were transported with undue
heats, and animosities against their Brethren; which
deserve to be lamented, and not to be imitated; that

of God ought not to be stayed from doing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments

of the same disobedience and rebellion, if Princes had

                  <p>To the Instance of the Apostles, Giffard <hi>had Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
That they were furnished with an extraordinary

                     <hi>whom they called the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Preachers; these are two.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That the planting, or reforming of <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Church must tarry for the <hi>Civil Magistrate,</hi> and may
not otherwise be brought in by the Word and Spirit of
God in the Mouths of his weakest Servants, except they
have Authority from Earthly Princes; which Doctrine,
<hi>saith he,</hi> is against the Kingly Power of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
<hi>three whole Lines of</hi> Scripture, which he there puts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>2. That it is lawful for a Minister of <hi>Christ</hi> to cease
Preaching, and to forsake his Flock, at the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Lord Bishop: Which Doctrine, <hi>he saith,</hi> is
contrary <hi>to two Lines of Scripture</hi> more, <hi>with the bare
numbers of Chapter and Verse. But, lest it should
be supposed, that these</hi> two <hi>were among those which</hi>
Iacob <hi>saith,</hi> he falsly laid to their charge; <hi>we find
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95208:94"/>
both these Doctrines owned by the several</hi> Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,<note place="margin">Confut. of the <hi>Brown.</hi> p. 51.</note>
                     <hi>who joyned together in a</hi> Confutation <hi>of
the</hi> Brownists. For, <hi>say they,</hi> As to the Peoples power
of Reforming,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> We cannot find any Warrant in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for them that are private Members of any Church,
to erect the Discipline, no not though the Magistrate and
Ministers, who should deal in this work, were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
profane and ungodly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We esteem our Prince to be a most Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Christian Magistrate, and our Ministers to be
true Ministers of <hi>Christ,</hi> and therefore we are justly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
that by enterprising a publick Reformation, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without, but contrary to the direction and liking of
them, who by God's word ought to have, if not the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet the principal hand in that work, we should high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offend God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That for the want of Publick Reformation,
the Magistrate is every where blamed, and no where the
Church, for ought we can find: Oft are the Priests and
People blamed for erecting and practising Idolatry,<note place="margin">Page 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> but
never for that they plucked it not down, when their
Princes had set it up; neither can we find, whether
ever the Church, under a Christian Magistrate, was by
any Prophet, either commanded to deal (otherwise than
by perswasion) in publick Reformation, when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
neglected it; or reproved for the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To the <hi>Instance of the Apostles</hi> they An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
Two things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:95208:95"/>
                     <hi>I.</hi> That though they set up Church-Government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Magistrates leave; yet not contrary to his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
or when he opposed his Authority directly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
it; they never erected the Discipline, when there
was so direct an opposition made against it by the Civil
Magistrates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>II.</hi> If it could be proved that the Apostles did so
then, yet would it not follow, that we may do so now;
for neither was the Heathen Magistrate altogether so
much to be respected by the Church, as the Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
is; neither have our Ministers and People now
so full and absolute a power, to pull down, and set up
Orders in the Church, as the Apostles (those wise Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-builders)
had.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, As to <hi>their Ministers Preaching being Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced,</hi>
they declare,</p>
                  <p>1. So long as the Bishops Suspend,<note place="margin">Page 41.</note> and Deprive, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of the Land, we account of the
Action herein, as of the Act of the Church, which we may
and ought to reverence, and yield unto; if they do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
we have liberty given us by the Law to appeal
from them. If it be said, <hi>the Church is not to be
obey'd when it Suspends and deprives us, for such
causes as we in our Consciences know to be insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi>
We Answer, That it lieth on them to Depose, who
may Ordain; and they may shut that may open. And as he
may, with a good Conscience execute a Ministery, by the
Ordination and Calling of the Church, who is privy to
himself of some unfitness (if the Church will press him
to it) so may he who is privy to himself, of no fault
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95208:95"/>
that deserveth Deprivation, cease from the execution
of his Ministery, when he is pressed thereunto by the
Church. And if a guiltless person, put out of his
Charge by the Churches Authority, may yet continue
in it, What proceedings can there be against guilty
persons, who, in their own conceit, are alwayes guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
or will at least pretend so to be; seeing they will
be ready alwayes to object against the Churches Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That they are called of God, and may not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
give over the Execution of their Ministery at the
will of Bishops?<note place="margin">The Second <hi>Quaere.</hi>

                     <hi>First.</hi> They that Inhibited the Apostles, were known

                  <p>

Gospel, which Commandment might more hardly be

they cannot endure them which teach that part of the
Truth that concerneth the good Government, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Church, yet are they not only content
that the Gospel should be Preached, but are also Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of it themselves.</p>

Authority from Men, nor by the hands of Men, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from God himself, and therefore also might

we exercise a Function, whereof God is the Author, and
we are also called of God to it, yet are we called and

ordained by the hands and Ministery of Men, and may
therefore by the Ministery of Men be also deposed, and

the Book was written by the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> and
that Mr. <hi>Rathband</hi> was only the Publisher of it? This
way of Answering is just, as if one should quote a

another should reply, If <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> said so, it had

                     <hi>When</hi> Fr. Iohnson <hi>said,</hi>

not to suffer themselves to be Silenced and Deposed from
their Publick Ministery, no not by Lawful Magistrates.
<hi>Mr.</hi> Bradshaw <hi>Answered,</hi> This Assertion is false and
seditious. <hi>And when</hi> Iohnson saith, That the Apostles
did not make their immediate Calling from God the
ground of their refusal; but this, that they ought to
obey God rather than Man; which is a Duty required
of all Ministers and Christians. Bradshaw <hi>(a Person
formerly in great esteem with Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commended by the</hi> Author <hi>of the</hi> Vindication <hi>of his
Dispute with</hi> Iohnson) <hi>gives this Answer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:95208:96"/>
1. Though the Apostles did not assign their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Calling from God, as the Ground of their refusal, in
so many Letters and Syllables, yet that which they do
assign, is by Implication, and in effect the same with
it. For it is as much as if they had said, God himself
hath imposed this Calling upon us, and not Man; and
therefore except we should rather obey Man than God, we
may not forbear this Office which he hath imposed upon
us. For, opposing the Obedience of God to the obedience of
Man, they therein plead a Calling from God, and not
from Man; otherwise, if they had received a Calling
from Man, there had been incongruity in the Answer;
considering, that in common sense and reason, they
ought so far forth to obey Men, forbidding them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
a Calling, as they exercise the same by vertue of
that Calling. Else, by this reason, a Minister should not
cease to Preach, upon the Commandment of the Church,
that hath chosen him; but should be bound, to give them
also the same Answer, which the Apostles gave, which
were absurd. So that by this gross conceit of Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
there should be no Power in any sort of Men who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
to depose a Minister from his Ministery; but
that nowithstanding any Commandment of Church or
State, the Minister is to continue in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
                  <p>2. For the further Answer of this his ignorant conceit,
plainly tending to Sedition, we are to know, that though
the Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists, Preached Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
where they were not hindred by open violence;
and did not, nor might not leave their Ministery upon any
Human Authority, or Commandment whatsoever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did not enter into, or exercise the same upon
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95208:97"/>
the will and pleasure of any Man whatsoever; yet they
never erected and planted Publick Churches and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
in the Face of the Magistrate, whether they would
or no; or in despite of them; but such, in respect of the
Eye of the Magistrate, were as private and invisible as
might be.</p>
                  <p>3. Neither were some of the Apostles only forbidden,
so as others should be suffered to Preach the same Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
in their places; but the utter abolishing of Christian
Religion was manifestly intended in Silencing of them.
But our Churches whereof we are Ministers, are no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and secret Assemblies, such as hide themselves from
the Face of a persecuting Magistrate and State; but are
publick, professing their Worship, and doing their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the face of the Magistrate and State; yea, and by
his Countenance, Authority and Protection; and we are
set over those Churches, not only by a Calling of our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but also by the Authority of the Magistrate, who hath
an Armed Power to hinder any such publick action; who
is willing also to permit and maintain other true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Gospel, in those places where he forbiddeth
some. If therefore after our publick calling, to Minister
to such a known and Publick Church, not by the Church
only, but by the Magistrate also, the Magistrate shall
have matter against us (whether just or unjust it skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not) and shall in that regard forbid us to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to our Church; I see not by what Warrant in Gods
Word, we should think our selves bound notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to exercise our Ministery still; except we should
think such a Law of Ministery to lie upon us, that we
should judge our selves bound to run upon the Swords
point of the Magistrate, or to oppose Sword to Sword.
And suppose the Magistrate should do it unjustly, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95208:97"/>
against the will of the Church, and should therein sin;
yet doth not the Church in that regard cease to be a Churh,
nor ought she therein to resist the Will of the Magistrate;
neither doth she stand bound, in regard of her affection
to her Minister (how great and deserving soever) to
deprive her self of the Protection of the Magistrate, by
leaving her publick standing, to follow his Ministery in
private, and in the dark; refusing the benefit of all other
Publick Ministery, which with the leave and liking of
the Magistrate she may enjoy.</p>
                  <p>4. Neither do I know what warrant any ordinary
Minister hath, by Gods Word, in such a case, so to draw
any such Church or People to his private Ministery, that
thereby they should hazard their outward state and quiet
in the Common-wealth where they live; when in some
competent measure they may publickly, with the grace
and favor of the Magistrate, enjoy the ordinary means
of Salvation by another: and (except he have a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to Minister in some Church) he is to be content to
live as a private member, till it shall please God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the Magistrate to him, and to call him again to
his own Church; labouring mean while privately, upon
particular occasions offered, to strengthen and confirm in
the wayes of God, those People that are deprived of his
publick Labour. And I take it to be the duty of the
People, in such a Case, if they will approve themselves
faithful Christians, and good Subjects, so to submit to
the Ministery of another, as that by Prayer, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good, dutiful, and loyal means, they may do their
best endeavor to obtain him, of whom, against their will,
they have been deprived, and still to affect and love him
as their Pastor: now, if the People do thus, then is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95208:98"/>
that Minister called to be Silent, not only by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
but by them also, though with much grief.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Answer to Serm. p. 99.</note> all that Mr.

which the old Non-conformists more complained
of, than <hi>the want of a more Preaching Ministery?</hi>
This then, could not be Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi>'s Reason;
and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> upon second thoughts, cannot be of
that opinion.</p>
                  <p>I have yet one Argument more, to prove this
to have been the general sense of the <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists;</hi>
which is Mr. <hi>Sprints</hi> Argument for <hi>Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in case of Deprivation;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cassand. Anglic. p. 2.</note> Which is, that where two
Duties do meet, a greater, and a less, whereof both
cannot be done at the same time, the lesser duty
must yield unto the greater; but this Doctrine of
suffering Deprivation for not Conforming, teacheth,
and the practice thereof causeth, to neglect a greater
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95208:98"/>
duty for performing of a less; therefore it seemeth
to be an Error in Doctrine, and a Sin in Practice.
The force of which Argument doth necessarily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
That Ministers, deprived by Law, are not to
exercise their Ministerial Function in opposition to
the Law's. And to confirm this, several <hi>Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi>
undertook to Answer this Argument, and
to give an account of the disparity of the case, as to
the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, and ours. For Mr. <hi>Sprint</hi> had ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the instance of the <hi>Apostles</hi> to this purpose, since
they submitted to <hi>Iewish Ceremonies</hi> rather than lose
the liberty of their Ministery, they ought to yield
to our <hi>Ceremonies</hi> on the same ground; to which
they Answer; <hi>That the Apostles had far greater reason
so to do;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 232<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>because their Ministery was of far greater
excellency, and usefulness, and therefore the Argument
was of much greater weight with the Apostles, than it
could be with them. For,</hi> say they, <hi>What one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Gospel is there, that dare be so presumptuous,
as to say, That his Preaching and Ministery can be of
that necessity, and use for the Glory of God, and good
of his Church; as was the Ministery of his Apostles? The
work whereunto the Lord called and separated the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
(viz. <hi>the planting of the Church, and the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gospel to all Nations) was such, as could not
have been performed by any other, but the Apostles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
but in deprivation of our Ministers that refuse
conformity, there is no such danger, and of their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there can be no such necessity imagined; though they
Preach not, the Gospel is Preached still, and that
soundly, and fruitfully.</hi> Did these Men think, the
<hi>Apostles Woe be unto me if I Preach not the Gospel,</hi> did
reach to their case? Can Mr. <hi>B.</hi> imagine, that such
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95208:99"/>
Men thought themselves still bound to Preach, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were silenced by our Laws?</p>
                  <p>And now, I hope, I have proved that to be <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi>
True, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith was <hi>notoriously false.</hi>
But if after all this, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will persist, in saying,
<hi>That he knew those who did otherwise;</hi> all that I have
to say to it, is, That I hope Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> Acquaintance,

in the foregoing
<hi>Discourse,</hi> to shew, How
far the <hi>present Dissenters</hi>
are gone off from the
Principles of the <hi>old
Non-conformists;</hi> I come
to consider, What those
<hi>Principles</hi> are, which they now proceed upon;</p>
                  <p>And those are of Two sorts.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Of such as hold</hi> partial, and occasional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with our Churches to be lawful; but not total
and constant, <hi>i. e. they judge it lawful at</hi> some times
<hi>to be present in</hi> some part <hi>of our</hi> Worship, <hi>and upon
particular occasions to partake of</hi> some acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<hi>with us; but yet, they apprehend</hi> greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and edification in separate Congregations, and when
they are to choose, they think themselves bound to choose
these, <hi>although at</hi> certain seasons <hi>they may think it</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:95208:100"/>
lawful <hi>to submit to</hi> occasional Communion <hi>with our</hi>
Church, <hi>as it is now established.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Of such as hold</hi> any Communion with our
Church to be unlawful, <hi>because they believe</hi> the Terms
of its Communion unlawful; <hi>for which they instance,</hi>
in the constant use of the Liturgy; the Aereal sign of the
Cross; kneeling at the Communion; the observation of
Holy-dayes; renouncing other Assemblies; want of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
in our Churches; and depriving the People of
their Right in choosing their own Pastors.</p>
                  <p>To proceed with all possible clearness in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we must consider these Three things, 1. What
things are to be taken for granted by the several par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
with respect to our <hi>Church.</hi> 2. Wherein they
<hi>differ</hi> among themselves about the nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of <hi>Separation</hi> from it. 3. What the true State
of the present <hi>Controversie</hi> about <hi>Separation,</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>I. In General, they cannot deny these <hi>three</hi>
things.</p>

1. <hi>That there is no</hi> Reason <hi>of</hi> Separation, <hi>because
of the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of our</hi> Church. <hi>This was confessed

                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>saith,</hi> We agree with our Brethren
in the Faith of the Gospel; and we are firmly united
with the main Body of Protestants in this Nation, in

We are one with the Church of <hi>England</hi> as to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,

Mr.</hi> A. <hi>after many trifling cavils, acknowledges,</hi> That
the Dissenters generally agree with that Book which is
commonly called the 39 Articles,<note place="margin">Mischief of Imposition. Preface.</note> which was compiled
above a Hundred years ago; and this Book some Men
call the Church of <hi>England. I know not who those
Men are, nor by what Figure they speak, who call a</hi>

of the Church of England <hi>is contained therein;</hi>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:95208:101"/>
and whatever the opinions of private persons may be,
this is the <hi>Standard</hi> by which the <hi>Sense</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi>
is to be taken: And that no objection ought to be
made, against <hi>Communion</hi> with our <hi>Church,</hi> upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it; but what reaches to such

                  <p>3. That <hi>Communion</hi> with our Church hath been
still owned by the <hi>Protestant</hi> and <hi>Reformed Churches</hi>
abroad. Which they have not only manifested, by
receiving the <hi>Apology</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> into

the <hi>Harmony</hi> of <hi>Confessions;</hi> but by the <hi>Testimony</hi>
and <hi>Approbation</hi> which hath been given to it, by the

and by the discountenance which they have still gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Communion</hi> of it. This
Argument was often objected against the <hi>Separatists,</hi>
by the <hi>Non-conformists;</hi> and <hi>Ainsworth</hi> attempts to
Answer it no less than Four times in one <hi>Book;</hi> but
the best Answer he gives,<note place="margin">Counterpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, p. 9. 10, 27, 51, 92.</note> is, <hi>That if it prove any

                  </p>
                  <p>Some do seem to allow <hi>Separate Congregations</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>in such places where the Churches are not capable to
receive the Inhabitants.</hi> For this I find insisted on, by

almost all my Answerers;<note place="margin">Letter out of the Country, p. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>Some Parishes,</hi> saith one,

                     <hi>The Parish Ministers are not near
sufficient for so populous a City,</hi> saith a third. And
yet not one of these, but assignes such reasons, for
<hi>the necessity of Separate Congregations,</hi> as would equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold, if there were never a <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> but
what would hold all the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> together. This
is therefore but a <hi>color,</hi> and <hi>pretence,</hi> and no <hi>real
Cause.</hi> Any one would think, by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
so very much, <hi>on the greatness and largeness of
our Parishes, as the Reason of his Preaching in separate
Congregations,</hi> this were his opinion, <hi>that such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
are only allowable in such vast Parishes, where
they are helps to the Parochial Churches:</hi> And no Man
denies, that more places for Worship are desireable,
and would be very useful, where they may be had,
and the same way of Worship and Order observed
in them, as in our <hi>Parochial Churches;</hi> where they
may be under the same Inspection, and Ecclesiastical
Government; where, upon pretence of greater <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Worship,</hi> and <hi>better means of Edification,</hi> the
People are not drawn into <hi>Separation.</hi> But, is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> should think the case alike, where
the <hi>Orders</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> are constantly neglected,
the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> is slighted and contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and such <hi>Meetings</hi> are kept up in affront to
them, and the Laws? Would Mr. <hi>B.</hi> have thought
this a sufficient Reason for Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> to have set up
a <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> because
it is <hi>a very large Parish?</hi> Or for <hi>R. Williams</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi>
to have set up a <hi>Separate Congregation</hi> at

                     <hi>Boston,</hi> because there were but <hi>three Churches</hi> there,
to receive all the numerous Inhabitants? If such a
number of <hi>Churches</hi> could be built, as were suitable
to the <hi>greatness,</hi> and <hi>extent</hi> of <hi>Parishes,</hi> we should be
so far from opposing it, that we should be very <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
to those who would accomplish so excellent a
Work: but, in the mean time, Is this just and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
to draw away the <hi>People,</hi> who come to our
<hi>Churches,</hi> under the pretence of <hi>Preaching</hi> to those
who cannot come? For, upon consideration, we
shall find,</p>
                  <p>(1.) That this is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own case. For, if
we observe him,<note place="margin">Answ. to Let. p. 24.</note> although he sometimes pretends
<hi>only to Preach to some of many thousands, that cannot
come into the Temples, many of which never heard a
Sermon of many years;</hi> and to this purpose he put so
many Quaere<hi>'s</hi> to me, concerning <hi>the largeness of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
and the necessity of more Assistants,</hi> thereby to
insinuate, <hi>That what he did, was only to Preach to
such, as could not come to our Churches;</hi> yet, when he
is pinch'd with the point of <hi>Separation,</hi> then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
<hi>That his hearers are the same with ours; at least
10 or 20 for one;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ans. to Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, p 17. Answer to Sermon, p. 57.</note> 
                     <hi>and that he knows not many (if
any) who use to hear him, that Separate from us.</hi> If
this be true, as no doubt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> believes it, then
what such mighty <hi>help,</hi> or <hi>assistance</hi> is this to our
<hi>great Parishes?</hi> What color, or pretence is there from
the <hi>largeness</hi> of them, that he should Preach to the
<hi>very same persons,</hi> who come to our <hi>Churches?</hi> And
if such <hi>Meetings</hi> as theirs be only lawful <hi>in great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
where they Preach to some of many thousands
who cannot come into the Churches,</hi> Then how come
they to be lawful, where few or none of those <hi>many

thousands</hi> ever come at all, but they are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the very same Persons, who come to our
<hi>Parish Churches?</hi> These two pretences then are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with each other; and one of them cannot
hold. For if he doth Preach <hi>to those who come to our
Churches, and scarce to any else (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then all the pretence from the <hi>large<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ess of
our Parishes, and the many thousands who cannot come
to our Churches,</hi> is vain and impertinent; and, to
Speak Softly, not becoming Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>(2.) That if this were Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own case, viz.
<hi>That he Preached only to such, as could not come to our
Churches,</hi> it would be no defence of the <hi>general pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
of <hi>Dissenters,</hi> who express no regard at all to
the <hi>greatness</hi> or <hi>smallness of Parishes.</hi> As, if it were
necessary, might be proved, by an <hi>Induction</hi> of the
particular <hi>Congregations</hi> within the <hi>City;</hi> and in the
<hi>adjacent Parishes.</hi> Either those <hi>separarate Meetings</hi>

but not <hi>with all Churches, in all Duties, or at all times.</hi>
These things must be more particulary explained, for
a right understanding the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>present Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi>
Which proceeds not so openly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as the <hi>old Separation</hi> did; but hath such artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
windings and turnings in it, that a Man thinks
they are very near our <hi>Church,</hi> when they are at a
great distance from it. If we charge them with fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the <hi>steps</hi> of the <hi>old Separatists,</hi> we utterly
deny it, for, say they; <hi>For they separated from your
Churches as no true Churches; they disowned your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
and Hierarchy as Antichristian, and looked on
your Worship as Idolatrous;</hi> but we do none of these
things; and therefore you charge us unjustly with
<hi>Separation.</hi> To which I Answer,</p>
                  <p>(1.) <hi>There are many still, especially of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who pursue the Principles of the</hi> old Separatists;
<hi>of whom Mr</hi> B. <hi>hath spoken very well in his</hi> Cure of
Divisions, <hi>and the</hi> Defence <hi>of it; and elsewhere. Where
he complains,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cure of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis. p. 393.</note> of their Violence, and Censoriousness:
their contempt of the Gravest and Wisest Pastors; and
forcing others to forsake their own judgments to comply
with their humors. <hi>And, he saith,</hi> A sinful humoring
of rash Professors, is as great a Temptation to them, as
a sinful compliance with the Great Ones of the World.
<hi>In another place he saith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sacrileg. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, p. 102. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> The People will not endure
any Forms of Prayers among them, but they declare
they would be gone from them, if they do use them. <hi>And
he doth not dissemble, that they do comply with
them, in these remarkable words,</hi> Should the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in London, that have suffer'd so long, but use any
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95208:104"/>
part of the Liturgy and Scripture Forms, though
without any Motive but the pleasing God and the
Churches good, What Muttering and Censuring would
then be among them? And Woe to those few Teachers
that make up their Designs by cherishing these Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
One would think, that their warning had been
fair; but, <hi>Si nati sint ad bis perdendam Angliam;</hi> The
Lord have Mercy upon us.</p>
                  <p>(2.) When the matter is throughly examined,
the difference between the <hi>Teachers,</hi> and the <hi>old
Separatists,</hi> will be found not near so great as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
For what matter is it, as to the <hi>nature</hi> of
<hi>Separation,</hi> whether the <hi>terms</hi> of our <hi>Communion</hi> be
called <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> or <hi>Vnlawful;</hi> whether the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>
of our <hi>Church</hi> be called a <hi>False Ministery,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient,

to the Institution of Christ.</hi> Now these are the
very same Arguments, which the <hi>old Separatists</hi> used,
only they are disguised under another appearance,
and put into a more fashionable dress. As will be

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95208:104"/>
saith,</hi> It is Schismatical in a Church to deny Baptism,
without the Transient Sign of the Cross, or for want of

scruple kneeling.<note place="margin">Page 45.</note> 
                     <hi>Now, if the</hi> Church <hi>be</hi> Schismatical,
<hi>then those who Separate in these things are not. For
saith Mr.</hi> B. When the Laity cannot have their Children
Baptized without such use of the Transient Dedicating
Image of the Cross;<note place="margin">Answ. to Serm p. 49.</note> and such use of Entitling and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting
Godfathers, which they take to be no small sin;
Is it Separation to joyn with Pastors that will otherwise
Baptize them? <hi>We see the</hi> Church <hi>is</hi> Schismatical <hi>in
requiring these things, and Mr.</hi> B. <hi>thinks</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
bound to joyn with other Pastors that will not use
them; <hi>And what is this but</hi> formal Separation? But
for all this, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may hold, that total renouncing of
Communion with our Church may be Schismatical; for,
<hi>he saith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plea for Peace, p. 47.</note> it may be Schism to Separate from a Church
that hath some Schismatical Principles, Practises, and
Persons, if those be not such, and so great, as to necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
our departure from them. <hi>But here Mr.</hi> B. <hi>saith,</hi>
There is a necessity of departure, and to joyn with other
Pastors; <hi>and therefore he must hold a</hi> formal Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>And as to</hi> the renouncing total Communion with
our Church, <hi>that was never done by the greatest</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists.
<hi>For they all held</hi> Communion <hi>in</hi> Faith <hi>with
it: And even</hi> Brown, <hi>the</hi> Head <hi>of the</hi> old Separatists,
<hi>thought it lawful to joyn with our</hi> Church <hi>in</hi> some
Acts of Worship; <hi>and others thought, they might joyn
in</hi> Acts <hi>of</hi> private <hi>and</hi> Christian Communion, <hi>but not</hi>
in Acts of Church Communion; <hi>others thought it</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>to joyn</hi> in hearing Sermons <hi>and</hi> Pulpit Prayers,
<hi>though not in others; and yet were charged with</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<hi>by the</hi> old Non-conformists. <hi>And if our</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Dissenters <hi>do hold the</hi> terms of Communion <hi>with
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95208:105"/>
our</hi> Church <hi>to be</hi> unlawful; <hi>they must hold a</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
<hi>of</hi> Separation, <hi>or that persons may be good</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
<hi>and yet be no</hi> Members <hi>of any</hi> Church. <hi>For,
if it be unlawful to</hi> communicate <hi>as</hi> Members of our
Church, <hi>they must either not</hi> communicate <hi>at all as</hi>
Members <hi>of any</hi> Church, <hi>or as</hi> Members <hi>of a</hi> distinct
<hi>and</hi> Separate Church <hi>from ours. If they declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
Members <hi>of</hi> another Church, <hi>they own as plain
a</hi> Separation, <hi>as the</hi> old Separatists <hi>ever did: if they
do not, and yet hold it</hi> unlawful <hi>to</hi> Communicate <hi>with
our</hi> Churches <hi>as</hi> Members, <hi>then they are</hi> Members <hi>of
no</hi> Church <hi>at all. So that, if they hold the</hi> terms <hi>of
our</hi> Communion unlawful; <hi>they must either be</hi> Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists,
<hi>or</hi> no good Christians <hi>upon their own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>

                     <hi>For, saith the</hi> Author <hi>of</hi> the Letter out of the
Country; this were to exchange visible Christianity, for
visible (at least Negative) Paganism. <hi>Now, that our</hi>
present dissenters <hi>do hold the</hi> terms of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
unlawful, <hi>they are more forward to declare, than
I could have imagined. In my</hi> Sermon <hi>I mentioned
some passages, wherein it seemed clear to me, that
some considerable persons among them</hi> did allow
Lay communion with our Church to be lawful: <hi>But
they have taken a great deal of pains to undeceive
me; some declaring in express terms,</hi> That they look
on the terms of our Communion as unlawful, and that
there is a necessity of Separation from our Parochial
Churches, and of joyning to other Congregations. <hi>And
others saying,</hi>

is unlawful; Communion in some parts of Worship is
so, in others not. And, 3. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y will further tell us,
That Communion with some Parish chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ches is lawful,
with others unlawful; that there are not the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
Preached, the same Ceremonies urged, the same
rigid terms of Communion in all Churches exacted. And
lastly, that occasional Communion is, or may be lawful,
where a stated and fixed Communion is not so; and
they give this Reason for their Iudgment and practice,
because to hold Communion with one Church, or sort of
Christians, exclusively to all others, is contrary to their
true Catholick Principles, which teach them to hold
Communion, though not equally, with all tolerable
Churches; and that there are some things tolerable,
which are not eligible, wherein they can bear with
much for Peace sake, but chuse rather to sit down or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
with Purer Administrations. <hi>Here we have
the</hi> Principles <hi>of the</hi> New Separation <hi>laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Many of them <hi>hold Communion with our Church
unlawful;</hi> and that must be understood of any <hi>kind</hi>
of <hi>Communion;</hi> for the Second sort, from whom
they are distinguish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, hold <hi>total Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful;</hi>
and therefore this first sort must hold <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in any parts of Worship unlawful.</hi> And so they
exceed the more moderate <hi>Separatists</hi> of <hi>Robinson</hi>'s,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95208:106"/>
and the <hi>New-England</hi> way; and must fall into the
way of the most <hi>rigid Separatists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Those that <hi>do hold Communion lawful,</hi> do it
with so many <hi>restrictions</hi> and <hi>limitations,</hi> that in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
it amounts to little more than the other. For
<hi>First,</hi> It is only with <hi>some Churches;</hi> and those it
seems must be such, as do not hold to our <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
for he saith, <hi>The same Ceremonies are not urged
in all Churches, nor the same rigid terms of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
exacted,</hi> i. e. If any <hi>Churches</hi> among us comply
with them, they can <hi>Communicate</hi> with them, <hi>i. e.</hi>
if <hi>they break their own Rules,</hi> they can joyn with
them. Is not this an admirable way of <hi>Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
with our <hi>Churches?</hi> But, if our <hi>Churches</hi> hold
to their <hi>Rule,</hi> and observe the <hi>Orders</hi> prescribed,
then it seems they renounce all <hi>Communion</hi> with
them as <hi>unlawful.</hi> And what is this but to deny
<hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> For unless
<hi>Parochial Churches</hi> depart from the <hi>terms</hi> of <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
required by it, they will have no <hi>Communion</hi>
with them.</p>
                  <p>And Mr. <hi>A.</hi> delivers this, not only as his own
Opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">Mischief of Impositions, p. 65.</note> but as the Sense of the Party, <hi>That if most
of the Preachers in the Separate Meetings were Asked
their Iudgments, about the Lawfulness of Ioyning with
the Parochial Churches in all the parts of Worship, or
in any exclusive to their joyning with other Assemblies,
where the Gospel Rule is more strictly observed, they
would flatly deny it.</hi> And he goes yet further, when
he saith, <hi>That the People cannot lawfully Separate
from those Churches whereof they are regularly Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and from those Pastors, under whose Ministerial
Conduct their own Free Election hath placed them, to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95208:106"/>
joyn ordinarily and constantly with any other particular
Churches.</hi> This is owning a plain and downright
<hi>Separation,</hi> in as clear and distinct words as ever <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
or <hi>Ainsworth</hi> did. For, 1. He makes it to be
their general sense, <hi>That it is unlawful to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with our Churches ordinarily and constantly,</hi> or to
be <hi>Members</hi> of our <hi>Churches:</hi> Which is the same thing
which they said. 2. He ownes the setting up new and
distinct Churches in plain opposition to ours. For he
owns <hi>other Pastors, other People,</hi> and a new <hi>Relation
between</hi> these, by the <hi>choice</hi> of the one, and the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi>
of the other. This is no mincing the matter, as
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> often doth; but he speaks it boldly, and with
great assurance; and ushers it in with, <hi>I have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
contrary to his.</hi> I think no Man doubts of his
<hi>Confidence,</hi> that ever looked into his Book; but in
this matter he is so brisk, that he saith, <hi>He doth not
question that he should carry it by the Poll.</hi> And is
withall so indiscreet as on this occasion to Triumph
<hi>in the Poll of Non-conformists at Guildhall:</hi> as though
all who gave their Votes there, had owned these
Principles of <hi>Separation,</hi> for which, many of those
Gentlemen will give him little thanks, and is a very
unseasonable boasting of their Numbers.</p>
                  <p>(II.) All the difference then that seems to be
left, is about the lawfulness of that which they call
<hi>Occasional Communion.</hi> As to which, these things are
to be observed. (1.) That it is practised by <hi>very
few;</hi> especially if Mr. A<hi>'s. Poll</hi> be allowed. (2.) That
it signifies little, as to this matter, if Men be fixed
<hi>Members</hi> of other Churches. For the denomination
of their <hi>Communion</hi> is to be taken from thence, and
not from an <hi>Occasional</hi> and <hi>accidental Presence.</hi> For
<hi>Communion</hi> with a <hi>Church,</hi> is joyning with a <hi>Church</hi> as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95208:107"/>
a <hi>Member</hi> of that <hi>Church:</hi> And it is not <hi>occasional
Presence</hi> at <hi>some parts of Worship,</hi> which makes a Man
a <hi>Member</hi> of a <hi>Church.</hi> I suppose there are many <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally
present</hi> at Mr. <hi>A's,</hi> or Mr. B's <hi>Meetings,</hi> who
renounce all <hi>Communion</hi> with them. A <hi>Protestant</hi>
may be <hi>occasionally present</hi> at <hi>some parts of Worship</hi> in
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and that frequently too, <hi>to hear
Sermons,</hi> &amp;c. but, Doth this make a Man to have
<hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi> Most of our
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> who have Travelled abroad, have been
thus <hi>occasionally present</hi> in <hi>some parts of the Romish
Worship,</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Paris;</hi> but they would think
themselves hardly dealt with, to be charged to have
had <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> And if
they be urged with it, they will plead still, <hi>They were
of the Protestant Communion;</hi> and the Reason they
will give, is, because they did not joyn with them
<hi>in all parts</hi> of their <hi>Worship;</hi> not in <hi>adoration of the
Host,</hi> or <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images;</hi> and therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
still of the <hi>Protestant Communion,</hi> although
they were <hi>occasionally present</hi> at <hi>some parts</hi> of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Service.</hi> And Is it not the same case here, If
Men only afford an <hi>occasional Presence,</hi> at <hi>some parts
of our Worship?</hi> How comes this to make them more
to have <hi>Communion</hi> with our <hi>Church,</hi> than the like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
would make them to have <hi>Communion</hi> with the
<hi>Roman Church?</hi> In the beginning of Q <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign,
most of the <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>England</hi> did offer an <hi>Occasional
Presence</hi> at our <hi>Churches,</hi> in <hi>some parts of our Worship;</hi>
and yet all that time were Members of the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> because they kept their <hi>Priests,</hi> and had <hi>Mass</hi>
in private, and declared, That though they looked on
our <hi>Service</hi> as <hi>tolerable,</hi> yet they thought the Roman
<hi>more eligible;</hi> and so having <hi>Full Communion</hi> with
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95208:107"/>
that, and being only <hi>occasionally present</hi> at our <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
they thought themselves good <hi>Catholicks.</hi> So,
if Men do look on the <hi>Separate Meetings</hi> as <hi>more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,</hi>
and <hi>a better way of Worship;</hi> with which they
<hi>constantly joyn,</hi> and <hi>alwayes choose</hi> to do it, their <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional
Presence</hi> at our Assemblies, doth not make
them <hi>Members</hi> of our <hi>Churches,</hi> but they still remain
<hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Separate Congregations,</hi> if they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
full and constant Communion with them. And
none of the formed <hi>Separate Churches</hi> will look on
any one as having <hi>Communion</hi> with them, for being
<hi>occasionally present at some parts of their Worship;</hi> for
they say, That <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> may have such
<hi>occasional Communion</hi> with them; but they require

their <hi>Churches,</hi> a <hi>Submission</hi> to <hi>all the Rules</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
among them. The <hi>New-England Churches</hi> will
suffer no Man to continue a <hi>Member</hi> of their <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
that scruples <hi>Infant Baptism,</hi> or <hi>refuses to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the Administration of it;</hi> although he be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so willing to be <hi>occasionally present</hi> at all other
parts of <hi>Worship</hi> with them. For not only <hi>openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
and opposing Infant-Baptism, but going about
secretly to seduce others from the approbation or use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
or purposely departing the Congregation at the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of that Ordinance,</hi> is liable, by their <hi>Laws,</hi>
to the <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Banishment.</hi> And they have found
it so necessary to twist the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests</hi>
together, that as none but <hi>Church-Members</hi> are
<hi>Free-men</hi> among them; so none that are <hi>banished</hi> can
retain their <hi>Church-Membership.</hi> From all this, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that this <hi>new Notion</hi> of <hi>Occasional Communion,
in some parts of Worship.</hi> exclusively to others, is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned
by all sorts of <hi>Churches;</hi> and is a late fancy

                     <hi>The benefit of Christian Love
and Concord may make it best, for certain seasons, to
joyn even in defective Modes of Worship, as</hi> Christ <hi>did
in the Synagogues and Temple in his time: though the least
defective must be chosen, when no such accidental Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
sway the other way.</hi> From whence we may take
notice, (1.) That no obligation to the <hi>Peace</hi> and
<hi>Vnity</hi> of this Church, as they are <hi>Members</hi> of it,
doth bring them to this <hi>occasional Communion</hi> with it,
but a certain Romantick Fancy of <hi>Catholick Vnity;</hi>
by which these <hi>Catholick Gentlemen</hi> think themselves
no more obliged to the <hi>Communion</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi>
than of the <hi>Armenian</hi> or <hi>Abyssine Churches.</hi> Only it
happens, that our <hi>Church</hi> is so much nearer to them,
than the others are, and therefore they can afford it
more <hi>occasional Communion.</hi> But I would suppose
one of these Men of <hi>Catholick Principles</hi> to be at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
where he might have <hi>occasional Communion</hi>
with all sorts of the <hi>Eastern Churches;</hi> and some of
the <hi>Members</hi> of those <hi>Churches</hi> should Ask him,
What <hi>Church he is Member of?</hi> If he should Answer,
He could have <hi>occasional Communion</hi> with all <hi>tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Churches,</hi> but was a <hi>fixed Member</hi> of none:
Would they take such a Man for a <hi>Christian?</hi> What,
a <hi>Christian,</hi> and a <hi>Member</hi> of no <hi>Church!</hi> That, they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95208:108"/>
would all agree, was no <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Catholick Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
And I much doubt, whether any of them
would admit such a <hi>one</hi> to <hi>occasional Communion,</hi> that
could not tell what <hi>Church</hi> he was Member of. For,
as to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> he declares, <hi>That he
holds only occasional Communion with that,</hi> as he would
do with any other <hi>tolerable Churches.</hi> But, Were they
not <hi>Baptized</hi> in this <hi>Church,</hi> and received into <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with it as <hi>Members</hi> of it? if so, then if they
Communicate no otherwise with it, than as a <hi>tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
defective Church,</hi> they must renounce their former
<hi>Membership;</hi> for that did oblige them to <hi>fixed</hi> and
<hi>constant Communion</hi> with it. And if they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their <hi>Membership</hi> in this <hi>Church,</hi> their <hi>occasional
Presence at some duties of Worship</hi> can never excuse
them from Separation. We thank them, that they
are pleased to account <hi>our Churches tolerable,</hi> but we
cannot see, how in any <hi>tolerable sense</hi> they can be
accounted <hi>Members</hi> of our <hi>Church;</hi> so that this great
favor of <hi>occasional Communion,</hi> which they do not
chuse but submit to <hi>for some accidental reasons,</hi> and
some very good <hi>occasions,</hi> is not worth the speaking
of among Friends; and so far from looking like
<hi>Communion,</hi> that it hath hardly the face of a <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) That, <hi>if the least defective way of Worship is
to be chosen,</hi> as they say, then this <hi>occasional Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
cannot be <hi>lawful</hi> above <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice</hi> in a Man's
Life: For that is sufficient to shew their <hi>true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Principles;</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> faith, <hi>When no such acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Reasons do sway, they are to choose the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
way of Worship;</hi> or as Mr. <hi>A.</hi> speaks, <hi>To sit
down ordinarily with purer Administrations.</hi> If then
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95208:109"/>
a Man be bound, <hi>out of love to his Soul, to prefer the
best way of Worship,</hi> and he judges the <hi>way of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Congregations</hi> to be <hi>such,</hi> there will arise a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
case of Conscience, concerning the <hi>lawfulness</hi>
of this <hi>occasional Communion.</hi> For the same <hi>Reasons,</hi>
which moved him to prefer one <hi>Communion</hi> above
the other, will likewise induce him to think himself
bound to adhere <hi>constantly</hi> to the one, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the other. And why should a Man, that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>purer Administrations,</hi> give so much
countenance to a <hi>defective way of Worship,</hi> and have
any Communion with a Church which <hi>walks so disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,</hi>
and contrary to the Rules of the Gospel; and
<hi>not reprove her rather,</hi> by a total forbearance of her
<hi>Communion?</hi> And why should not those general
Rules of <hi>approving the things that are more excellent,</hi>
and <hi>holding fast that which is good, and not forsaking
the Assembling themselves together,</hi> perswade such a
Man, that it is not <hi>lawful</hi> to leave the <hi>best Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
meerly to shew, what <hi>defective, and tolerable
Church he can communicate with?</hi> Which is, as if a
Man should forsake his <hi>Muskmelons,</hi> to let others
see what <hi>Pumpions</hi> he can swallow; or to leave whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som

                  </p>

And how just soever the reason were, they

this is now the main support of the <hi>present Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>

either they must own the Principles of the <hi>old Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists,</hi>
which they are unwilling to do, or find out
others to serve their turn; but they are such, as no

Is this the truth of the case indeed? Then, for

most confident and self-conceited, and none so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
give way to their Ignorant Zeal, to Censure,
Backbite, and Reproach others, as those that know not
what they talk of.</hi> Let now any Reader judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the stating of the case by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself,
their having <hi>better means of Edification,</hi> can be the
ground of leaving <hi>our Churches,</hi> to go to <hi>Separate
Congregations,</hi> unless <hi>injudiciousness, and self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
confidence and an ignorant zeal</hi> may perhaps be
more edifying to some capacities, and to some pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
than <hi>judicious and well studied Sermons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Argument must therefore be quitted; and
they who will defend the <hi>present Separation,</hi> must
return to the <hi>old Principles</hi> of the <hi>Separatists,</hi> if they
will justifie their own <hi>practices.</hi> And so I find Mr.
<hi>B.</hi> is forced to do; for discerning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the pretence
of <hi>greater Edification</hi> would not hold of it self, he
adds more weight to it, and that comes home to the
business;<note place="margin">Answ. p. 18.</note> viz. <hi>That the People doubt of the Calling of
the obtruded Men.</hi> This is indeed an Argument for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95208:112"/>
                     <hi>Separation,</hi> and the very same, which <hi>Barrow,</hi> and
<hi>Greenwood,</hi> and <hi>Iohnson,</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> and <hi>Can</hi> used.
Now we are come to the old Point of defending
the <hi>Calling of our Ministry;</hi> but we are mistaken, if
we think they now manage it after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
We do not hear so much the old terms of a
<hi>False and Antichristian Ministry;</hi> but if they do
substitute others in their Room as effectual to make
a <hi>Separation,</hi> but less fit to justifie it, the difference
will not appear to be at all to their advantage.</p>

                     <hi>I. In General, they declare,</hi> That they only look
on those as true Churches, which have such Pastors
whom they approve. How oft have I told you, <hi>saith
Mr.</hi> B. that I distinguish,<note place="margin">Answer to my Sermon, p. 63.</note> and take those for true
Churches, that have true Pastors. But I take those
for no true Churches, that have,
<list>
                        <item>1. Men uncapable of the Pastoral Office.</item>
                        <item>2. Or not truly called to it.</item>
                        <item>3. Or that deny themselves to have the power
essential to a Pastor.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>And one or other of these he thinks most, if not
all the <hi>Parochial Churches</hi> in <hi>England</hi> fall under.</p>

                     <hi>You will say then, Mr.</hi> B. is a Rigid Separatist;
and thinks it not lawful to joyn with any of our Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Congregations: but this is contradicted by his own
Practice.</p>
                  <p>There lies therefore a farther subtilty in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for he declares in the same place, <hi>he can joyn
with them</hi> notwithstanding. But how? <hi>as true
Churches, though he saith they are not?</hi> No; but as
<hi>Chappels and Oratories, although they be not Churches, as
wanting an essential part.</hi> This will bring the matter
to a very good pass, the <hi>Parish Churches</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
shall only be <hi>Chappels of Ease</hi> to those of the <hi>Non-conformists.</hi>
This I confess is a Subtilty beyond the
reach of the old <hi>Brownists,</hi> and <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> for
they both took it for granted that there was sufficient
ground for <hi>Separation, if our Churches were not true
Churches,</hi> and the Proof of that depended on the
<hi>Truth</hi> of our <hi>Ministry.</hi> Now, saith Mr. <hi>B. Although
our Parochial Congregations be not true Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they want an essential part,</hi> viz. <hi>a true Ministry,
yet he can joyn with them occasionally, as Chappels or
Oratories.</hi> From whence it appears, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
not our <hi>Parochial Churches as true Churches,</hi>
nor doth communicate with them <hi>as such;</hi> but only
looks on them as <hi>Publick places of Prayer,</hi> to which
a Man may resort upon occasion without owning any
relation to the <hi>Minister,</hi> or looking on the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
as a <hi>Church.</hi> For, where he speaks more fully,
he declares, That he looks <hi>on none as true Churches,
but such as have the Power of the Keys within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sacrileg. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert. p. 34.</note>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95208:113"/>
to be <hi>a true Church,</hi> and none else. So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
our <hi>Parochial Churches and Ministers</hi> assume to
themselves <hi>Episcopal Power,</hi> in opposition to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Constitution</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> as he apprehends, he
at once discards them all from being <hi>true Churches:</hi>
but I shall afterwards discover his mistake as to the
<hi>nature</hi> of our <hi>Parochial Churches;</hi> that which I only
insist on now is, That he looks on none of them as
<hi>truly constituted Churches,</hi> or as he calls it, <hi>of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Organized Form,</hi> as wanting <hi>an essential part,</hi>
viz. a <hi>true Pastor.</hi> From hence it necessarily follows,
either that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> communicates with <hi>no true Church
at all;</hi> or it must be <hi>a Separate Church;</hi> or, if he
thinks himself bound to be <hi>a Member of a true
Church,</hi> he must proceed to as a great <hi>Separation</hi> as the
old <hi>Brownists</hi> did, by setting up <hi>new Churches</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

case, to say, <hi>That Mr.</hi> B. <hi>doth it not;</hi> for we are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to shew, what he is obliged to do by vertue of
his <hi>own Principles:</hi> which tend to as much <hi>Separation,</hi>

about <hi>the Ministerial Knowledge or utterance of

them to be Judges of that; but I never heard
before, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did bid People <hi>turn away</hi> from

Are not the <hi>People</hi> admirable Judges? How

in the World is not so little, as not to know and be

thing he should thus subject the Judgment of <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial

these? But suppose they do allow their <hi>Ministers</hi>
to pass for men of tolerable <hi>abilities,</hi> and reasonable
<hi>good utterance,</hi> there is a harder task yet behind, and
that is, to approve themselves to the <hi>People</hi> to be
<hi>Sound and Orthodox;</hi> For, saith Mr. <hi>B. (2) If they
be Heretical,</hi> they may without sin separate from

him so; <hi>i.e.</hi> if he crosseth their humor, and delivers
such Doctrine as doth not please them; for that is
generally their <hi>Standard</hi> for <hi>Heresie?</hi> And they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well have any other; unless you will suppose
all the People to be learned Divines, and every Man
obliged to read and understand <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Bini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi>

what shall we say to him, if under pretence of

their Ignorance, Injudiciousness, Pride and Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedness,
they are their grief and their shame; that
they are endanger'd by Divisions, principally because the
selfconceited part of the Religious People will not be
ruled by their Pastors; that it is they that tempt the

and that sin which Non-conformists fear, and fly
from, which maketh it harder to us that desire it to draw
many good People to Communion with Conformists than
it was of old.</hi> No doubt of it, if you give such
broad intimations as these are, what a horrible scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
sin <hi>Conformity</hi> is. Nay, he maketh it an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable
sin,</hi> when he saith, in the Preface to his
<hi>Plea, That more like Truth hath been said for the lawfulness
of Anabaptistry, Poligamy, Drunkenness, Stealing, and
Lying, in case of necessity, than any thing he ever yet

<hi>but drawing on our selves the guilt of many thousand

he could find out 40 or 50 as <hi>tremendous aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi>
of the <hi>Sin of Separation.</hi> For never did any

                     <hi>That be the

differ with him about the Existence of God and Christ,
a Heaven and Hell.</hi> Which I have found too true,
by my experience in this case, for without any colour
or pretence in the World that I know of, but only
by declaring against <hi>Separation,</hi> he tells me, <hi>That he
is so far past doubt, on the other side, as that he thinks
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95208:119"/>
I overthrow all Religion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answ. p. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>and set up Man in Rebellion

say, which I never said or thought, <hi>That all Publick
Worship is sinful, when forbidden:</hi> and then on he
runs with a mighty torrent, <hi>Daniel may go to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the Martyrs, Fathers, Counsels, the Vniversal

I wonder he did not give me 30 <hi>tremendous
aggravations</hi> of <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Hobbism.</hi> For he doth
in effect charge me with them; For it follows, <hi>It's
strange that he can be sure, God's Word is true, and
yet be so sure, that Mens Laws are above it, and may
suspend it.</hi> Did I ever in my life say the least thing
tending that way? I abhor and detest such <hi>Principles,</hi>
as set <hi>Mans Laws above Gods.</hi> And when I gave
him the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Controversie</hi> about <hi>Separation,</hi> I
supposed <hi>an Agreement in all the Substantials of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
between the dissenting Parties and our Church.</hi> How
then could he possibly infer from hence, that I set
<hi>Man's Laws above Gods?</hi> The Question is not, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>all Publick Worship be sinful, when forbidden?</hi>
but whether in a Nation professing <hi>true Religion,</hi> some
<hi>publick Worship</hi> may not be <hi>forbidden?</hi> If not, then
an universal, unlimited toleration of <hi>Turks, Iews,
Papists, Socinians, Ranters,</hi> &amp;c. must follow. If
<hi>some</hi> may be <hi>forbidden,</hi> then another Question fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>viz.</hi> Whether such <hi>Publick Worship,</hi> as may
have an evil in it, antecedent to that <hi>Prohibition,</hi>
may not be forbidden? <hi>viz.</hi> such as tends to <hi>Idolatry,
Sedition, Schism,</hi> &amp;c. and if this be allowed, then it
comes to this at last, Whether such <hi>Meetings</hi> are
guilty of any of these <hi>faults;</hi> and if they be, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Magistrate</hi> so judging may not justly forbid
them? And this is the utmost that matter can be
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95208:119"/>
driven to; which I here mention, to let the Reader
understand, what little cause there is to dread Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s
30 <hi>Aggravations of the Sin of Conformity;</hi> which are
built on as slight grounds as this heavy charge against
me; for the sake of which I shall hardly ever dread
his <hi>aggravations</hi> more. But the sting of these <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi>
follows. <hi>If the People think, (though they
should mistake) that all the Conformists are guilty of
the like,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answ. p. 50.</note> 
                     <hi>Can you wonder, if they prefer less Guilty Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors

the true <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Separation</hi> is come out at last.
Our <hi>Conformity</hi> is a <hi>horrible, scandalous sin</hi> with them,
and therefore they must choose <hi>better Pastors.</hi> Is
not this just the old <hi>Brownists</hi> Argument? <hi>The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of the Church of</hi> England <hi>is a corrupt and sinful
Ministery, and therefore we must not communicate with
them, but choose more honest and faithful Guides:</hi> But
let me ask Mr. <hi>B.</hi> supposing all this to be true, Is it
<hi>lawful</hi> to communicate with <hi>Conformists</hi> or not? If it
be not <hi>lawful,</hi> then he condemns his own practice,
and takes away <hi>occasional communion;</hi> if it be lawful,
How comes <hi>Separation</hi> to be <hi>lawful,</hi> since, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>lawful,</hi> but when it is <hi>necessary?</hi> as it will be

them Schismaticks, because they do it not.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The bottom of all this, is, they are <hi>Vsurpers</hi> to
whom the People do not <hi>consent</hi> in any particular
Parish; although the whole Nation in <hi>Parliament</hi>
consented to the passing of a <hi>Law</hi> for removal of
some <hi>Pastors,</hi> and putting in of others. And what
dangerous consequences there may be of such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
as these, I leave others to Judge. For upon
these grounds, when <hi>Salomon</hi> deprived <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and
put <hi>Zadok</hi> in his room;<note place="margin">1 Kings 2. 35.</note> any part of the People might
have pleaded, <hi>They never consented to</hi> Zadok<hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        </gap>riest still; let</hi>
Salomon <hi>do what he would; he could not dissolve the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95208:120"/>
relation between them,</hi> without <hi>their own consent.</hi> For
the Question is not, Whether <hi>Abiathar</hi> did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be put out, but to whom it belonged to do
it, whether to the <hi>King,</hi> or the <hi>People?</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any part of the <hi>People</hi> might still own that <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
which he had before to them, without palpable
<hi>disobedience</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> of <hi>Authority?</hi> Especially
if the <hi>People</hi> had given their <hi>own consent,</hi> and the thing
had been done not only by <hi>Salomon,</hi> but by the <hi>States</hi>
of <hi>Israel;</hi> as it was in our case. They who discern
not the ill consequences of such Assertions as to our
<hi>Government,</hi> have very little insight into Affairs. For
it follows, that a small part of the People may disown
the <hi>Publick Acts of Parliament,</hi> and <hi>choose</hi> other <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,</hi>
to themselves in opposition to those establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

there is no more colour for the <hi>Peoples</hi> resuming their
<hi>right,</hi> especially a <hi>small part</hi> against the whole, in

some cases, but not in theirs.</hi> Is not this a <hi>Plea</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all? For whoever thought themselves <hi>justly
ejected?</hi> Or that they did any thing which deserved
so severe a punishment? What then is to be done
in this case, if Men think themselves unjustly cast
out? The old <hi>Non-conformists</hi> said, <hi>They ought to sit
down quietly; with this satisfaction, that there were
others to Preach the Word of God soundly, although
they did not.</hi> They might by joyning in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

                     </gap>s these,
<hi>That the Magistrate had no rightful power to eject them,
That others are Vsurpers who come in their places, That
the People are still bound to own them in their former
relation notwithstanding the Laws, And that 'tis Schism to
separate from them,</hi> notwithstanding that they confess
<hi>the True Religion is maintained and preached in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95208:121"/>
Assemblies,</hi> I leave it to others to determine how
consistent such Principles are with the <hi>submission</hi> Men
owe to <hi>Government,</hi> or that <hi>peaceable behaviour</hi> which
becometh Christians. This I the rather insist upon,
because I find not only Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>A.</hi> asserting
it, but that it is made the <hi>standing Plea</hi> for the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>
of the <hi>present Separation,</hi> among those who do
not hold all <hi>Communion</hi> with our <hi>Churches unlawful.</hi>
So the latest of my <hi>Answerers makes a Question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they can be said to erect new Churches,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rector of <hi>Sutton</hi> &amp;c. p. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>or proceed
to the forming of separate Congregations, who were true
Ministers, and had their Congregations before others
came into their places? If they had done nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of ejection, or exclusion from their Ministry, whether
they have not still a right to exercise their Function. And
consequently, whether others may not as justly be said
to draw away their People from them, as they are
charged with the same practice?</hi> There is not one
word in all this <hi>Plea</hi> but might have equally served
the <hi>Papists</hi> in the <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> For
the Law signifies nothing with them in any case
where themselves are concerned, if Ministers be eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without or against Law, they who come into
their places are no Usurpers; and if they are cast
out by Law, they that succeed them are Usurpers;
so that the Law is always the least thing in their
consideration.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>All those who come into any</hi> Pastoral
charge, <hi>whether</hi> Bishops <hi>by vertue of the</hi> Kings No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
<hi>or others by the</hi> Presentation <hi>of</hi> Patrons,
<hi>are</hi> Vsurpers, <hi>unless the</hi> People <hi>be pleased to give
their</hi> free consent; <hi>and if they do it not, they may</hi>
lawfully withdraw <hi>from them.</hi> For, <hi>saith Mr.</hi> B. the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95208:122"/>
People have an antecedent Right to consent,<note place="margin">Plea, p. 55.</note> which none
can take from them.<note place="margin">Answ. p. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>And he saith,</hi> he hath proved it
by many Canons, that he was no Bishop, that was not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
by the Clergy and the People; or came in without
the Peoples consent. <hi>Nay, if they have the consent
of</hi> some, <hi>and not of the greater part, those who did
not consent, may proceed to choose</hi> another Bishop,
<hi>if Mr.</hi> B. <hi>say true. For these are his words.</hi> If a
Diocess have a Thousand or 600, or 300 Parish Pastors,<note place="margin">Plea, p. 81, 82.</note>
and a Hundred thousand or a Million of People (or
50000 or 20000, as ye will suppose) and if only a
dozen or 20 Presbyters, and a Thousand People (or
none) chuse the Bishop, this is not the Election or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Diocesan Church; nor is it Schism for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand to go against the Votes of two thousand.
<hi>Therefore if they have so much the advantage in</hi>
polling, <hi>as Mr.</hi> A. <hi>suggests, there is nothing hinders
them, but that in spite of Laws, they may proceed
to the choice of</hi> new Bishops, <hi>and</hi> new Pastors <hi>of</hi>
Churches, <hi>wherever they think they can make the</hi>
Majority. <hi>For this is</hi> an inherent and unalterable
right in the People, <hi>say they,</hi> to choose their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.
<hi>Again, saith Mr.</hi> B. <hi>in the name of the Party
in his Plea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> If Bishops that have no better a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>i.e. that come in by the Kings Nomination, and
not by the Majority of the People,</hi> shall impose infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Pastors or Presbyters on the Parish Churches, and
command the Peoples acceptance and obe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

they give them Institution upon a Patrons presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
the People are not bound to accept and obey them
by any Authority that is in that command as such; nor
is it Schism to disobey it, no more than it is Treason to
reject the Vsurper of a Kingdom. <hi>It is plain then,
all</hi> Bishops <hi>of the</hi> Kings Nomination, <hi>all</hi> Ministers
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95208:122"/>
                     <hi>presented by</hi> Patrons <hi>are meer</hi> Vsurpers: <hi>the</hi> People
<hi>may give them a good</hi> Title <hi>if they please; but they
are not to blame if they do it not.</hi> For in them, <hi>Mr.</hi>
B. <hi>saith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answ. p. 49.</note> the chief Power is, <hi>and sometimes he tells
them,</hi> they are bound to Separate; <hi>however,</hi> while
they do not consent, they are no Churches, which they
are set over;<note place="margin">Plea, p. 82.</note> and it is no Schism so to pronounce them;
nor to deny them Communion proper to a Church. <hi>Is
not this an excellent</hi> Plea for Peace; <hi>and the</hi> true
and only way of Concord, <hi>which lays the foundation
for all imaginable Disorders and Confusions, only
that they might have some pretence for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>

have gained the consent <hi>(implicit</hi> at least) of the
People, and so are no <hi>Vsurpers,</hi> yet if they be <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,</hi>
or <hi>Ithacian Prelatists,</hi> i.e. if they either act
towards, or approve of the <hi>Silencing Non-conformists,</hi>
the <hi>People</hi> may <hi>Separate</hi> from them. When Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
wrote the <hi>Defence</hi> of his <hi>Book,</hi> called, <hi>The Cure of
Divisions,</hi> to satisfie the <hi>People</hi> who were much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased

he Asks about his Book, is, <hi>Is there a word to
perswade you to Communion with Persecutors?</hi> As
though that had been an unpardonable Crime. In
the <hi>Plea</hi> he saith, <hi>If any Excommunicate persons for
not complying with them in sin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plea, p. 42.</note> i.e. Conformity, <hi>but
also prosecute them with Mulcts, Imprisonments, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
or other Prosecution, to force them to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
this were yet more heinously aggravated Schism:
and therefore it is no sin to Separate from such.</hi> And
how easily Men are drawn in to the guilt of this
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95208:123"/>
                     <hi>persecution,</hi> appears by the example he makes of me,
for although I expresly set aside <hi>the case of Ministers,</hi>
and declared, <hi>I intended only to speak of Lay-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answ. p. 61.</note>
yet he charges me <hi>with engaging my self in the
Silencing design.</hi> And by such consequences, all that
speak against <hi>Separation</hi> may be Separated from, as

our Communion to be sinful,</hi> they say, <hi>the Schism doth not
lye on those that Separate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plea, p. 42.</note> 
                     <hi>but on those that do impose
such terms;</hi> and therefore they may <hi>lawfully separate</hi>
from such <hi>imposers.</hi> This is the most <hi>colourable Plea</hi>
hath been yet used by them. But in this case, we
must distinguish between <hi>terms of communion</hi> plainly
and <hi>in themselves sinful;</hi> and such which are only
<hi>fancied</hi> to be so through <hi>prejudice,</hi> or <hi>wilful Ignorance,</hi>
or <hi>error</hi> of <hi>Conscience.</hi> That there is a real distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between these two, is evident; and that it ought
to be considered in this case, appears from hence,
that else there can be no <hi>sinful separation</hi> under an <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Conscience.</hi> As suppose some men should
think that <hi>Preaching by an hour-glass, and much more
Praying by one, was a stinting of the Spirit in point of
Time, as Praying by a Form was in point of words;
and all Men should be required to begin the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
at such an Hour, and so end at such an
Hour; time</hi> being a <hi>necessary circumstance,</hi> our
Brethren grant, that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> or <hi>Church</hi>
may <hi>lawfully</hi> determine it. Here is then <hi>a
lawful imposition;</hi> and yet the <hi>Quakers</hi> may <hi>really judge
it to be sinful;</hi> and declare they cannot communicate
unless this <hi>sinful Imposition</hi> be removed; For it is
against their <hi>Consciences</hi> to have <hi>the Spirit limited to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95208:123"/>
any certain time;</hi> On whose side doth the <hi>Schism</hi> lie
in this case? Not <hi>on the Imposers,</hi> because they grant
such an <hi>imposition lawful;</hi> therefore it must lie on those
that <hi>Separate,</hi> although they judge <hi>such terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
sinful.</hi> If therefore the determination of
other things not forbidden be really as much in the
<hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Churches Power,</hi> as the necessary <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of time and place,</hi> &amp;c. then mens appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
such <hi>terms of Communion to be sinful</hi> will not
hinder the <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>Separation</hi> from <hi>lying</hi> on their side,
and not on the <hi>imposers.</hi> Because it is to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
that where there is no <hi>plain prohibition,</hi> men may
with ordinary care and judgment, satisfie themselves
of the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of things required. As for instance,
when the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> imposeth the <hi>Worship</hi> of
<hi>Images,</hi> we have the <hi>plain prohibition</hi> of the <hi>Second
Commandment</hi> to prove that it is really a <hi>sinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Communion;</hi> but when our <hi>Church</hi> requireth
the <hi>constant use of a Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which
are now pleaded as <hi>sinful conditions of Communion,</hi>
Where is the <hi>prohibition? In the same Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi>
say some. I desire them to read it over to
me. They do so. Where, say I, are the words that
forbid a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies? I am mistaken,</hi> they
tell me, <hi>it is not in the words, but in the sense.</hi> I Ask,
How we should come by the sense, but from the
words? <hi>Yes,</hi> they say, <hi>there are certain Rules for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
the Commandments.</hi> Are they <hi>Divine</hi> or
<hi>Human?</hi> Where are they to be found? What are
those <hi>Rules? One,</hi> they say, is, <hi>that where any thing
is forbidden, something is commanded.</hi> So say I, there
is here a Command to Worship God without an
Image. What is there more? <hi>Yes,</hi> say they, (1.) <hi>That
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95208:124"/>
we must not Worship God with our own Inventions;
now Liturgies and Ceremonies are Mens Inventions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
But, I say, no <hi>Inventions are condemned</hi> in the <hi>Worship</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> but such as <hi>God</hi> himself hath <hi>somewhere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden;</hi>
but he hath no where forbidden these. And
<hi>human Inventions</hi> are forbidden in this <hi>Commandment</hi>
in the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> but then (1) They are
such <hi>inventions</hi> which go about to <hi>represent God,</hi> and
so to disparage him; and no other <hi>inventions</hi> are to
be understood, than the <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, <hi>i.e.</hi> not such which are consistent with the
Spiritual and Invisible nature of God. (2.) They
are not such as do relate to the <hi>manner</hi> or <hi>form</hi> of
<hi>Worship,</hi> supposing the <hi>Worship</hi> it self be performed
in a way <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and <hi>Law.</hi> For
otherwise all use of mens inventions, as to <hi>Preaching,</hi>
or <hi>Reading,</hi> or <hi>Interpreting Scripture,</hi> would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.
And then this <hi>interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Second
Commandment</hi> would be <hi>unlawful,</hi> because it is a <hi>meer
Invention of Men;</hi> as much as <hi>Liturgies,</hi> or <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this we see, what <hi>stretching</hi> and <hi>forcing</hi> of
<hi>Scripture</hi> there must be, to make <hi>Liturgies</hi> or <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
unlawful terms</hi> of <hi>Communion;</hi> And that Men
must first blind and fetter their Minds by certain <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices</hi>
of <hi>Education,</hi> or <hi>Reading</hi> only one sort of
<hi>Books,</hi> and taking some things for granted which they
ought not, before they can esteem the <hi>terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
required by our <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>sinful:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Schism</hi> doth not lye on the <hi>Imposers</hi> side, but
upon those who suffer themselves first to be so easily
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95208:124"/>
Deluded, and then Separate from our <hi>Church</hi> upon
it. But there is another plain instance in this case,
wherein our <hi>Brethren</hi> themselves will not allow the
<hi>Schism</hi> to lie on the <hi>imposers side;</hi> and that is of
those who deny the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>Infant-Baptism.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of whom pretend to do it with as much <hi>sincerity</hi>
and <hi>impartiality,</hi> as any of our <hi>Brethren</hi> can deny
the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>Liturgy</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> if they break
<hi>Communion</hi> rather than allow what they judge to be
<hi>sinful,</hi> On whose side doth the <hi>Schism</hi> lie, on theirs
that require the allowance of it, as a <hi>condition</hi> of
<hi>Communion,</hi> or not? If on the <hi>Imposers side,</hi> they
must condemn themselves, who blame the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
for their <hi>Separation.</hi> And so did <hi>Fr. Iohnson,</hi>
and so did the <hi>New-England Churches.</hi> From whence
it appears, that they do all agree, that where Men
through <hi>mistake</hi> do judge those to be <hi>sinful terms of
Communion</hi> which are not, the guilt of <hi>Schism</hi> doth
not lie <hi>on the imposers side,</hi> but on those that <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi>
Therefore, this matter of <hi>Schism</hi> cannot be
ended by the <hi>Plea</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> judging the <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be sinful,</hi> but by evident and convincing
Proofs that they are so; but till these are brought
forth, which never yet were, or ever will be, they
must bear the <hi>blame</hi> of the <hi>Schism,</hi> if they <hi>Separate</hi>
on these accounts.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have faithfully represented the <hi>Principles</hi>
of those who allow <hi>occasional Presence</hi> in our <hi>Churches,</hi>
rather than <hi>Communion</hi> with them; which I have
discover'd to be of that Nature, as leads Men to the
greatest <hi>Separation.</hi>

not in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or any proper <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
This I have shewed, was the Opinion of
<hi>Robinson,</hi> and the <hi>New-England Churches;</hi> and was
lately owned by Mr. <hi>Ph. Nye,</hi> who Wrote a Discourse
about it, and answered all Objections. Yea, he goes

                     <note place="margin">Mischief of Impos. P. 48.</note> And so much may
satisfie Mr. <hi>A.</hi> too, who, after his trifling manner,
talks of a <hi>bellum Parochiale,</hi> as though Men were so
weak to charge one another with <hi>Separation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they meet in <hi>different Parishes;</hi> but as to the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95208:126"/>
Gird he gives about a <hi>Bellum Episcopale,</hi> I desire
him only to look into the <hi>Evangelium armatum</hi> for
an Answer to it.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>I do not mean by Separation any</hi> difference in
Doctrine, <hi>not determin'd by our Church, upon
which Men do not proceed to divide from the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<hi>of it: And I wonder, who ever did. But
Mr.</hi> B. <hi>is pleased to make another</hi> Quaere <hi>about it.
To this I shall Answer him in Mr.</hi> Hales <hi>his words:</hi>
While the Controversies in <hi>Holland</hi> about Praedestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Tract of Schism, p. 3.</note>
went no farther th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the Pen-combats, the Schism
was all that while unhatcht; but assoon as one party
swept an old Cloyster, and by a pretty art made it a
Church, by putting a new Pulpit in it for the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
party there to meet, that which was before a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
became a formal Schism.</p>
                  <p>3. By <hi>Separation</hi> I do not mean any <hi>difference in
Modes of Worship</hi> allowed by the <hi>Church</hi> in whose
<hi>Communion</hi> we live. This is to Answer Mr. <hi>B's.</hi> Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
concerning <hi>the difference between Cathedral and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Churches; and publick and private administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Sacraments.</hi> But this sticks much with Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
who takes his hints from Mr. <hi>B.</hi> which he cooks and
dresses after his Facetious manner, that they may go
off the better with the common people. And a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pleasant representation he endeavors to make of
the difference of the <hi>Cathedral Service</hi> from that in
<hi>Countrey Parishes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mischief of Impos. p. 48, 49.</note> But what is all this to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
If the same Man puts on finer Clothes at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
than he wears in the <hi>Countrey,</hi> Is he not the
same Man for all that? Are not <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Psalms the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95208:126"/>
same,</hi> whether they be <hi>Sung,</hi> or <hi>Said?</hi> Or whether
<hi>Sung</hi> in a <hi>Cathedral Tune,</hi> or as set by a <hi>Parish Clerk?</hi>
That which only looks like Argument (and my business
is to mind nothing else; possibly others may call him
to an account for his unbecoming way of Writing)
That I say which looks like Argument is, <hi>That some
things are done without Rules in our Parish Churches,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mischief of Impos. p. 53.</note> 
                     <hi>as
the universal practice of Singing Psalms in</hi> Hopkins
<hi>and</hi> Sternholds <hi>Metre;</hi> and therefore they may do
things without <hi>Rules</hi> and yet not be <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
This proceeds upon a mistake, for in the
first establishment of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> upon the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
under <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. allowance was made for
the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> as they were to be Sung in
<hi>Churches</hi> distinct from the <hi>use</hi> of them as <hi>part</hi> of the
<hi>Liturgy;</hi> and from thence that custom hath been so
universally practised. But suppose there are some
Customs receiv'd without <hi>Rules;</hi> suppose there are
some different <hi>Customs</hi> among us; What is this, <hi>to
the denying the lawfulness of constant Communion
with our Churches? To the choosing of new Pastors?</hi> and
sitting <hi>down,</hi> as he speaks, <hi>with purer Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi>
All which this Man owns in his Book, as
their avowed Principles and Practices; and yet hath
the confidence to parallel their <hi>Separation</hi> from our
<hi>Church,</hi> with the <hi>different Modes</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> among
our selves. He must have a very mean opinion of
Mens understandings, that thinks to deceive them
in so gross a manner.</p>
                  <p>4. By <hi>Separation</hi> I do not understand a
<hi>meer difference as to the way of Worship, which the
Members of foreign Churches are here permitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</hi>
For they do not break off from the <hi>Communion</hi>
of our <hi>Churches;</hi> but have certain priviledges allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95208:127"/>
them, as acting under the <hi>Rules</hi> of those <hi>Churches</hi>
from whence they came. But what have we to do
to judge the Members of other Reformed Churches?
Our business is with those who being Baptized in this
<hi>Church,</hi> and living under the <hi>Rules and Government</hi>
of it; either renounce <hi>the Membership</hi> they once had
in it, or <hi>avoid Communion</hi> with it as <hi>Members,</hi> and
joyn with other <hi>Societies</hi> set up in opposition to
this <hi>Communion.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answ. p. 46. 60, 87.</note> Yet this matter about <hi>the Foreign
Churches</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mentions again and again; as
though their case could be thought alike, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
departed from ours, but only continue in the
Communion of their own Churches.</p>
                  <p>5. I do not charge <hi>every disobedience to the
King and Laws and Canons in matters of Religion,
Government and Worship with the Guilt of Separation.</hi>
For although a Man may be guilty of culpable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
in breaking the <hi>Commands</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answ. p. 47.</note>
and the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> he lives in; yet if he
continues in all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> with our <hi>Church,</hi>
and draws not others from it upon mere pretence of
<hi>greater Purity of Worship, and better means of Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
I do not charge such a one with <hi>Schism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. I do not charge those with <hi>Separation,</hi>
who under <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> or <hi>Arian Princes</hi> did keep up
the Exercise of true Religion though against the
<hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate.</hi> But what is this to our case,
where the <hi>true Religion</hi> is acknowledged, and the
<hi>true Doctrine of Faith</hi> owned by the <hi>dissenters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
who break off <hi>Communion</hi> with our <hi>Churches.</hi>
Wherefore then doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> make so many Quaeres,<note place="margin">Answ. 15, 52, 53, 84.</note>
                     <hi>about the case of those who lived under Heathen Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors?
or the Arian Emperors, or Idolatorous Princes?</hi>
I hope, he did not mean to Parallel their own Case
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95208:127"/>
with theirs; for, What horrible reflection would
this be upon our <hi>Government,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
established among us? To what end doth he
mention <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Hunericus that cut out of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Tongues,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answ. p. 21.</note> and several other unbecoming Insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
when God be thanked, we live under a most
merciful Prince, and have the <hi>true Doctrine of the
Gospel</hi> among us, and may have it still continued, if
Mens great <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> as well as other crying Sins,
do not provoke God justly to deprive us of it.
What need was there, of letting fall any passages
tending this way? when I told him in the very State
of the <hi>Question,</hi> that all our <hi>Dispute</hi> was, <hi>Whether
the upholding Separate Meetings for Divine Worship,
where the Doctrine established, and the substantial
parts of Worship are acknowledged to be agreeable to
the Word of God, be a Sinful Separation or not?</hi> Why
is this Dissembled and passed over? And the worst
cases imaginable supposed, in stead of that which is
really theirs? If I could defend a Cause by no other
means, I think Common Ingenuity, the Honor of
our Prince and Nation, and of the <hi>Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
Professed among us, would make me give it
over.</p>

from the <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>Separation.</hi> Which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by these things,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First.</hi> Bare <hi>occasional Communion</hi> makes no Man the
<hi>Member</hi> of a <hi>Church.</hi> This term of <hi>occasional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
as far as I can find, was invented by the
<hi>Dissenting Brethren</hi> to give satisfaction to the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi>
who charged them with <hi>Brownism:</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
this charge, they declared, <hi>That the Brownists
held all Communion with our Parochial Churches unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
which they did not; for,</hi> said they, <hi>we can occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
Communicate with you;</hi> but this gave no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of satisfaction to the other Pary, as long as they
upheld <hi>Separate Congregations,</hi> with whom they would
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95208:128"/>
                     <hi>constantly Communicate;</hi> and accounted those their
<hi>Churches,</hi> with whom they did joyn as <hi>Members</hi> of
the same Body. But if notwithstanding this <hi>lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of <hi>occasional Communion</hi> with our <hi>Churches,</hi> they
joyned with other <hi>societies</hi> in <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>constant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;</hi>
it was a plain Argument they apprehended
something so bad or defective in our <hi>Churches,</hi>
that they could not joyn as <hi>Members</hi> with
them; and because they saw a necessity of joyning
with some <hi>Churches</hi> as <hi>Members,</hi> they pleaded for
<hi>separate Congregations.</hi> And so, must all those do, who
think it their <hi>duty</hi> to be members of any <hi>Churches</hi> at
all; and not follow <hi>Grotius</hi> his Example, in suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Communion</hi> from all <hi>Churches.</hi> Which is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
I do not find any of our <hi>dissenting Brethren</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to own.<note place="margin">Answ. p. 64.</note> Although Mr. <hi>B.</hi> declares,<note place="margin">Page 24.</note> 
                     <hi>That he

                     <hi>that he
Baptized none in 20 years; and gave the Lords Supper
to none in 18 years.</hi> I desire to know, what <hi>Church</hi>
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath been of all this time. For as to <hi>our
Churches,</hi> he declares, That he thinks it <hi>lawful</hi> to
Communicate with us <hi>occasionally;</hi> but not as <hi>Churches</hi>
(for he thinks we want an <hi>essential part,</hi> viz. <hi>a Pastor
with Episcopal Power,</hi> as appears before) <hi>but as Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories;</hi>
and so he renounces Communion with our
<hi>Churches</hi> as <hi>Churches;</hi> and for other <hi>Churches,</hi> he saith
<hi>he hath gathered none, he hath administred Sacraments
to none in 18 years;</hi> and if he hath not joyned as a
<hi>Member</hi> in constant <hi>Communion</hi> with any <hi>separate
Church,</hi> he hath been so long a <hi>Member</hi> of no <hi>Church</hi>
at all. It is true, he hath <hi>Pray'd occasionally,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the Sacrament occasionally</hi> in our <hi>Oratories,</hi> but
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95208:129"/>
not as a <hi>Member</hi> of our <hi>Churches;</hi> he hath <hi>Preached
occasionally to separate Congregations,</hi> but <hi>he hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d
no Church, he hath Administred no Sacraments
for 18 years together.</hi> So that he hath <hi>Prayed occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in one place,</hi> and <hi>Preached occasionally</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but hath had no <hi>Communion</hi> as <hi>Member</hi> of a
<hi>Church</hi> any where. But I wonder, how any Man
could think such a <hi>necessity lay upon him to Preach,</hi>
that <hi>Woe was unto him if he did not;</hi> and yet appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
none <hi>to Administer the Sacraments</hi> for so long
together; none, to joyn himself as <hi>a Member to any
Church.</hi> Is it possible for him <hi>to think it Sacriledge
not to Preach;</hi> and to think it no fault, not to give
the <hi>Sacraments</hi> to others, nor to receive <hi>one</hi> of
them himself as a <hi>Communicant</hi> with a <hi>Church?</hi> Was
there not the <hi>same devotedness,</hi> in Ordination to the
<hi>faithful Administration of Sacraments,</hi> as to Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Gospel?</hi> Was not the <hi>same Authority,</hi> the <hi>same
charge</hi> as to both of them? Was there not the <hi>same
promise</hi> and <hi>engagement to give faithful diligence to
Minister the Doctrine and Sacraments?</hi> Is there an
indispensable obligation to do one part of your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and none at all to the other? Is this possible,
to perswade impartial Men, that for 18 years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you thought your self bound <hi>to Preach against
the Laws;</hi> and yet never thought your self bound to
do that, which you were as solemnly obliged to do as
the other? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> knows very well in <hi>Church-History,</hi>
that <hi>Presbyters</hi> were rarely allowed to Preach, and not
without leave from the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and that in some of
the <hi>Churches</hi> he most esteems too; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>African;</hi>
but they were constantly bound to Administer the
<hi>Sacraments;</hi> so that, if one obligation were stricter
than the other, that was so which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> dispensed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95208:129"/>
with himself in, <hi>for 18 years together;</hi> and why he
might not as well in the other, is not easie to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
However, Why all this while, no <hi>Constant
Communicant</hi> with any <hi>Church?</hi> What, no <hi>Church</hi>
among us fit for him to be a <hi>Member</hi> of? No Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon a <hi>Christian</hi> to that, equal to the <hi>necessity</hi>
of <hi>Preaching?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things must seem very strange, to those who
judge of Christian Obligations, by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and
the <hi>Vniversal Sense</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Christian
Church</hi> in the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>purest Ages.</hi> To what purpose
is it to dispute about the <hi>true notion</hi> of <hi>an Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Church for personal presential Communion;</hi> if men
can live <hi>for 18 years together</hi> without joyning in
<hi>Communion</hi> with any such <hi>Church?</hi> What was this
<hi>Communion</hi> intended for? The antient <hi>Churches</hi> at
this rate, might easily be capacious enough for their
Members, if some never joyned with them in so
long a time. <hi>But he hath communicated occasionally
with us:</hi> Yes, to shew, what <hi>defective and tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Churches he can communicate with,</hi> but not <hi>as a
Member,</hi> as himself declares; and this <hi>occasional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
makes him none.<note place="margin">Mischief of Impos. P. 85.</note> For Mr. <hi>A.</hi> saith, <hi>Their
occasional Communion with us, is but like any of our
occasional Communion with them: or occasional hearing
of a weak Preacher; or occasional going to a Popish
Chappel;</hi> which no one imagines makes the Persons
Members of such Congregations. If therefore Men
use this <hi>occasional Communion</hi> more than once or
twice, or ten or twenty times, as long as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it is only <hi>occasional communion,</hi> it makes them
no <hi>Members</hi> of our <hi>Churches;</hi> for that obliges them
to fixed and constant Communion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:95208:130"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> They that have <hi>fixed</hi> and constant <hi>communion</hi>
in a <hi>Church gathered out of another,</hi> are in a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
from the <hi>Church</hi> out of which it is gathered,
although they may be <hi>occasionally present</hi> in it. Now,
if Men who think our <hi>constant communion unlawful,</hi>
Do judge themselves bound to joyn together in
another Society for <hi>purer administrations,</hi> as Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
speaks, and to <hi>choose new Pastors;</hi> this is gathering
<hi>new Churches;</hi> and consequently is a plain <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
from those <hi>Churches</hi> out of which they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd.
The <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Letter out of the Country</hi>
speaks plainly in this matter. <hi>Such,</hi> saith he, <hi>of the
dissenting Ministers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 33.</note> 
                     <hi>as have most openly declared for
communicating at some times with some of the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Churches; have also declared their judgment of
the lawfulness and necessity of Preaching and Hearing,
and doing other Religious Duties in other Congregations
also.</hi> If this be true, as no doubt that <hi>Gentleman</hi>
well understands their Principles, then we see plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Separation</hi> owned, notwithstanding the <hi>occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
communion</hi> with our <hi>Churches.</hi> For, here is not
only a <hi>lawfulness,</hi> but a <hi>necessity</hi> asserted of joyning
in Separate Congregations, for <hi>Preaching, Hearing,</hi>
and <hi>other Religious Duties.</hi> And here are all the
parts necessary for making <hi>New Churches, Pastors,
People,</hi> and <hi>joyning together for Religious Worship,</hi> in
a way separate from our Assemblies. For although
they allow the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>occasional communicating</hi>
with some of them; yet they are so far from allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>constant communion,</hi> that they assert a <hi>necessity</hi> of
<hi>separate Congregations</hi> for <hi>Divine Worship;</hi> And what
was there more then this which the old <hi>Separatists</hi>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:95208:130"/>
held? For when they first published the <hi>Reasons</hi>
of their <hi>Separation,</hi> which <hi>Giffard</hi> Answered, they
laid down the grounds of their dissatisfaction with
our <hi>Assemblies;</hi> from whence they inferred <hi>the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Separation;</hi> and then declare, <hi>that they only
sought the Fellowship and Communion of Gods faithful
servants; and by the direction of his Holy Spirit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to a choice of new Pastors; with whom they might
joyn, in all the Ordinances of Christ.</hi> And what is
there in this different, from what must follow from
the <hi>Principles</hi> of those, who assert <hi>the necessity of
joyning in other Congregations distinct and separate from
our Assemblies for the performance of Religious Duties?</hi>
And if there be a <hi>necessity of Separation,</hi> as this <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi>
tells us they generally hold, that seem most
moderate, the holding the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>occasional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
will not excuse them from the <hi>guilt</hi> of the
other. For, as long as the necessity of <hi>Separation</hi>
was maintained, the other was alwayes accounted a
less material dispute, and some held one way and
some another. And for this <hi>occasional communion</hi> the
same <hi>Author</hi> tells us, <hi>that he looks upon it, but as
drinking a single glass of Wine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 51.</note> 
                     <hi>or of Water, against
his own inclination, to a person out of Civility;
when he is not for any Mans pleasure to destroy his
health by tying himself to drink nothing else.</hi> It seems
then, this <hi>occasional communion</hi> is a meer <hi>Complement</hi>
to our <hi>Churches,</hi> wherein they force themselves to a
dangerous piece of civility much <hi>against their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations;</hi>
but they account <hi>constant communion</hi> a
thing pernicious to their Souls, as the other is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive

Mr. <hi>A.</hi> brings several instances to prove, <hi>that
we allow occasional Communion to be lawful, where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
is no duty; as with other Parish Churches, upon a
Iourney, at a Lecture,</hi> &amp;c. but who ever question'd
the lawfulness of <hi>occasional Communion</hi> with <hi>Churches</hi>
of the same constitution; or thought a Man was
bound to be always of that <hi>Church,</hi> where he goes
to hear a Lecture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the question is, about
the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>Separation,</hi> where <hi>occasional Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is allowed to be <hi>lawful.</hi> For a man is not said
to separate from every Church, where he forbears
or ceases to have Communion; but only from that
Church, with which he is obliged to hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and yet withdraws from it. And it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to me, none of my <hi>Friends</hi> (my <hi>Adversaries</hi> I
am loth to call them) could discern this. <hi>It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
saith Mr. <hi>B. to have Communion with the French,

                     <hi>If it be possible,</hi> saith St.
<hi>Paul, as much as lies in you live peaceably with all

at least, upon <hi>Christians</hi> to preserve <hi>Peace</hi> in
the <hi>Church,</hi> as with <hi>all Men?</hi> and they are bound
to that, <hi>as far as possible, and as much as lies in
them.</hi> And is not that <hi>possible and lies in them</hi> to
do, which they acknowledge <hi>lawful to be done,</hi> and
<hi>can do at some times?</hi> What admirable Arguments
are there to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> among <hi>Christians?</hi>
What Divine Enforcements of them on the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of Men in the Writings of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles?</hi>
And cannot these prevail with Men to do
that, which they think in their Consciences they
may lawfully do, towards joyning in <hi>Communion</hi>
with us? This I am perswaded, is one of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
Sins of the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> that they have
been so backward in doing, what they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
they might have done, with a <hi>good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
When they were earnestly pressed to it by
those in <hi>Authority,</hi> they refused it; and they have
been more and more backward ever since, till now
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95208:132"/>
they seem generally resolved, either to break all in
pieces, or to persist in <hi>Separation.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> indeed very
honestly moved them 1663. to consider <hi>how far it was
lawful, or their duty to communicate with the Parish
Churches in the Liturgy and Sacraments;</hi> and brought
many Arguments to prove it <hi>lawful; and no one of
the Brethren seemed to dissent:</hi> but observe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
Mr. <hi>A.</hi> makes to this;<note place="margin">Mischief of Impos. P. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> saith he, <hi>They did

against the Reasons of their Brother; like wise

they have been <hi>advising</hi> and <hi>considering</hi> ever since, till
with great Wisdom and Wariness they are dropt into
<hi>Separation</hi> before they were aware of it; and the
meer <hi>necessity</hi> of defending their own <hi>practices,</hi> makes
them espouse these <hi>Principles. Such another Meeting</hi>
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith, <hi>they had after the Plague and Fire, at
which they agreed, That Communion with our Church
was in it self lawful and good.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>A.</hi> charges
me <hi>for being tardy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>and wronging the Relator, by

viz. <hi>When it would not do more harm than good.</hi> And
upon this he expatiates about the wayes when it <hi>may

to examine the place, he will find, I did consider the
force of those words;<note place="margin">Plea. p. 240.</note> when I put it, <hi>that they resolved
it to be lawful in it self;</hi> although some <hi>circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
might hinder their present doing it. For they
declared, <hi>That it was in it self lawful and meet;</hi> but
the <hi>circumstances</hi> of that time, did make them think
<hi>it might do more harm than good;</hi> and therefore it is
said, <hi>They delaid for a fitter opportunity,</hi> which makes
it clear, they were then resolved upon the <hi>lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:95208:132"/>
of the thing. But that <hi>opportunity</hi> hath never
hapned since; and so they are now come to plead
against the <hi>practice</hi> of it; as Mr. <hi>A.</hi> plainly doth; by
such reasons as these. <hi>Communion with our Churches
will then do more harm than good,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>When such Communion shall perswade the Parish
Churches, that their frame is eligible and not only tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mischief of Impos. p, 40.</note>
As though <hi>Separation</hi> were more <hi>eligible,</hi> than
a <hi>Communion</hi> that is <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>tolerable;</hi> and Schism
were not more intolerable, than Communion with
a tolerable Church. What will not Men say in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their own practice? Was ever <hi>Schism</hi>
made so light a matter of, And the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
of <hi>Christians</hi> valued at so low a rate; that for
the prevention of the one, and the preservation of
the other, a thing that is <hi>lawful</hi> may not be done,
if there be any danger that what is only <hi>tolerable</hi>
should be mistaken for more <hi>eligible?</hi> As if all the
<hi>Mischiefs</hi> of <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Division</hi> in the Church, were
not fit to be put in the ballance, against such a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and monstrous inconvenience. Methinks, it
were better sometimes to be wise and considerate,
than always thus subtil and witty against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sence, and reason of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>2. When others shall thereby be thought obliged to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from purer Churches, <hi>i. e. be drawn off from
their Separation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>When it will harden the Papists.</hi> As though
their <hi>Divisions</hi> did not do it ten thousand times
more.</p>

4. When it shall notably prejudice the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in general. <hi>Yes, no doubt the</hi> Cure <hi>of</hi> Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>would do so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By these particulars, it appears, that he thinks
them not obliged to do <hi>what lawfully they can do.</hi>
Yet at last, he saith, <hi>he tells us, as much is done, as
their Consciences will permit them.</hi> Say you so? Is
it indeed come to this? Will none of your Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
now permit you either to <hi>come to the Liturgy,</hi> or
to make use of <hi>any parts</hi> of it, in your own <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi>
How often hath Mr. <hi>B.</hi> told the World, That
you stuck not at <hi>Set-Forms,</hi> nor at the <hi>Vse of the
Liturgy,</hi> provided some exceptionable passages
were alter'd in it? Did not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> declare at his
<hi>Meeting,</hi> publickly, in a <hi>Writing</hi> on purpose, <hi>That
they did not meet under any colour, or pretence of any
Religious Exercise in other manner, than according to
the Liturgy and Practice of the Church of</hi> England,
<hi>and were he able he would accordingly Read himself?</hi>
Is this observed in any one <hi>Meeting</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> or
through <hi>England?</hi> Then certainly, there are some
who do not, what they think they lawfully may do
towards <hi>Communion</hi> with us. And Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith in the
beginning of his late <hi>Plea, That they never made
one Motion for Presbytery, or against Liturgies;</hi> and
these words are spoken in the Name of the whole
<hi>Party</hi> called <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> And since that, Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
saith, <hi>They did come to an Agreement, wherein the
constant Vse of the Liturgy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answ. p. 64.</note> with some <hi>Alterations,</hi>
was required. And are we now told, <hi>That all that
can lawfully be done is done?</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> indeed acts agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95208:133"/>
to his Principles, in coming to our <hi>Liturgy;</hi> but
Where are all the rest? And, Which of them <hi>Reads</hi>
what they think <hi>lawful</hi> at their own <hi>Assemblies?</hi> Do
they not hereby discover, that they are more afraid
of losing their People, who force them to comply
with their <hi>humors,</hi> than careful to do, what they
judge <hi>lawful,</hi> towards <hi>Communion</hi> with our <hi>Church?</hi>

who think <hi>occasional Communion</hi> with us to be <hi>lawful,</hi>
should not think themselves obliged to <hi>constant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?</hi>
From what grounds come they to practise
<hi>occasional Communion?</hi> Is it <hi>from the Love of Peace
and Concord,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith? That is a good ground
so far, as it goes, But will it not carry a Man far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if he pursue it, as he ought to do? What <hi>love
of Concord</hi> is this to be <hi>occasionally present at our
Churches,</hi> and at the same time to declare, That
there is <hi>greater purity of Worship, and better means of
Edification in Separate Congregations?</hi> The one can
never draw Men so much to the <hi>love of Concord,</hi> as

differ; which, <hi>saith he,</hi> is the substance of what is
pleaded for by the Non-conformists.</p>
                  <p>For the clearing of this matter, there are Three
things to be debated,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Whether the</hi> Apostle <hi>speaks of</hi> different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>or</hi> different practises?</item>
                        <item>2. Whether the <hi>Rule</hi> he gives be <hi>mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance?</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. How far the <hi>Apostles Rule,</hi> hath an <hi>influence</hi> on
our present <hi>case?</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Whether the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of <hi>different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>
or of <hi>different practises?</hi> For the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of this, we must strictly attend to the
<hi>Apostles</hi> scope and design. It is most evident that
the <hi>Apostle</hi> began this <hi>Discourse</hi> with a <hi>Caution</hi> against
the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the <hi>Circumcision,</hi> Vers 2. <hi>Beware of Dogs,
beware of Evil Workers, beware of the Concision.</hi> But speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so reproachfully of them, he shews in the next
words, that every thing that was excellent in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95208:136"/>
of the Law, was accomplished in the Gospel;
and so he proceeds to declare, how justly he was
brought to a <hi>disesteem</hi> of the <hi>greatest priviledges</hi> of
the <hi>Law,</hi> in comparison with the things revealed by
the Gospel, which shews, that the Apostle had still
an eye to these <hi>False Teachers,</hi> who were very busie
in disturbing the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Churches,</hi> and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Disciples after them, pleading the <hi>necessity</hi> of
observing the <hi>Law;</hi> and dividing the <hi>Christians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>different Communions</hi> on that account, as appears
by their proceedings at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where they did se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
themselves from the <hi>Gentile Christians,</hi> and
St. <hi>Peter</hi> for a time complyed with them.<note place="margin">Act. 16. 13.</note> If such
as these had not been busie at <hi>Philippi</hi> (where it
appears that <hi>Iews</hi> inhabited) What need St. <hi>Paul</hi>
give so much <hi>caution</hi> against them? What need all
this dispute concerning the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Law?</hi>
If it be allowed, that they were there carrying on
the same designs, which they did in other <hi>Churches,</hi>
then it follows, he had great reason to perswade
them to <hi>Vnity</hi> so earnestly, as he doth, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 1, 2.
and to give so much <hi>caution</hi> against them; and to
represent the great <hi>excellencies</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> above
the <hi>Law;</hi> which being done, the <hi>Apostle</hi> after his
usual method, makes a <hi>digression,</hi> concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
viz. <hi>How far short he thought himself of what he
aimed at,</hi> and yet with <hi>what earnestness he pressed
forward, toward Christian perfection;</hi> making no
longer any account of <hi>legal priviledges.</hi> Which I
take to be his meaning, when he saith, <hi>Forgetting
the things which are behind I press forward,</hi> &amp;c. So
St. <hi>Hierome</hi> understands it, <hi>Legis obliviscens ad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta
Evangelii praecepta me teneo. Forgetting the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95208:136"/>
Law, I keep to the Precepts of the Gospel.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
understood, the <hi>Apostles</hi> sence naturally follows,
according to his former design; <hi>Let us therefore, as
many as are arrived to this height of Christianity</hi> (so
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is used, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 20. Ephes. 4. 13.
Coloss. 4. 12. Heb. 5. 14.) agree in pursuing our
main end.</hi> But then comes the case of <hi>those,</hi> who
were not so fully satisfied in this <hi>matter</hi> of the
<hi>Law;</hi> there being many and plausible Arguments
on their side; well, saith the Apostle, if they are
doubtful, I advise them however, not to hearken
to <hi>these false Teachers,</hi> for they make nothing but
<hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> among you, wait patiently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, which is the best means, for your satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
<hi>If any be otherwise minded, God shall reveal
even this unto you,</hi> i. e. saith <hi>Beza</hi> in his <hi>Paraphrase,
If any yet doubt of the laying aside of the Law, let
them make no disturbance in the Church about it.</hi> And
so <hi>Erasmus</hi> saith, <hi>It ought to be understood of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing
Christians, who did not yet discern, that the
Ceremonial Law was to be abolished, however,</hi> saith
he, <hi>they ought not to break the Peace of the Church for
it.</hi> But, What sence can Dr. <hi>O.</hi> here put upon the
<hi>being otherwise minded: Otherwise</hi> than what? <hi>As
many as be perfect be thus minded,</hi> to pursue your
main end; but, <hi>if any be otherwise minded;</hi> Did any
think they ought not to mind chiefly their great end?
that is incredible; Therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> must be
understood of somewhat, about which there were
then very <hi>different apprehensions;</hi> and that it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
there were about the <hi>Law</hi> among the <hi>Christians</hi>
then. The <hi>Apostle</hi> therefore doth not speak of any
kind of <hi>different apprehensions</hi> Christians might fall
into; but of such as were at that time among
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95208:137"/>
them; and so one Copy reads it, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>If hitherto ye have been otherwise minded;</hi> they had
no difference concerning the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the things
before them;</hi> viz. the <hi>happiness</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but
they had concerning the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the things behind,</hi>
viz. the <hi>force</hi> and <hi>obligation</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi> And since
this <hi>difference</hi> did not rest barely in opinion, but was
carried on so far, as to break the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
about it; it appears to have been no bare <hi>difference</hi>
of <hi>Opinions,</hi> but such as related to the <hi>Peace</hi> and
<hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>Christians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Rule</hi> which the Apostle
layes down, be only a <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>mutual forbearance?
Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us
walk by the same Rule, let us mind the same things.</hi> The
sence according to Dr. <hi>O.</hi> is this, <hi>That those who are
agreed in the stubstantials of Religion, should go on
and do their duty without regarding lesser differences.</hi>
Which is a <hi>sence</hi> very uncertain, and doth not reach
to the <hi>differences</hi> then among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
because it sets no bounds to <hi>differences;</hi> and
supposes the continuance of such <hi>differences</hi> among
them, which he designed to prevent, by perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them so often in this <hi>Epistle</hi> to be <hi>of one mind,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27. 2. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>of
one soul;</hi> as well as <hi>to mind the same things.</hi> Besides,
the difference then on foot, was none of the <hi>smaller
differences of opinions,</hi> but that about which they
differ'd was urged on one side, <hi>as necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 15. 1.</note>
by the <hi>false Apostles;</hi> and opposed on the
other, <hi>as pernicious and destructive to it.</hi> One of
my <hi>Answerers</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Rector of Sutton, p. 15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Iudaizing Christians
were leaven'd with such a corrupt Opinion, as was by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95208:137"/>
no means to be born with; which would have madè</hi>
Christ <hi>and his Death in vain. And that the Apostle
sets himself against it might and main, shewing the
dreadful consequences of it.</hi> And is it probable the
<hi>Apostle</hi> should prescribe a <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>mutual forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.</note>
in such a case as this? especially, when in the
same <hi>Chapter,</hi> he gives so great a <hi>caution</hi> against
them, with so much unusual sharpness of expression;
<hi>Beware of Dogs, beware of Evil Workers, beware of the
Concision.</hi> Doth this look like a <hi>Precept</hi> of <hi>mutual
forbearance, as to the differences then among them?</hi>
these we know there were, let Dr. <hi>O</hi> name any
other smaller <hi>differences</hi> of <hi>Opinion,</hi> which might be
an occasion of the <hi>Apostles</hi> giving such a <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
forbearance.</hi> But now, if we suppose the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
to speak to the <hi>difference</hi> about the <hi>Law,</hi> about
which the <hi>Churches</hi> were then divided, the sence is
plain, easie, and pertinent. For so, either (1.) It
takes in those who hitherto differ'd about the <hi>Law;</hi>
and then the sence is, although you are not come
up to so great satisfaction as others have, yet go as
far as you can with the Body of Christians, you live
with; <hi>keep within one Rule;</hi> break not the <hi>bounds</hi> of
<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> hath set you; run not
with the <hi>false Teachers</hi> into <hi>Separating dividing cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
(2.) It is directed to those who have <hi>got the
start of others,</hi> and then it contains the <hi>obligation</hi>
that lies upon them, especially so have a mighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the <hi>Peac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Christians;</hi> not to
break the Common<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ties and bonds on the account of
their <hi>greater attainments,</hi> nor to <hi>Separate</hi> from others,
as meaner and lower Christians, because they are
not come up to that <hi>perfection,</hi> which you have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95208:138"/>
to. And so either way, it contains an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Rule,</hi> and of admirable use to the <hi>Christian
Church,</hi> not only at that time, but in all Ages of
the World, <hi>viz.</hi> That those who cannot be fully
satisfied in all things, should <hi>go as far as they can</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
preserving <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;</hi>
and not peevishly separate and divide the
Church, because they cannot in all things think as
others do; nor others on the account of <hi>greater san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
and perfection,</hi> despise the inferior sort of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
and <hi>forsake</hi> their <hi>Communion,</hi> but they ought
all to do what lies possibly in them to preserve the
<hi>bonds</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How far this <hi>Rule</hi> hath an <hi>influence</hi> on our
case? (1.) It follows from hence, that <hi>as far as
Communion is lawful, it is a duty,</hi> since, as far as they
have attained they are to walk by the same Rule.
And so much Dr. <hi>O.</hi> doth not deny; when
he saith, <hi>Those who are agreed in the Substantials
of Religion, or in the Principles of Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
should walk by the same Rule, and mind the
same things, forbearing one another in the the things
wherein they differ.</hi> Then as far, as they agree, they are
bound to joyn together, whether it be as to Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Communion. Because the obligation to
<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> must especially reach to <hi>Acts</hi> of
<hi>Christian Communion,</hi> as far as that is judged to be
<hi>lawful.</hi> (2.) That the <hi>best Christians</hi> are bound to
<hi>Vnite</hi> with others, though of <hi>lower attainments,</hi> and
to keep within the <hi>same Rule;</hi> which is a general
expression relating to the <hi>bounds</hi> of a <hi>Race,</hi> and so
takes in all such <hi>Orders</hi> which are <hi>lawful</hi> and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
necessary to hold the <hi>Members</hi> of a <hi>Christian
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95208:138"/>
Society</hi> together.<note place="margin">Vindication of Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists, p. 26.</note> But, saith Dr. <hi>O. Let the Apostles
Rule be produced with any probability of proof to be
his, and they are all ready to subscribe and conform
unto it.</hi> This is the <hi>Apostles Rule,</hi> to <hi>go as far as they
can;</hi> and if they can go no farther, <hi>to sit down qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly,
and wait for farther instruction,</hi> and not to <hi>break
the Peace of the Church,</hi> upon present dissatisfaction,
nor to gather <hi>new Churches</hi> out of others upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of <hi>higher attainments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the Rule reach our Case,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 27.</note> saith he again, <hi>it must
be such as requires things to be observed, as were never
divinely appointed, as National Churches, Ceremonies
and Modes of Worship.</hi> And so this <hi>Rule</hi> doth in
order to <hi>Peace,</hi> require the observation of such
things, which although they be not particularly
appointed by God, yet are enjoyned by lawful
Authority, provided, they be not unlawful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
nor repugnant to the World of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the Apostles never gave any such Rules them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 28,</note>
                     <hi>about outward Modes of Worship with Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
Feasts, Fasts, Liturgies,</hi> &amp;c. What then? It
is sufficient that they gave this general Rule, <hi>That
all lawful things are to be done for the Churches
Peace:</hi> And without this no <hi>Vnity,</hi> or <hi>Order</hi> can
be preserved in <hi>Churches. The Apostles,</hi> saith he,
<hi>gave Rules inconsistent with any determining Rule,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page. 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31.</note> viz.
<hi>of mutual forbearance,</hi> Rome. 14. <hi>And herein the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
acted not upon meer Rules of Prudence, but as a
Teacher divinely inspired.</hi> That he was Divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
I do not question, but even such a one may
determine a case upon <hi>present circumstances,</hi> which
resolution may not always bind, when the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
are changed. For then, the meaning of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95208:139"/>
                     <hi>Apostle</hi> must be, that whatever <hi>differences</hi> happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>Christians,</hi> there must be no determination
either way. But the direct contrary to this, we
find in the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the difference that happened in the <hi>Christian
Churches.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 15, 28.</note> And although there was a very plausible
pretence of the <hi>obligation</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> one way;
yet the <hi>Apostles</hi> made a determination in the case,
contrary to their Judgment. Which shews, that
the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Forbearance,</hi> where <hi>Conscience</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
both wayes, is no <hi>standing Rule</hi> to the
<hi>Christian Church;</hi> but that the <hi>Governors</hi> of it from
<hi>Parity</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> may determine those things which
they judge to conduce most to the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare</hi>
of that <hi>Church,</hi> which they are bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.
And from hence it appears how little <hi>Reason</hi>
there is for Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s Insinuation, <hi>as though the false
Apostles were the only Imposers:</hi> whereas, it is most
evident, that the true <hi>Apostles</hi> made this perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Decree,</hi> in a matter of great <hi>consequence,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the pretence of <hi>Conscience</hi> on the other side.</p>
                  <p>But saith Dr. <hi>O.</hi> further,<note place="margin">Page 7, 8.</note> 
                     <hi>The Iewish Christians
were left to their own liberty, provided they did not
impose on others; and the Dissenters at this day, desire
no more, than the Gentile Churches did,</hi> viz. <hi>not to be
imposed upon to observe those things which they are not
satisfied, it is the mind of</hi> Christ <hi>should be imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. I Answer,</hi> 1. It was agreed by all the
<hi>Governors</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> that the <hi>Iewish
Christians</hi> should be left to their own liberty, out of
respect to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses;</hi> and out of regard to
the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> which might have
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95208:139"/>
been extremely hazarded, if the <hi>Apostles</hi> had present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set themselves against the observing the <hi>Iewish
Customs</hi> among the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves. 2. The <hi>false
Apostles imposing</hi> on the <hi>Gentile Christians</hi> had two
<hi>Circumstances</hi> in it, which extremely alter their case
from that of our <hi>present Dissenters.</hi> For, (1.) They
were none of their <hi>lawful Governors,</hi> but went about
as <hi>Seducers</hi> drawing away the <hi>Disciples</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi>
from them. (2.) They imposed the <hi>Iewish Rites as
necessary to Salvation,</hi> and not as <hi>meerly indifferent
things.</hi> And therefore the case of our <hi>Dissenters</hi>
is very different from that of the <hi>Gentile Christians,</hi>
as to the <hi>Impositions</hi> of the <hi>false Apostles.</hi> Thus I
have considered every thing material in Dr. <hi>O.</hi> which
seems to take off the force of the Argument drawn
from this Text.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> saith, (1.) <hi>That I
ought to have proved,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Letter cut of the Country, p. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Apostles meant some
Rule superadded to the Scriptures; and, (2.) That
other Church-Guides had the same Power, as the Apostles
had.</hi> But what need all this? If it appear (1.) That
the <hi>Apostles</hi> did give <hi>binding Rules</hi> to particular
<hi>Churches,</hi> which are not extant in Scriptures, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 17. So that either the <hi>Scripture</hi> is
an <hi>imperfect Rule,</hi> for omitting some <hi>Divine Rules;</hi>
or else these were only <hi>Prudential Rules</hi> of <hi>Order</hi>
and <hi>Government,</hi> (2.) That it is a standing <hi>Rule</hi>
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>Men are bound to do all lawful
things</hi> for the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And this I have
shewed, was the <hi>Apostles</hi> design in the <hi>words</hi> of this
<hi>Text.</hi>

<hi>to some at least of our Parochial Churches, that they are
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95208:141"/>
true Churches:</hi> But in what sense? Are they <hi>Churches
rightly constituted,</hi> with whom they may joyn in
<hi>Communion</hi> as <hi>Members?</hi> No; that he doth not
say. But his meaning is, <hi>that they are not guilty of
any such heinous Errors in Doctrine, or Idolatrous
Practice in Worship, as should utterly deprive them of
the Being and Nature of Churches.</hi> And doth this
Kindness only belong to <hi>some of our Parochial
Churches?</hi> I had thought, every <hi>Parochial Church</hi>
was <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> according to its <hi>frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;</hi>
which among us supposeth the owning
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> received and practised in
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as it is established by Law;
and if no such <hi>Errors in Doctrine, nor Idolatrous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
be allowed by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> then
every <hi>Parochial Church</hi> which is constituted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to it, is <hi>a true Church.</hi> But all this amounts
to no more, than what they call a <hi>Metaphysical
Truth;</hi> for he doth not mean, that they are <hi>Churches</hi>
with which they may lawfully have <hi>Communion.</hi>
And he pleads, <hi>for the necessity of having Separate
Congregations,</hi> from <hi>the necessity of Separating from
our Communion:</hi> (although the time was, when
the bare want of a <hi>right Constitution</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi>
was thought a sufficient ground for setting up <hi>new
Churches,</hi> or for withdrawing from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of a <hi>Parochial Church;</hi> and I do not think
the <hi>Dr.</hi> is of another mind now.) But however,
I shall take things as I find them; and he insists
on, <hi>as the grounds of this necessity of Separation, the
things enjoyned by the Law's of the Land, or by the
Canons and Orders of the Church; as Signing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
Baptized with the Sign of the Cross; Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

submitting to an Ecclesiastical Rule and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
which not one of a Thousand can apprehend
to have any thing in it, of the Authority of</hi> Christ,
<hi>or Rule of the Gospel.</hi> This is the short account
of the <hi>Reasons</hi> of <hi>Separation</hi> from our <hi>Churches
Communion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which I am now to inquire into, is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such <hi>Reasons</hi> as these be sufficient ground for
<hi>Separation</hi> from a <hi>Church,</hi> wherein it is confessed
<hi>there are no heinous Errors in Doctrine, or Idolatrous

must be a <hi>formal Schism;</hi> because such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

whom I hope no exceptions will be taken.</p>
                  <p>(1.) <hi>In the General,</hi> He assigns two marks of the

Sacraments administred according to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>(2.) <hi>He saith,</hi> Wherever these Marks are to be
found in particular Societies, those are true Churches,
howsoever they are distributed according to humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:95208:143"/>
(3) That although those stand as Members of
particular Churches, (who may not be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of that Society) till they are duly cast out; yet
the Churches themselves having these Marks, do still
retain the true Nature and Constitution of Churches,
and ought to be so esteemed.</p>
                  <p>(4.) Men ought not to Separate from,<note place="margin">Numb. 10.</note> or break
the Vnity of such Churches. <hi>And he hath this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
saying upon it:</hi> God sets such a value upon
the Communion of his Church, that he looks upon him
as an Apostate from his Religion, who doth wilfully
Separate himself from any Christian Society, which
hath the true Ministery of the Word and Sacraments.
<hi>And a little after, he calls</hi> Separation a Denial of
God and <hi>Christ,</hi> a destruction of his Truth, a mighty
provocation of his Anger, a crime so great that we
can hardly imagine a worse, it being a Sacrilegious
and perfidious breach of the Marriage betwixt <hi>Christ</hi>
and his People.<note place="margin">Numb. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>In the next</hi> Section <hi>he makes it a very</hi>
dangerous and mischievous temptation so much as to
think of Separation from a Church that hath these
Marks.</p>
                  <p>(5.) That although there be many Faults and
Corruptions in such a Church, yet as long as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
those Marks, Separation from it, is not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable:
nay, although some of those faults be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Preaching the Word, and Administration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:
for, <hi>saith he,</hi> all truths are not of equal
moment: but as long as the Doctrine according to
Godliness, and the true Vse of Sacraments is kept
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95208:143"/>
up, Men ought not to separate upon lesser differences;
but they ought to seek the amending what is amiss,
continuing in the Communion of the Church; and
without disturbing the Peace and Order of it. <hi>And
he at large proves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>what great allowance is to be
made,</hi> as to the corruption of Members <hi>from the</hi>
Examples <hi>of the</hi> Apostolical Churches: <hi>and he saith,</hi>
Mens Moroseness in this Matter, although it seems
to flow from zeal, yet it much rather comes from Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Pride, and a false opinion of their own holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
above others. Although, <hi>saith he,</hi> there were
such universal corruptions in the Iewish Church,<note place="margin">Numb. 18.</note> that
the Prophets compare it to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi>
yet they never set up new Churches, nor erected other
Altars, whereat they might offer Separate Sacrifices:
but whatever the People were, as long as Gods Word
and Ordinances were among them, they lifted up
pure hands to God, although in such an impure Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>The same he proves,</hi> as to <hi>Christ</hi> and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
<hi>From whence he concludes,</hi> That Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from such Churches,<note place="margin">Numb. 19.</note> where the true Word of
God and Sacraments are, is an inexcusable fault.
<hi>But how then comes he to justifie the</hi> Separation
<hi>from the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome?<note place="margin">Cap. 2. n. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> Because in that Church
the true Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> is so much suppressed,
and so many Errors obtruded on Mens Minds in
stead of it; and the Worship of God so corrupted,
that the Publick Assemblies are Schools of Idolatry
and Wickedness. And the truth of the Gospel, being
the Foundation of the Churches Vnity, it can be no
culpable Separation to withdraw from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Church which hath so notoriously corrupted
his Doctrine and Institutions: especially, when they
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95208:144"/>
Anathematize those who will not comply with them?
<hi>But doth he mean any</hi> indifferent Rites,<note place="margin">Numb. 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>or</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<hi>where the</hi> Doctrine <hi>is</hi> sound? <hi>No; but</hi>
False Doctrine, and Idolatrous Worship; <hi>as he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
declares. And therefore he that would
go about to defend Separation from a Church,
on the account of some</hi> Ceremonies <hi>prescribed,

in the Sacrament, which overthrows not the

Poison with his Medicines, and besides adds abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Prescriptions, both needless and chargeable,

and without Anathematizing all those who have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
them. For the condition of Communion with
that Church is no less, than receiving all its Errors
for necessary Articles of Faith.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Publick Worship practised, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of the Host, the Worship of Saints and

                  <p>3. That they cannot return to that Church without

                  <p>Let our <hi>Brethren</hi> now consider, what Triumphs
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> would make over us, if we
had nothing to justifie our <hi>Separation</hi> from them,
but only that we could not have <hi>our Children Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
without an Aerial Sign of the Cross, nor receive
the Communion without kneeling; that we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Holy-days, and use a Liturgy; and that Men
are not so good as they should be, nor Discipline so
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95208:146"/>
exact as were to be wished;</hi> How should we be his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and laughed at all over the <hi>Christian World;</hi> if
we had nothing to alledge for our <hi>Separation</hi> from
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> but such things as these? And
when the <hi>Papists</hi> see the weakness of these Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they are harden'd in their own ways; and
cry out presently there is no end of <hi>Schism's</hi> and

die to prevent a Schism, as to avoid Idolatry, and
he thinks it a much greater thing; the one being a
Martyrdom for the Church, the other only for ones
own Soul. <hi>St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>charges those who were
guilty of this</hi> Schism <hi>with</hi> Pride and Arrogance,
and doing unspeakable mischief to the Church, by
breaking the Peace of it: and will hardly allow those
to be Christians who lived in such a Schism: <hi>when as</hi>
Epiphanius <hi>observes,</hi>

                     </note> they still pleaded they had the

the same Faith with them, <hi>as</hi> Epiphanius <hi>relates
the Story; and their</hi> Schism <hi>began too</hi> about pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Discipline of the Church, and the best
means for the Edification of the People. <hi>They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
a</hi> Restitution <hi>for the</hi> lapsed <hi>to the</hi> Communion
<hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>but after a</hi> very severe Discipline,
<hi>and an utter</hi> incapacity <hi>of those in</hi> Orders <hi>as to

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95208:150"/>
whereupon a</hi> Separation <hi>followed: and the</hi> Mele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
<hi>had</hi> distinct Churches; <hi>which they called,</hi>
The Churches of the Martyrs. <hi>This</hi> Schism <hi>grew to
that height,</hi> that they would not pray together in
Prison, nor in the Quarries whither they were sent.
Meletius <hi>being a</hi> Bishop <hi>was</hi> deposed <hi>by</hi> Peter <hi>of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,<note place="margin">Theod. l. 1. c. 9.</note>

course of Separation <hi>in</hi> Thebais, <hi>and other parts of</hi>
Egypt, <hi>upon which the</hi> Council <hi>of</hi> Nice, <hi>in their</hi>

withdrew from the <hi>Churches communion,</hi> with his

<hi>the most dreadful thing in the World:</hi> and

of <hi>Eustathius Sebastenus,</hi> both in Opinion and Practise,
were very gross, which the Council takes notice of
and condemns. <hi>Yet,</hi> as gross as they were, <hi>there
was a</hi> pretence <hi>of</hi> greater Sanctity <hi>and</hi> Purity <hi>in
them. For</hi> their abstaining from Marriage, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity

carried on with the same</hi> Pretence.</p>
                  <p>To proceed then. On the same accounts the

of their <hi>Schism,</hi> although they were mistaken in
the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> concerning <hi>Coecilian;</hi> for their
<hi>great pretence</hi> was to preserve <hi>the purity</hi> of the

do clear our selves, I am sure they will do as
good a turn for them. Now, the main <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
of our present <hi>Separation</hi> are these.</p>
                     <p>(1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) That every particular Church, upon a due bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of all circumstances, has an inherent right to
choose its own Pastor, and every particular Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
the same Power to choose his own Church. I
say not to mischoose, <hi>do you mark me,</hi> but, a power
to choose; not to choose any, but one that may best
advance their own Edification; at lest that no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
be forced upon a Church, no Church obtruded
on a single Christian without their own consent. <hi>Now
I pray consider, Why might not</hi> Lucilla, <hi>and</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,
<hi>and</hi> Botrus, <hi>and</hi> Celeustus, <hi>with their Party
among the</hi> People at Carthage, <hi>choose</hi> Majorinus
<hi>for their</hi> Pastor; <hi>although the rest had chosen</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian?
<hi>For they were not well satisfied with</hi>
Mensurius <hi>his Predecessor, whom they suspected
for a</hi> Traditor; <hi>but when they had</hi> their liberty to
choose, <hi>Why should they be debarred of their</hi>
inherent right of choosing their own Pastor? <hi>Why
should</hi> Caecilian <hi>be obtruded upon them? Why
should not they choose one, who would best</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
their Edification? <hi>For</hi> Caecilian <hi>was at lest
under suspicion of</hi> compliance <hi>in time of</hi> Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
<hi>and therefore for my part, upon our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
I think the</hi> Donatists <hi>very free from the</hi>
charge <hi>of</hi> Schism.</p>
                     <p>(2.) That it is the duty of every Christian to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95208:154"/>
God, not only in purity of heart, but according
to the purity of Gospel-Administrations. <hi>Now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that there was nothing the</hi> Donatists <hi>plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so much, and so vehemently for, as the</hi> purity
of Gospel-Administrations. <hi>This was that which</hi>
Parmenian, Petilian, <hi>and the rest still contended
for, as appears by the</hi> Plea <hi>they put in for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the last</hi> Conference <hi>at</hi> Carthage. We are
they <hi>(say they)</hi> that have suffer'd persecution for
maintaining the Purity of the Church,<note place="margin">Collat. 3. Carthag. n. 258.</note> this hundred
years, because we would not comply with their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
we have been turned out of our Churches,
and been sent to Prison, and had our Goods taken
from us, and some of our Brethren have been killed,
and others hardly used for so good a Cause; <hi>And,
Can such Men as you condemn them for a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible</hi>
Schism? <hi>I tell you, they are as Innocent
as our selves, for they went upon the same
grounds.</hi>

the use of all God's Ordinances and Commandments.
<hi>Now, Is not</hi> Discipline <hi>one of</hi> God's Ordinances?
<hi>And, Do we not make</hi> want of Discipline, <hi>one
of the</hi> Reasons <hi>of our</hi> Separation? <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the</hi> Donatists <hi>were very honest Men, for they

words of the Holy Ghost, that it is utterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

not oftner forbidden in the Gospel, than this: that it
is contrary to the very design of <hi>Christ</hi> in our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
which was, to reconcile us all to God, and to unite
and centre us all in him: that, it is contrary to the design
of the Spirit of Grace, and to the very nature of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
it self: that it is a sin against the nearest bonds
of our highest Relations to each other; that it is either
a dividing <hi>Christ,</hi> or robbing him of a great part of
his inheritance: and neither of these is a little sin:
that it is accompanied with Self-ignorance, and Pride,
and great unthankfulness to God: that Church-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are the most successful servants of the Devil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enemies to <hi>Christ</hi> in his Family and Livery: and
that they serve the Devil more effectually than open
enemies: that Schism is a sin which contradicteth all
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95208:156"/>
Gods Ordinances and Means of Grace, which are
purposely to procure and maintain the Vnity of his
Church. That it is a sin against as great and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
experiences, as almost any sin can be: and this
is a heinous aggravation of it, that it is commonly
justified, and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and it is yet the more heinous, `that it is commonly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
upon God: Lastly, that it is most unlike the
Heavenly State, and in some regard worse than the
Kingdom of the Devil, for he would not destroy it by
dividing it against it self. Remember now, <hi>saith he,</hi>
that Schism, and making Parties and Divisions in
the Church, is not so small a Sin, as many take it for. <hi>I

we should not yet know, that our own Vncharitable

<hi>Church.</hi> For it is not possible to suppose, that any
<hi>Duty</hi> should be bound upon the <hi>Consciences</hi> of

than this is. The places are so many, that
it were <hi>endless</hi> to repeat them; and therefore
needless, because this is agreed on all hands. So
that <hi>violation</hi> of the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> where
there is no sufficient reason to justifie it, is a <hi>Sin,</hi>
as much as <hi>Murder</hi> is, and as plainly forbidden. But
it happens here, as it doth in the other case, that
as <hi>Murder</hi> is always a <hi>sin;</hi> but there may be some
<hi>circumstances,</hi> which may make the taking away a
Mans life, not to be <hi>Murder;</hi> so it may happen,
that though <hi>Schism</hi> be always a <hi>sin,</hi> yet there may
be such <hi>circumstances</hi> which may make a <hi>Separation</hi>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:95208:158"/>
not to be a <hi>Schism;</hi> but then they must be such
Reasons, as are not fetched from our Fancies, no
more than in the case of <hi>Murder;</hi> but such as are
allowed by <hi>God</hi> himself in his Law. For, he
only that made the Law can except from it.</p>
                  <p>(2.) <hi>The</hi> Vnity <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>doth not lie in a</hi>
bare communion of Faith and Love, <hi>but in a</hi> Ioynt-participation
of the Ordinances appointed by <hi>Christ</hi>

<hi>but what is allowed by</hi> Christ <hi>or his</hi> Apostles, <hi>as a</hi>

is set upon by its own Children. This, <hi>saith he,</hi> I
speak to those who make no great matter of Schism; and

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> In the <hi>case</hi> of <hi>Idolatrous Worship.</hi> For the
Precepts are as plain that <hi>Christians</hi> should <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain</hi>
from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as that they should preserve
the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church. Neither be ye Idolaters.

                     <hi>Keep your selves from Idols.

                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>St.</hi> John 5.</note> And to the case of <hi>Idolaters,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>

                     <hi>and be separate;
and touch not the unclean thing.</hi> Now in this case,
where there is so plain a Command, there is no

                  <p>

                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 7. 17.</note> For although in other things

St. <hi>Paul</hi> denounces an <hi>Anathema</hi> against them:<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 6. 7. 8.</note> and
that implies, that they should have <hi>no Communion</hi>
with them, but look upon them as <hi>Persons cut off</hi>
from the <hi>Body</hi> (like putrid Members) lest they
should corrupt the rest. St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 10.</note>
when there is no hopes of reclaiming such, to

to Salvation,</hi> and <hi>divide</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> upon
that account. And this was the case of the <hi>false
Apostles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95208:160"/>
necessary to Salvation;</hi> and to propagate this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of theirs, they went up and down, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor'd
to draw away the <hi>Apostles Disciples,</hi> and
to set up <hi>Separate Churches</hi> among the <hi>Christians;</hi>
and to allow none to partake with them, that
did not own the <hi>Necessity</hi> of the <hi>Iewish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
to <hi>Salvation.</hi> Now although St. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
complyed sometimes with the practice of
them; and the <hi>Iewish Christians</hi> especially in <hi>Iudaea,</hi>
generally observed them; yet when these false <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
came to enforce the <hi>observation</hi> of them, <hi>as
necessary to Salvation,</hi> then he bid the <hi>Christians</hi> at
<hi>Philippi</hi> to beware of them,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> to fly their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
and have nothing to do with them. These
are all the <hi>Cases</hi> I can find in the <hi>New Testament,</hi>
wherein <hi>Separation</hi> from <hi>Publick Communion</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
but there are two others, wherein S. <hi>Paul</hi>
gives particular directions, but such as do not
amount to <hi>Separation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The <hi>different opinions</hi> they had about <hi>Meats</hi>

Now this being a matter of <hi>Diet,</hi> and relating
to their own <hi>Families,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> advises them
not to censure or judge one another; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this difference, to joyn together as
<hi>Christians</hi> in the <hi>Duties common</hi> to them all. For the

                     <hi>i. e.</hi> Let every one order his Family as he thinks

give disturbance to the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for these
matters; which he calls <hi>Peace and Ioy in the Holy
Ghost;</hi> which is provoked and grieved by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions

                     <hi>is acceptable to God, and

                     <hi>and things wherewith
we may edifie one another.</hi> In such <hi>Cases</hi> then, the
Apostle allows no <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>publick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Christians.</hi> It was the same case as to the
<hi>observation</hi> of <hi>Days</hi> then; for some <hi>Christians</hi> went
then on <hi>Iewish Holidays</hi> to the <hi>Synagogues;</hi> others did
not; but for such things they ought not to divide
from each others <hi>Communion</hi> in the common <hi>Acts of
Christian Worship.</hi> And the design of the <hi>Apostle</hi> is
not to lay down a <hi>standing Rule</hi> of <hi>Mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance</hi>
as to <hi>different Communions;</hi> but to shew,
that such <hi>differences</hi> ought not to be an occasion
of <hi>breaking Communion</hi> among <hi>Christians,</hi> and so
the <hi>Apostles</hi> discourse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. holds strongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Separation,</hi> on these and the like Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>corrupt lives</hi> of many who were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

<hi>Corruptions</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> no wonder
if some of them, put the case to them, what they
should do, in case they knew some <hi>Members</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> to be Men of bad lives; although the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
were not <hi>scandalous,</hi> by being <hi>publickly
known;</hi> Must they <hi>abstain</hi> from the <hi>Communion</hi> of
the <hi>Church</hi> for these?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 11.</note> To this St. <hi>Paul</hi> Answers,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95208:161"/>
That every private Christian ought to forbear all
<hi>familiar Conversation</hi> with such; <hi>If any one that is
a Brother, be a fornicator,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with such a one, no
not to eat.</hi> Which is all the <hi>Apostle</hi> requires of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christians;</hi> but if the <hi>Scandal</hi> be publick, as
that of the <hi>Incestuous persou,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> had power
to vindicate its own honor, by <hi>casting such out:</hi> not
as though the <hi>Church Communion</hi> were <hi>defiled,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 12. 13,</note> if
they continued in; but the reputation and honor
of the <hi>Church</hi> suffered by it; the preservation
whereof, is the <hi>true cause</hi> of the <hi>Churches Discipline.</hi>
But the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives not the lest <hi>countenance</hi> to

though such persons still continued in it.
For there may be many <hi>reasons</hi> to break off <hi>private

For our <hi>Communion</hi> in publick, is a
thing which chiefly respects <hi>God,</hi> and a necessary
duty of his own appointing, the benefit whereof
depends upon his <hi>Promises,</hi> and all the <hi>communion</hi>
they have with other Men, is only joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the performance of a <hi>common Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
but <hi>private familiarity</hi> is a thing which wholly
respects the <hi>Persons</hi> converse with, and a thing of
<hi>mere choice,</hi> and hardly to be imagined without <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi>
at lest, if not <hi>imitation</hi> of their <hi>wickedness.</hi>

                  <p>1. I begin with our <hi>Parochial Churches;</hi> because it
is Separation from these, with which we principally
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95208:163"/>
charge our Adversaries; for herein they most disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Separation,</hi> since in former times,
the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> thought it their duty to keep up
<hi>Communion</hi> with them. But since the <hi>Congregational
way</hi> hath prevailed in <hi>England,</hi> the present <hi>Dissenters</hi>
are generally fallen into the <hi>practice</hi> of it, whatever
their <hi>principles</hi> are, at least so far as concerns forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>our Parochial Churches,</hi> and
joyning together in <hi>separate Congregations</hi> for <hi>Divine
Worship.</hi> This principle is therefore the first thing
to be examined. And the main foundation of that
way, I said, was, that <hi>Communion</hi> in <hi>Ordinances</hi> must
be onely in such <hi>Churches</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> himself instituted
by <hi>unalterable Rules,</hi> which were onely <hi>particular</hi> and
<hi>Congregational Churches.</hi> Concerning which I laid
down two things. (1.) That supposing <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Churches</hi> to be of <hi>Christ's Institution,</hi> this was
no reason for <hi>separation</hi> from our <hi>Parochial Churches,</hi>
which have all the <hi>essentials</hi> of such <hi>true Churches</hi> in
them. (2.) That there is no reason to believe that
the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> was limited to <hi>particular
Congregations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In answer to this Dr. <hi>O.</hi> saith these things, (1.) <hi>That
they do not deny, at least some of our Parochial Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to be true Churches:</hi> but why then do they deny
Communion with them? But, he saith, <hi>he hopes it
will not be made a Rule, that Communion may</hi> not <hi>be
withheld</hi> (so the sense must be although <hi>not</hi> be left
out) <hi>or withdrawn from any Church in any thing, so
long as it continues as unto the essence of it to be so.</hi>
This is somewhat odly and faintly expressed.<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> But as
long as he grants, that our <hi>Parochial Churches are not
guilty of such heinous Errours in Doctrine, or idolatrous
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:95208:163"/>
Practice in Worship as to deprive them of the Being and
Nature of Churches,</hi> I do assert it to be a <hi>Sin</hi> to <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
from them. Not but that I think, there may
be a <hi>separation</hi> without sin, from a <hi>Society</hi> retaining
the <hi>essentials</hi> of a <hi>Church;</hi> but then I say, the reason
of such <hi>separation</hi> is, <hi>some heinous Errour in Doctrine,
or some idolatrous Practice in Worship, or some tyranny
over the Consciences of men;</hi> which may not be such,
as to destroy <hi>true Baptism;</hi> and therefore consistent
with the <hi>essentials</hi> of a <hi>Church.</hi> And this is all that
I know the <hi>Protestant Writers</hi> do assert in this matter.</p>
                  <p>(2.) <hi>He answers,</hi> That they do not say, that because
Communion in Ordinances must be onely in such Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
as Christ hath instituted, that therefore it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and necessary to separate from Parochial Churches,
but if it be on other grounds necessary so to separate or
withhold Communion from them, it is the duty of them
who doe so, to joyn themselves in or unto some other
particular Congregation.</p>
                  <p>To which I reply, that This is either not to the
business, or it is a plain giving up the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency.</hi>
For, wherefore did the <hi>dissenting Brethren</hi>
so much insist upon their <hi>separate Congregations,</hi> when
not one of the things, now particularly alleged
against our <hi>Church,</hi> was required of them? But if
he insists on those things common to our <hi>Church</hi> with
other <hi>reformed Churches,</hi> then they are such things,
as he supposes contrary to the <hi>first Institution of
Churches;</hi> And then I intreat him to tell me, what
difference there is, between <hi>separating from our</hi>
Churches <hi>because Communion in Ordinances is onely
to be enjoy'd in such Churches as Christ hath instituted;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95208:164"/>
and separating from them because they have things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the first Institution of Churches?</hi> Is not
this the <hi>primary reason</hi> of <hi>Separation,</hi> because <hi>Christ
hath appointed unalterable. Rules for the Government
of his Church;</hi> which we are bound to observe, and
which are not observed in <hi>Parochial Churches?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the most <hi>immediate reason</hi> of <hi>separation</hi> from
<hi>such</hi> a <hi>Church</hi> is not observing <hi>Christ's Institution;</hi>
but the <hi>primary ground</hi> is, <hi>that Christ hath settled
such Rules for Churches which must be unalterably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</hi>
Let us then (1.) suppose, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath
by <hi>unalterable Rules</hi> appointed <hi>that a Church shall
consist onely of such a number of men as may meet in
one Congregation, so qualified; and that these by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into Covenant with each other become a Church,
and choose their Officers, who are to Teach, and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
and Administer Sacraments, and to exercise Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
by the consent of the Congregation;</hi> And let us
(2.) suppose such a <hi>Church not yet gathered,</hi> but
there lies <hi>fit matter</hi> for it dispersed up and down in
several <hi>Parishes.</hi> (3.) Let us suppose Dr. <hi>O.</hi> about
to <hi>gather such a Church.</hi> (4.) Let us suppose not one
thing <hi>peculiar</hi> to our <hi>Church</hi> required of these <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
neither the aëreal sign of the Cross, nor kneeling
at the Communion, &amp;c.</hi> I desire then to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Dr. <hi>O.</hi> be not bound by these <hi>unalterable Rules</hi>
to draw these <hi>members</hi> from <hi>Communion</hi> with their
<hi>Parochial Churches,</hi> on purpose that they might form
a <hi>Congregational Church,</hi> according to <hi>Christ's Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
Either then he must quit these <hi>unalterable Rules,</hi>
and the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> or he must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that <hi>setting</hi> up a <hi>Congregational Church</hi> is the
<hi>primary ground</hi> of their <hi>Separation</hi> from our <hi>Parochial
Churches.</hi> If they do suppose but <hi>one</hi> of those <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:95208:164"/>
wanting which they believe <hi>Christ</hi> hath <hi>insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted</hi>
in <hi>particular Churches,</hi> do they not believe this
a sufficient ground for <hi>separation?</hi> It is not therefore
any <hi>Reason</hi> peculiar to our <hi>Church,</hi> which is the true
<hi>Cause</hi> of their <hi>separation;</hi> but such <hi>Reasons</hi> as are
common to all <hi>Churches,</hi> that are not formed just af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their own model. If there be then <hi>unalterable
Rules for Congregational Churches,</hi> those must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and <hi>separation</hi> made in order to it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>separation</hi> is necessary upon Dr. <hi>O.</hi>'s grounds, not
from the particular <hi>Conditions</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> with us,
but because our <hi>Parochial Churches</hi> are not formed
after the <hi>Congregational way.</hi> But this was a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
piece of art at this time, to keep fair with the
<hi>Presbyterian Party,</hi> and to make them believe (if they
can be so forgetfull) that they do not own <hi>separation</hi>
from their Churches, but onely from <hi>ours,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
whereof is so apparent from the debates with
the <hi>dissenting Brethren,</hi> and the setting up <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Churches</hi> in those days, that they must be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull
indeed, who do not remember it. Have those
of the <hi>Congregational way</hi> since alter'd their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
Hath Dr. <hi>O.</hi> yielded, that in case some <hi>terms</hi>
of <hi>Communion</hi> in our <hi>Church</hi> were not insisted upon,
they would give over <hi>separation?</hi> Were not their
<hi>Churches</hi> first gathered out of <hi>Presbyterian Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi>
And if <hi>Presbytery</hi> had been settled upon the
<hi>Kings Restauration,</hi> would they not have continued
their <hi>Separation?</hi> Why then must our <hi>Church</hi> now
be accused for giving the <hi>Occasion</hi> to the <hi>Independent
separation,</hi> when it is notoriously otherwise; and
they did <hi>separate</hi> and <hi>form their Churches,</hi> upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
common to our <hi>Church</hi> with all other <hi>Reformed
Churches?</hi> This is more artificial than ingenuous.</p>

from the nature of the thing, that the Churches
planted by the Apostles were limited to Congregations,
that many wise men, wholly unconcerned in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
do take it for a thing to be granted by all
without dispute. <hi>And for this two Testimonies are
alleged, of</hi> Iustice Hobart, <hi>and</hi> Father Paul; <hi>but
neither of them speaks to the point. All that</hi> Chief
Iustice Hobart <hi>saith is,</hi> That the Primitive Church in
its greatest Purity, was but voluntary Congregations
of Believers submitting themselves to the Apostles, and
after to other Pastours. <hi>Methinks Dr.</hi> O. <hi>should have
left this</hi> Testimony <hi>to his Friend</hi> L. du Moulin, <hi>it
signifies so very little to the purpose; or rather, quite
overthrows his</hi> Hypothesis; <hi>as appears by these two
Arguments. (1.) Those</hi> voluntary Congregations over
which the Apostles were set, <hi>were no</hi> limited Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
<hi>of any one</hi> particular Church; <hi>but those</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
over whom the Apostles were set, <hi>are those
of which</hi> Iustice Hobart <hi>speaks. And therefore it is
plain he spake of</hi> all the Churches <hi>which were under
the</hi> care <hi>of the</hi> Apostles, <hi>which he calls</hi> voluntary
Congregations. <hi>(2.) Those</hi> voluntary Congregations
over whom the Apostles appointed Pastours after their
decease, <hi>were no</hi> particular Congregations <hi>in one City;
but those of whom</hi> Iustice Hobart <hi>speaks, were such;
for he saith,</hi> they first submitted to the Apostles, and
after to other Pastours. <hi>But</hi> Iustice Hobart <hi>could not
be such a stranger to Antiquity to believe that the</hi>
Christians <hi>in the</hi> Age <hi>after the</hi> Apostles <hi>amounted but
to</hi> one Congregation in a City. <hi>And therefore, if he
consults</hi> Iustice Hobart<hi>'s honour or his own, I advise
him to let it alone for the future. As to the Testimony
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95208:165"/>
of Father</hi> Paul, <hi>it onely concerns the</hi> Democratical
Government of the Church, <hi>and I wonder how it came
into this place; I shall therefore consider it in its due
season.</hi>

evidence <hi>for the Institution of Congregational Churches;</hi>
concerning which,<note place="margin">Serm. p. 26.</note> these are my words. <q>It is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
at first, there might be no more Christians in
one City than could meet in one Assembly for
Worship; but where doth it appear, that when
they multiplied into more Congregations, they
did make new and distinct Churches under new
Officers with a separate Power of Government?
Of this I am well assured, there is no mark or foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>step
in the New Testament, or the whole History
of the Primitive Church. I do not think it will
appear credible to any considerate man, that the
5000 Christians in the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> made
one stated and fixed Congregation for Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
not, if we make all the allowances for stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
which can be desired: but if this were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
where are the unalterable Rules, that as soon
as the company became too great for one particular
Assembly, they must become a new Church under
peculiar Officers and an Independent Authority?</q>
To this Dr. <hi>O.</hi> answers in four particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>That an account may e're long be given of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
deviation of the First Churches after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease
of the Apostles from the Rule of the first Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which although at first it began in matters of
small moment; yet still they increased untill they issued
in a fatal Apostasy;</hi> Or as he after expresses it, <hi>leaving
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95208:166"/>
their Infant state, by degrees, they at last brought forth
the Man of Sin.</hi> But I do not understand how this
at all answers the former <hi>Paragraph</hi> of my <hi>Sermon</hi>
concerning the <hi>first Institution</hi> of <hi>Churches;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I suppose intended for a <hi>Reason</hi> why he doth
not afterwards answer to the <hi>evidence</hi> out of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
I shall not onely so far take notice of it, as to
let him know, that when that is done, I do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
but the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> will find sufficient
<hi>Advocates</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> but I desire
that undertaker to consider, what a blot and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
it will be to <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> if the <hi>Primitive
Churches</hi> could not hold to their <hi>first Institution,</hi> not
for one <hi>Age</hi> after the <hi>Apostles.</hi> I know what abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<hi>Heresies</hi> there were soon after, if not in the
<hi>Apostles</hi> days; but the question is not concerning
these, but <hi>the purest and best Churches;</hi> and about
them, not whether some trifling Controversies might
not arise, and humane infirmities be discovered; but
<hi>whether they did deviate from the plain Institutions of
Christ, and the unalterable Rules of Government which
he had fixed in his Church?</hi> This seems utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
to me upon this consideration among many
others: That Government is so nice and tender a
thing, that every one is so much concerned for his
share in it, that men are not easily induced to part
with it. Let us suppose the Government of the
Church to have been <hi>Democratical</hi> at first, as Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
seems to doe; is it probable, that the <hi>People</hi> would
have been wheadled out of the sweetness of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so soon and made no noise about it? Yea Dr. <hi>O.</hi>
tells us that in <hi>Cyprian's time it continued at Carthage;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vindic p. 41.</note>
and others say, a great deal longer: there was then
no such change as to this <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> so
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95208:166"/>
soon after. And why should we imagin it otherwise,
as to extent of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Iurisdiction?</hi> Suppose
<hi>Christ</hi> had limited the <hi>Power</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;</hi>
the <hi>Pastour</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> could have no
more pretence over any other Congregation, than
Dr. <hi>O.</hi> by being <hi>Pastour</hi> over one <hi>Congregation</hi> in
<hi>London,</hi> could challenge a right to Govern all the
<hi>Independent Congregations</hi> in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>about it;</hi> and
appoint their several <hi>Teachers,</hi> and call them to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for their proceedings. I appeal now to any
man of consideration, whether there be the least pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
that such an alteration could be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great noise and disturbance? Would not Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>C.</hi> and many more, think themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to stand up for their own <hi>Rights?</hi> And if
they could be drawn into the design, would the
<hi>People</hi> submit? Let us put the case, as to <hi>New-England.</hi>
Suppose the <hi>Apostles</hi> an Age or two since,
had planted such <hi>Congregational Churches</hi> there, as
have been formed within these last 50 years at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
Boston, Hereford, Newhaven, &amp;c.</hi> and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
every <hi>Congregation</hi> with the <hi>full Power</hi> of the
<hi>Keys,</hi> the execution whereof they had intrusted with
the several <hi>Elderships,</hi> within their own Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but so, as not to have any <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Authority,</hi>
over the <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Members</hi> of any other <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:</hi>
let us then suppose, that after the decease of
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> these <hi>Churches</hi> gradually declined so far,
that in this Age Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> at <hi>Boston</hi> should take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the whole <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Keys,</hi> and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so, but appoint <hi>Pastours</hi> over other <hi>Congregations,</hi>
and keep a great <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Elders</hi> under him, and
challenge the <hi>Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction</hi> over the whole
<hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>Massachusets,</hi> of which <hi>Boston</hi> is the <hi>chief
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95208:167"/>
Town,</hi> and so three others doe the same at the chief
<hi>Places</hi> of the other <hi>Colonies;</hi> would not this be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
alteration of the Church Government? And
is it possible to conceive, such a change should be
brought about insensibly, without any complaint of
the <hi>subordinate Elders,</hi> or the <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi>
who were robbed of their <hi>inherent Right</hi> by an
<hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and so late an establishment
by the <hi>Apostles?</hi> Doctrines may be insensibly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by continuing the names and altering opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
through the carelesness and unskilfulness of
<hi>People:</hi> but in <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> the meanest
<hi>People</hi> are sensible, and look big with an opinion of
it. If therefore it be not conceivable in this case,
the <hi>Government</hi> should be thus changed from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>

1. That there was a <hi>great number</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi>
belonging to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and therefore
not probable to be one <hi>single Congregation.</hi> This
appears from Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>Epistles</hi> to them in his
retirement.<note place="margin">

of one <hi>single Congregation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>These</hi> Presbyters <hi>and the</hi> whole Church <hi>were
under the particular care and</hi> Government <hi>of Saint</hi>
Cyprian <hi>as their</hi> Bishop. <hi>Some of the</hi> Presbyters <hi>at</hi>
Carthage <hi>took upon them to meddle in the affairs of</hi>
Discipline,<note place="margin">L. 3. Ep. 14. Ep. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>without consulting their</hi> Bishop <hi>then in
his retirement. Saint</hi> Cyprian <hi>tells them</hi> they neither
considered Christ's Command, nor their own Place, nor
the future Iudgment of God, nor the Bishop who was
set over them, and had done that which was never done
in foregoing times, to challenge those things to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
with the contempt and reproach of their Bishop,
<hi>which was to receive</hi> Penitents <hi>to</hi> Communion <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
imposition of hands by the</hi> Bishop <hi>and his</hi> Clergy.
<hi>Wherein,</hi>

                     <hi>he vindicates the</hi> Martyrs <hi>and</hi> Confessours
<hi>in his following</hi> Epistle, <hi>saying,</hi> that such an affront to
their Bishop was against their will: for they sent their
Petitions to the Bishop, that their Causes might be heard
when the Persecution was over. <hi>In another</hi> Epistle <hi>to
the</hi> People <hi>of</hi> Carthage <hi>on the same occasion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">L. 3. Ep. 10. Ep. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>he

Episcopo honorem Sacerdotii sui &amp; Cathedrae reservare,
reserve to the Bishop the honour which belonged to his
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95208:168"/>
Place: <hi>and therefore charges,</hi> that nothing further
be done in this matter till his return,<note place="margin">Ep. 21.</note> when he might
consult with his fellow-Bishops. Celerinus <hi>sends to</hi>
Lucian <hi>a</hi> Confessour, <hi>to beg him for a</hi> Letter of Grace
<hi>for their Sisters</hi> Numeria <hi>and</hi> Candida <hi>who had fallen.</hi>
Lucian <hi>returns him answer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ep. 22.</note> that <hi>Paulus</hi> before his
Martyrdom had given him Authority to grant such in
his Name, and that all the Martyrs had agreed to such
kindness to be shewed to the lapsed; but with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that the Cause was to be heard before the Bishop,
and upon such Discipline as he should impose, they were
to be received to Communion.<note place="margin">Ep. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>So that though</hi> Lucian
<hi>was extreamly blamed for</hi> relaxing <hi>the</hi> Discipline <hi>of
the</hi> Church; <hi>yet neither he nor the other</hi> Martyrs
<hi>would pretend to doe any thing without the</hi> Bishop.
Cyprian <hi>gives an account of all that had passed in this
matter to</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Maximus <hi>two Roman</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>and</hi> Confessours;<note place="margin">Ep. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>they return him answer,</hi> that
they were very glad he had not been wanting to his
Office, especially in his severe reproving those who had
obtained from Presbyters the Communion of the Church
in his absence. <hi>In his</hi> Epistle <hi>to the</hi> Clergy <hi>of</hi> Carthage
<hi>he mightily blames those</hi> who communicated with those
persons who were reconciled to the Church meerly by
Presbyters without him;<note place="margin">Ep. 28.</note> and threatens excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to any Presbyters or Deacons who should presume
to doe it. <hi>The</hi> Roman Clergy <hi>in the vacancy of the</hi> See,
<hi>take notice of the</hi> discretion of the Martyrs in remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the lapsed to the Bishop,<note place="margin">Ep. 30.</note> as an argument of their
great modesty, and that they did not think the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church belonged to them: <hi>and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their resolution,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ep. 31.</note> to doe nothing in this matter,
till they had a new Bishop. <hi>By which we see the</hi>
Power <hi>of</hi> Discipline <hi>was not then supposed to be in
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95208:169"/>
the</hi> Congregation, <hi>or that they were the</hi> first subject of
the Power of the Keys; <hi>but that it was in the</hi> Bishop
<hi>as</hi> superiour <hi>to the</hi> Presbyters. <hi>And that they were
then far from thinking it in the</hi> Power <hi>of the</hi> People,
to appoint and ordain their own Officers,<note place="margin">Ep. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>Saint</hi> Cyprian
<hi>sends word to the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Carthage, that he had
taken one <hi>Aurelius</hi> into the Clergy; although his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
custom was in Ordinations to consult them before,
and to weigh together the manners and deserts of every
one:<note place="margin">Ep. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>which is quite another thing from an</hi> inherent
Right <hi>to</hi> appoint <hi>and</hi> constitute <hi>their own</hi> Church-officers:
<hi>the same he doth soon after, concerning</hi>
Celerinus <hi>and</hi> Numidicus.<note place="margin">Ep. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>When he could not go
among them himself, by reason of the persecution,
he appoints</hi> Caldonius <hi>and</hi> Fortunatus <hi>two</hi> Bishops,<note place="margin">Ep. 38.</note>
                     <hi>and</hi> Rogatianus <hi>and</hi> Numidicus two Presbyters, to visit
in his name; and to take care of the poor, and of the
persons fit to be promoted to the Clergy. <hi>Who give an
account in the next</hi> Epistle,<note place="margin">Ep. 39.</note> that they had excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<hi>Felicissimus</hi> and his Brethren for their separation.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>That Saint</hi> Cyprian <hi>did believe that this</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<hi>which he had for</hi> governing <hi>the</hi> Church <hi>was not
from the</hi> Power <hi>of the</hi> People, <hi>but from the</hi> Institution
<hi>of</hi> Christ.<note place="margin">Ep. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>So upon the</hi> occasion <hi>of the</hi> Martyrs <hi>inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the</hi> Discipline <hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>he produceth that
saying of</hi> Christ <hi>to Saint</hi> Peter, Thou art Peter, <hi>&amp;c.
And</hi> whatsoever you shall bind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whence,
<hi>saith he,</hi> by a constant succession of times, such a course
hath been always observed in the Church, that the Church
hath been still governed by Bishops, and every Act of
the Church hath been under their care and conduct.
Since this, <hi>saith he,</hi> is a Divine Institution, I wonder
at the boldness of those who have written at that rate to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95208:169"/>
                     <hi>me (concerning the lapsed)</hi> since the Church consists
in the Bishop, the Clergy and the standing People. <hi>In
his</hi> Epistle <hi>to</hi> Antonianus,<note place="margin">Ep. 52.</note> 
                     <hi>he speaks of the</hi> Agreement
of the Bishops throughout the whole world:<note place="margin">Ep. 55.</note> 
                     <hi>and in</hi> that
<hi>to</hi> Cornelius, that every Bishop hath a part of the flock
committed to him, which he is to govern and to give
an account thereof to God:<note place="margin">Ep. 65.</note> 
                     <hi>and</hi> that a Bishop in the
Church is in the place of Christ; and that disobedience
to him is the cause of schisms and disorders. <hi>To the
same purpose he speaks in his</hi> Epistle <hi>to</hi> Rogatianus,<note place="margin">Ep. 69.</note>
                     <hi>and to</hi> Pupianus; <hi>where he declares</hi> a Church to be a
People united to a Bishop;<note place="margin">Ep. 75.</note> 
                     <hi>and to</hi> Stephanus, that they
have succeeded the Apostles in a constant course.</p>
                  <p>Let the Reader now judge, whether these be the
<hi>strokes and lineaments</hi> of the <hi>Congregational way;</hi> and
whether Dr. <hi>O.</hi> had any reason to appeal to Saint
<hi>Cyprian</hi> for the <hi>Democratical Government of the Church.</hi>
But we have this advantage from this appeal, that
they do not suppose <hi>any deviation</hi> then <hi>from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Institution,</hi> and what that was in Saint <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s
judgment any one may see; when he speaks of
nothing peculiar to his own <hi>Church,</hi> but what was
generally observed over the <hi>Christian world.</hi> And
now let Dr. <hi>O.</hi> give an account, how a change so
great, so sudden, so universal, should happen in the
<hi>Christian world,</hi> in the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi>
that when <hi>Christ</hi> had placed <hi>the Power in the People,</hi>
the <hi>Bishops</hi> in so short a time should be every where
settled, and allowed to have the chief management
in <hi>Church-affairs,</hi> without any <hi>controul</hi> from the
<hi>People:</hi> which to me is as strong an argument as a
matter of this nature will bear, that the <hi>Power</hi> was
at first lodged in <hi>them,</hi> and not in the <hi>People.</hi> For,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:95208:170"/>
as Mr. <hi>Noys</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> well argues, <hi>It is not
imaginable that Bishops should come by such Power, as
is recorded in Ecclesiastical History,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>p.</hi> 62.</note> 
                     <hi>and that over all
the world; and in a way of ambition, in such humbling
times, without all manner of opposition for 300 years
together, and immediately after the Apostles; had it
been usurpation or innovation. When and where is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
without opposition? Would not Elders, so
many seeing and knowing men, at least some of them,
have contended for Truth, wherein their own Liberties
and Rights were so much interessed?</hi> Aërius <hi>his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of Bishops, so long after their rise and standing,
is inconsiderable.</hi> The force of which reasoning, will
sway more with an impartial and ingenuous mind,
than all the difficulties I ever yet saw on the other
side. So much for the account Dr. <hi>O.</hi> promises of
the <hi>deviations</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> after the <hi>Apostles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease.</hi>

concerning <hi>the Institution of Congregational Churches,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 39.</note>
The <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> is, that when <hi>Churches</hi> grew
too big for one <hi>single Congregation</hi> in a <hi>City,</hi> then a
<hi>new Congregational Church</hi> was set up under <hi>new Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi>
with a <hi>separate Power of Government.</hi> Let us
now see Dr. <hi>O.</hi>'s proof of it. <hi>For although it may be
there is not express mention made that these or those
particular Churches did divide themselves into more
Congregations with new Officers:</hi> i. e. Although the
<hi>matter of fact</hi> be not <hi>evident</hi> in <hi>Scripture: yet,</hi> saith
he, <hi>there are Instances of the erection of new particular
Congregations in the same Province.</hi> But what is this
to the proof of the <hi>Congregational way?</hi> The thing
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:95208:170"/>
I desired was, that when the <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>one City</hi>
multiplied into <hi>more Congregations,</hi> they would
prove, that they did make <hi>new and distinct Churches;</hi>
and to exemplifie this he mentions <hi>new Congregations
in the same Province.</hi> Who ever denied or disputed
that? On the contrary, the proof of this, is a great
advantage to our <hi>Cause;</hi> for since, where the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
speaks of <hi>the Churches of a Province,</hi> it speaks of
them as of <hi>different Churches;</hi> but when it mentions
<hi>the Christians of one City,</hi> it calls them <hi>the Church of
that City</hi> (as the <hi>Church of Ierusalem,</hi> the <hi>Church of
Ephesus;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 9. 31.</note> but <hi>the Churches of Iudea, Galilee</hi> and <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria)</hi>
what can be more evident, than that the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
of <hi>one City,</hi> though never so numerous, made
but <hi>one Church?</hi> If one observe the language of the
<hi>New Testament,</hi> one may find this observation not

<hi>plural number,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 14.</note> they are the <hi>Churches of a Province,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 1.</note> as <hi>the Church at Antioch; the

of together, they are the 7 <hi>Churches;</hi> but when
spoken to single, it is <hi>the Church of Ephesus, the

any discrimination, as to the difference of these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in greatness and capacity, or the number of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
in them, doth evidently discover that what
<hi>number</hi> soever they were, they were all but the

And thus men to serve an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> take
off from the mighty <hi>Power,</hi> and prevalency of the

when after he hath produced the evidence of distinct

he calls this <hi>plain Scripture evidence and practice
for the erecting particular distinct Congregations:</hi> who
denies that? but I see nothing like a proof of <hi>distinct
Churches in the same City</hi> which was the thing to be
proved, but because it could not be proved was pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
let alone: whereas we have <hi>plain Scripture
evidence</hi> that all the <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>a City,</hi> though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

evidence from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that the neighbouring

that he saith further to this matter,<note place="margin">p. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Churches had power to rule and govern themselves,
because in every one of them Elders were ordained,</hi>
Act. 14. 22. which is again an argument on our side:

<hi>be allowed for some</hi> Acts of Worship, <hi>why not for
others? if the</hi> number <hi>of</hi> Elders <hi>be unlimitted, then
every one of these may attend the</hi> occasional distinct
Assemblies <hi>for</hi> Worship, <hi>and yet all together make up
the</hi> Body <hi>of</hi> one Church; <hi>to which, if he had but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
a</hi> single Bishop <hi>over these, he had made up that</hi>
representation <hi>of a</hi> Church, <hi>which we have from the
best and purest</hi> Antiquity.<note place="margin">Orig. <hi>c.</hi> Cels. <hi>l.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>And so</hi> Origen <hi>compares
the</hi> Churches <hi>of</hi> Athens, Corinth <hi>and</hi> Alexandria <hi>with
the</hi> Corporations <hi>in those</hi> Cities; <hi>the</hi> number <hi>of</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
<hi>with the</hi> Senates <hi>of the</hi> Cities; <hi>and at last the</hi>
Bishop <hi>with the</hi> Magistrate. <hi>But Dr.</hi> O. <hi>adds,</hi> that
when they did begin to exceed in number, beyond a
just proportion for Edification; they did immediately
erect other Churches among them, or near them. <hi>Name
any one</hi> new Church <hi>erected in the</hi> same City, <hi>and I

allows</hi> occasional distinct Assemblies <hi>for</hi> greater Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?
<hi>But he names</hi> the Church at Cenchrea, which
was a Port to the City of Corinth; because of the mighty
increase of Believers at Corinth, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 10. with
<hi>Rom. 16. 1. I answer,</hi> (1.) <hi>It seems then there was
such an increase at</hi> Corinth, <hi>as made them plant a</hi>
distinct Church; <hi>and yet at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>where Saint</hi> Paul
<hi>used extraordinary diligence, and had great success,
there was no need of any</hi> new <hi>and</hi> distinct Church.

                     <hi>As to the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Ierusalem,<note place="margin">p. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>he saith,</hi> that the
5000 Converts were so disposed of or so dispersed, that
some years after, there was such a Church there, as did
meet together in one place, as occasion did require, even
the whole multitude of the Brethren; nor was their
number greater when they went unto Pella. <hi>To which
I answer (1.) the force of the Argument lies in the
5000 being said</hi> to be added to the Church,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>before any</hi>
dispersion, <hi>or</hi> persecution. <hi>In which time we must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a</hi> true Church <hi>to be</hi> formed, <hi>and the</hi> Christians
<hi>at that time performing the</hi> Acts of Church-communion:
<hi>the</hi> Question <hi>then is, whether it be in the least pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that 5000 persons should at that time, make
one</hi> stated and fixed Congregation <hi>for</hi> Divine Worship
<hi>and all the</hi> Acts <hi>of</hi> Church-communion? <hi>What place
was there large enough to receive them, when they
met for</hi> Prayer <hi>and</hi> Sacraments? <hi>Dr.</hi> O. <hi>was sensible of
this inconvenience, and therefore onely speaks of the</hi>
Church <hi>of</hi> Ierusalem <hi>when these were</hi> dispersed; <hi>but
my question was about them, while they</hi> were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Were they not a</hi> Church <hi>then?</hi> Did they not
continue in the apostles Doctrine and Fellowship and
breaking of Bread and Prayers? <hi>But how could 5000
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95208:172"/>
then doe all this together? Therefore a</hi> Church <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

about such a <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> as is necessary

be limited to these exclusively to all other <hi>Vnions</hi>
of <hi>Christians?</hi> whether every <hi>single Congregation</hi>
hath <hi>all Church-power</hi> wholly in it self, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably,
as to subordination to any other? How
doth this appear from the <hi>nature of the thing,</hi> and the
<hi>necessary duties of Christians?</hi> I grant the <hi>Institution</hi>
of <hi>Churches</hi> was <hi>for Edification:</hi> And I think a great

things. Whatever tends to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> among

I cannot apprehend how a <hi>sole Power</hi> of <hi>Government</hi>
in every <hi>Congregation</hi> tends to the preserving this <hi>Peace</hi>
and <hi>Vnity</hi> among <hi>Christians:</hi> much less how it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
so clearly from <hi>the nature of the thing</hi> as to take
away the need of any <hi>positive Rule or Direction</hi> in
this matter. And here the main Controversie lies,
between us and the <hi>Congregational Churches.</hi> Is there
no <hi>positive Rule</hi> or <hi>Direction</hi> in this matter? then it
follows as much from the <hi>nature of the thing,</hi> that
since <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> is to be kept up among <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
as well as <hi>Persons,</hi> every <hi>single Congregation</hi>
ought not to engross <hi>Church-power</hi> to it self, but to
stand accountable for the management of it to those
who are intrusted with the immediate care of the
<hi>Churches Peace.</hi> And I cannot yet see, by all that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95208:173"/>
hath been said, how those that break the established
<hi>Order</hi> in a <hi>Church wherein all the substantials of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are acknowledged to be sound,</hi> and set up parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Independent Churches</hi> in opposition to it, can
acquit themselves from the Guilt of Schism, how
<hi>great and intolerable</hi> soever it be thought.<note place="margin">p. 43.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to what concerns <hi>the Churches in the Houses of
Priscilla and Aquila, and Nymphas and Philemon,</hi> I
say,<note place="margin">p. 44.</note> that this is to be understood, not of a <hi>Church mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in their Houses,</hi> but of their own <hi>Families</hi> was

                     <hi>most of
our Divines are of that Opinion:</hi> and therefore the
Argument holds against them. And from Dr. <hi>O.</hi>'s
Discourse I less understand than I did before, what
<hi>obligation</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> can be upon any, when they
may serve <hi>God</hi> in their <hi>Families,</hi> in opposition to
<hi>Laws,</hi> to keep up such <hi>publick Congregations</hi> as are
forbidden by them. For (1.) he grants that a <hi>Church</hi>
may be in a <hi>Family;</hi> although a <hi>Family</hi> as such be
not a <hi>Church.</hi> Then the <hi>members</hi> of a <hi>Family</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Master</hi> as their
<hi>Pastour</hi> are a <hi>true Church:</hi> for a <hi>Church,</hi> he saith,
<hi>may consist onely of the Persons that belong to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi>
Then there is no necessity of going out of a
<hi>Family</hi> for the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Church-communion;</hi> especially,
when the addition of four more, may provide suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
for all the <hi>Officers</hi> they believe necessary to
the making up a <hi>Church.</hi> (2.) All that he saith, is,
<hi>that there is no such example given of Churches in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Families in Scriptures, as should restrain the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of Churches from Congregations of many Families.</hi>
And what then? the <hi>Question</hi> is not now whether
they be <hi>lawfull,</hi> but whether they be <hi>necessary;</hi> for
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95208:174"/>
nothing less than a <hi>Divine Command</hi> can justifie the
<hi>breach</hi> of a plain <hi>Law;</hi> but where is that <hi>Command?</hi>
Doth not Dr. <hi>O.</hi> appeal to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi>
and the <hi>indispensable duties</hi> of men with respect to
the end of <hi>Churches,</hi> as his great <hi>Rule</hi> in these cases?
But which of all these necessary <hi>duties</hi> may not be
performed within the <hi>terms</hi> of the <hi>Law?</hi> so that no
<hi>obligation</hi> can arise from thence to have <hi>Congregations</hi>
of many <hi>Families.</hi> All that he saith further, as to
this matter is,<note place="margin">p. 46.</note> 
                     <hi>that if through non-compliance any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
happen, the blame will be found lying upon
those who would force others to forego their Primitive
Constitution.</hi> Then it seems at last the <hi>Primitive
Constitution</hi> is come to be the ground of <hi>non-compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi>
which in this case amounts to <hi>separation.</hi> But
this <hi>primitive Constitution</hi> had need be far better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
before it can be thought a <hi>good ground</hi> for brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> of the
<hi>Land;</hi> and much more, before it can carry off the
blame from the persons who break <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi>
to the <hi>Makers</hi> of them. All men no doubt that ever
broke Laws, if this Plea would be admitted, would
transfer the blame upon those that made them. And
so much for the <hi>Plea</hi> of the <hi>Congregational</hi> Party.</p>

                  <p>Sect. 8. 2. <hi>I now come to consider the</hi> Plea <hi>of
those, who hold</hi> our Diocesan Episcopacy <hi>to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.
In my</hi> Sermon, <hi>as it is printed, I set down
this saying of Mr.</hi> Baxter,<note place="margin">p. 24.</note> That to devise new species
of Churches (beyond Parochial or Congregational)
without God's Authority, and to impose them on the
world (yea in his name) and to call all Dissenters
Schismaticks,<note place="margin">True and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way of Concord. p III.</note> is a far worse usurpation, than to make
or impose new Ceremonies or Liturgies. <hi>Which I said
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95208:174"/>
doth suppose</hi> Congregational Churches <hi>to be so much
the</hi> Institution of Christ; <hi>that any other</hi> Constitution
<hi>above these is both</hi> unlawfull <hi>and</hi> insupportable: <hi>which
is more than the</hi> Independent Brethren <hi>themselves do
assert. Now for our better understanding Mr.</hi> B.<hi>'s
meaning, we must consider his design in that place
from whence those words are quoted. 1. He saith,</hi>
Christ hath instituted onely Congregational or Parochial
Churches. 2. <hi>That</hi> Diocesan Episcopacy is a new spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Churches devised by men without God's Authority,
and imposed in such a manner, that those are called
Schismaticks who dissent from it. 3. That such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is worse than that of Ceremonies and Liturgies;
and consequently affords a better plea for Separation.
<hi>But to prevent any misunderstanding of his meaning,
I will set down his own Cautions.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Premonition to the true way of Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cord.</note> 1. That the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is not whether every particular Church should
have a Bishop with his Presbyters and Deacons: <hi>i.e.</hi>
whether every Rectour of a Parish be not a Bishop, if
he hath Curates under him. <hi>This he calls</hi> Parochial
Episcopacy. 2. Nor, whether these should have Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops
over them, as Successours to the Apostolical and
general Overseers of the first Age, in the ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
parts of their Office. 3. Nor, whether Partri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,
Diocesans and Lay-chancellours be lawfull, as
Officers of the King, exercising under him such Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church as belongeth to Kings, to which
in such exercise all Subjects must for conscience sake
submit. 4. Nor, if Diocesans become the sole Bishops
over many hundred Parishes, all the Parochial Bishops
and Parish Churches being put down and turned into
Curates and Chappels, whether a Minister ought yet to
live quietly and peaceably under them. <hi>You will ask
then, where lies this horrible</hi> imposition, <hi>and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:95208:175"/>
usurpation? <hi>It is in requiring the owning the</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<hi>of this</hi> Diocesan Episcopacy; <hi>and joyning with</hi>
Parochial Churches <hi>as</hi> parts <hi>of it. But wherein lies
the unsufferable malignity of that?</hi> 1. It is making
a new species of Churches without God's Authority.
2. It is overthrowing the species of God's making:
<hi>which, according to Mr.</hi> B. <hi>requires two things.</hi>
1. Local and presential Communion, <hi>as he calls it,</hi> i.e.
<hi>That it consists onely of so many, as can well meet
together for</hi> Church Society. 2. The full exercise of
Discipline within it self by the Pastours; <hi>which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken away, they are onely</hi> Curates, <hi>and their</hi>
Meetings Oratories <hi>and no</hi> Churches. <hi>This I think is
a true and fair representation of Mr</hi> B.<hi>'s opinion in
this matter. Which tending so apparently to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
our present</hi> Constitution <hi>as</hi> insupportable, <hi>and
to justifie</hi> separation <hi>from our</hi> Parochial Churches <hi>as</hi>
members <hi>of a</hi> Diocesan Church; <hi>Therefore to vindicate
the</hi> Constitution <hi>of</hi> our Church, <hi>I shall undertake these
three things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. To shew that our <hi>Diocesan Episcopacy</hi> is the
same for <hi>substance</hi> which was in the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>That it is not</hi> repugnant to any Institution of
Christ, <hi>nor</hi> devising a new species of Churches
<hi>without</hi> God's Authority.</item>
                     <item>3. That the accidental <hi>alterations</hi> in <hi>Discipline</hi> do
not overthrow the <hi>being</hi> of our <hi>Parochial
Churches.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. That our Diocesan Episcopacy is the same for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
which was in the Primitive Church. <hi>This I
begin with, because Mr.</hi> B. <hi>so very often makes his</hi>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:95208:175"/>
Appeal <hi>to</hi> Antiquity <hi>in this matter. And my first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
shall be into the</hi> Episcopacy <hi>practised in the</hi>
African Churches;<note place="margin">Plea for peace, p. 66. Church-History. p. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>because Mr.</hi> B. <hi>expresseth an esteem
of them above others; for in Saint</hi> Cyprian<hi>'s time he
saith</hi> they were the best ordered Churches in the world;
and that the Bishops there were the most godly, faithfull,
peaceable company of Bishops since the Apostles times.
<hi>And of the following times he thus speaks,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 73.</note> Most of
the African Councils, <hi>saith he,</hi> were the best in all the
world.<note place="margin">Church-History, p. 57.</note> Many good Canons for Church order were made
by this and most of the African Councils, no Bishops
being faithfuller than they. <hi>Therefore concerning the</hi>
Episcopacy <hi>there practised, I shall lay down these two
Observations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That it was an <hi>inviolable Rule</hi> among
them, <hi>That there was to be but one Bishop in a City,</hi>
though the <hi>City</hi> were never so <hi>large,</hi> or the <hi>Christians</hi>
never so <hi>many.</hi> This one Observation made good,
quite overthrows Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> For upon his
<hi>principles,</hi> where ever the <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi>
became so great,<note place="margin">Answ. to Serm. p. 74.</note> 
                     <hi>that they could not conveniently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
at one place so as to have personal Communion
in presence,</hi> as he speaks; there either they must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>instituted species</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> or they must
have more <hi>Bishops</hi> than <hi>one</hi> in a <hi>City.</hi> For, he saith,
<hi>the Church must be no bigger, than that the same Bishop
may perform the Pastoral Office to them in present
Communion,</hi> and for this he quotes 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 12, 13.
Heb. 13. 7, 17. i.e.</hi> their <hi>Bishops</hi> must be such as they
must <hi>hear preach, and have Conversation with.</hi> But
that this was not so understood in the <hi>African Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
appears by their strict observance of this Rule;
of having but <hi>one Bishop</hi> in a <hi>City</hi> how large soever
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:95208:176"/>
it was. And how punctually they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
bound to observe it, will appear by this one
Instance, That one of the greatest and most pernicious
<hi>Schisms</hi> that ever happened, might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
if they had yielded to more <hi>Bishops</hi> than <hi>one</hi>
in a <hi>City;</hi> and that was the <hi>Schism</hi> of the <hi>Donatists,</hi>
upon the competition between <hi>Majorinus</hi> and <hi>Coeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi>
as the <hi>Novatian Schism</hi> began at <hi>Rome</hi> upon a
like occasion between <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Novatian.</hi> Now
was there not all the <hi>Reason</hi> imaginable upon so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
an occasion to have made more <hi>Bishops</hi> in
the <hi>same City,</hi> unless they had thought some <hi>Divine
Rule</hi> prohibited them? When there were 46 <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> had it not been fair to have divided
them? or upon Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s principles <hi>made so many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
that every one might have had three or four for
his share? But instead of this, how doth Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
even the holy and meek Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as
Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> calls him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> de Bapt. l. 2. c. 4.</note> aggravate the <hi>Schism</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatian</hi>
for being chosen a <hi>Bishop</hi> in the <hi>same City,</hi>
where there was one chosen before? His words are
so considerable to our purpose, that I shall set them
down.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Et cum post primum secundus esse non possit,
quisquis post unum qui solus esse debeat, factus est, non
jam secundus ille sed nullus est. Since there cannot be
a second after the first, whosoever is made Bishop when
one is made already, who ought to be alone, he is not
another Bishop, but none at all.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>B.</hi> reconcile
these words to his <hi>Hypothesis</hi> if he can. What! in
such a <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> then was, where
were 46 <hi>Presbyters,</hi> to pronounce it a meer <hi>nullity</hi>
to have a <hi>second Bishop</hi> chosen? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would rather
have thought there had been need of 46 <hi>Bishops;</hi>

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95208:176"/>
                     <hi>Apostles</hi> times, and I am apt to think, knew as well
the <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> then, thought it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
that <hi>Constitution</hi> to have <hi>more Bishops than one
in a City.</hi> At <hi>Carthage</hi> it seems some turbulent <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>
that were not satisfied with Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
Government, or it may be looking on the charge as
too big for one, chose one <hi>Fortunatus</hi> to be <hi>Bishop</hi>
there:<note place="margin">

the having one Bishop was the best means to prevent

where they confessed their fault, and declared,
<hi>That they were not ignorant, that as there was but one
God, and one Christ, and one Holy Ghost, so there
ought to be but one Bishop in the Catholick Church.</hi>
Not according to the senseless interpretation of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius,</hi>
who would have it understood of <hi>one Pope;</hi>
but that according to the ancient and regular <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>

were very troublesome in some of the remoter

had <hi>praesential and local Communion</hi> with Saint

he writes to <hi>Maximinus</hi> a <hi>Donatist Bishop</hi> a sharp

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95208:179"/>
                     <hi>he went from</hi> Hippo <hi>to the place himself to be satisfied
of the truth of it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ep. 204.</note> At the same place lived one <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
a <hi>Presbyter</hi> of the <hi>Donatists</hi> whom Saint <hi>Augustin</hi>
would have had brought to him against his Will, to
be better instructed, <hi>as being under his care,</hi> but the
obstinate man rather endeavour'd to make away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">Ep. 262.</note>
upon which he writes a <hi>long Epistle</hi> to him. In
another <hi>Epistle</hi> he gives an account, that there was
a place called <hi>Fussala, which with the Country about
it, belonged to the Diocese of</hi> Hippo; <hi>where there was
abundance of People, but almost all</hi> Donatists; <hi>but by
his great care in sending Presbyters among them, those
places were all reduced; but because</hi> Fussala <hi>was
40 miles distant from</hi> Hippo, <hi>he took care to have a
Bishop placed among them;</hi> but as appears by the
event he had better have kept it under his own
Care. For upon the complaints made against their
<hi>new Bishop,</hi> he was fain to <hi>resume it;</hi> as appears by
a <hi>Presbyter</hi> of <hi>Fussala,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ep. ad <hi>Quodvult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deum</hi> ante lib. de haeres.</note> which he mentions afterwards.
However it appears, that a place 40 <hi>miles distance</hi>
was then under the <hi>care</hi> of so <hi>great</hi> a <hi>Saint,</hi> and so
<hi>excellent</hi> a <hi>Bishop</hi> as Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> was. And could
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> have found it in his heart to have told him
<hi>that he did not understand the right constitution of
Churches?</hi> How many <hi>Quaere's</hi> would Mr. <hi>B.</hi> have
made about the <hi>numbers</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi> at <hi>Fussala,</hi> and
how he could take upon him the <hi>care</hi> of a <hi>place</hi>
so far <hi>distant</hi> from him? And it is no hard matter
to guess what answer Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> would have
given him.</p>
                  <p>But besides this plain evidence of the extent of
<hi>Dioceses,</hi> we have as clear proof of <hi>Metropolitan

<hi>Episcopacy</hi> was onely in these <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> let us
enquire into the <hi>Episcopacy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi>
And we may suppose <hi>Athanasius</hi> did not spend
all his zeal upon <hi>doctrinal points,</hi> but had some for
the <hi>right Constitution</hi> of <hi>Churches;</hi> and yet it is most
certain the <hi>Churches</hi> under his care could not have
<hi>personal Communion</hi> with him.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epiph.</hi> haer. 68. n. 6.</note> It is observed by
<hi>Epiphanius, that</hi> Athanasius <hi>did frequently visit the
neighbour Churches, especially those in</hi> Maraeotis; of
which <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself gives the best account.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Athanas.</hi> Ap. p. 781. 802.</note>
                     <hi>Maraeotis,</hi> saith he, <hi>is a Region belonging to</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,
<hi>which never had either Bishop or Suffragan in
it; but all the Churches there are immediately subject
to the Bishop of</hi> Alexandria; <hi>but every Presbyter is
fixed in his particular Village; and here they had
Churches erected in which these Presbyters did offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate.</hi>
All this we have expressly from <hi>Athanasius</hi>
himself, whence we observe, (1.) That here were
<hi>true Parochial Churches;</hi> for so <hi>Athanasius</hi> calls them
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:95208:180"/>
                     <hi>Churches,</hi> and not <hi>bare Oratories.</hi> (2.) That these
had <hi>Presbyters fixed</hi> among them, who performed
<hi>divine Offices</hi> there. (3.) That these were under
the <hi>immediate inspection</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
so that the <hi>whole Government</hi> belonged to him.
(4.) That these were at <hi>that distance,</hi> that they
could not have <hi>local Communion</hi> with their <hi>Bishop</hi>
in his <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Which is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> So in <hi>Alexandria</hi>
it self,<note place="margin">Haeres. 68. n. 4. 69. n. 1.</note> there were many <hi>distant Churches</hi> with fixed
<hi>Presbyters</hi> in them, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> several times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves:
and it would be a very strange thing indeed,
if so many <hi>Presbyters</hi> should have <hi>fixed Churches</hi> in
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and yet the <hi>whole Church</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>
be no <hi>bigger</hi> than to make <hi>one Congregation for perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Communion with the Bishop.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Abridgment of Chur. hist. p. 9.</note> But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
great argument is, <hi>from the meeting of the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
with</hi> Athanasius <hi>in the great Church at</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria
<hi>to keep the Easter Solemnity;</hi> whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<hi>that the Christians in</hi> Alexandria <hi>were no more
than that the main body of them could meet and hear
in one Assembly.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Athanas.</hi> Ap. p. 682.</note> Whereas all that <hi>Athanasius</hi> saith,
amounts to no more than this, <hi>that the multitude
was too great to meet in one of the lesser Churches, and
therefore a great clamour was raised among them that
they might go into the New Church;</hi> Athanasius <hi>pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them to bear with the inconveniency and disperse
themselves into the lesser Churches; the People grew
impatient, and so at last he yielded to them.</hi> But
what is there in all this to prove that <hi>all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
in the <hi>whole City</hi> were then <hi>present,</hi> and that this
<hi>Church</hi> would hold them all? If a great Assembly
should meet at one of the lesser <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>London</hi>
upon some <hi>Solemn Occasion,</hi> and finding themselves
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95208:180"/>
too big for that place should press the <hi>Bishop</hi> to
open Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s for that day before it were quite
<hi>finished,</hi> because of the greater <hi>capacity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
for receiving such a number, would this prove that
Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s held all the <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>London? Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
saith not a word more, <hi>than that it was Easter,
and there appeared a great number of People, such a
one as Christian Princes would wish in a Christian City.</hi>
Doth he say, or intimate, that all the Christians of
the <hi>City</hi> were <hi>present?</hi> that none of them went to
the <hi>lesser Churches?</hi> or were absent, though the Croud
was so great? Doth he not say, <hi>the multitudes were
so great in the smaller Churches in the Lent Assemblies,
that not a few were stifled and carried home for dead?
And therefore it was necessary to consider the multitude
at such a time.</hi> In my mind Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> might as well
prove that the whole <hi>Nation</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> made but
one <hi>Congregation;</hi> because at the dedication of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s
<hi>Temple</hi> there was so great <hi>a multitude present,</hi>
that one of the lesser <hi>Synagogues</hi> could not hold them.
But the argument is of greater force in this respect,
that <hi>God</hi> himself appointed but <hi>one Temple</hi> for the
<hi>whole Nation</hi> of the <hi>Iews:</hi> and therefore he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no more than a <hi>single Congregational Church.</hi>

that the number of <hi>Christians</hi> there should be no

is no hopes of convincing men, that can build <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
upon such strange improbabilities. I shall onely
add one Instance more from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> which is
plain enough of it self to shew the great extent of
<hi>Diocesan Power</hi> then; and that is of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> a
great and learned Bishop; and although his <hi>Bishoprick</hi>
was none of the largest, yet in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Leo</hi> he
saith,<note place="margin">Theodor. <hi>Ep.</hi> 113.</note> 
                     <hi>he had the Pastoral charge of 800 Churches; for
so many Parishes,</hi> saith he, <hi>are in my Diocese, which
he had then enjoyed twenty six years.</hi> Doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
believe that all the <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>these 800 Churches
had personal Communion with</hi> Theodoret? And yet
these <hi>Parishes</hi> did not change their <hi>species,</hi> for he saith,
<hi>they were Churches still.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Testimony of <hi>Theodoret</hi> is so full and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,<note place="margin">Treatise of Episcopacy, p. 67.</note>
that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath no other way to avoid
the force of it, but to call in question the <hi>Authority</hi> of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:95208:181"/>
the <hi>Epistle.</hi> But without any considerable ground,
unless it be that it contradicts his Hypothesis. For,
<hi>what if</hi> Theodoret'<hi>s Epistles came out of the</hi> Vatican
<hi>Copy?</hi> Is that a sufficient argument to reject them,
unless some inconsistency be proved in those Epistles,
with the History of those times, or with his other
Writings?<note place="margin">Critic. Sacr. l. 4. c. 21.</note> Which are the <hi>Rules, Rivet</hi> gives for
judging the sincerity of them. <hi>That Epistle which</hi>
Bellarmin <hi>and others reject as spurious,</hi> is contradicted
by other Epistles of his still extant; which shew a full
reconciliation between <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and him
before his death. And it is supposed, that <hi>Iohn</hi> of
<hi>Antioch</hi> was dead some considerable time before <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril;</hi>
which manifestly overthrows the Authority of
it. But what is there like that in this <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Leo?</hi>
when the matter of fact is proved by other <hi>Epistles?</hi>
As to the unreasonable proceedings of <hi>Dioscorus</hi>
against him, (which was the occasion of writing it)
his other Epistles are so full of it, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> never
read the rest, if he calls this into question upon that
account. That <hi>Hypatius, Abramius</hi> and <hi>Alypius</hi> were
sent into the <hi>West</hi> upon <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s account, appears
by the Epistles to <hi>Renatus</hi> and <hi>Florentius,</hi>

are lost, which</hi> Nicephorus <hi>saw,</hi> doth that prove all
that are remaining to be counterfeit? But he is much

of the <hi>Epistles</hi> from it. <hi>What if</hi> Leontius <hi>saith
that Hereticks feigned Epistles in</hi> Theodoret'<hi>s name?</hi>
Doth that prove an <hi>Epistle</hi> wherein he vindicates
himself from the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Heresie,</hi> to be spurious?
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95208:182"/>
What Mr. <hi>B.</hi> means <hi>by the printing this Epistle alone
after</hi> Theodoret'<hi>s Works,</hi> I do not well understand,
unless he never saw any other than the <hi>Latin Edition</hi>
of <hi>Theodoret.</hi> But it is a very bold thing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
concerning the <hi>Authority</hi> of a man's Writings,
without so much as looking into the latest and best
Editions of them. But there are two things he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
which seem more material. (1.) <hi>That it seems
incredible that a Town within two days journey of</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch
<hi>should have 800 Churches in it at that time.
(2.) That he proves from other places in</hi> Theodoret,
<hi>that it is very improbable that Dioceses had then so
many Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. As to the first; certainly no man in his wits
ever undertook to prove, <hi>that one such City</hi> as <hi>Cyrus</hi>
then was, <hi>had 800 Churches in it.</hi> But by <hi>Cyrus,
Theodoret</hi> means the <hi>Diocese</hi> of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> as will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
appear. If <hi>Cyrus</hi> were taken for the <hi>Regio
Cyrrhestica</hi> with the bounds given it by <hi>Ptolemy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ptolem. <hi>l. 5. c.</hi> 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi>
and <hi>Pliny,</hi> then there would not appear the least
improbability in it,<note place="margin">Strab. <hi>l.</hi> 16.</note> since many considerable <hi>Cities</hi>

and extended as far as <hi>Euphrates; Zeugma</hi> being
comprehended under it. The Ecclesiastical Province
was likewise very large, and by the ancient <hi>Notitiae</hi>
it is sometimes called <hi>Euphratensis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Amm. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. <hi>l.</hi> 14.</note> which in <hi>Ammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>

(but the <hi>Regio Cyrrhestica</hi> before was distinct
from <hi>Comagena</hi> as appears by <hi>Strabo</hi> and others) in

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95208:182"/>

                     <hi>that Christianity was then
so much spread among them, that not onely the Cities,

filled with Divine Grace.</hi> And that these Villages
had <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> settled in them under the

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:95208:183"/>
to shew, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> had properly a <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san

did extend to many <hi>Parochial Churches;</hi> his <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese
being forty miles in length, and as many in breadth.</hi>
So that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> must reject, not onley that <hi>Epistle</hi> to
<hi>Leo,</hi> but the rest too, and his other Works, if he
hopes to make good his <hi>Parochial Episcopacy;</hi> which
is too hard a task to be undertaken, without better
evidence than he hath hitherto brought.</p>

had so many Churches.</hi> The question is not about the
bare <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>Dioceses,</hi> which all men
know to have been very different; but about the
<hi>extent</hi> of <hi>Episcopal Power,</hi> whether it were limited
to <hi>one Parochial Church,</hi> or was extended over many.
And what is there in <hi>Theodoret</hi> which contradicts
this? I extreamly failed of my expectation, as to
the other places of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> which he promised to
produce;<note place="margin">Treatise of Episcopacy, part 2. p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 49, 50.</note> For I find five or six places cited out of
his <hi>History,</hi> but not one that comes near any proof

shews <hi>that in a small City of</hi> Thebais,<note place="margin">l. 4. c. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Whither</hi> Eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius

denied this, where there was a prospect of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
more, as appears by the endeavours of <hi>Eulogius</hi>
and <hi>Protogenes</hi> there? But he ought to have proved
that as the <hi>Christians increased, new Bishops</hi> were

made, which this is very far from. The (3.) proves
<hi>that</hi> Lucius <hi>of</hi> Alexandria <hi>was made Bishop by force,</hi>

Alexandria <hi>was but one Assembly, which met onely in
one place at once.</hi> But it is very unhappy, that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi>
shews just the contrary in that place, for he

<hi>Valens found the Orthodox, even in the great

but to compare this <hi>Translation</hi> with the <hi>Text</hi>
in <hi>Theodoret;</hi> and I dare say, he will see cause to
admire it. But if any one can imagin that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal
Church</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> in the time of <hi>Valens</hi> could
consist but of <hi>one Congregation,</hi> for my part, I must
give him over, as one uncapable of being convinced
of any thing by me. I do not speak what the <hi>Church</hi>
in a time of great persecution might be driven to, but
of what it was in its <hi>settled state.</hi>

I am ashamed to reade, much more to confute such

not set down the <hi>bounds</hi> of the <hi>Diocese;</hi> which for
any thing we see in <hi>Theodoret,</hi> might be as large, as,
we have evidently proved from him, the <hi>Diocese of

                     <hi>But Mr.</hi> B. <hi>insists</hi> upon the Institution of Christ;
and if Christ hath appointed one sort of Churches, <hi>viz.</hi>
for personal Communion, and men make another, is not
this a violation of Christ's Command, and setting up
Man against God? <hi>I see no evidence produced for
any such</hi> Institution of Christ, <hi>which limits</hi> Episcopal
Power <hi>to a</hi> single Congregation; <hi>and therefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it to more, can be no</hi> violation <hi>of</hi> Christ's
Command, <hi>or</hi> setting up a new species of Churches, <hi>as
will appear from Mr.</hi> B. <hi>himself under the next par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.

his, as going beyond the</hi> Independents <hi>in making</hi> the
devising new species of Churches beyond Parochial or
Congregational without God's Authority, and to impose
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:95208:184"/>
them on the world, yea in his name, and call all dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Schismaticks, a far worse usurpation than to make
or impose new Ceremonies or Liturgies. But is not all
this true supposing that such new species of Churches be
so devised and so imposed? <hi>That is not to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
for that which I quoted it for, was to shew
that Mr.</hi> B. <hi>looked upon all</hi> Churches beyond Parochial,
as Churches meerly of mens devising; <hi>and that</hi> to charge
men with Schism for opposing any such Constitution is
unreasonable; <hi>and that</hi> the imposing it as Divine, is an
intolerable usurpation; <hi>and all this at the same time,
when he pretends to write for</hi> Peace <hi>and</hi> Concord.

seem to accuse God of mutability, as settling one form
of Government for one Age onely, and no longer. 3. We
leave room for audacious Wits accordingly to question
other Gospel Institutions, as Pastours, Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and to say, they were but for an Age. 4. It was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Officers Christ promised to be with, to the end of
the world, <hi>Matt. 28. 20. Which being joyned with
the</hi> Consent <hi>of the</hi> Christian Church of the Ages suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
the Apostles, <hi>that the</hi> Apostles <hi>did leave</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
<hi>in the</hi> care <hi>and</hi> Government <hi>of</hi> Churches, <hi>have
a great deal of weight in them, and overballance the</hi>
difficulties <hi>on the other side. As upon this occasion
I think fit to declare. From whence I argue thus,
That which is onely a</hi> Continuance <hi>of the</hi> same kind
of Churches <hi>which were in being in the</hi> Apostolical
times <hi>is</hi> no devising a new species of Churches, <hi>nor
hath any thing</hi> repugnant to any Institution of Christ.
<hi>But that is the case as to our</hi> Episcopacy. <hi>We intend
no quarrel about names: If it be Mr.</hi> B.'<hi>s pleasure to
call our</hi> Bishops, Archbishops, <hi>let him enjoy his own
fancy. It already appears from Saint</hi> Cyprian, <hi>and
might much more be made plain from many others if
it were needfull, that the</hi> Bishops <hi>of the</hi> several Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<hi>were looked on as</hi> Successours <hi>to the</hi> Apostles <hi>in
the</hi> care <hi>and</hi> Government <hi>of</hi> Churches. <hi>Now the</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<hi>of Mr.</hi> B.'<hi>s</hi> Parochial Bishops <hi>was onely to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to</hi> one particular Congregation; <hi>but the</hi> Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Office <hi>was above this, while the</hi> Apostles <hi>held it
in their own hands; and did not make a</hi> new species
<hi>of</hi> Churches, <hi>nor overthrow the</hi> Constitution <hi>of</hi> Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Churches. <hi>It seems then a strange thing to me,
that the continuance of the same kind of</hi> Office <hi>in the</hi>
Church, <hi>should be called the</hi> devising a new species of
Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:95208:185"/>
But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> runs upon this perpetual mistake, that
our <hi>English Episcopacy</hi> is not a <hi>succession</hi> to the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
part</hi> of the <hi>Apostolical Power</hi> in <hi>Governing Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi>
but a <hi>new sort</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> not heard of in the
<hi>ancient Church,</hi> which swallows up the <hi>whole Power</hi>
of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and leaves them onely a bare name of
<hi>Curates,</hi> and destroyes the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>Parochial Churches.</hi>
But if I can make the contrary to appear from the
<hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> I hope Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
will be reconciled to our <hi>Episcopal Government,</hi> and
endeavour to remove the <hi>prejudices</hi> he hath caused

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. Now to examin this, let us consider two
things. (1.) What <hi>Power</hi> is left to <hi>Presbyters</hi> in our
<hi>Church.</hi> (2.) What <hi>Authority</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> of our
<hi>Church</hi> have over them.</p>
                  <p>I. What <hi>Power</hi> is left to <hi>presbyters</hi> in our <hi>Church:</hi>
and that may be considered two ways. 1. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the <hi>whole Body</hi> of this <hi>Church.</hi> 2. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to their particular <hi>Congregations</hi> or <hi>Cures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. With respect to the <hi>whole Body</hi> of this <hi>Church:</hi>
and so (1.) There are no <hi>Rules of Discipline,</hi> no <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Doctrine,</hi> no <hi>Form of Divine Service,</hi> are to
be allowed or received in this <hi>Nation;</hi> but, by the
<hi>Constitution</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of it
have their <hi>Votes</hi> in passing them, either in <hi>Person,</hi>
or by <hi>Proxy.</hi> For, all things of that <hi>Nature,</hi> are to
pass both <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Convocation;</hi> and the <hi>lower House</hi>
consists wholly of <hi>Presbyters;</hi> who represent the
whole <hi>Presbytery</hi> of the <hi>Nation;</hi> either appearing
by their <hi>own Right,</hi> as many do; or as <hi>being chosen
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:95208:186"/>
by the rest,</hi> from whom <hi>by Indentures</hi> they either do,
or ought to receive <hi>Power</hi> to transact things in their
<hi>names.</hi> And the <hi>Custom</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi> hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
been, for the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Dioceses</hi> to give <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
Proxies</hi> in particular <hi>Cases</hi> to their <hi>Procuratours.</hi>
Now I appeal to any man of understanding, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Clergy</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi> have their <hi>whole Power</hi>
swallowed up by the <hi>Bishops,</hi> when yet the <hi>Bishops</hi>
have no power to oblige them to any <hi>Rules</hi> or <hi>Canons</hi>
but by their <hi>own consent;</hi> and they do freely vote
in all things of <hi>common concernment</hi> to the <hi>Church;</hi>
and therefore the <hi>Presbyters</hi> are not by the <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
deprived of their <hi>share</hi> in one of the greatest
<hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> viz. in making <hi>Rules</hi> for the
<hi>whole Body.</hi> And in this main part of <hi>Government</hi>
the <hi>Bishops</hi> do nothing without the <hi>Counsel</hi> of their
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> and in this respect our <hi>Church</hi> falls behind
none of the <hi>ancient Churches,</hi> which had their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
of <hi>Presbyters</hi> together with their <hi>Bishops;</hi> onely,
there, they were taken <hi>singly</hi> in <hi>every City;</hi> and here
they are combined together in <hi>Provincial Synods;</hi>
model'd according to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi> And
when the <hi>whole Body</hi> of <hi>Doctrine, Discipline</hi> and
<hi>Worship</hi> are thus agreed upon by a general consent,
there seems to be far less need of the particular <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
of <hi>Presbyters</hi> to every <hi>Bishop;</hi> since both <hi>Bishops</hi>
and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are now under <hi>fixed Rules,</hi> and are
accountable for the breach of them.<note place="margin">Can. 31. &amp; 35.</note> (2.) <hi>In gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

to be Ordained</hi> (or the <hi>Bishop</hi> in their presence)
and afterwards <hi>to joyn in the laying on of hands upon
the Persons ordained.</hi> And is all this nothing but to

2. <hi>As to their</hi> particular charges; <hi>one would think
those who make this objection, had never read over
the</hi> Office <hi>of</hi> Ordination; <hi>for therein (1.) For the</hi>
Epistle <hi>is read the charge given by Saint</hi> Paul <hi>to the</hi>
Elders <hi>at</hi> Miletus, <hi>Act. 20. or the</hi> third Chapter <hi>of the</hi>
first Epistle <hi>to</hi> Timothy; <hi>concerning the</hi> Office <hi>of a</hi>
Bishop. <hi>What a great impertinency had both these
been, if the</hi> Presbyters Power <hi>had been quite swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by the</hi> Bishops? <hi>But it hence appears, that
our</hi> Church <hi>looked on the</hi> Elders <hi>at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>and the</hi>
Bishop <hi>in</hi> Timothy <hi>to be</hi> Presbyters, <hi>as yet under the
care and Government of the</hi> Apostles, <hi>or such as they
deputed for that Office, such as</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus
<hi>were. Which I suppose is the true meaning of Saint</hi>
Ierome <hi>and many other doubtfull passages of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
which relate to the</hi> community <hi>of the</hi> names
<hi>of</hi> Bishop <hi>and</hi> Presbyter, <hi>while the</hi> Apostles <hi>governed
the Church themselves. And at this time</hi> Timothy
<hi>being appointed to this part of the</hi> Apostolical Office
<hi>of</hi> Government, <hi>the</hi> Bishops <hi>mentioned in the</hi> Epistle
<hi>to him, may well enough be the same with the</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
<hi>in the</hi> Epistle <hi>to</hi> Titus, <hi>who was</hi> appointed to
ordain Elders in every City, <hi>Titus 1. 5. (2.) In the</hi>
Bishop's Exhortation <hi>to them that are to be ordained,
he saith,</hi> Now we exhort you in the name of the Lord
Iesus Christ, to have in remembrance into how high a
dignity, and to how chargeable an Office ye be called,
that is to say, the Messengers and Watchmen, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
and Stewards of the Lord, to teach, to premonish,
to feed and provide for the Lord's Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have
always therefore printed in your remembrance, how
great a treasure is committed to your charge; for they
be the Sheep of Christ which he bought with his death,
and for whom he shed his bloud. The Church and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95208:187"/>
whom you must serve is his Spouse and Body.
And if it shall chance the same Church, or any member
thereof, to take any hurt or hinderance, by reason of
your negligence, you know the greatness of the fault and
of the horrible punishment which will ensue, <hi>&amp;c. Is this
the language of a</hi> Church <hi>which deprives</hi> Presbyters
<hi>of the</hi> due care of their flocks, <hi>and makes</hi> Parochial
Congregations <hi>to be</hi> no Churches? <hi>(3.) The person
to be ordained doth solemnly promise</hi> to give faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
diligence to minister the Doctrine and Sacraments,
and the Discipline of Christ as the Lord hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and as this Realm hath received the same, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Commandments of God, so that he may
teach the People committed to his Cure and charge,
with all diligence to keep and observe the same. <hi>Here
we see a</hi> Cure <hi>and</hi> charge <hi>committed to the</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
Preaching <hi>and</hi> Administration <hi>of</hi> Sacraments
<hi>required of them; and the</hi> exercise of Discipline <hi>as
far as belongs to them, (of which afterwards): but
now in the</hi> Consecration <hi>of a</hi> Bishop, <hi>this part is left
out, and instead of that it is said,</hi> That he is called to
the Government of the Church; and he is required to
correct and punish such as be unquiet, disobedient and
criminous in his Diocese. <hi>So that the more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
charge <hi>of</hi> Souls <hi>is committed to every</hi> Pastour
<hi>over his own Flock, and the general care of</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>and</hi> Discipline <hi>is committed to the</hi> Bishop; <hi>as
that which especially belongs to his</hi> Office <hi>as distinct
from the other.</hi>

               <div n="13" type="section">
                  <p>Sect. 13. <hi>II. Which is the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,</hi>
viz. What Authority the Bishop hath, by virtue
of his Consecration, in this Church? <hi>And that, I say,
is what Mr.</hi> B. <hi>calls the</hi> ordinary parts of the Apostolical
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95208:187"/>
Authority; <hi>which lies in three things,</hi> Government,
Ordination <hi>and</hi> Censures. <hi>And that our</hi> Church <hi>did
believe our</hi> Bishops <hi>to succeed the</hi> Apostles <hi>in those
parts of their</hi> Office, <hi>I shall make appear by these
things. (1.) In the</hi> Preface <hi>before the</hi> Book <hi>of</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
<hi>it is said,</hi> That it is evident unto all men,
diligently reading holy Scripture, and ancient Authours,
that from the Apostles time, there have been these Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Ministers in Christ's Church, Bishops, Priests
and Deacons. <hi>What is the reason that they express
it thus,</hi> from the Apostles time, <hi>rather than</hi> in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
times, <hi>but that they believed, while the</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<hi>lived, they managed the affairs of Government
themselves; but as they withdrew, they did in some
Churches sooner, and in some later, as their own</hi>
continuance, <hi>the</hi> condition <hi>of the</hi> Churches, <hi>and the</hi>
qualification <hi>of</hi> Persons <hi>were, commit the care and
Government of</hi> Churches <hi>to such</hi> Persons <hi>whom they
appointed thereto? Of which, we have an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
evidence in the Instances of</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi>
Titus; <hi>for the care of</hi> Government <hi>was a distinct
thing from the</hi> Office <hi>of an</hi> Evangelist; <hi>and all their
removes do not invalidate this, because while the</hi>
Apostles <hi>lived, it is probable there were no fixed</hi>
Bishops, <hi>or but few. But as they went off, so they
came to be settled in their several</hi> Churches. <hi>And as
this is most agreeable to the</hi> sense <hi>of our</hi> Church, <hi>so
it is the fairest</hi> Hypothesis <hi>for reconciling the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>
Testimonies <hi>of</hi> Antiquity. <hi>For hereby the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of</hi> Bishops <hi>is secured from the</hi> Apostles <hi>times,
for which the Testimonies of</hi> Irenaeus, Tertullian,
<hi>Saint</hi> Cyprian, <hi>and others, are so plain; hereby room
is left to make good all that Saint</hi> Ierom <hi>hath said;
and what</hi> Epiphanius <hi>delivers concerning the differing</hi>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:95208:188"/>
settlements <hi>of</hi> Churches <hi>at first. So that we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
for the</hi> Community <hi>of names, between</hi> Bishop
<hi>and</hi> Presbyter, <hi>for a while in the</hi> Church, i. e. <hi>while
the</hi> Apostles <hi>governed the</hi> Churches <hi>themselves; but
afterwards, that which was then part of the</hi> Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Office, <hi>became the</hi> Episcopal, <hi>which hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
from that time to this, by a constant succession
in the</hi> Church. (2.) Archbishop Whitgift <hi>several times
declares</hi> that these parts of the Apostolical Office still
remained in the Bishops of our Church.<note place="margin">Defence of the Answer to the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. p. 218.</note> As for this
part of the Apostles function, <hi>saith he,</hi> to visit such
Churches as were before planted, and to provide that
such were placed in them, as were vertuous and godly
Pastours, I know it remaineth still, and is one of the
chief parts of the Bishops function. <hi>And again,</hi> there
is now no planting of Churches,<note place="margin">p. 424.</note> nor going through the
whole world, there is no writing of new Gospels, no
prophesying of things to come, but there is Governing
of Churches, visiting of them, reforming of Pastours
and directing of them, which is a portion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
function.<note place="margin">p. 427.</note> 
                     <hi>Again,</hi> Although that this part of
the Apostolical Office which did consist in planting and
founding of Churches through the whole world is cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
yet the manner of Government by placing Bishops
in every City, by moderating and Governing them, by
visiting the Churches, by cutting off schisms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
by ordering Ministers remaineth still, and
shall continue, and is in this Church in the Archbishops
and Bishops, as most meet men to execute the same.
Bishop Bilson <hi>fully agrees, as to these particulars.</hi>
(1.) That the Apostles did not at first commit the
Churches to the Government of Bishops,<note place="margin">Perpetual Government of Christ's Church. ch. 12. p. 224.</note> but reserved
the chief power of Government in their own hands.
(2.) That upon experience of the confusion and disorder
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:95208:188"/>
which did arise through equality of Pastours, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
at their departures certain approved men to be
Bishops.<note place="margin">ch. 13 p. 244.</note> (3.) That these Bishops did succeed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in the care and Government of Churches, <hi>as he
proves at large; and therefore he calls</hi> their function
Apostolick. <hi>Instead of many others, which it were
easie to produce, I shall onely add the</hi> Testimony <hi>of
King</hi> Charles <hi>I. in his</hi> debates <hi>about</hi> Episcopacy, <hi>who
understood the</hi> Constitution <hi>of our</hi> Church <hi>as well as
any</hi> Bishop <hi>in it, and defended it with as clear and as
strong a Reason. In his</hi> third Paper <hi>to</hi> Henderson,
<hi>he hath these words,</hi> Where you find a Bishop and
Presbyter in Scripture to be one and the same (which
I deny to be always so) it is in the Apostles times;
now I think to prove the Order of Bishops succeeded that
of the Apostles, and that the name was chiefly altered
in reverence to those who were immediately chosen by
our Saviour. <hi>In his</hi> first Paper <hi>at the</hi> Treaty <hi>at</hi> New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
<hi>he thus states the case about</hi> Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I conceive that Episcopal Government is most
consonant to the word of God, and of an Apostolical
Institution, as it appears by the Scriptures to have been
practised by the Apostles themselves, and by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
and derived to particular persons as their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
or successours therein (as for ordaining Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Deacons, giving Rules concerning Christian
Discipline, and exercising Censures over Presbyters and
others) and hath ever since to these last times been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
by Bishops in all the Churches of Christ, and
therefore I cannot in conscience consent to abolish the
said Government. <hi>In his</hi> Reply <hi>to the</hi> first Answer
<hi>of the</hi> Divines, <hi>he saith,</hi> that meer Presbyters are
<hi>Episcopi Gregis</hi> onely, they have the oversight of the
Flock in the duties of Preaching, Administration of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95208:189"/>
Sacraments, publick Prayer, Exhorting, Rebuking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but Bishops are <hi>Episcopi Gregis &amp; Pastorum</hi> too, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the oversight of Flock and Pastours within their
several precincts in the Acts of external Government.
And that, although the Apostles had no Successours <hi>in
eundem gradum</hi> as to those things that were extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in them, as namely the Measure of their Gifts,
the extent of their charge, the infallibility of their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
and the having seen Christ in the flesh: but in
those things that were not extraordinary (and such those
things are to be judged which are necessary for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Church in all times, as the Office of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and the Power of Governing are) they were to have
and had Successours; and therefore the learned and
godly Fathers and Councils of old times did usually stile
Bishops the Successours of the Apostles without ever scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
thereat. <hi>Many other passages might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out of those</hi> excellent Papers <hi>to the same purpose,
but these are sufficient to discover that our</hi> Bishops
<hi>are looked on as</hi> Successours <hi>to the</hi> Apostles, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>hath no reason to call our</hi> Episcopacy
a new devised species of Churches, <hi>and such as destroys
the</hi> being of Parochial Churches.</p>

be able to give an account of the necessary points of

in the</hi> Creed, <hi>the</hi> Lord's Prayer, <hi>the</hi> Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
<hi>and the</hi> Church Catechism; <hi>and of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
herein the</hi> Parochial Minister <hi>is the</hi> Iudge.
<hi>For he is</hi> either to bring or send in writing, with his

the</hi> Objections <hi>made against the</hi> Discipline <hi>of this</hi>

to have truly repented and amended his former

an account to the Ordinary within 14 days; and the

Here is plainly a <hi>Power</hi> granted to put back any

Churches</hi> for want of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Discipline?</hi>
Is it that they have not <hi>Power</hi> to exclude men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their faults be <hi>Scandalous</hi> to the <hi>Congregation</hi> or
not? Or is it, that they are bound to justify what
they doe, and to prosecute the Person for those
faults for which they put him back from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?</hi>
Or is it, that they have not <hi>Power</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

served to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> upon full hearing of all parties

to keep back <hi>notorious Offenders,</hi> it will be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to prove from other circumstances that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <note place="margin">Defence of the Plea. p. 58.</note> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith, <hi>that if it could be proved,
that the lesser excommunication out of our particular
Congregations were allowed to the Parish Ministers, it
would half reconcile him to the English sort of Prelacy;
but if it be so, he hath been in a sleep these 50 years,
that could never hear or read of any such thing.</hi> It is
strange, in all this time, he should never reade or
consider the 26 Canon, which saith, <hi>that no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
shall in any wise admit any one of his Flock, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his care to the Communion of the Lord's Supper,
who is notoriously known to live impenitently in any

Ecclesiasticarum,</hi> which he mentions <hi>as an abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
thing, published by Iohn Fox,</hi> (which last any
one that hath seen them, knows to be a mistake)
nor <hi>in</hi> Dr. <hi>Mocket</hi>'s <hi>Book which was burnt;</hi> yet not so

seen it (but it was <hi>for nothing of this kind,</hi> that

Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls <hi>the Authorized Church Canons;</hi> which
I think are plain in this case. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith, <hi>this

to such persons.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>B.</hi> call it by what

is required to doe this; the question then
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:95208:191"/>
is, whether this be not such a <hi>Censure</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
as to suspend <hi>notorious Offenders</hi> from the <hi>Sacrament;</hi>
and that within the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Parochial Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster?</hi>
I grant, this is not <hi>the lesser excommunication,</hi>
according to the <hi>Vse</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> for that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the <hi>sentence</hi> passed; and is so called by way of
distinction from the <hi>greater</hi> pronounced by the <hi>Bishop</hi>
in Person, upon extraordinary occasions. But yet
it is a <hi>Church-censure</hi> upon <hi>Offenders,</hi> and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a sort of <hi>excommunication</hi> by the <hi>Ancient

there was no question, wherever there was a <hi>Power</hi>
to <hi>suspend</hi> any <hi>Persons</hi> from <hi>Communion,</hi> there was a

did not consist merely in the <hi>power of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
no more than a <hi>Iudges</hi> power lies onely in

                  <p>2. It is far easier to <hi>separate,</hi> or complain for <hi>want</hi>
of <hi>Discipline,</hi> than to find out a <hi>due way</hi> to restore
it.<note place="margin">Of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. p. 174, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

those most who stand in need of it; and be

                  <p>3. The case of our <hi>Churches</hi> now, is very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that of the <hi>Churches</hi> in the <hi>Primitive times.</hi>
For, the great <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Discipline</hi> is not, that for
want of it the <hi>Consciences</hi> of <hi>Fellow-communicants</hi>
would be <hi>defiled</hi> (for to assert that, were <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism)</hi>
but that the <hi>honour</hi> of a <hi>Christian Society</hi> may
be maintained. If then the <hi>Christian Magistrates</hi> do
take care to vindicate the <hi>Churches honour</hi> by <hi>due pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi>
of <hi>Scandalous Offenders,</hi> there will appear
so much less necessity of restoring the <hi>severity</hi> of the
<hi>ancient Discipline.</hi> To which purpose these words
of the <hi>Royal Martyr King Charles</hi> I. are very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.<note place="margin">His Majesties final Answer to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines at <hi>Newport,</hi> n. 4.</note>
                     <q>But his <hi>Majesty</hi> seeth no necessity that
the <hi>Bishops</hi> challenge to the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi>
should be at all times as large as the <hi>exercise</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
at some times appeareth to have been; the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise</hi>
thereof being variable according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conditions of the <hi>Church</hi> in different times.
And therefore his <hi>Majesty</hi> doth not believe that
the <hi>Bishops</hi> under <hi>Christian Princes</hi> do challenge
such an <hi>amplitude</hi> of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> to belong unto
them in respect of their <hi>Episcopal Office</hi> precisely,
as was exercised in the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> by <hi>Bishops</hi>
before the days of <hi>Constantine.</hi> The reason of the
difference being evident, that in those former times
under <hi>Pagan Princes,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> was a <hi>distinct Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
of it self, divided from the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and
so was to be governed by its own <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;</hi>
the <hi>Bishops</hi> therefore of those times, though
they had no outward coercive power over
mens Persons or Estates, yet in as much as every
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:95208:193"/>
Christian man when he became a Member of the
Church, did <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and by that his own
voluntary Act put himself under their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they exercised a very large Power of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<hi>in spiritualibus,</hi> in making <hi>Ecclesiastical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi>
receiving accusations, converting the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
examining Witnesses, judging of Crimes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
such as they found guilty of <hi>Scandalous
offences</hi> from the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> enjoyning Penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
upon them, casting them out of the Church,
receiving them again upon their Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And all this they exercised as well over <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
as others. But after that the <hi>Church</hi> under
<hi>Christian Princes</hi> began to be incorporated into the
<hi>Common-wealth,</hi> whereupon there must of necessity
follow a <hi>complication</hi> of the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical
Power,</hi> the <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> (in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
exercise of it) was subordinate unto, and
limitable by the Supreme Civil Power, and hath
been, and is at this day, so acknowledged by the
Bishops of this Realm.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The due exercise of <hi>Discipline</hi> is a work of so
much <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>difficulty,</hi> that the greatest <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi>
for it, have not thought it fit to be trusted in
the hands of every <hi>Parochial Minister</hi> and his <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Congregation.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Calvin. <hi>Ep.</hi> 136.</note> 
                     <hi>Calvin</hi> declares, <hi>that he never
thought it convenient that every Minister should have
the power of Excommunication: not onely because of
the invidiousness of the thing, and the danger of the
example; but because of the great abuses and Tyranny
it may soon fall into, and because it was contrary to the
Apostolical Practice.</hi> And to the same purpose, <hi>Beza</hi>
delivers his judgment, who likewise gives this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:95208:194"/>
of the <hi>Discipline</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi>

                     <hi>that the Parochial
Ministers and Elders proceed no farther than Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but in case of Contumacy they certify the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
of the City which sits at certain times and hears
all Causes relating to Discipline, and as they judge fit
either give admonition, or proceed to suspension from
the Lord's Supper; or, which is a rare case, and when
no other remedy can prevail, they go on to publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</hi>
Where we see, every <hi>Parochial Church</hi>
is no more trusted with the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Discipline</hi> than
among us; nay, the <hi>Minister</hi> here hath no power <hi>to
repel,</hi> but all that he can doe there is <hi>to admonish;</hi>
and how come then their <hi>Parochial Churches</hi> to be
<hi>true,</hi> and not ours? Besides, why may not our <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>
be obliged to <hi>certify</hi> the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as well as

Churches</hi> the matter of <hi>Discipline</hi> was so much reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> that a <hi>Presbyter had no power to

without the advice and direction of the Bishop;</hi> and
Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> proposed it, <hi>that whosoever received
one that declined the judgment of his own Bishop, should
undergoe the same censure which that person deserved;
and it was allowed by the Council. Alipius,</hi> Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustins</hi>

<hi>Numidia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">c. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>proposed the case of a Presbyter under the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

                     <note place="margin">c. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>and he desired to know the judgment of
the Council about it; and they unanimously determined
that he was guilty of Schism, and ought to be anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized,
and to lose his place.</hi> And this was the
<hi>Iudgment</hi> even of the <hi>African Bishops,</hi> for whom
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> professeth greater reverence than for any
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:95208:194"/>
others; and saith, <hi>their Councils were the best in the
world;</hi> and commends <hi>their Canons for very good about
Discipline.</hi> But he pretends <hi>that a Bishop's Diocese
there, was but like one of our Parishes,</hi> which I have
already refuted at large, by shewing that there were
places at a considerable distance under the care of the
<hi>Bishops.</hi> So that the bringing the <hi>full power</hi> of <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
into <hi>every Parochial Church,</hi> is contrary to the
practice of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Reformed
Churches</hi> abroad, which plead most for <hi>Discipline;</hi>
and would unavoidably be the occasion of great and
scandalous disorders, by the ill management of the
<hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Excommunication;</hi> as was most evident by
the <hi>Separatists</hi> when they took this <hi>Sword</hi> into their
hands, and by their foolish and passionate, and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
use of it, brought more <hi>dishonour</hi> upon their
<hi>Churches,</hi> than if they had never meddled with it at all.
And in such a matter, where the <hi>honour</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Society</hi> is the chief thing concerned, it becomes
wise men to consider what tends most to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of that; and whether the good, men promise
themselves by <hi>Discipline,</hi> will countervail the <hi>Schisms</hi>
and <hi>Contentions,</hi> the heart-burnings, and animosities
which would follow the <hi>Parochial exercise</hi> of it. The
dissenting Brethren in their Apologetical Narration
do say,<note place="margin">p. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>That they had the fatal miscarriages and ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecks
of the separation, as Land-marks to forewarn
them of the rocks and shelves they ran upon;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they say <hi>they never exercised the Power of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 9.</note>
For they saw plainly, they could
never hold their <hi>People</hi> together if they did; since
the <hi>excommunicated party</hi> would be sure to make
friends enough, at least to make <hi>breaches</hi> among them;
and they holding together by <hi>mutual consent,</hi> such
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:95208:195"/>
                     <hi>ruptures</hi> would soon break their <hi>Churches</hi> to pieces.
Besides, this would be thought no less than setting
up an <hi>Arbitrary Court of Iudicature</hi> in <hi>every Parish;</hi>
because there are no <hi>certain Rules</hi> to proceed by;
no standing determination what those sins and faults
are, which should deserve <hi>excommunication;</hi> no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of trials agreed upon; no security against false
Witnesses; no limitation of Causes; no liberty of
Appeals, (if <hi>Parochial Churches</hi> be the onely <hi>insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Churches,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirms:) besides multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of other inconveniencies, which may be easily
foreseen; so that I do not question, but if Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
had the management of this <hi>Parochial Discipline</hi>
in any one <hi>Parish</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and proceeded by
his own <hi>Rules;</hi> his <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Discipline</hi> would be
cried out upon in a short time, as more <hi>arbitrary</hi> and
<hi>tyrannical,</hi> than any <hi>Bishop's Court</hi> this day in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
Let any one therefore judge, how reasonable
it is for him to overthrow the <hi>being</hi> of our <hi>Parochial
Churches,</hi> for <hi>want</hi> of that, which being set up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own <hi>principles,</hi> would destroy the
<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity,</hi> if not the very being, of any <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Church</hi> whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>5. That <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Discipline,</hi> which is in <hi>Parochial
Churches,</hi> was never thought by the most zealous
<hi>Non-conformists</hi> of old, destructive to the <hi>Being</hi> of
them. Of which I have already produced the <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
of <hi>Cartwright, Hildersham, Giffard,</hi> and many
others.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. And supposing all persons left to the
<hi>judgment</hi> of their <hi>own Consciences,</hi> as to their own
<hi>fitness</hi> for the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> we may observe these
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:95208:195"/>
things; which may serve towards the <hi>vindication</hi> of
our <hi>Parochial Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1.) That the <hi>greatest Offenders</hi> do generally <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate</hi>
themselves; not daring to venture upon
so hazardous a thing, as they account the <hi>holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
to be, for fear of the <hi>damnation</hi> following
<hi>unworthy receiving.</hi> So that, the most constant <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants,</hi>
are the most <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>devout
Christians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) That if any such do voluntarily come, it is
upon some great <hi>awakenings of Conscience;</hi> some <hi>fresh
resolutions</hi> they have made of amendment of life;
after some dangerous sickness, or under some great
affliction; when they are best inclined, and have
strong convictions, and hope for greater <hi>strength</hi> of
<hi>Grace</hi> against the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Temptations.</hi> So that
whether this <hi>Sacrament</hi> be a <hi>converting Ordinance</hi> or
not, by <hi>God's Institution,</hi> yet the <hi>preparation</hi> and
disposition of men's minds before it, puts them into
the fittest capacity for <hi>Divine Grace;</hi> if they be not
looked on as the <hi>effects</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>(3.) That it is no prejudice to the benefit of this
<hi>holy Sacrament</hi> to those who are well prepared, if
those who are not, do come to it; any more than in
joyning in <hi>Prayer</hi> or <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> with them. And
if the presence of such persons who deserve <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi>
and are <hi>not excommunicated,</hi> do overthrow
the <hi>being</hi> of a <hi>Church;</hi> then <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Disciples</hi>
did not make a <hi>Church,</hi> when <hi>Iudas</hi> was present with
them; as in probability he was, at his last <hi>Supper.</hi>
At least, if this kind of <hi>Discipline</hi> had been so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:95208:196"/>
it would never have been left so doubtfull, as
it is by the <hi>Evangelists;</hi> since it had been necessary
for the <hi>information</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> to have
set it down expresly; not onely that he was not
present, but that he <hi>ought not to be;</hi> and therefore
was <hi>cast out</hi> before.</p>
                  <p>(4.) That several <hi>Presbyterian Churches</hi> for many
years had no <hi>Discipline</hi> at all among them; nor so
much as the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> administred. And were
these <hi>true Churches</hi> all that while, and are not ours
so now?<note place="margin">Plea for Peace, p. 243.</note> Nay Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith, <hi>That some Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
have these seventeen or eighteen years forborn
to Baptize,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Answ. 10 Serm.</note> 
                     <hi>or administer the Lord's Supper, or to be
Pastours of any Churches.</hi> Now I would fain know,
what <hi>Churches</hi> these men are of? Some or other they
must own, if they be <hi>Christians; New Churches they
have not,</hi> they say; either then they must own <hi>our
Churches</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>defect</hi> of
<hi>Discipline,</hi> or they must be of <hi>no Church</hi> at all.</p>
                  <p>(5.) That our Church is but in the same condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and other <hi>Churches</hi>
were in, when <hi>Nectarius</hi> changed the <hi>Discipline</hi> of
it, or rather took it quite away. For, the <hi>Poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary,</hi>
whom he removed for the scandal given, was
the Person whose business it was to look after the
<hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to see that all known
<hi>Offenders</hi> performed the <hi>Penance</hi> enjoyned them, for
satisfaction of the <hi>Church.</hi> And, the consequence of
it <hi>Socrates</hi> saith was,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Socr.</hi> l. 5. c. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>That every one was left to the
judgment of his own Conscience, as to the participation
of the holy Mysteries.</hi> And this <hi>Socrates</hi> saith, he had
from <hi>Eudaemon</hi> himself, who gave the Counsel to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:95208:196"/>
                     <hi>Nectarius to take that Office away;</hi> which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
done;<note place="margin">Soz. l. 7. c. 16.</note> and <hi>no more restored,</hi> saith <hi>Sozomen:</hi>
the consequence whereof was, saith he, <hi>that every
one went to the Lord's Table,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>as his Conscience gave him leave, and
as he was assured in his own mind.</hi> And this example
of <hi>Nectarius</hi> was soon followed <hi>in other Churches,</hi>
saith <hi>Sozomen;</hi> and so the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
decayed. But I hope all those <hi>Churches</hi> did not lose
their <hi>being,</hi> by the loss of <hi>Discipline.</hi> And so much
in vindication of our <hi>Diocesan Church Government.</hi>

of <hi>our Church.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Serm. p. 19.</note> By the <hi>Church of England,</hi> I said,
<q>we meant that <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Christian People</hi> which in
this Nation are united under the same <hi>Profession</hi> of
<hi>Faith,</hi> the same <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> of
<hi>Divine Worship.</hi> And that this was a very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
and true notion of our <hi>National Church,</hi> I
proved from the first notion of a <hi>Church,</hi> which is
a <hi>Society</hi> of men united together for their <hi>Order</hi>
and <hi>Government</hi> according to the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Christian
Religion.</hi> And since, the lowest kind of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
viz. <hi>Congregations</hi> for <hi>Worship,</hi> are called <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi>
since the largest <hi>Society</hi> of all <hi>Christians</hi> is
accounted a <hi>true Catholick Church;</hi> and both from
their <hi>union</hi> and <hi>consent</hi> in some common thing; I
said I did not understand why a <hi>National Society</hi>
agreeing together in the <hi>same Faith,</hi> and under the
<hi>same Government</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> might not be as
truly and properly <hi>a Church,</hi> as any <hi>particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations?</hi>
Because the narrowness or largeness of
extent doth not alter the <hi>nature</hi> of the thing: the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>France</hi> being as truly a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:95208:197"/>
the small <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Ivetot:</hi> and as several <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
make one <hi>Kingdom,</hi> so several <hi>lesser Churches</hi>
make <hi>one National.</hi> And that this notion was not
disagreeing with the importance of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
I shewed, that at <hi>Athens,</hi> from whence the

                        </gap> too; and from thence in the <hi>first
Ages</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> the name of a <hi>Church</hi>
comprehended in it the <hi>Ecclesiastical Governours</hi> and
<hi>People</hi> of <hi>whole Cities,</hi> and therefore might by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Reason be extended to many Cities united
together under one civil Government and the same
Rules of Religion.</q> This is the substance of what
I delivered upon this subject; against which all my
Adversaries have something to say, though not with
equal strength, clearness, or temper. Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> saith
(1.) <hi>That since I make National Churches to begin
with the dissolution of the Roman Empire,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vindicat. of Non-conform. p. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>it fell out a
great while after the first Institution of Churches, and
therefore they are not concerned in it: because he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
Congregational Churches to be entire Churches of
Christ's Institution, and therefore to have a just right
to govern and reform themselves, independently as to
any National Constitution.</hi> To which I answer, that
if the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Christs Institution</hi> be not limited to
<hi>particular Congregations,</hi> as I have already proved,
then the gradual increase of <hi>Churches,</hi> till they came
to be <hi>National,</hi> doth not alter any <hi>Institution of
Christ;</hi> and consequently the <hi>Power</hi> of those <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>

or else nothing but disorder and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of a <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
No,<note place="margin">p. 17.</note> saith Dr. <hi>O. the case is not the same. For God
never appointed that there should be no other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but that of Families.</hi> And where hath he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
that there should be no other <hi>Churches</hi> but
particular <hi>Congregations? But God by the Light and
Law of Nature, by the ends and use of the Creation of
man, by express Revelation in his Word, hath by his
own Authority, appointed and approved other sorts of
Civil Government.</hi> So say I, that <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>Light</hi>
and <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> by the <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>use</hi> of a <hi>Christian
Society,</hi> by <hi>express Institution</hi> of the <hi>Apostolical func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in the <hi>care</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>many Churches</hi>
did declare, that he did appoint and approve other
<hi>sorts</hi> of <hi>Church Government</hi> besides that of <hi>particular
Congregations.</hi> For, if <hi>God</hi> upon the <hi>dispersion</hi> of
the <hi>Nations</hi> after the <hi>Floud,</hi> had appointed <hi>twelve
Princes</hi> to have ruled the People in their several
dispersions, it had been a plain demonstration he did
not intend the <hi>several Families</hi> to have a <hi>distinct</hi>
and <hi>independent Power</hi> within themselves; but that
they ought to be governed according to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment;
so in the case of <hi>Churches;</hi> since <hi>Christ</hi>
did appoint <hi>twelve Apostles</hi> to plant, settle and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
<hi>Churches,</hi> and set up <hi>Rulers</hi> in them, but still
under their <hi>Authority,</hi> can any thing be plainer, than
that these particular <hi>Churches</hi> were not settled with
an <hi>entire power of governing themselves?</hi> But as in the
former case, if we suppose those <hi>twelve Princes</hi> to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:95208:198"/>
have led out their several <hi>Divisions,</hi> and to have
placed them in convenient <hi>Seats,</hi> and given them
general <hi>Rules</hi> for governing themselves in <hi>Peace</hi>
and <hi>Order</hi> under such as they should appoint,
and as they found themselves decaying, should no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
so many <hi>Successours</hi> as they thought fit for
the ruling the <hi>several Colonies,</hi> were they not then
obliged to submit to such <hi>Governours?</hi> Without
breaking in pieces into so many <hi>Families,</hi> every
Master governing his family by himself; which would
certainly ruin and destroy them all; because they
could not have strength and union to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
So it is again in the <hi>case</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
planted them, and settled such <hi>Officers</hi> in them
as were then fit to teach and govern them, still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the main care of <hi>Government</hi> to themselves;
but giving excellent <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Charity, Peace, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
and <hi>Submission</hi> to <hi>Governours;</hi> and as they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
from particular <hi>Churches</hi> (within such a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct,</hi>
as <hi>Crete</hi> was) they appointed some, whom they
thought fit to take care of all those <hi>Churches,</hi> and to
constitute inferiour Officers to teach and rule them;
and therefore in this case, here is no more <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>
in <hi>particular Congregations;</hi> than in the other,
as to <hi>private Families;</hi> which is as contrary to the
general design of the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi>
and their mutual preservation and defence, as in the
former case. In which, we believe the <hi>civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to be from <hi>God,</hi> although no <hi>Monarch</hi> can now
derive his <hi>Title</hi> from such <hi>Princes</hi> at the first disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and would it not then seem unreasonable to
question the <hi>succession</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> from the <hi>Apostles,</hi>
when the matter of fact is attested by the most early,
knowing, honest and impartial <hi>Witnesses?</hi> Lastly,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:95208:198"/>
as in the former case, several of those <hi>lesser Princes</hi>
might unite themselves together by joynt-consent
for their common interest and security, and become
one <hi>Kingdom:</hi> so in the latter case; <hi>several Bishops</hi>
with the <hi>Churches</hi> under them, might for promoting
the common ends of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> and
<hi>establishment</hi> of their <hi>Churches,</hi> joyn together under
the same common bonds and become one <hi>National
Church:</hi> which being intended for the good of the
whole so united, and no ways repugnant to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Institution, and not usurping upon the
<hi>Rights</hi> of others, nor assuming more than can be
managed, as an <hi>universal Pastour</hi> must doe; will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be no ways repugnant to any particular
command or general <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as the
<hi>Pope</hi>'s challenge of <hi>universal Dominion</hi> over the
<hi>Church</hi> is. Which I therefore mention that any one
may see, that the force of this Reasoning will never
justifie the <hi>Papal Vsurpations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But saith Dr.</hi> O. National Provincial Churches must
first be proved of Christ's Institution,<note place="margin">p. 17.</note> before they can
be allowed to have their power given them by Iesus
Christ. <hi>And yet in the case of Congregational Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
he saith</hi> there is no need of any positive Rule or
direction;<note place="margin">p. 42.</note> for the Nature of the thing it self, and the
duty of men with respect to the end of such Churches,
is sufficient for it. <hi>And this is as much as we plead
in behalf of</hi> National Churches, <hi>viz. What the nature
of a</hi> Christian Society, <hi>and the</hi> duty of men with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the end of it <hi>doth require. For, whatever
tends to the</hi> support <hi>of</hi> Religion, <hi>to the</hi> preserving
Peace <hi>and</hi> Vnity <hi>among</hi> Christians, <hi>to the preventing</hi>
dangerous Errours <hi>and</hi> endless confusions, <hi>from the</hi>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:95208:199"/>
very nature <hi>of the</hi> thing, <hi>and the end of a</hi> Christian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<hi>becomes a</hi> Duty. <hi>For the general</hi> Rules <hi>of</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<hi>lay an obligation upon men to use the best
means for advancing the ends of it. It being then
taken for granted among all</hi> Christians, 1. <hi>That</hi>
Christ <hi>is the</hi> Authour <hi>or founder of this</hi> Society <hi>which
we call the</hi> Church; 2. <hi>That he designs the</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
<hi>and</hi> preservation <hi>of it; 3. That the best way
of its</hi> preservation <hi>is by an</hi> Vnion <hi>of the</hi> members <hi>of
it; provided the</hi> Union <hi>be such as doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the ends of it: We may reasonably infer,
that whatever tends to promote this</hi> Vnion, <hi>and to
prevent any notable inconveniencies or mischiefs
which may happen to it, is within the design of the</hi>
first Institution; <hi>although it be not contained in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press

whether <hi>single Congregations</hi> dispersed and disunited
over a <hi>Nation;</hi> or a <hi>combination</hi> of them together
under some <hi>common bonds</hi> as to <hi>Faith, Government</hi>
and <hi>Worship,</hi> be the more likely way to promote <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
to secure the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of a
<hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us then compare these two <hi>Hypotheses</hi> together
in point of <hi>Reason,</hi> as to these ends.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Congregational way,</hi> there may be as many
<hi>Religions</hi> as <hi>Churches.</hi> I do not say there <hi>are,</hi> but
we are arguing now upon what may be, from the
<hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing.</hi> Supposing then every <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
to have an entire and unaccountable Power
within it self; what hinders but of <hi>ten Congregations</hi>
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:95208:199"/>
one may be of <hi>Socinians,</hi> another of <hi>Papists,</hi> another
of <hi>Arians,</hi> another of <hi>Quakers,</hi> another of <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
&amp;c. and it may be no two of them of the same
mind. But if they be, it is meer <hi>chance</hi> and <hi>good hap;</hi>
there being no <hi>obligation</hi> upon them to have any more
than <hi>mutual forbearance</hi> towards each other. Let
now any rational man judge, whether it appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that so loose and shatter'd a <hi>Government</hi> as this
is, should answer the <hi>obligation</hi> among <hi>Christians,</hi>
to use the best and most effectual means to preserve
<hi>the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> and to uphold
<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> among <hi>Christians?</hi> But supposing
all these several <hi>Congregations</hi> united together under
such common bonds, that the <hi>Preacher</hi> is accountable
to <hi>superiours;</hi> that none be admitted but such as own
the <hi>true Faith,</hi> and promise <hi>obedience;</hi> that publick
<hi>legal Censures</hi> take hold upon the <hi>disturbers</hi> of the
<hi>Churches Peace:</hi> here we have a far more effectual
means according to <hi>Reason</hi> for upholding <hi>true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
among us. And that this is no meer <hi>theory,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the sad experience of this <hi>Nation,</hi> when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the breaking the bonds of our <hi>National Church-Government,</hi>
there came such an overpowring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
of <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Schisms</hi> among us, that this
Age is like to smart under the sad effects of it. And
in <hi>New-England,</hi> two or three men, as <hi>Williams, Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and <hi>Clark</hi> discovered the apparent weakness of
the <hi>Independent Government:</hi> which being very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
to this business, I shall give a brief account of it
as to one of them. Mr. <hi>Roger Williams</hi> was the <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi>
of a <hi>Congregational Church</hi> at <hi>Salem,</hi> and a man
in very good esteem as appears by Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Letter
to him:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Williams</hi> his Answer to <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Letter, p. 1.</note> he was a great admirer of the <hi>purity</hi> of the
<hi>New-England Churches;</hi> but being a thinking man,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:95208:200"/>
he pursued the <hi>principles</hi> of that way farther than
they thought fit, for he thought it <hi>unlawfull</hi> to joyn
with <hi>unregenerate men in prayer, or taking an Oath;
and that there ought to be an unlimited toleration of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi>
&amp;c. These Doctrines, and some others of his
not taking, he proceeded to <hi>Separation</hi> from them,
and gathered a <hi>New Church</hi> in opposition to theirs;
this gave such a disturbance to them, that the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi>
sent for him, and the <hi>Ministers</hi> reasoned the
case with him. He told them, <hi>he went upon their own
grounds, and therefore they had no reason to blame him.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> told him <hi>they deserved to be punished who
made Separation among them;</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> replied,
<hi>this would return upon themselves; for had not they
done the same as to the Churches of</hi> Old-England? In
short,<note place="margin">Cottons <hi>Answer to</hi> R<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Williams, p. 57.</note> after their debates, and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Separation</hi> from their <hi>Churches,</hi>
a <hi>sentence</hi> of <hi>banishment</hi> is decreed against him by the
<hi>Magistrates,</hi> and this <hi>sentence</hi> approved and justified
by their <hi>Churches.</hi> For these are Mr. <hi>Cotton's</hi> words,
<hi>That the increase of concourse of People to him on the
Lord's days in private, to a neglect or deserting of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Ordinances, and to the spreading of the leaven of
his corrupt imaginations, provoked the Magistrates, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to breed a Winters spiritual plague in the
Country, to put upon him a Winters journey out of the
Country.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> told them, was falling
into <hi>the National Church way,</hi> which they disowned;
or else, saith he, <hi>why must he that is banished from the
one, be banished from the other also?</hi> And he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
them <hi>that they have suppressed Churches set up after
the Parochial way;</hi>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:95208:200"/>
than what themselves practised.</hi> Which appears by
the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>New England</hi> mentioned before: and
Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> one of the <hi>Teachers</hi> of their <hi>Churches,</hi>
confesseth <hi>that by the Laws of the Country,</hi>

                     <hi>none are
to be free men, but such as are members of Churches.</hi>
I now appeal to any man, whether these <hi>proceedings</hi>
and these <hi>Laws</hi> do not manifestly discover the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
weakness and insufficiency of the <hi>Congregational
way</hi> for preventing those <hi>disorders</hi> which they
apprehend to be <hi>destructive</hi> to their <hi>Churches?</hi> why
had not Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his liberty of <hi>Separation</hi> as well
as they? why are no <hi>Anabaptists</hi> or <hi>Quakers</hi> permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among them? <hi>Because these ways would disturb
their Peace, and distract their People, and in time
overthrow their Churches.</hi> Very well: but where is
the <hi>entireness</hi> of the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>every single Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
the mean while? Why might not the <hi>People</hi> at
<hi>Salem</hi> have the same liberty as those at <hi>Boston</hi> or <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth?</hi>
The plain truth is, they found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
this <hi>Congregational way</hi> would not do alone,
without civil Sanctions, and the interposing of the
<hi>Pastours</hi> of other <hi>Churches.</hi> For when <hi>Williams,</hi>
and <hi>Gorton,</hi> and <hi>Clark</hi> had begun to make some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
on their <hi>People,</hi> they besti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>red themselves
as much as possible to have their mouths stopt, and
their persons banished. This I do onely mention,
to shew, that where this way hath prevailed most,
they have found it very insufficient to carry on those
ends which themselves judged necessary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi>
among themselves. And in their <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Boston,</hi>

For, Christ's care,</hi> say they, <hi>is for whole Churches as
well as for particular persons.</hi> Of which <hi>Consociation</hi>
they tell us, that Mr. <hi>Cotton drew a platform before
his death.</hi> Is such a <hi>Consociation</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> a <hi>Duty</hi>
or not, in such cases? If not, why do they doe any
thing relating to <hi>Church Government,</hi> for which
they have no Command in Scripture? If there be a
<hi>Command</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> then there is an <hi>Institution</hi> of
a <hi>Power</hi> above <hi>Congregational Churches.</hi> It is but a
slender evasion, which they use, when they call
these onely <hi>voluntary Combinations,</hi> for what are all
<hi>Churches</hi> else? Onely, the antecedent obligation
on men to joyn for the Worship of God makes
entring into other <hi>Churches</hi> a <hi>Duty;</hi> and so the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
lying upon <hi>Church-Officers</hi> to use the best
means to prevent or heal divisions, will make such
<hi>Consociations</hi> a Duty too. And therefore in such
cases <hi>the Nature</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> requires an <hi>union</hi> and
<hi>conjunction</hi> superiour to that of <hi>Congregational Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi>
which is then most agreeable to <hi>Scripture</hi> and

<hi>What is it then, that is so denied and disputed against,
and such a flood of words is poured out about? It
seems at last it is this,</hi> that the Nation must be one
Church as united in one Saccrdotal head, personal or
collective, Monarchical or Aristocratical. <hi>Before I
answer this Question, I hope, I may ask another;
whence comes this zeal now against a</hi> National
Church? <hi>For, when the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>were in
power, they were then for</hi> National Churches, <hi>and
thought they proved them out of</hi> Scriptures; <hi>and
none of these</hi> subtilties <hi>about the</hi> Constitutive Regent
part <hi>did ever perplex, or trouble them. Thus the</hi>
Presbyterian London Ministers 1654. <hi>made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of owning</hi> National Churches;<note place="margin">

                     <hi>and particularly
the</hi> Church of England; <hi>in these words.</hi> And if all
the Churches in the world are called one Church; let no
man be offended if all the Congregations in England, be
called the Church of England. <hi>But this you will say,
is by</hi> association <hi>of</hi> equal Churches. <hi>No, they say,</hi> it
is when the particular Congregations of one Nation li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

and Worship, are governed by their greater and lesser
Assemblies, and in this sense, <hi>say they,</hi> we assert a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

                     <hi>Two things saith Mr.</hi> Hudson <hi>are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

                     <hi>and thought they understood what was meant by it.
Whence come all these difficulties now to be raised
about this matter? Is the thing grown so much dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker

ensnared by needless Scruples.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To give therefore a plain answer to the Question,</hi>
what we mean by the National Church of England.
<hi>By that is understood either (1) the</hi> Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
diffusive. <hi>Or (2) The</hi> Church of England repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative.</p>
                  <p>1. The <hi>National Church of England diffusive,</hi> is,
the whole <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> in this Nation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of <hi>Pastours</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> agreeing in that <hi>Faith,
Government</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> which are established by
the <hi>Laws</hi> of this <hi>Realm.</hi> And by this description,
any one may see, how easily the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
is distinguished from the <hi>Papists</hi> on one side, and
the <hi>Dissenters</hi> on the other. Which makes me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
my wonder at those who so confidently say,
<hi>they cannot tell what we mean by the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
For was there not a <hi>Church</hi> here settled upon
the <hi>Reformation</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. and <hi>Queen

in this <hi>Church?</hi> (bating onely the interruption gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

for men to understand so easy, so plain, so intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a thing? If all the Question be, how all the
<hi>Congregations</hi> in <hi>England</hi> make up this <hi>one Church?</hi>
I say, by <hi>unity of consent;</hi> as all <hi>particular Churches</hi>
make <hi>one Catholick Church.</hi> If they ask, <hi>how it comes
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:95208:203"/>
to be one National Church?</hi> I say, because it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the <hi>common consent</hi> of the <hi>whole Nation</hi> in

                  <p>1. <hi>That it proceeds upon a</hi> false supposition:
<hi>which is, that whereever there is the</hi> true Notion <hi>of
a</hi> Church, <hi>there must be a</hi> Constitutive Regent part,
i. e. <hi>there must be a</hi> standing Governing Power, <hi>which
is an</hi> essential part <hi>of it. Which I shall prove to be</hi>
false <hi>from Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>himself. He asserts, that there

Doctrine be true,</hi>

                     <hi>and withall it be necessary</hi> that
every Church must have a Constitutive Regent part as
essential to it, <hi>then it unavoidably follows that there
must be a</hi> Catholick visible Head, <hi>to</hi> a Catholick visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church. <hi>And so Mr.</hi> Baxter'<hi>s</hi> Constitutive Regent
part <hi>of a</hi> Church, <hi>hath done the</hi> Pope <hi>a wonderfull
kindness, and made a very plausible</hi> Plea <hi>for his</hi>
Vniversal Pastourship. <hi>But there are some men in
the world, who do not attend to the advantages
they give to</hi> Popery; <hi>so they may vent their spleen
against the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England. <hi>But doth not
Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>say,</hi> that the universal Church is headed
by <hi>Christ</hi> himself? <hi>I grant he doth; but this doth
not remove the difficulty; for the</hi> Question <hi>is about</hi>
that visible Church <hi>whereof</hi> particular Churches are
parts; <hi>and they being</hi> visible parts <hi>do require a</hi> visible
Constitutive Regent part as essential <hi>to them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
the whole visible Church <hi>must have likewise</hi> a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Constitutive Regent part, <hi>i. e.</hi> a visible Head <hi>of
the</hi> Church; <hi>as if a</hi> Troop <hi>hath an inferiour</hi> Officer,
<hi>an</hi> Army <hi>must have a</hi> General; <hi>if a</hi> City <hi>hath a</hi> Mayor,
<hi>a</hi> Kingdom <hi>must have a</hi> King, <hi>that is</hi> equally present
<hi>and</hi> visible <hi>as the other is. This is indeed to make a</hi>
Key <hi>for</hi> Catholicks, <hi>by the help of which they may
enter and take possession.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The</hi> plain resolution <hi>is, that we deny any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of any such</hi> Constitutive Regent part, <hi>or</hi> one
formal Ecclesiastical Head <hi>as</hi> essential to a National
Church. <hi>For a</hi> National Consent <hi>is as sufficient to
make a</hi> National Church; <hi>as an</hi> Vniversal Consent <hi>to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:95208:204"/>
make a</hi> Catholick Church. <hi>But if the Question be, by
what way this</hi> National Consent <hi>is to be declared?
then we answer farther; that by the</hi> Constitution <hi>of
this</hi> Church, <hi>the</hi> Archbishops, Bishops, <hi>and</hi> Presbyters
<hi>being summoned by the</hi> King's Writ <hi>are to</hi> advise

is (3.) concerning <hi>the common ties or Rules
which make this National Church.</hi> For Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would
know,<note place="margin">Anws. p 34.</note> 
                     <hi>whether by the common Rules I mean a Divine
Rule or a meer humane Rule. If it be a Divine Rule,
they are of the National Church as well as we; if it be
a humane Rule, how comes consent in this to make a
National Church? how come they not to be of it for not
consenting? how can such a consent appear, when there
are differences among our selves?</hi> This is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of what he objects. To which I answer
(1.) Our <hi>Church</hi> is founded upon a <hi>Divine Rule,
viz.</hi> the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> which we own as the <hi>Basis</hi>
and <hi>Foundation</hi> of our <hi>Faith;</hi> and according to
which, all other <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> are to
be agreeable. (2.) Our <hi>Church</hi> requires a <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
to those <hi>Rules</hi> which are appointed by it, as
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:95208:204"/>
                     <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And so the <hi>Churches</hi>
of <hi>New-England</hi> doe, to the <hi>orders</hi> of <hi>Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
among themselves by all that are members
of their <hi>Churches;</hi> and annex <hi>civil Privileges</hi> to
them; and their <hi>Magistrates</hi> impose <hi>civil Punishments</hi>
on the breakers and disturbers of them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they profess agreement in other things, yet
because they do not submit to the <hi>Orders</hi> of their
<hi>Churches,</hi> they do not own them as <hi>members</hi> of their
<hi>Churches.</hi> Why should it then be thought unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
with us, not to account those <hi>members</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who contemn and disobey the
<hi>Orders</hi> of it? (3.) There is no difference among
our selves concerning the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of the <hi>Orders</hi> of
our <hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>submission</hi> to them. If
there be any other differences, they are not <hi>material,</hi>
as to this business: and I believe are no other than
in the <hi>manner of explaining</hi> some things, which may
happen in the best <hi>Society</hi> in the world, without
breaking the <hi>Peace</hi> of it. As about the <hi>difference</hi> of
<hi>Orders;</hi> the sense of some <hi>passages</hi> in the <hi>Athanasian
Creed;</hi> the <hi>true explication</hi> of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two Articles;</hi>
which are the things he mentions.<note place="margin">p. 39.</note> A multitude of

which are objected by my more weighty Adversaries,
the weaker assaults of the rest in what they differ
from these, will admit of a quicker dispatch. Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
objects,<note place="margin">Mischief of Impos. p. 27.</note> (1.) <hi>That if National Churches have Power

I grant it, if he proves that no <hi>Congregational Church</hi>
hath any more <hi>Power</hi> over it, than a <hi>National Church</hi>

the <hi>Pope's Vsurpations.</hi> When he doth prove
that,<note place="margin">ibid.</note> he may have a farther answer. (2.) <hi>That Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

them;</hi> this I utterly deny, and there wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

But did I not immediately before say, that
<hi>National Churches are National Societies of Christians,

to be <hi>true Churches,</hi> I used such a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription

not proper to a <hi>National Church.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 30.</note> (4.) <hi>He gives this
reason why consent should not make National Churches
as well as Congregational; because it must be such an
agreement as the Gospel warrants; and that is onely
for Worship, and not to destroy their own being.</hi> This
is the reasoning of a horse in a mill; still round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the same thing. And therefore the same answer
may serve.<note place="margin">p. 31.</note> (5.) Out come Mr. <hi>B.'s</hi> Objections,

of their heavy and rusty Armour; and makes them

they could not stand the field in the former habit,
they can much less doe it in this.</p>

                     <hi>The Authour of the Letter saith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Letter out of the country, p. 24.</note> I onely prove a
National Church a possible thing. <hi>He clearly mistakes
my design; which was to shew that if there be such
a thing as a</hi> National Church, <hi>then no</hi> single Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
<hi>have such a power in themselves to separate
from others in matters of</hi> order <hi>and</hi> decency <hi>where
there is a</hi> consent <hi>in the</hi> same Faith. <hi>To prove that
there was such a thing, I shewed that if the</hi> true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>of a</hi> Church <hi>doth agree to it, then upon the same
reason that we own</hi> particular Churches, <hi>and the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, <hi>we are to own a</hi> National Church;
<hi>so that the design of that discourse was not barely

and reality <hi>of it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>But, saith he,</hi> Can it be proved
that Christ hath invested the Guides of this Church,
not chosen by the People, with a Power to make Laws
and Decrees, prescribing not onely things necessary for
common order and decency, but new federal rites, and
teaching signs and symbols, superadded to the whole
Christian Institution? <hi>&amp;c. I answer, that such a</hi>
Church <hi>hath</hi> Power <hi>to appoint</hi> Rules <hi>of</hi> Order <hi>and</hi>
Decency <hi>not repugnant to the</hi> word <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>which
on that account others are bound to submit to; and
to take such care of its</hi> preservation, <hi>as to admit none
to its</hi> privileges <hi>but such as do submit to them; and
if any disturb the</hi> Peace <hi>of this</hi> Church, <hi>the</hi> Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
<hi>may justly inflict</hi> civil Penalties <hi>upon them
for it. All which is no more than any settled</hi> Church
<hi>in the world asserts, as well as ours. And I wonder
this should be so continually objected against our</hi>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:95208:206"/>
Church, <hi>which all</hi> Societies <hi>in the world think just
and necessary for their own</hi> preservation. As to the
Guides of the Church not being chosen by the People,
<hi>I shall speak to that afterwards. One objection
more he makes, which the others did not,</hi> viz. <hi>I had
said</hi> that by whole or National Churches, I understood
the Churches of such Nations which upon decay of the
Roman Empire resumed their just right of Governing
themselves, and upon their owning Christianity incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
into one Christian Society, under the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ties and Rules of Order and Government. Such
Churches, I say, have a just right of Reforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and therefore are not liable to the imputation of
Schism from the Roman Church. <hi>Would one think,
what unlucky Inferences he draws from hence?</hi>
(1.) Then all that remain within the Empire,<note place="margin">p. 26.</note> were
bound to continue in the Communion of the Roman
Church. <hi>What, if I should deny the continuance
of the</hi> Roman Empire? <hi>then all would be safe. But
do I any where say,</hi> that being in the Empire, <hi>they
were bound to</hi> submit <hi>to the</hi> Roman Church? <hi>No;
but as the</hi> Nation <hi>resumed its</hi> just civil Rights, <hi>the</hi>
Church <hi>might as rightfully recover it self from</hi> Papal
Vsurpations; <hi>not laying the force of one upon the
other, but paralleling them together: and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the argument is on the</hi> Churches <hi>side.
(2.)</hi> Then where Princes have not resumed their just
rights as to Reformation, they are Schismaticks that
separate from Rome.<note place="margin">Part 2.</note> 
                     <hi>That doth not follow: for in
the cases before mentioned</hi> separation <hi>is</hi> lawfull; <hi>but
no</hi> Reformation <hi>is so unexceptionable, as when there

Separatist from more than one Parish Priest; and
therefore my charge of them is schismatical and unjust,
and recoileth on my self; who instead of God's Rule,
accuse them that walk not by our novel crooked Rules,
which may make as many modish Religions as there are
Princes.</hi> When I first read such passages as these, I

then? <hi>They would never have separated, if they had

                     <hi>That every particular Church upon a due ballance of
all circumstances, has an inherent right to choose its
own Pastour, and every particular Christian the same
Power to chuse his own Church.</hi> Nay then, I thought,
we were in a very fair way of settlement; when the
<hi>Anabaptists</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> never broached a <hi>looser prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
than this; nor more contrary to the very possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:95208:207"/>
of having an <hi>established Church:</hi> for it leads to
all manner of <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Factions</hi> in spight of all
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> The <hi>Authour</hi>
of the <hi>Letter</hi> goes upon the same principle too,<note place="margin">Letter out of the Country, p. 25.</note> and
saith, <hi>The Guides of the Church are to be chosen by the
People, according to Scripture and Primitive practice.</hi>
This I perceive is a <hi>popular argument,</hi> and a fine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to draw in the <hi>common People</hi> to the <hi>dissenting
Party;</hi> whatever becomes of <hi>Laws,</hi> and mens
<hi>just</hi> and <hi>legal Rights of Patronage,</hi> all must yield to
the <hi>antecedent Right of the People.</hi> But to bring this
matter to a strict debate, we must consider these three
things. 1. What <hi>Original,</hi> or <hi>inherent Right</hi> and
<hi>Power</hi> the <hi>People</hi> had. 2. How they came to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested</hi>
of it. 3. Whether there be sufficient <hi>ground</hi>
to <hi>resume</hi> it. And from thence we shall understand,
whether some of the <hi>People</hi>'s consenting to hear the
<hi>Nonconformists preach,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>Laws,</hi>
can excuse them from <hi>Separation?</hi> for this lies at the
bottom of all.</p>
                  <p>1. As to the <hi>Original, inherent Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of
the <hi>People.</hi> Dr. <hi>O.</hi> supposeth all <hi>Church-Power to be
originally in the People;</hi> for to manifest how favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>wise men have been to the Congregational way,</hi>
he quotes a saying of <hi>F. Paul;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vindicat. p. 37.</note> out of a <hi>Book</hi> of his,
lately translated into <hi>English, that in the beginning,
the Government of the Church had altogether a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical
Form;</hi> which is an opinion so absurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
that I could not easily believe such a saying
to have come from so <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>judicious</hi> a <hi>Person.</hi>
For was there not a <hi>Church</hi> to be formed <hi>in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</hi>
Did not <hi>Christ</hi> appoint <hi>Apostles</hi> and give them
<hi>Commission</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> for that end? Where was
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:95208:208"/>
the <hi>Church power</hi> then lodged? Was it not in the
<hi>Apostles?</hi> Did not they in all places, as they planted
<hi>Churches,</hi> appoint <hi>Officers</hi> to teach and govern them?
And did they not give them <hi>Authority</hi> to doe what
they had appointed? Were not then the several <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours</hi>
and <hi>Teachers</hi> invested with a <hi>Power superiour</hi>
to that of the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> upon them?
And if they had such <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> over the
<hi>People,</hi> how came their <hi>Power</hi> to be derived from
them, as it must be, if the <hi>Church Government</hi> then
were <hi>Democratical?</hi> Besides, Is it reasonable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the <hi>People</hi> should <hi>assemble</hi> to choose their <hi>Officers,</hi>
and convey the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Keys</hi> to them; which
never <hi>were</hi> in their hands? And how could they
make choice of men for their <hi>fitness</hi> and <hi>abilities,</hi>
when their <hi>abilities</hi> depended so much on the <hi>Apostles
laying on of their hands?</hi> For <hi>then the Holy Ghost
was given unto them.</hi> But in all the <hi>Churches</hi> planted
by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> in all the directions given about the
choice of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> no more is required,
as to the <hi>People,</hi> than barely their <hi>Testimony;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is said <hi>they must be blameless,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 2, 7, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>and men of good
report.</hi> But, where is it said or intimated that the
<hi>Congregation</hi> being the <hi>first subject of the Power of the
Keys,</hi> must meet together, and choose their <hi>Pastour,</hi>
and then convey the <hi>Ministerial Power</hi> over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to them? If it were true <hi>that the Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
at first was Democratical,</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> have
done the People a mighty injury; for they have
said no more of their <hi>Power</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> than they
have done of the <hi>Pope's.</hi> It is true the <hi>Brethren</hi>
were present at the <hi>nomination</hi> of a <hi>new Apostle:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. l. 14.</note> but
were not the <hi>Women</hi> so too? And is the <hi>Power</hi> of
the <hi>Keys</hi> in their hands too? Suppose not, doth this
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:95208:208"/>
prove that the <hi>Churches Power</hi> was then <hi>Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal?</hi>
then the <hi>People</hi> made an <hi>Apostle</hi> and gave him
his <hi>Power;</hi> which I do not think any man would
say, much less <hi>F. Paul.</hi> As <hi>to the election of Deacons;</hi>
it was no properly <hi>Church Power</hi> which they had;
but they were <hi>Stewards</hi> of the <hi>common Stock;</hi> and
was there not then, all the reason in the world, the
<hi>Community</hi> should be satisfied in the choice of the
men?<note place="margin">Act. 6. 3, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>When Saint</hi> Peter <hi>received</hi> Cornelius <hi>to the
Faith, he gave an account of it to all the Church.</hi>
And what then? Must he therefore derive his <hi>power</hi>
from it? Do not <hi>Princes</hi> and Governours give an
account of their proceedings for the satisfaction of
their <hi>Subjects</hi> minds? But here is not <hi>all the Church</hi>
mentioned;<note place="margin">Act. 11. 3.</note> onely <hi>those of the Circumcision at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
had a mind to understand the <hi>reason</hi> of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
a <hi>Gentile Convert.</hi> And what is this to the
<hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Church? But in the Council of</hi> Jerusalem
<hi>the People did intervene, and the Letters were written in
the names of all the three Orders, Apostles, Priests and
faithfull Brethren.</hi> I grant it; but is it not expresly
said, that the <hi>Question</hi> was sent up from the <hi>Churches,
to the Apostles and Presbyters?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 15. 2.</note> Is it not said, <hi>that
the Apostles and Presbyters met to debate it;</hi> and that
<hi>the multitude was silent?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">6. 12.</note> Is it not said, <hi>that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
were passed by the Apostles and Presbyters,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any mention of the <hi>People?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">16. 4.</note> And here was the
proper occasion to have declared their <hi>Power;</hi> but in
the other place, it signifies no more than their <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
consent</hi> to the <hi>Decrees</hi> that were then made. <hi>In
success of time,</hi> it is added, <hi>when the Church increased
in number, the faithfull retiring themselves to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of their Families,</hi> and having <hi>left those of the
Congregation, the Government was retained onely in the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:95208:209"/>
Ministers, and so became Aristocratical, saving the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which was Popular.</hi> Which account is neither
agreeable to <hi>Reason,</hi> nor to <hi>Antiquity.</hi> For, was
not the Government of the Church <hi>Aristocratical</hi> in
the <hi>Apostles</hi> times? How came it to be changed,
from that to a <hi>Democratical Form?</hi> Did not the
Apostles appoint <hi>Rulers</hi> in the several Churches, and
charged the <hi>People</hi> to <hi>obey them?</hi> And was this an
argument the <hi>Power</hi> was then in the <hi>People?</hi> It was
not then <hi>the People's withdrawing</hi> (of which there
can be no evidence, if there be so much evidence
still left for the <hi>People's Power,</hi> in <hi>Antiquity)</hi> but the
<hi>Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> was <hi>Aristocratical</hi> by the
appointment of the <hi>Apostles.</hi>

<hi>Popular Elections,</hi> as to which there is so fair a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
from <hi>Antiquity;</hi> but yet not such, as to fix
any <hi>inherent,</hi> or <hi>unalterable Right</hi> in the <hi>People.</hi>
As I shall make appear, by these following observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>1. That the main ground of the <hi>People's Interest</hi>
was founded upon the <hi>Apostles</hi> Canon,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 2, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>That a Bishop
must be blameless</hi> and of <hi>good report.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That the <hi>People</hi> upon this <hi>assuming</hi> the <hi>Power</hi>
of <hi>Elections,</hi> caused great <hi>disturbances</hi> and <hi>disorders</hi>
in the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That to prevent these, many <hi>Bishops</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
without their <hi>choice,</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> made for
the better regulating of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:95208:209"/>
4. That when there were Christian <hi>Magistrates,</hi>
they did interpose as they thought fit, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the popular claim; in a matter of so great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. That upon the alteration of the <hi>Government</hi> of
<hi>Christendom</hi> the <hi>Interest</hi> of the People was secured
by their consent in <hi>Parlaments,</hi> and that by such
consent the <hi>Nomination</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> was reserved to
<hi>Princes,</hi> and the <hi>Patronage</hi> of <hi>Livings</hi> to <hi>particular
Persons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. That things being thus settled by established
<hi>Laws,</hi> there is no reasonable <hi>Ground</hi> for the <hi>Peoples</hi>
resuming the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>electing</hi> their own <hi>Bishops</hi> and
<hi>Ministers</hi> in opposition to these <hi>Laws.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I can make good these <hi>Observations,</hi> I shall
give a full answer to all the <hi>Questions</hi> propounded,
concerning the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> which
my Adversaries build so much upon.</p>
                  <p>(1.) <hi>That the main ground of the Peoples interest
was founded upon the Apostles Canon, that a Bishop
must be blameless, and of good report.</hi> For so the
<hi>Greek Scholiast</hi> argues from that place in <hi>Timothy,
If a Bishop ought to have a good report of them that are
without,</hi>

                     <hi>men of good reputation

                        <hi>Clement.</hi> Epist. p. 54, 55, 56, 57.</note> where
he gives an account, how <hi>the Apostles preaching
through Cities and Countries, did appoint their First-fruits,
having made a spiritual trial of them, to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Deacons of those who were to believe.</hi> Here
it is plain, that they were of the <hi>Apostles appointment,</hi>
and not of the <hi>Peoples choice;</hi> and that their <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
could not be from them, whom they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>first to convert</hi> and then <hi>to govern;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their number was but small at first, yet as
they increased, though into many <hi>Congregations,</hi> they
were still to be under the <hi>Government</hi> of those, whom
the <hi>Apostles</hi> appointed over them. And then he shews
<hi>how those who had received this Power from God came
to appoint others:</hi> and he brings the <hi>Instance</hi> of <hi>Moses,
when there was an emulation among the Tribes, what
method he took for putting an end to it, by the blossom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Aarons Rod;</hi> which, saith he, <hi>Moses did on
purpose to prevent confusion in Israel, and thereby to
bring Glory to God;</hi> now, saith he, <hi>the Apostles fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
the contentions that would be about the name of
Episcopacy</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>i. e.</hi> about
the choice of men into that <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Ruling</hi> the
<hi>Church;</hi> which the sense shews to be his meaning:
<hi>therefore, foreseeing these things perfectly, they appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the persons before mentioned, and left the distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Offices, with this instruction, that as some
died, other approved men should be chosen into their
Office. Those therefore who were appointed by them, or
other eminent Men, the whole Church being therewith
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:95208:210"/>
well-pleased, discharging their Office with humility,
quietness, readiness, and unblameableness, being men
of a long time of good report, we think such men cannot
justly be cast out of their Office.</hi> It seems, some of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> were at that time <hi>factious</hi> against
some <hi>Officers</hi> in their <hi>Church,</hi> and endeavoured to
throw them out for the sake of one or two more,
and made such a disturbance thereby as had brought
a <hi>great scandal,</hi> not onely on themselves, but the
<hi>Christian Church;</hi> which made <hi>Clemens</hi> write this
<hi>Epistle</hi> to them; wherein he adviseth those busie men
<hi>rather to leave the Church themselves, than to continue
making such a disturbance in it; and if they were good
Christians they would do so; and bring more glory to
God by it, than by all their heat and contentions.</hi>
Now by this discourse of <hi>Clemens</hi> it is plain,
(1.) That these <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> were not <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen</hi>
by the <hi>People,</hi> but appointed by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>great Men,</hi> according to their Order? (2.) That
they took this course on purpose to prevent the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi>
that might happen in the <hi>Church,</hi> about those

their <hi>approbation</hi> of those, who were so appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For he could not allow their <hi>power of choosing,</hi>
since he saith, <hi>the Apostles appointed Officers on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

one great reason of the <hi>faction</hi> among them; <hi>viz.</hi>
that those few <hi>Popular</hi> men in that <hi>Church,</hi> who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all the disturbance, represented this, as a great
grievance to them; that their <hi>Pastours</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi>
were <hi>appointed</hi> by others, and not <hi>chosen</hi> by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
For they had no <hi>objection</hi> against the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters

themselves,</hi> being allowed to be men of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable

                     </gap>
them, leaving to the <hi>People</hi> their <hi>Testimony</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
those whom they ordained. And this is plain,
even from Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> where he discourseth of this
matter,<note place="margin">Answ. p. 27.</note> in that very <hi>Epistle</hi> concerning <hi>Basilides</hi> and
<hi>Martialis,</hi> to which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> refers me. For, the
force of what Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith comes at last onely
to this <hi>giving Testimony;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cypr. <hi>Epist.</hi> 68.</note> 
                     <hi>therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the Priest to be appointed before all the People,
thereby shewing that Ordinations in the Christian Church
ought to be, sub Populi Assistentis Conscientiâ, in the
Presence of the People:</hi> for what reason? that they
might give them <hi>Power?</hi> no; that was never done
under the <hi>Law;</hi> nor then imagined, when S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
wrote; but he gives the account of it himself; <hi>that
by their presence, either their faults might be published,
or their good acts commended; that so it may appear to
be a just and lawfull Ordination, which hath been exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the suffrage and judgment of all.</hi> The
<hi>People</hi> here had a share in the <hi>Election,</hi> but it was
in matter of <hi>Testimony</hi> concerning the good or ill
behaviour of the Person. And <hi>therefore,</hi> he saith,
<hi>it was almost a general Custom among them, and he
thinks came down from Divine Tradition and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Practice, that when any People wanted a Bishop,
the neighbour Bishops met together in that place, and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:95208:211"/>
the new Bishop was chosen, plebe praesente, the People
being present,</hi> (not by the <hi>Votes</hi> of the <hi>People) quae
singulorum vitam plenissimè novit, which best under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
every mans Conversation:</hi> and <hi>this,</hi> he saith,
<hi>was observed in the Consecration of their Fellow-bishop</hi>
Sabinus, <hi>who was put into the place of</hi> Basilides. Where
he doth express the <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>Bishops;</hi> which being
thus performed, he incourages the People to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from <hi>Basilides</hi> and to adhere to <hi>Sabinus.</hi> For,
<hi>Basilides</hi> having fallen foully into <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>blasphemy</hi> with it, had of his <hi>own accord</hi> laid
down his <hi>Bishoprick,</hi> and desired onely to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to <hi>Lay-Communion,</hi> upon this <hi>Sabinus</hi> was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
Bishop</hi> in his room; after which <hi>Basilides</hi>
goes to <hi>Rome</hi> and there engages the <hi>Bishop</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in his behalf, that he might be restored; <hi>Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
finding this, makes his <hi>application</hi> to Saint <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
and the <hi>African Bishops,</hi> who write this <hi>Epistle</hi> to
the <hi>People</hi> to withdraw from <hi>Basilides,</hi> saying <hi>that it
belonged chiefly to them to choose the good and to refuse
the bad.</hi> Which is the strongest Testimony in <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
for the <hi>Peoples Power;</hi> and yet here we are to
consider (1.) It was in a case where a <hi>Bishop</hi> had
<hi>voluntarily resigned.</hi> (2.) Another <hi>Bishop</hi> was put
into his room, not by the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> but
by the <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> of the <hi>neighbour Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi>
(3.) They had the judgment of a whole <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
of <hi>African Bishops</hi> for their deserting him. (4.) For
a notorious matter of fact, <hi>viz. Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy</hi>
by his <hi>own confession.</hi> (5.) All the proof which Saint
<hi>Cyprian</hi> brings for this, doth amount to no more, than
that the <hi>People</hi> were most concerned to give <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
as to the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad lives</hi> of their <hi>Bishops.</hi>

This further appears by the words in <hi>Lampridius</hi>
concerning <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> who proposed the
<hi>names</hi> of his <hi>civil Officers</hi> to the <hi>People, to hear what
they had to object against them, and said it was a hard
case, when the Christians and Iews did so about their
Priests, the same should not be done about Governours
of Provinces, who had mens lives and fortunes in their
hands.</hi> But no man could ever from hence imagin,
that the <hi>People</hi> had the <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>make</hi> or <hi>unmake the

is swallowed up therein: since their <hi>Acts</hi> do oblige
the whole Nation. For not onely the <hi>Statute</hi> of
1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. declares, <hi>The Right of appointing Bishops
to be in the King;</hi> but 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. it is likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<hi>That the Right of disposing Bishopricks was in
the King by Right of Patronage, derived from his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours
before the freedom of elections was granted.</hi>
Which shews not onely the <hi>great Antiquity</hi> of this
<hi>Right,</hi> but the <hi>consent</hi> of the <hi>whole Nation</hi> to it.
And the same is fully related in the <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.
to <hi>Clement</hi> 5. where it is said,<note place="margin">Walsingh. <hi>in</hi> Edw. 3. <hi>p.</hi> 161.</note> 
                     <hi>That the King did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of them,</hi> jure suo Regio, <hi>by his Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
as his Ancestours had done from the first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a Christian Church here.</hi> This is likewise ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the famous <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Carlisle 25 Edw.</hi> 1. so
that there is no <hi>Kingdom</hi> where this <hi>Right</hi> hath been
more fully acknowledged by the <hi>general consent of
the People,</hi> than here in <hi>England;</hi> and that from the
<hi>Original planting</hi> of a <hi>Christian Church</hi> here. As to
the inferiour <hi>Right of Patronage;</hi> it is justly thought
to bear equal date with the <hi>first settlements</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
in peace and quietness. For when it began
to spread into <hi>remoter Villages</hi> and places distant from
the <hi>Cathedral Churches,</hi> where the <hi>Bishop</hi> resided with
his <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as in a <hi>College</hi> together; a necessity was
soon apprehended of having <hi>Presbyters fixed</hi> among
them. For the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Neocaesarea</hi> mentions the

was held ten years before the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> In
the time of the <hi>first Council</hi> of <hi>Orange, A. D.</hi> 441.
express mention is made of the <hi>Right of Patronage</hi>
reserved to the <hi>first Founders</hi> of <hi>Churches, c. 10. viz.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:95208:216"/>
If a Bishop built a Church on his own Land in another
Bishop's Diocese, yet the right of presenting the Clerk
was reserved to him.</hi> And this was confirmed by the
<hi>second Council</hi> of <hi>Arles, c. 36. A. D.</hi> 452. By the

it obtained by <hi>general consent</hi> that the <hi>Patron</hi> might

conclude, that,</p>
                  <p>6. Things being thus settled by <hi>general consent and

<hi>resume</hi> the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>Elections:</hi> (1.) because it was

of <hi>Livings,</hi> but may be remedied by <hi>Laws;</hi> far ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,
than those which will follow upon the <hi>Peoples
taking this Power to themselves,</hi> which cannot be done
in a <hi>divided Nation,</hi> without throwing all into <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediless

                     <hi>for when the objection is put
by him,</hi> That the People chose the Parlament who make
the Laws which give the Patrons Power, and therefore
they now consent; <hi>he saith,</hi> this seemeth a Iest; for,
<hi>he saith,</hi> 1. It cannot be proved that all the Churches
or People gave the Patrons that Power. 2. They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
consented that Parlaments should do what they
list, and dispose of their Souls, or what is necessary to
the saving of their Souls. 3. They may as well say,
that they consent to be baptized and to receive the
Sacraments because the Parlament consented to it.
4. Their forefathers had no power to represent them
by such consenting. 5. The obligation on the People
was Personal, and they have not God's consent for the
transmutation.</p>
                  <p>So that one would think by Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Doctrine, all
<hi>Laws</hi> about <hi>Patronage</hi> are void in themselves; and
all <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Advowson</hi> in the <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Noblemen</hi> and

things utterly unlawfull among <hi>Christians,</hi> since he
makes such a <hi>personal obligation to choose their own
Pastours</hi> to lie on the <hi>People,</hi> that they cannot
transfer it by their own <hi>Act.</hi> But upon second
thoughts I suppose he will not deny, that the <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
of <hi>Publick Churches</hi> and the <hi>endowments</hi> of them,
do lie within the <hi>Magistrates Power,</hi> and so binding
Laws may be made about them; unless he can prove
that the <hi>Magistrates Power</hi> doth not extend to those
things which the <hi>Magistrate gives.</hi> And if these may
be justly settled by <hi>Laws,</hi> then the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi>
are as <hi>just</hi> and <hi>legal Rights</hi> as men have to their
Estates; and consequently every Minister duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:95208:218"/>
hath a <hi>legal</hi> Title to <hi>the Temple and Tithes,</hi>
as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls them. <hi>But this doth not,</hi> saith he,
<hi>make a Minister for their Souls, and the Parlament
cannot dispose of their Souls.</hi> The meaning of all
which is, if the People be humorsome and factious,
they may run after whom they please, and set up
what <hi>Minister</hi> they please, in opposition to Laws.
And so for instance, suppose a Parish be divided in
their Opinions about Religion, (as we know too
many are at this day) all these several parties, <hi>viz.
Anabaptists, Quakers,</hi> yea and <hi>Papists</hi> too, as well as
others, will put in for an equal share in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<hi>the care of their Souls,</hi> and consequently, may
choose a several Pastour to themselves, and leave the
<hi>Incumbent</hi> the bare possession of <hi>the Temple and
Tithes.</hi> But if there be no other objection, this may
be thought sufficient, <hi>that he was none of their choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi>
being imposed upon them by others, who could
not <hi>dispose of their Souls.</hi> By which means, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>taking care for their Souls,</hi> will be made use
of, to justifie the greatest disorder and confusion,
which can happen in a Church. For, let the Person
be never so worthy in himself, the <hi>People</hi> are still
to have their <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>choosing</hi> for themselves. And
who are these <hi>People?</hi> Must all have equal Votes?
then according to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s opinion of our <hi>Churches,</hi>
the worst will be soonest chosen; for why should
we not think the <hi>worst People will choose their like</hi>
as well as the <hi>worst Patrons,</hi> and the <hi>worst Bishops?</hi>
But if the <hi>Profane</hi> must be excluded, <hi>by what Law?</hi>
Is it because they have <hi>no right to the Ordinances?</hi>
But have they <hi>no right to their own Souls and to the
care of them?</hi> therefore they are equally concerned
with others. Yet let us suppose all these excluded, as
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:95208:218"/>
                     <hi>no competent Iudges;</hi> shall all the rest be excluded
too, who are <hi>incompetent Iudges?</hi> then I am afraid,
there will not be many left. And whatever they
pretend, the <hi>People</hi> wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they do choose, do trust
other mens Judgments, as well as where the <hi>Patrons
present;</hi> and to prevent popular tumults, such elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are generally brought by a kind of <hi>devolution</hi>
to a few Persons who are entrusted to choose for
the rest. But if all the People were left <hi>to choose
their own Pastours,</hi> it is not to be imagined, what
parties and factions, what mutual hatreds, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
animosities, they would naturally fall into on
such occasions. Do we not daily see such things to be
the fruits of popular elections, where men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for the strength and reputation of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
What envying and strife, what evil speaking
and backbiting, what tumults and disorders, what
unchristian behaviour in general, of men to each
other, do commonly accompany such <hi>elections?</hi>
Which being the natural effects of mens passions
stirred up by such occasions, and there being so much
experience of it in all Ages of the Christian Church,
where such things have been; I am as certain, that
<hi>Christ</hi> never gave <hi>the People such an unalterable Right
of choosing their own Ministers,</hi> as I am, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to have the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
And of all Persons, I do the most wonder
at him, who pretends to discover <hi>the Onely way of
unity and concord among Christians,</hi> that he should so
much, so frequently, so earnestly insist upon this;
which if it be not <hi>the onely,</hi> is one of the most <hi>effectual
ways</hi> to perpetuate <hi>disorder</hi> and <hi>confusion</hi> in a broken
and divided Church. And so much for the <hi>Plea</hi> for
<hi>Separation,</hi> taken from the <hi>Peoples Rights to choose their
own Ministers.</hi>

total Communion of Parochial Churches are imposed
on the Consciences and Practices of men, which are not
according to the mind of <hi>Christ. These are very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
words; but Dr.</hi> O. <hi>reckons up the particulars,
which (setting aside those already considered) are,</hi>
the use of the Aëreal sign of the Cross,<note place="margin">Vindic. of Non-conf. p. 13.</note> kneeling at the
Communion, the Religious observation of Holy-days;
and the constant use of the Liturgy in all the publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Church. <hi>As to this last, I shall say nothing,
it being lately so very well defended by a</hi> learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>of our</hi> Church.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Falkner's</hi> Vindication of Liturgies, 1680.</note> 
                     <hi>To the other, Mr.</hi> B. <hi>adds,</hi> the
use of Godfathers and Godmothers; <hi>and now I am to
examine what weight there is in these things, to make
men seriously think</hi> Communion <hi>with our</hi> Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
                  <p>When I found our <hi>Church</hi> thus charged with <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
unlawfull terms of Communion,</hi> I expected a
particular and distinct proof of such a charge, because
the main weight of the <hi>Cause</hi> depended upon it.
And this is the method we use in dealing with the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> We do not run upon general char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of <hi>unscriptural Impositions,</hi> and <hi>things imposed on
mens Consciences against the mind of</hi> Christ; but we
close with them upon the particulars of the charge,
as <hi>Worship of Images, Invocation of Saints, Adoration
of the Host,</hi> and we offer to prove by plain <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
                     <pb n="333" facs="tcp:95208:219"/>
that these are <hi>forbidden</hi> and therefore <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
But I find no such method taken or pursued by
our <hi>Brethren;</hi> onely we are told over and over,
that <hi>they judge, they think, they esteem them unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
and they cannot be satisfied about them;</hi> but for
particular arguments to prove them <hi>unlawfull</hi> I find
none; which makes the whole charge look very sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piciously.
For men do not use to remain in <hi>generals,</hi>
when they have any assurance of the <hi>Goodness</hi> of
their <hi>Cause.</hi> Yet, to let the Reader see that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
nothing that looks like argument in this matter,
I shall pick up every thing I can find, which seems
to prove these <hi>terms</hi> of our <hi>Communion</hi> to be <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
or to justify their <hi>Separation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Epistle</hi> before my <hi>Sermon</hi> I had used this
Argument against the <hi>present Separation,</hi> 
                     <q>that if it
be lawfull to separate on a pretence of <hi>greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
where there is an <hi>agreement</hi> in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
the <hi>substantial parts of Worship,</hi> as is acknowledged
in our Case; then a bare difference of opinion, as
to some <hi>circumstantials of Worship</hi> and the <hi>best Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
of <hi>Churches</hi> will be sufficient ground to
break <hi>Communion</hi> and to set up <hi>new Churches;</hi>
which, considering the great variety of mens fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
about these matters, is to make an infinite Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibility
in Churches, without any possible stop
to further Separation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Argument others were willing to pass over,
but Mr. <hi>A.</hi> in his <hi>Preface,</hi> undertakes to answer it in
all the parts of it; which being so material to our
business, I shall now distinctly consider: and like
an able Disputant he allows nothing at all in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:95208:220"/>
for he denies the <hi>Supposition,</hi> viz. <hi>that there
is any such agreement in Doctrine and the substantial
parts of Worship;</hi> he denies <hi>the first consequence;</hi> and
as though that were not sufficient, he denies the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter
consequence</hi> too. And what Argument can
stand before a man of such prowesse in disputing?</p>
                  <p>1. He denies <hi>an Agreement in Doctrine,</hi> which I
have already shewed was allowed by <hi>all Dissenters</hi>
before him, from the days of <hi>R. Brown</hi> to Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
But we must not mistake him, for as fierce as he
seems to be at first, yet let him but have scope to
shew some tricks of Wit, and trials of his skill in
fencing; and he is as tame and yielding as you
would wish him; for at last he confesses <hi>they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
agree with the Doctrine contained in the 39 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles;</hi>
and but for meer shame, he would have said
<hi>all;</hi> for I never heard of one before him made any
scruple of it. And this is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> established
in this <hi>Church;</hi> and if there be an <hi>Agreement in this,</hi>
then this <hi>Supposition</hi> is granted.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>As to</hi> substantial parts of Worship; <hi>he denies an</hi>
Agreement in this too:<note place="margin">Vindication, p. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>although Dr.</hi> O. <hi>saith,</hi> we are
agreed in the substantial parts of Religion; <hi>and I
hope the</hi> parts <hi>of</hi> Worship <hi>are allowed to be some
of them. But he pretends</hi> not to know what we mean
by the difference between the parts of Worship, making
some substantial, and others circumstantial; <hi>and then
he offers to prove</hi> that our Church appoints new sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
parts of Worship, <hi>and therefore he must know
one from the other; and after he hath spent some
leaves in the proof of that, at last he fairly concludes,</hi>
that there is a difference at least in a circumstantial part
of Worship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:95208:220"/>
But because this is a weighty charge against our
<hi>Church,</hi> I shall take the more pains to consider it,
because the main objection against our <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
lies under it, and that which most sticks with the
more sober <hi>Nonconformists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> A.<hi>'s charge about</hi> a substantial part of Worship
<hi>being appointed by our</hi> Church, <hi>is thus drawn up.</hi>
An outward visible sign of an inward invisible grace,
whereby a person is dedicated to the profession of, and
subjection to the Redeemer, is a substantial part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
<hi>Now this he chargeth our</hi> Church <hi>with, but
gives no instance; but the</hi> sign <hi>of the</hi> Cross <hi>after</hi>
baptism,<note place="margin">Answ. p. 49.</note> 
                     <hi>is that which he means: which Mr.</hi> B. <hi>calls</hi>
the transient dedicating Image of the Cross. <hi>For the
clearing of this, it will be necessary to shew,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>What we mean by</hi> a substantial part of Worship.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>How it appears that the</hi> sign of the Cross <hi>is made
no</hi> substantial part of Worship <hi>by our</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>1. What we mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>y a <hi>substantial part of divine
Worship.</hi> For I have observed, that the want of a
clear and distinct notion of this, hath been one of
the greatest occasions of the <hi>Scruples</hi> of the most
conscientious <hi>Non-conformists.</hi> For being afraid of
displeasing God, by using any other <hi>parts of Worship,</hi>
than himself hath appointed; and looking on our
Ceremonies, as <hi>real parts of divine Worship,</hi> upon
this reason they have thought themselves obliged in
conscience, at least to forbear the use of them. The
great principle they went upon was this, <hi>that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was any ways intended or designed for the Worship
of God, was a real and substantial part of his Worship;</hi>
and when their Adversaries told them that <hi>Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:95208:221"/>
was necessary to make <hi>a part of Worship;</hi>
their answer was, that <hi>Divine Institution</hi> did not
make that a <hi>part of Worship</hi> which was <hi>none,</hi> but that
to be <hi>a part of true Worship,</hi> which otherwise would
be <hi>a part of false Worship.</hi> In the mean time, they
did not deny the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of the <hi>application</hi> of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
circumstances</hi> to <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> as
<hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> &amp;c. but the annexing any other
<hi>Rites,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies</hi> to proper <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
(as the <hi>sign of the Cross</hi> to <hi>Baptism)</hi> they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be the making <hi>new substantial parts</hi> of <hi>Divine
Worship;</hi> and therefore forbidden by all those places
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which imply the <hi>Scripture it self</hi> to be a
perfect <hi>Rule of Worship.</hi> This as far as I can gather
is the strongest <hi>Plea</hi> of the <hi>Non-conformists side,</hi> which
I have represented with its full advantage, because
my design is, if possible, not so much to confute, as
to convince our <hi>Dissenting Brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us then seriously consider this matter, and if
we can find out a plain discernible difference between
<hi>substantial parts of Divine Worship</hi> and mere <hi>acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
appendices,</hi> this discovery may tend more to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangle
scrupulous minds, than the multiplying of
arguments to <hi>prove</hi> the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of our <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
And that we may better understand where the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
lies, these following things are agreed on both
sides.</p>
                  <p>1. That besides <hi>proper Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> there are
some <hi>Circumstances</hi> which may be differently used,
without setting up <hi>new parts</hi> of <hi>Worship.</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>Adoration</hi> is a <hi>substantial</hi> and <hi>proper Act</hi> of
<hi>Divine Worship;</hi> but whether that <hi>Adoration</hi> be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:95208:221"/>
by <hi>prostration,</hi> or by <hi>bowing,</hi> or by <hi>kneeling,</hi>
is in it self <hi>indifferent;</hi> and no man will say, that he
that makes his <hi>adoration kneeling</hi> makes another <hi>new
part</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> from what he doth who performs it
<hi>standing</hi> or <hi>falling on his face.</hi> And so, if the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Eastern Church</hi> did at certain times forbid <hi>knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
in <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Adoration;</hi> this doth not prove that
they differ'd in point of <hi>Adoration</hi> from the <hi>Western
Church</hi> which requires <hi>kneeling</hi> in the same <hi>Offices</hi>
of <hi>Divine Worship;</hi> because they agreed in the <hi>act</hi>
of <hi>Adoration,</hi> but onely differ'd in the manner of
expressing it.</p>
                  <p>2. That <hi>Divine Institution</hi> makes those to be <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
parts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> which of themselves are not
so. As is plain in the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
which of themselves are no <hi>necessary substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
parts of the worship of God;</hi> but onely become
so, by being appointed by <hi>Christ.</hi> So under the
Law, many things meerly <hi>ritual</hi> and <hi>ceremonial</hi> in
themselves, yet by vertue of <hi>Divine appointment</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>substantial parts</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That for men to make <hi>new Parts</hi> of <hi>Divine
Worship</hi> is <hi>unlawfull.</hi> For that is to suppose the
<hi>Scripture</hi> an <hi>imperfect Rule</hi> of <hi>Worship;</hi> and that <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition</hi>
is no fault; and consequently that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
without cause, found fault with the <hi>Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Pharisees</hi> for their <hi>Traditions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. That there are many things which may be done
in the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> which are not forbidden to
be done unless they be <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship.</hi>
For, if the supposed reason of their <hi>prohibition,</hi> be
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:95208:222"/>
their being made <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> if it be
made appear, that they are not so, then it follows
they are not forbidden.</p>
                  <p>5. That what is neither <hi>forbidden directly,</hi> nor by
<hi>consequence</hi> is <hi>lawfull</hi> and may be practised in the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
of <hi>God.</hi> For although Mr. <hi>A.</hi> quarrels with me,
for saying, they require <hi>express Commands</hi> to make
things <hi>lawfull</hi> in the <hi>Worship of God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mischief of Impos. p. 29.</note> yet he allows,
that what is not required either <hi>directly</hi> or by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence</hi>
is unlawfull; and by parity of Reason,
what is not forbidden in the same manner must
be lawfull.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="27" type="section">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 27. It remains now to find out those certain
<hi>notes</hi> and <hi>marks</hi> of <hi>distinction</hi> in this matter, as may
give satisfaction to the consciences of men, in the
difference between <hi>innocent Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
parts</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship.</hi> For the difference
here doth not lie in supposing some things of <hi>Divine
Institution</hi> which are not, but in making those to
be <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship</hi> which are not. And that
may be done these ways.</p>
                  <p>1. By supposing them to be so <hi>necessary,</hi> that the
<hi>doing</hi> them would be a thing <hi>pleasing</hi> to God, and
the <hi>omitting</hi> of them would be a thing <hi>displeasing</hi> to
God, although there were no <hi>humane Law</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the doing of them. For, where there is no
obligation by vertue of any humane Law and yet
men suppose they should <hi>please God</hi> by doing, or
<hi>displease God</hi> by not observing some particular <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;</hi>
it is a sign they esteem those to be <hi>parts</hi> of
<hi>Divine Worship.</hi> And this was the case of the <hi>Scribes</hi>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:95208:222"/>
and <hi>Pharisees</hi> whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> reproved, not so
much for their <hi>frequent washings,</hi> as for supposing
that a mans <hi>Conscience</hi> was <hi>defiled,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 15. 11. 19, 20.</note> if he did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them. For they had taken up an opinion
among them, (as <hi>H. Grotius</hi> observes) that any thing
that was touched by a Person unclean by the Law,
did communicate an uncleanness first to their Bodies,
and then to their Souls; but that this ceremonial
washing did purifie both Body and Soul: upon
which supposition, they concluded this <hi>washing</hi> so
necessary a <hi>part</hi> of <hi>God's Worship,</hi> that the doing of
it was a thing very pleasing to God, and the omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it must be displeasing to him, because it left
an inward defilement upon their Consciences, which
might have been removed by the use of it. But it
is lately pleaded by Mr. <hi>A. that this washing of hands
among the Iews condemned by our Saviour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exercit. on Matt. 15. 1, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>was just
of the nature of our Ceremonies, being onely observed
as a command of their Superiours not repugnant to the

                     <hi>but rather more agreeable to it than our
Ceremonies are:</hi> from whence he infers, <hi>that all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>

invalid and not obligatory.</hi> But I say, the Reason
of our Saviour's opposing the <hi>Pharisees</hi> about this
matter, was not because a thing in it self unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
was determined by their <hi>Superiours,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the <hi>superstitious opinion</hi> which the <hi>Pharisees</hi>
had concerning this <hi>washing</hi> with respect to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi>
of men. And that I shall prove 1. From the
force of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s reasoning. 2. From the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
sense of the <hi>Iews</hi> concerning it.</p>

                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:95208:223"/>
1. From the force of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s reasoning:
which will appear, by observing what He proves,
<hi>viz.</hi> that they set up their <hi>Tradition above the Law.</hi>
v. 3. <hi>Why do you also transgress the Commandment of
God by your Tradition?</hi> and v. 6. <hi>Thus ye have made the
Commandment of God of none effect by your Tradition.</hi>
v. 9. <hi>Full well ye reject the Commandment of God,
that ye may keep your own Tradition.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi>
here proves by a plain and undeniable Instance about
the <hi>Vow Corban,</hi> that they did believe their <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
to have a force <hi>superiour</hi> to the <hi>Law;</hi> else it were
impossible they should suppose such an <hi>arbitrary Vow</hi>
should supersede the obligation of the <hi>Law,</hi> as to the
duty which <hi>Children</hi> owe to their Parents; but from
hence it appeared that they believed the keeping of
this <hi>Vow</hi> to be a thing more pleasing to <hi>God,</hi> than
relieving their Parents, and so they esteemed it a
<hi>more necessary</hi> and <hi>substantial part</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship.</hi>
The force of his Argument then extends to all things
which they looked on as things pleasing to God, on
the account of the <hi>Tradition</hi> of their <hi>Elders;</hi> for he
argued against the main supposition, the truth of
which he proves by a clear instance, where the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
did contradict the <hi>Law.</hi> And since by this,
it appeared, that they thought their <hi>Tradition</hi> to
over-rule the <hi>Law,</hi> it was no wonder they set up
others equal to it; and thought mens consciences
strictly obliged to observe them. <hi>But how doth the
argument reach to the present case,</hi> viz. <hi>Because that
when their Traditions contradicted the Law, they were
not to be observed; therefore, not, when agreeable;
unless he rejected all kind of Traditions?</hi> I answer,
the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did think a man's <hi>Conscience</hi> defiled if
he did not observe that <hi>Tradition,</hi> as appears by what
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:95208:223"/>
follows, when he taught the People upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
v. 11. <hi>That which entreth into the mouth defileth
not a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth
defileth a man.</hi> This was the <hi>Doctrine Christ</hi> taught
the <hi>People</hi> with respect to this dispute with the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees:</hi>
which signified nothing, unless the opinion
among them was, that eating of bread with unwashen
hands, did really defile a man's <hi>Conscience</hi> towards
<hi>God.</hi> At which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were much offended,
as the <hi>Disciples</hi> told him, <hi>v.</hi> 12. and they were not
so very well satisfied, but they desire a further expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this matter from himself; which he gives
them, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18, 19. where he shews that no <hi>defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
could come to mens <hi>Consciences</hi> meerly <hi>by what
they did eat;</hi> but that mens <hi>inward lusts</hi> were the
things which <hi>defiled them,</hi> for these were the source
of those <hi>wicked actions,</hi> which were most displeasing
to God. And so he concludes his Discourse, v. 20.
<hi>These are the things which defile a man, but to
eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</hi> From
whence it follows, that the main thing in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
was, whether this <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>washing hands</hi>
could be omitted, without <hi>defiling the conscience?</hi>
or else our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s conclusion doth not reach the
Question. But if the <hi>conclusion</hi> was contrary to the
<hi>Pharisees Doctrine,</hi> then they must look upon this
<hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>washing of hands,</hi> as <hi>a part</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi>
equal to the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and which men pleased
<hi>God</hi> by doing, and displeased him by omitting it;
not meerly with respect to the <hi>command</hi> of <hi>Superiours,</hi>
but as they supposed some lesser guilt upon the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
might be <hi>expiated</hi> by it, which would remain,
if they did not use it.</p>

2. From the <hi>general sense</hi> of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Even
Mr. <hi>A.</hi> himself, in the very same discourse, where he
would make <hi>this washing of hands like our Ceremonies,</hi>
quotes several passages of the <hi>Talmudists,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 17.</note> to prove
<hi>that they equalled their Traditions with the Laws of
God; and sometimes set them above them;</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of this <hi>Tradition</hi> he saith, <hi>It is a saying of
the Talmud, that he that eats bread with unwashen
hands, sins as grievously as if he lay with a Whore.</hi>
Which is a saying of <hi>R. Ase</hi> in <hi>Sota;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> 6.</note> and abundantly
proves, that this was not looked on as an <hi>indifferent
Ceremony,</hi> but as a thing, whose omission brought a
guilt on the Conscience. And I wonder Mr. <hi>A.</hi> did
not discern, that by this one saying, he overthrew
all the rest of his discourse: but this opinion is not
built on the saying of any <hi>Rabbi,</hi> but on a constant
<hi>Tradition</hi> among them, which they derive from the
<hi>days</hi> of <hi>Solomon; who,</hi> they say, <hi>appointed it first,
when they did eat of Sacrifices;</hi> afterwards, <hi>the wise
men applied it to the Terumah,</hi> and at last <hi>Hillel</hi>
and <hi>Schammai decreed it ought to be observed for
their greater purification, before the eating their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Meals.</hi> And the <hi>Pharisees</hi> placing the greatest
part of their <hi>Religion</hi> in the nice observance of such
<hi>Traditions,</hi> thought themselves so much more holy
than others, as they did more carefully avoid the
defilements of common Conversation; and for that
reason they observed <hi>this washing</hi> especially when
they had been in promiscuous company.<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k 7. 4.</note> For they
thought themselves <hi>defiled</hi> by any <hi>touch from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
sort of People;</hi> and this, <hi>Maimonides</hi> saith,
<hi>They looked on, as a peculiar part of Sanctity;</hi> and
the more strict and punctual they were in this, the
more holy they were accounted. Therefore in the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:95208:224"/>
                     <hi>Talmud</hi> one <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Gudged</hi> is particularly
admired for his <hi>Sanctity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chagiga</hi> c. 2. § ult.</note> 
                     <hi>because he exceeded others in
the niceness of washing his hands.</hi> And they have a
saying in the <hi>Misna</hi> to this purpose, <hi>The Garments of
the common People, are a pollution to the Pharisees,
the Garments of the Pharisees to those that eat the
Terumah, and theirs to those that eat of the Sacrifices,
and theirs to those that touched the water of cleansing.</hi>
So that they had different <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Sanctity</hi> about
this <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>washing,</hi> none of which was imposed
for the sake of <hi>cleanliness,</hi> but from the <hi>supposition</hi> of
some <hi>inward purification</hi> they obtained by it, from
the <hi>common filthiness</hi> of the world. And upon this
principle, even the <hi>vessels</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> were to be
<hi>washed</hi> all over, <hi>if they were but touched by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People.</hi> In the <hi>washing their hands,</hi> they put a
difference between that before, and that after meat;
the latter they accounted a matter of liberty, or at
least onely <hi>for health</hi> to wash off the dangerous <hi>saline
particles</hi> which they supposed to remain; but the
former was required for <hi>inward purification;</hi> which
they require so strictly, <hi>that if water may be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
four miles, a Iew is bound not to eat till he hath
washed, no not with a fork; and in case none can be
had, then he is to cover his hands and so eat; nor can
he take meat from another in his mouth, untill his mouth
be first washed. If there be no more water than will
serve for his drink, he must part with enough of it to
wash his hands;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Erub</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> f. 21.</note> and therefore <hi>R. Akiba</hi> in prison said,
<hi>He would rather perish with thirst than want water to
wash his hands.</hi> And they say, <hi>Whosoever disesteems
this Custom, deserves not onely excommunication but
death too.</hi> Since all this is evident from the most
<hi>authentick Writers</hi> among the <hi>Iews,</hi> I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:95208:225"/>
at Mr. <hi>A.</hi>'s design, who would make the world
believe, that this was no more than an <hi>indifferent
Ceremony</hi> among the <hi>Iews,</hi> that was onely required
for <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency,</hi> as <hi>our Ceremonies</hi> are, when
those very <hi>citations</hi> he brings from <hi>Buxtorf</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> do manifestly prove the contrary.
This I thought necessary to be cleared, because this
is the chief place in the <hi>New Testament</hi> which they
bring to prove the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of <hi>our Ceremonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence it now appears that the reason of
<hi>Christ</hi>'s condemning that <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>washing of hands,</hi>
was not upon the account of <hi>Decency,</hi> but a <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Opinion</hi> they had concerning it, that it did
<hi>expiate</hi> a lesser kind of <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>spiritual filthiness</hi>
which they contracted by the <hi>impure touches</hi> of men
less holy than themselves. And this the <hi>Pharisees</hi>
more wondred at in <hi>Christ's Disciples,</hi> because it was
a <hi>Rule</hi> among them, <hi>that the Disciples of the Wise
ought to be more strict in these cases than others,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these things tended to advance the <hi>reputation</hi>
of their <hi>holiness,</hi> among the <hi>People.</hi> And where such
an opinion prevails, there such <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are made
<hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship.</hi>

they be used in the performance of them. As

made this <hi>badge</hi> a <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship?</hi> But when
they see the <hi>Papists</hi> on that day using the most solemn

And thus I have at once shewed, what we mean by</hi>
substantial parts <hi>of</hi> Divine Worship, <hi>and that our</hi>
Church <hi>doth not make any human</hi> Ceremonies <hi>to
be so.</hi>

Sect. 29. <hi>I now come particularly to examin the
charge against our</hi> Church. <hi>For Mr.</hi> A. <hi>saith,</hi> An out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
visible sign of an inward invisible grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a person is dedicated to the profession of and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the Redeemer, is a substantial part of Worship.
<hi>I answer,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. An <hi>outward visible sign</hi> between men represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>duty</hi> or <hi>engagement</hi> of another, is <hi>no part</hi> of
<hi>Divine Worship</hi> at all, much less a <hi>substantial part</hi> of it.
There are some <hi>visible signs</hi> from <hi>God to men,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>Grace</hi> to us; and those we
call <hi>Sacraments;</hi> there are other <hi>signs from men to
God,</hi> to testifie their <hi>subjection</hi> and <hi>dependence,</hi> and
these are <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Worship;</hi> and there are <hi>signs from
men to men</hi> to represent some other thing besides the
bare action; and these are <hi>significant Ceremonies,</hi> such
as the <hi>Cross</hi> in <hi>Baptism</hi> is. For, after the <hi>Child is
baptized</hi> and received into the <hi>Church,</hi> the sign of the
<hi>Cross</hi> is used <hi>in token that hereafter he shall not be
ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified,</hi> &amp;c.
To whom is this token made? Is it to <hi>God?</hi> no
certainly. If it were a permanent sign of the <hi>Cross,</hi>
would it be for a <hi>Testimony</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>to Men?</hi>
When the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> used the <hi>sign of the
Cross</hi> in token they were not ashamed of <hi>Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi>
was this a <hi>dedicating sign to God,</hi> or a <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
sign to men?</hi> And what if it represents <hi>subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Christ</hi> as the <hi>Redeemer?</hi> must it therefore be
such an <hi>outward visible sign</hi> of <hi>inward invisible Grace,</hi>
as the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are? It represents the <hi>Duty</hi> and not
the <hi>Grace;</hi> the <hi>Duty</hi> is <hi>ours</hi> and may be represented
by us; but the <hi>Grace</hi> is <hi>Gods</hi> and therefore he must
appoint the <hi>signs</hi> to <hi>represent</hi> and convey that, because
he alone is the <hi>Giver</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:95208:227"/>
2. The <hi>Cross</hi> in <hi>Baptism</hi> is not intended by our
<hi>Church</hi> for a <hi>sign</hi> of <hi>immediate dedication</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> but of
<hi>obligation</hi> on the person. It is true, that in the 30 <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
it is said, <hi>that this Church retains the sign of the
Cross, following the example of the Primitive and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Churches; and accounteth it a lawfull outward
Ceremony and honourable badge, whereby the Infant is
dedicated to the service of him who died upon the Cross.</hi>
But for the right understanding thereof, we must
consider, That <hi>Baptism</hi> is declared to be <hi>compleat</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
so that the <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> adds nothing to
the <hi>perfection</hi> or <hi>vertue</hi> of it, nor being omitted,
takes nothing from it; as it is there expressed as the
<hi>sense</hi> of this <hi>Church.</hi> This therefore, is no part of
the <hi>Baptismal Dedication.</hi> And the <hi>Minister</hi> acts in
a <hi>double capacity,</hi> when he doth <hi>baptize,</hi> and when
he <hi>signs</hi> with the <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross:</hi> when <hi>he bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth,</hi>
he acts by vertue of <hi>Authority</hi> derived <hi>from
Christ, I baptize thee in the Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c.
Which being done, and the <hi>Child</hi> thereby solemnly
<hi>dedicated to God in Baptism;</hi> he then speaks in the
<hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> varying the number; <hi>We receive
this Child into the Congregation of</hi> Christ<hi>'s Flock, and
do sign him with the sign of the Cross,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e. We
Christians</hi> that are already <hi>members</hi> of <hi>Christ's Flock
do receive him into our number;</hi> and in token of his
being <hi>obliged</hi> to perform the <hi>duty</hi> belonging to such
a one, do make use of this <hi>sign of the Cross,</hi> as the
<hi>Rite of Admission</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> and of his <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to behave himself, as becomes a <hi>Christian.</hi> And
if we consider the <hi>sign of the Cross</hi> in this sense, as no
doubt it was so intended,<note place="margin">Plea for Peace, p. 178, 179.</note> all the difficulties about a
<hi>Dedicating, Covenanting, Symbolical, Sacramental
Sign,</hi> concerning which some have made so great a

may not the <hi>Church</hi> appoint such a <hi>Rite</hi> of <hi>Admission</hi>
of one of her <hi>Members</hi> declaring it to be <hi>no part</hi> of
<hi>Baptism?</hi> Let us suppose an adult person to be <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi>
and immediately after <hi>Baptism</hi> to be admitted
a <hi>Member</hi> of an <hi>Independent Church;</hi> and the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
of this <hi>admission</hi> to be <hi>holding up of his hand</hi> in
token of his owning the <hi>Church-Covenant,</hi> i. e. of
promising to live as a <hi>Church-member</hi> ought to doe
among them; the <hi>Pastour</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> then bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizes
him, and immediately after, upon <hi>the holding
up of his hand in token of his owning the Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
he saith in the name of the Church, <hi>we receive
thee into this Congregation, and accept of thy holding
up of thy hand as a token that thou wilt hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
thy self as a Church-member ought to do among us.</hi>
What harm is there in all this? And yet is not this a
<hi>Professing, Dedicating, Covenanting, Symbolical, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
Sign,</hi> as much as the <hi>Sign of the Cross</hi> is
among us? Doth not <hi>holding up the hand</hi> signify
and represent? Is it not therefore a <hi>significant</hi> and
<hi>symbolical Ceremony?</hi> Doth it not import an <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
lying on the person? Is it not therefore <hi>dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
covenanting, and sacramental,</hi> as much as the
<hi>sign of the Cross?</hi> Why then should this be scrupled
more than the other?</p>
                  <p>And by this Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s great mistake appears about
this matter;<note place="margin">plea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

its <hi>sacramental Efficacy</hi> is a <hi>Rite</hi> of <hi>Admission</hi> into
<hi>Christ's Catholick Church;</hi> so the <hi>sign of the Cross</hi> is

                     <hi>yet not as a dedicating sign, and as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
professing symbol of baptized Persons.</hi> If it be
<hi>lawfull</hi> in the former sense, I cannot understand how
it should be <hi>unlawfull</hi> in the latter. <hi>Yes,</hi> saith he,
<hi>the instituting of the latter belongs to God onely.</hi>
How doth that appear? <hi>Because he hath made two
Sacraments already for that end.</hi> True, but not
onely for that end; but to be the <hi>means</hi> and <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of <hi>conveying his Grace</hi> to men; which none
but <hi>God</hi> himself can doe, and therefore none but he
ought to appoint the <hi>means</hi> for that end. And we
account it an unsufferable insolency in the <hi>Roman
Churches,</hi> for them to take upon them to make <hi>appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Merits of</hi> Christ <hi>to Rites of their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;</hi>
which is the onely possible way for a
<hi>Church</hi> to make <hi>new Sacraments;</hi> but if every <hi>signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
custom</hi> in a <hi>Church</hi> must pass for a <hi>new Sacrament,</hi>
then <hi>sitting</hi> at the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is a <hi>new Sacrament,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are told <hi>it betokens rest and Communion with</hi>
Christ; then putting off the <hi>Hat</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> is a <hi>new
Sacrament,</hi> because it is a <hi>professing sign of Reverence;</hi>
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:95208:229"/>
then laying <hi>on the hand, and kissing the Book in swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
are <hi>new Sacraments,</hi> because they are <hi>publick
symbolical Rites.</hi> But saith Mr. <hi>B. it belongeth onely
to the King to make the common badge or symbol of his
own Subjects.</hi> Yet I hope, every Nobleman or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
may give a <hi>distinct Livery</hi> without <hi>Treason.</hi>
And therefore why may not every <hi>Church</hi> appoint its
own <hi>Rite</hi> of <hi>admission</hi> of <hi>Members</hi> into its <hi>Body?
But the obligation here is to the common duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
And is not every <hi>Church-member</hi> bound to
perform these? That which is peculiar, is the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of <hi>admission</hi> by the <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross;</hi> and this
<hi>Rite</hi> our <hi>Church</hi> imposes on no others but its own
<hi>Members, i. e.</hi> makes it necessary to none else; and
to shew it to be onely a solemn <hi>Rite</hi> of <hi>Admission,</hi>
it allows it to be forborn in <hi>private Baptism.</hi> But
saith Mr. <hi>B. Christs Sacraments or Symbols are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
we need not devise more, and accuse his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of insufficiency.</hi> If it be lawfull, the <hi>Church</hi> is
to judge of the <hi>expediency;</hi> and not every private
person. And to appoint other <hi>Rites</hi> that do not
encroach upon the <hi>Institutions</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> by challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
any <hi>effect</hi> peculiar to them, is no charging them
with insufficiency. Well, saith Mr. <hi>B. but it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
on another account,</hi> viz. <hi>as it is an Image used
as a medium in God's Worship, and so forbidden in the
Second Commandment.</hi> He may as well make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
to use <hi>Words</hi> in <hi>God's Worship,</hi> for are not
they <hi>Images</hi> and represent things to our <hi>minds,</hi> as
well as a <hi>transient sign of the Cross?</hi> Nay, doth not
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in the same place make it <hi>lawfull to make an
Image an Object or Medium of our consideration exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our minds to Worship God? as he instanceth in a
Crucifix, or historical Image of Christ, or some holy man.</hi>
                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:95208:229"/>
If any <hi>Divine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had said any
thing to this purpose, what out-cries of <hi>Popery</hi> had
been made against us? How many <hi>Advances</hi> had we
presently made for letting in the <hi>grossest Idolatry?</hi>
How many <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had been
quoted, to shew, that they went no further and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
no more than this? Yet the <hi>transient sign of the
Cross,</hi> without any respect to <hi>Worship,</hi> is condemned
among us, <hi>as forbidden by the Second Commandment;</hi>
and that by the <hi>same person</hi> and in the <hi>same page.
But it is used as a medium in God's Worship.</hi> Is our
<hi>Worship</hi> directed to it? or, do we <hi>kneel</hi> before it, as
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> allows men may do before a <hi>Crucifix?</hi> Do
we declare that we are <hi>excited</hi> by it to worship God?
No; all these are rejected by our Church. How
then <hi>is it a medium in God's Worship?</hi> Why forsooth,
<hi>it is not a meer circumstance but an outward act of
Worship.</hi> What, as much as <hi>kneeling before a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix?</hi>
and yet that is lawfull according to him, <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the mind be onely excited by it.</hi> Suppose then
we onely use <hi>the sign of the Cross</hi> to <hi>excite</hi> mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
in the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>Worship;</hi> what harm were in
it upon Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s ground? But our <hi>Church</hi> allows not
so much, onely taking it for a <hi>lawfull outward Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
which hath nothing of <hi>Worship</hi> belonging to
it; how comes it then to be a <hi>medium in God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?</hi>
For Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith, in the same place, <hi>there is a
twofold medium in God's Worship.</hi> 1. Medium ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citans,
<hi>that raises our minds to Worship God, as a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix,
&amp;c.</hi> 2. Medium terminans; or as he calls it <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,
in genere causae finalis,</hi> a worshipped <hi>medium or
the terminus, or the thing which we worship mediately,
on pretence of representing God, and that we worship him
in it ultimately. And this he takes to be the thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:95208:230"/>
directly in the second Commandment,</hi> viz. <hi>to
worship a Creature (with mind or body) in the Act of
Divine Worship, as representing God, or as the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
term of our Worship, by which we send it unto God,
as if it were more acceptable to him. So that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
saith he, <hi>by the sight of a Crucifix to be provoked
to worship God, but it's unlawfull to offer him that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
by offering it to the Crucifix first, as the sign, way,
or means of sending it to God.</hi> Observe here a strange
piece of partiality. 1. It is allowed to be <hi>lawfull to
pray before a Crucifix,</hi> as a <hi>medium excitans,</hi> as <hi>an
object that stirs up in us a worshipping affection;</hi> and
so all those <hi>Papists</hi> are excused from <hi>Idolatry</hi> who
profess they use a <hi>Crucifix</hi> for <hi>no other end,</hi> although
they perform all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>adoration</hi> before it; and it
will become a very hard Question whether the mind
in its consideration, uniting the <hi>Image</hi> with the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
may not give the same <hi>Acts of Worship</hi> to one as
to the other, but in different respects. For the <hi>Image</hi>
being allowed to <hi>excite the mind to consideration of
the object to be worshipped,</hi> the <hi>object</hi> is <hi>considered</hi> in
the <hi>mind</hi> as <hi>represented by the Image,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is so worshipped; and why then may not <hi>the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
be as well directed to the <hi>Image as representing,</hi>
as to the <hi>Object represented by the Image;</hi> provided,
that the <hi>Act</hi> of the mind be still fixed upon the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
as <hi>represented</hi> by the <hi>Image?</hi> And thus even <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi>
may be performed to a <hi>Crucifix.</hi> Is not this a
very fair concession to the <hi>Papists?</hi> But on the other
side, 2. The <hi>sign of the Cross,</hi> even the <hi>aëreal sign,</hi>
as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> calls it, must be made a <hi>medium</hi> in <hi>God's
Worship,</hi> though it be utterly denied by our <hi>Church;</hi>
and there be no colour for it, from his own grounds.
For it is neither <hi>medium excitans,</hi> being not intended
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:95208:230"/>
by our <hi>Church</hi> for that purpose, a <hi>Crucifix</hi> being much
fitter for that purpose; and our <hi>Church</hi> calls it onely
<hi>a lawfull ceremony and honourable badge;</hi> much less
can it be thought to be any <hi>mediate object</hi> of <hi>our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
there being nothing like <hi>Worship</hi> performed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it. But if all his meaning be, that whatever
is used in the time of <hi>Worship</hi> that is not a <hi>meer
circumstance</hi> must be a <hi>medium</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> that
is so weak a pretence, that I shall consider it no
farther.</p>

                     <hi>yet it cannot out of Mr.</hi> B.<hi>'s Head, but that

it with such</hi> promises, <hi>as he hath his
other</hi> Sacraments, <hi>no doubt it had been one;
but then the use of it had been quite changed,
from what it is now. For then its</hi> signification
<hi>had been from</hi> God to us; <hi>and the</hi> Minister <hi>had</hi>
signed in Christ's Name <hi>and not in the</hi> Churches;
<hi>and then it had been</hi> in token that Christ will

                  <p>
                     <hi>There is one thing yet remaining in Mr.</hi> B. <hi>about
this matter to be considered,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Defence of the Plea, p. 49.</note> viz. That according to
the Rule of our Church, the Cross in Baptism hath a
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:95208:231"/>
Sacramental efficacy attributed to it; <hi>for, saith he,</hi>
As the Water of Baptism worketh morally, by signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the washing of Christ's Body; so the Cross is
to operate morally, by signifying Christ's Crucifixion,
the benefits of his Cross and our Duty. <hi>And then
he adds,</hi> That it is the common Doctrine of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
that the Sacraments are not instituted to give
Grace physically, but onely morally; and that even
the wisest Papists themselves do maintain onely such
moral Causality in Sacraments. <hi>And so by this
means he would make</hi> the sign of the Cross <hi>to
have the</hi> nature <hi>of a</hi> Sacrament <hi>with us. But
that he hath misrepresented or misapplied both
the</hi> Popish <hi>and</hi> Protestant Doctrine <hi>about the</hi> effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
<hi>of</hi> Sacraments <hi>to serve his purpose, I shall now
make appear,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Concerning the <hi>Popish Doctrine;</hi> that which
overthrows the strength of all that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith
is, that it is unanimously agreed among them as
a <hi>matter of faith, that the Sacraments do confer
grace,</hi> ex opere operato, <hi>where there is no actual
impediment; and that it is no less than heresie to
assert, that they are bare outward professing signs,
i. e.</hi>

of them, whom I ever saw, either denies, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes;
and it is expresly determin'd in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
of <hi>Florence</hi> and of <hi>Trent.</hi> But then they have

whether <hi>physically</hi> or <hi>morally.</hi> By <hi>physically,</hi> they
mean, <hi>when a thing by its own immediate action
hath influence on producing the effect;</hi> by <hi>morally,</hi>
they mean <hi>that which doth effectually concurr to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:95208:231"/>
the producing the effect, but after another manner,
as by perswasion, by intreaty,</hi> &amp;c. As he that <hi>runs</hi>
the <hi>sword</hi> into <hi>anothers bowels,</hi> kills him <hi>physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally;</hi>
he that <hi>perswades and incourages him</hi> effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to doe it, is as <hi>really</hi> the <hi>cause</hi> of his <hi>death</hi>
as the other; but then they say, he is but a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
and not a <hi>physical cause</hi> of the <hi>murther.</hi> They
all agree, that the <hi>Sacraments</hi> do <hi>effectually</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
<hi>Grace,</hi> where there is <hi>no obstacle put;</hi> but
the onely question is, about the <hi>manner</hi> of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
it. And as to this they agree, that the
<hi>Sacraments</hi> do work as <hi>moral Causes,</hi> not <hi>principal</hi>
but <hi>instrumental;</hi> the <hi>principal</hi> they say is <hi>the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Instrumental</hi> the <hi>Sacraments</hi> as
deriving their <hi>efficacy</hi> from the former; as the
<hi>Writing</hi> from the <hi>Seal,</hi> and the <hi>Seal</hi> from the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
of the <hi>Person;</hi> or as <hi>Money</hi> from the <hi>Stamp,</hi>
and the <hi>Stamp</hi> from the <hi>King:</hi> but besides this,
they question whether there be not a <hi>proper effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
by Divine Power in the Sacraments,</hi> to produce
at least the <hi>character</hi> from whence <hi>Divine Grace</hi>
immediately follows. And about this indeed they
are divided. Some say, there is <hi>no necessity</hi> of
asserting more than a bare <hi>moral Causality;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this is sufficient <hi>for the infallible efficacy of
the Sacraments,</hi>

in <hi>applying</hi> the <hi>moral Causality</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi>

that in very ambiguous terms; for, he saith, <hi>That
Protestants commonly maintain that the Sacraments
are not instituted to give Grace physically, but onely
morally.</hi> If it be their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
are instituted for the <hi>conveying of Grace</hi> at
all, which he seems to yield; (and if he did not,
might be fully proved from the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:95208:232"/>
most eminent <hi>Reformers</hi> abroad, as well as at home)
This is sufficient to shew that the <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi>
can never be advanced to the <hi>dignity</hi> of a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

pretences as these have served to darken People's

                     <note place="margin">Mischief of Imposit. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note> for allowing <hi>worshipping towards the Altar,
the East, and at the sound of the word Iesus; which,</hi>
he saith, <hi>are made the Motive of Worship, if not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else.</hi> The lawfulness of these things, so far,
as they are required by our <hi>Church,</hi> I had formerly
defended against the <hi>Papists,</hi> and now Mr. <hi>A.</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:95208:233"/>
their <hi>Weapons</hi> from them; although he doth
not manage them with that skill and dexterity which
<hi>T. G.</hi> used. I had said, that bowing at the <hi>name
of Iesus,</hi> was no more than <hi>going to Church at the
Toll of a Bell,</hi> the <hi>Worship</hi> being not given to the
<hi>Name,</hi> but to <hi>Christ</hi> at the sound of his Name.
<hi>Why may not,</hi> saith he, <hi>an Image give warning to
the Eye, when to worship God, as well as a Bell to the
Ear?</hi> I will tell him, since he needs it, because an
<hi>Image</hi> is a <hi>mighty disparagement</hi> to an <hi>infinite</hi> and
<hi>invisible Being;</hi> it is directly contrary to his <hi>Law</hi>
to <hi>worship</hi> him by an <hi>Image;</hi> it is against the <hi>sense</hi>
of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> in its <hi>best and purest Ages;</hi>
this one would have thought I had proved so
much against the <hi>Papists,</hi> that I had little reason
to expect such a question from a <hi>Protestant.</hi> But
such men do too much discover, whose part
they are willing to take against the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England. He grants the Papists go too far in
preferring an Image higher than to be</hi> Motivum
Cultûs, <hi>but the Question is, whether they do not sin
in applying it to this lower use, to make it an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
stated Motive to Worship.</hi> When I read
this, I began to pity the man, being in some fear
lest something had a little disordered his fancy.
For where do we ever allow such an <hi>use of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
in our <hi>Church?</hi> If he had written against
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who allows a <hi>Crucifix</hi> to be <hi>Medium
excitans,</hi> he had some reason to have answered him,
but I have none. But he brings it home to us;
<hi>for,</hi> saith he, <hi>If men do sin who make an Image an
ordinary stated motive of Worship, then how shall
we excuse our own adorations?</hi> What doth the
man mean? I am yet afraid, all things are not
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:95208:233"/>
right somewhere. We acknowledge <hi>no adorations,</hi>
but what are due to the <hi>Divine Majesty;</hi> and do
these need to be excused? And what consequence
is there from the unlawfulness of the <hi>Worship</hi> of
<hi>Images,</hi> against our <hi>worshipping</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> Let him
first prove, that we give <hi>adoration</hi> to any besides the
<hi>Divine Majesty,</hi> before we shall go about to <hi>excuse</hi>
our <hi>adorations. But if men do not sin in making
an Image a stated Motive of Worship</hi>(whoever said
they did not? I am sure, not our Church. But
let this pass, what follows?) <hi>then,</hi> saith he, <hi>why
do we not introduce Images into our Churches?</hi>
Ask Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that <hi>Question,</hi> and not us of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> If we allowed the <hi>Worship</hi>
of <hi>Images</hi> to be <hi>lawfull,</hi> this were a pertinent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
but since we deny it, what makes all this
against us? <hi>which if our Church-men shall venture
upon;</hi> I pray stay till they do, before you charge
us with it. Are not these men hugely to seek
for Arguments against our <hi>Church</hi> that talk at this
rate? But, he saith, <hi>they may doe it with equal
reason.</hi> Here is something now fit to be proved.
We utterly deny that we may <hi>worship Images</hi> on
the same <hi>Reason,</hi> that we perform <hi>external adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>bowing the Body;</hi> or to <hi>Iesus</hi> at
the mention of his <hi>name.</hi> Hold now to this, and
prove it. Instead of that, he shews the difference
between going to Church at the <hi>sound</hi> of a <hi>Bell,</hi>
and <hi>bowing</hi> at the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Iesus;</hi> viz. <hi>That the
Bell tolls out of Worship to bring them to it; but
the sound of the word Iesus is in the middle of
Worship, when mens minds should be intent on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
and not sit listening and watching, as</hi> Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington'<hi>s
Cat watcht the Mouse, (there 'tis for you,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:95208:234"/>
viz.</hi> what he hath laboured for all this while)
<hi>for the casual starting of a word, and the dropping
of two syllables.</hi> But the Question is not about
the <hi>seasonableness</hi> of doing this when we are in
other <hi>Acts of Devotion</hi> and <hi>immediate Application
to God,</hi> which no body contends for, that I know
of, but about the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of doing it in the
<hi>time</hi> of <hi>Divine Service,</hi> when we hear the name
of <hi>Iesus</hi> repeated in the <hi>Lessons,</hi> or the <hi>Creed;</hi>
and the <hi>Canon</hi> which requires it refers to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Custom,</hi> and in the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
the <hi>Lessons</hi> and <hi>Sermons</hi> are mentioned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly;
and although it be said, <hi>or otherwise in
the Church pronounced,</hi> yet by the manner of shewing
this Reverence, <hi>viz. with lowness of courtesie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
of heads of mankind;</hi> it supposeth them at
that time not to be imployed in any other <hi>Act of
Devotion.</hi> And so it gives no interruption to the
<hi>intention</hi> of it; nor <hi>obliges</hi> men to lie at the <hi>catch
for the coming of the word,</hi> as though all our <hi>Worship</hi>
consisted in it; but since our <hi>Church</hi> approves it as a
<hi>laudable Ceremony,</hi> we ought not to refuse it at <hi>seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
times;</hi> unless it can be proved <hi>unlawfull</hi> in it
self. Which I say, can never be done, as long as the
<hi>Worship</hi> is directed to a <hi>true object, viz.</hi> the <hi>Person of
Christ;</hi> and the mention of his name, onely expresses
<hi>the time,</hi> as the tolling the <hi>Bell</hi> doth of going to
<hi>Church.</hi> Neither doth it signifie any thing to this
purpose, <hi>whether Persons be in the Church or out of it,
when the Bell rings;</hi> for in the same page he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the <hi>Mass-bell;</hi> which sounds to the <hi>People</hi> in the
Church as well as out of it; and if the <hi>Object</hi> of their
<hi>Worship</hi> were true, as it is false, that would make
him better understand the parallel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:95208:234"/>
                     <hi>But, saith he,</hi> if it be a duty to give external Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to God, when ever the word Iesus is mentioned,
there is more need of it in our ordinary converses, and the
secular affairs of the world; and so, <hi>he addes,</hi> this word
might do the service of the Mass-bell going about the
streets, at which all are bound to fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
<hi>Now, what a strange piece of</hi> crosness <hi>is this,
to dispute the</hi> lawfulness <hi>of doing it at</hi> Church, <hi>because
we do it not at the Market-place? My business is to
defend what our</hi> Church <hi>requires, if he will allow
that, and thinks it convenient to do it likewise in</hi>
common conversation, <hi>let him defend his own new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented</hi>
wayes of Reverence; <hi>as for us, we think there
are proper</hi> seasons <hi>for</hi> Divine Worship, <hi>and that it is
not enough to do what is</hi> lawful, <hi>unless it be done at
its</hi> convenient time, <hi>but there are some men, who
know no mean between</hi> doing nothing, <hi>and</hi> over-doing.
<hi>But is this becoming a</hi> Protestant Divine <hi>to parallel
the</hi> Worship <hi>we give to</hi> the Eternal Son of God, <hi>as our</hi>
Church <hi>declares,</hi> Can. 18. <hi>and that which the</hi> Papists
<hi>give to the</hi> Host, <hi>when it is carried up and down the
streets? At last,</hi> he commends the moderation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
1640. about bowing towards the East or Altar, that
they which use this Rite, despise not them who use it not;
and they who use it not, condemn not those that use it:
but he would fain know why the same moderation should
not be used in other Rites, as the sign of the Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and
kneeling at the Lords Supper? <hi>It had been much more
to his purpose to have proved any thing</hi> unlawful
<hi>which had been required by our</hi> Church. <hi>But the case
was not the same as to those things which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by our</hi> Church, <hi>ever since the</hi> Reformation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>and
as to some customes, which although in themselves</hi>
lawful, <hi>yet were never strictly enjoyned, but left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.
And therefore the</hi> moderation <hi>used in
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:95208:235"/>
the</hi> Canon, 1640, <hi>was very suitable to the</hi> principles <hi>of
our</hi> Church; <hi>but how doth it follow,</hi> that because some
things are left at liberty, therefore nothing should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd;
or being determin'd ought not to be obeyed?
<hi>It was the great</hi> Wisdom <hi>of our</hi> Church <hi>not to make
more things necessary (as to practice) than were
made so at the settlement of our</hi> Reformation; <hi>but
whether there be</hi> sufficient Reason <hi>to alter those</hi> terms
<hi>of</hi> Communion <hi>which were then settled, for the sake
of such whose scruples are groundless and endless, I
do not take upon me here to determine. But as far as
I can perceive by Mr.</hi> A. <hi>he thinks</hi> the Apostles Rule of
forbearance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. to be of equal force in all ages,
and as to all things, about which Christians have different
apprehensions; <hi>and then the</hi> Papists <hi>come in for an
equal share in such a</hi> toleration. <hi>And so</hi> those who do
not worship the Host, or Images, or use Auricular Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
must not censure those that do, <hi>unless he will say,
that the</hi> Papists <hi>have no</hi> scruple <hi>of</hi> Conscience, <hi>as to
such things; but if notwithstanding these scruples,
our</hi> Laws <hi>put a just restraint upon them, then</hi> the
Rule of Forbearance, <hi>Rom. 14. is no</hi> obligatory Law <hi>to</hi>
Christians <hi>in all</hi> Ages; <hi>and consequently, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that, our</hi> Church <hi>may justly require the</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<hi>of some things, though it leaves others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determin'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he saith, <hi>these Customes though left indifferent,
are still observed among us, and practised by all the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Church-men.</hi> And what then? are they <hi>lawful,</hi>
or are they not? If not, why are they not proved to
be <hi>unlawful?</hi> And if that were proved, what is all
this to the point of <hi>Separation,</hi> unless they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to <hi>all People,</hi> and made <hi>terms</hi> of <hi>Communion;
i. e.</hi> that persons were not allowed to joyn in all <hi>Acts</hi>
of <hi>Communion</hi> with us, unless they did them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:95208:235"/>
                     <hi>he thinks this will prove</hi>(What, that they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from us in any <hi>substantial part of Worship?</hi> No,
he dares not say that: but what then?) <hi>that we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in more than a circumstance, even at least in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial
part of Worship, yet we must be supposed to
be agreed.</hi> To convince the Reader, what an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
faculty of proving this man hath, let him but
look on the thing he undertook to prove. I had said,
that <hi>we were agreed in the substantial parts of Worship;</hi>
this he undertakes to disprove, for two or three
leaves together, and the conclusion is, <hi>that at least we
differ in a circumstantial part of Worship,</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
must be, therefore we differ in <hi>a substantial,</hi>
or else it is idle and impertinent talk. <hi>T. G.</hi> would
have been ashamed to have argued after this fashion:
but they are to be pittied, they both do as well, as
their Cause will bear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet Mr.</hi> A. <hi>cannot give over, for he hath a very
good will at proving something against our Church,
although he hath very ill luck in the doing of it. My
argument was,</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>If it be lawful to</hi> separate <hi>upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of</hi> greater purity, <hi>where there is an</hi> agreement
in doctrine, <hi>and</hi> the substantial parts of Worship, <hi>then a
bare difference in opinion, as to some</hi> circumstantials
in Worship <hi>and the</hi> best constitution of Churches <hi>will be
a sufficient ground to</hi> break Communion <hi>and to set up</hi>
new Churches.</q> 
                     <hi>Hitherto we have considered his deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of the</hi> Antecedent; <hi>and the charge he hath brought
against our</hi> Church, <hi>about</hi> new substantial parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
<hi>we now come to his</hi> denying the Consequence,
<hi>viz.</hi> that although it be granted that there is an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Doctrine and the substantial parts of Worship,
yet he will not allow it to follow that a bare difference in
opinion as to some circumstantials will be sufficient ground
to break Communion and to set up new Churches. <hi>To
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:95208:236"/>
understand the consequence we must suppose, 1. An</hi>
agreement <hi>in the</hi> substantial parts of Worship. 2. A
Separation, <hi>for</hi> greater parity of Worship. <hi>And what
then can justifie this</hi> Separation, <hi>but a difference of</hi>
Opinion <hi>as to some</hi> circumstantials <hi>in Worship?</hi> Hold,
<hi>saith he,</hi> the consequence is not good, for there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
middle things, between substantial parts of worship
and bare circumstances, about which it will be lawful to
divide, though otherwise we agree in doctrine, and the
substantial parts of Worship. <hi>So that here a</hi> Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

which are confessed to be neither</hi> substantial <hi>nor</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial

agreement in the substantial parts of Worship; <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
although these</hi> middle kind of things <hi>be not
made</hi> substantial parts of worship. <hi>For that he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
us with in the</hi> Antecedent; <hi>and now allowing
the</hi> Antecedent <hi>and denying the</hi> Consequence, <hi>he must
grant, that it is lawful to</hi> separate <hi>on the account of</hi>
Ceremonies, <hi>although they be made no</hi> parts <hi>of</hi> worship
<hi>at all. For if they be neither</hi> substantial <hi>nor</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial

yet he saith, it is lawful to divide about them. And
which is more pleasant, when he goes about to prove
the</hi> lawfulness <hi>of</hi> separating <hi>for the sake of these things,
he doth it by undertaking to shew,</hi> that they are made
substantial parts of Worship. <hi>For thus he argues,</hi> The
Church of <hi>England</hi> hath exalted these things, <hi>i. e.</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
to a high preferment in worship, to signifie the
same things with the Sacramental Elements, to make
them necessary to salvation as far as man can make
them; and therefore they conclude them sinful. <hi>If their
preferment in Worship makes them sinful, then they
must be either</hi> substantial, <hi>or</hi> circumstantial parts of
Worship, <hi>and their</hi> separation <hi>is not upon the account
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:95208:236"/>
of their being</hi> Ceremonies, <hi>but those</hi> Ceremonies <hi>are
supposed to be made</hi> Parts <hi>of</hi> Worship, <hi>which I have

not. Is this mans conscience full of <hi>Scruples</hi> that
writes at this rate, with so little regard to the
plain meaning and words of him whom he pretends
to confute?</p>
                  <p>3. He saith, <hi>I put one of the wildest cases that ever
was put,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 73.</note> viz. <hi>If a man think himself bound to divide
the Church by sinful Separation, that separation is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
a sin for his thinking himself bound to do it.
For (1.) It may be justly questioned, whether it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for a man in his Wits to think himself bound to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Church by sinful Separation.</hi> What <hi>Sophisters</hi>
arguments are these? As though we did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
speak of the thing <hi>as it is,</hi> and not as the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
apprehends it.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> did think himself bound
to a <hi>sinful persecution,</hi> although he did not think it
so, when he did it. The <hi>Iews</hi> thought themselves
bound <hi>to kill the Apostles,</hi> which was <hi>wilful murder,</hi>
and yet they were men in their wits. The <hi>false
Apostles</hi> thought themselves bound to divide the
Church by a <hi>sinful separation.</hi> How then comes this
to be thought so impossible a case as to the thing it
self? for I was not so foolish to put the case concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
men, who thought themselves bound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a sin, knowing it to be a sin. (2.) <hi>He much
questions, whether ever any did think himself bound to
divide a Church, he may possibly think himself bound to
avoid it.</hi> If he may think himself bound to do that
which makes <hi>divisions</hi> in a <hi>Church,</hi> it is sufficient to
my purpose. And did not the <hi>false Apostles</hi> do so,
and have not others followed their examples? And
thus, after other trifling Cavils to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
after his manner, he yields all that I say, and
saith, <hi>It is freely granted by all the world, that wilful
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:95208:240"/>
Error doth not excuse from sin.</hi> And after many
words about the case of an <hi>erroneous conscience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 77.</note> he
concludes that <hi>I deliver nothing but the common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of all Casuists; only he thinks it not pertinent to
the matter in hand.</hi> Why so? was not the matter
in hand about the <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>complying</hi> with an <hi>established
Rule?</hi> And was it not very pertinent to this, to shew
how far an <hi>erroneous conscience</hi> may, or may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
from sin? But Mr. <hi>A.</hi> saith, <hi>it should have been
about the Power of Conscience, concerning an established
Rule of mans making; and such for which they have
neither general nor particular warrant from God so to
make.</hi> Is not this indeed to the purpose? First to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
an <hi>unlawful rule</hi> imposed, and then to enquire
what <hi>conscience</hi> is to do about it. My business was to
shew, that men were not in doubtful cases to satisfie
themselves with this, <hi>that they followed their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;</hi>
because their <hi>consciences</hi> might <hi>err,</hi> and if that
<hi>Error</hi> happened to be <hi>wilful,</hi> being contracted for
want of due care, what they did, might not only
be <hi>sinful in it self,</hi> but imputed to them as <hi>sins.</hi>
Which all men who pretended any regard <hi>to consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>

in the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> most of them were by

for the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> commonly raised <hi>Scruples</hi> among

themselves must be allowed the <hi>liberty of setting

will not deny, but they may have <hi>Scruples</hi> too,
<hi>many Scruples, and of long standing, and among great
numbers, and they have Priests enough at liberty to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

and <hi>agreement</hi> among themselves? Our <hi>Churches</hi> not
permitting the <hi>Parents</hi> themselves to be <hi>Sponsors</hi> is
but like such an occasion of absence; and the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of our <hi>Church</hi> is not to supersede the <hi>obligation</hi>
                     <pb n="381" facs="tcp:95208:243"/>
of <hi>Parents,</hi> but to superinduce a farther obligation
upon other Persons for greater security of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
If men be negligent in doing their duty,
must the <hi>Church</hi> bear the blame, and this be pleaded
for a ground of <hi>Separation</hi> from her <hi>Communion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But there is something beyond this, which lies at
the bottom of this scruple; viz.</hi> that the Childs Right
to Baptism depends on the Right of the Parents, and
therefore if the Parents be excluded, and only Sponsors ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
the Children so baptized have no right to Baptism.
<hi>For Mr. B.</hi>'s <hi>first</hi> Question <hi>is,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Def. of the Plea. <hi>p.</hi> 25.</note> which way the Child cometh
to have right to Baptism, any more than all the Infidels
Children in the world? And his next is, whether the
Church of <hi>England</hi> require any ground of title in the
Infant, besides the Sponsion of the fore-described God-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and Gods general promise?</p>
                  <p>I answer, (1.) The <hi>Church</hi> by requiring <hi>Sponsors</hi>
doth not exclude any <hi>Title</hi> to <hi>Baptism,</hi> which the <hi>Child</hi>
hath by the <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Parents.</hi> For the <hi>Sponsors</hi> may
be supposed to appear in a threefold <hi>Capacity.</hi> 1. As
<hi>representing the Parents</hi> in <hi>offering up the Child to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;</hi>
and so whatever <hi>right</hi> the Parents have, that is
challenged, when the <hi>Child</hi> is brought to be <hi>baptized.</hi>
2. As <hi>representing the Child in the Answers that are
made in Baptism;</hi> which is a very ancient and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
practice of the Christian Church; for it was not
only observed in the Latin <hi>Churches</hi> in S. <hi>Augustins</hi>
time;<note place="margin">Aug. ep. 23.</note> and in the <hi>Greek Churches</hi> in S. <hi>Chrysostom's;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chrysost. in <hi>Psal.</hi> 14.</note>
and hath so continued ever since; but the <hi>Aethiopick</hi>
and <hi>Armenian Churches</hi> do still observe it. 3. <hi>In their
own capacity;</hi> when they <hi>promise</hi> to <hi>take care of the
good education of the Child in the principles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
faith;</hi> in the charge given to them, <hi>after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</hi>
So that since one of these <hi>capacities</hi> doth not
destroy another, they all succeeding each other, there is
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:95208:244"/>
no reason to say that the <hi>Church</hi> doth exclude the
right which comes by the Parents.</p>
                  <p>(2) <hi>If the</hi> Parents <hi>be supposed to have</hi> no right,
<hi>yet upon the</hi> Sponsion <hi>of</hi> God-fathers, <hi>the</hi> Church <hi>may
have</hi> right <hi>to administer</hi> Baptism <hi>to</hi> Children. <hi>Not,
as though their</hi> Sponsion <hi>gave the</hi> right, <hi>but was only
intended to make them</hi> parties <hi>to the</hi> Covenant <hi>in the</hi>
Childs name <hi>and</hi> Sureties <hi>for performance. To make
this clear, we must consider, that</hi> administration <hi>of</hi>
Baptism, <hi>is one considerable part of</hi> the Power of the
Keys, <hi>which</hi> Christ <hi>first gave to the</hi> Apostles, <hi>and is
ever since continued in the</hi> Officers <hi>of the</hi> Church.
<hi>By vertue of this</hi> Power, <hi>they have</hi> Authority <hi>to give
admission into the</hi> Church <hi>to capable</hi> Subjects. <hi>The</hi>
Church <hi>of</hi> Christ, <hi>as far as we can trace any records of</hi>
Antiquity, <hi>hath alwayes allowed</hi> Children <hi>to be</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Subjects of Admission into the Christian Church; <hi>but
lest the</hi> Church <hi>should fail of its end, and these</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<hi>not be afterwards well instructed in their Duty,
it required</hi> Sponsors <hi>for them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>who were not only to
take care of them for the future but to stand as their</hi>
sureties <hi>to ratifie their part of the</hi> Covenant <hi>which</hi>
Baptism <hi>implyes. And the</hi> ancient Church <hi>went no
farther as to the</hi> right of Baptism <hi>than this, for since
the</hi> Power of the Keys <hi>was in the</hi> Church <hi>to give</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<hi>to</hi> capable Subjects; <hi>since the</hi> Catholick
Church <hi>did alwayes judge</hi> Infants capable, <hi>there
seemed to be no more necessary for their</hi> admission
<hi>than the undertaking of</hi> Sponsors <hi>in their name.
All this appears from S.</hi> Augustines Epistle, ad Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facium;
<hi>where he saith (1.) That the</hi> Childs <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by</hi> Baptism <hi>doth not depend upon the</hi> intention
<hi>of those that offer him. For</hi> Boniface <hi>put the
question to S.</hi> Augustin <hi>about some</hi> who offered Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to Baptism, not for any spiritual benefit, but for
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:95208:244"/>
corporal health; <hi>notwithstanding this, saith S.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,
if the due form of Baptism be observed, the
spiritual effect of it is obtained. <hi>(2.) That the</hi> Churches
<hi>right is chiefly concerned in the</hi> baptism <hi>of</hi> Infants.
For, <hi>saith he,</hi> the Children are offered to Baptism and
the Spiritual Grace to be received thereby, not so much
by those in whose arms they are carried <hi>(for so the</hi>
Sponsors <hi>used to carry them in their</hi> right arms) as
by the whole Society of the Faithful. Tota ergo mater
Ecclesia quae in sanctis est facit, quia tota omnes, tota
singulos parit: <hi>so that it is by the</hi> Churches right, <hi>that
he supposeth them to receive</hi> baptism <hi>and the</hi> bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
<hi>by it. (3.) That there is no necessity,</hi> that the
Parents themselves offer their Children. <hi>For he calls</hi>
it a mistake to think that Children receive the benefit
in Baptism, as to the remission of Original Guilt, or
the account of their Parents offering them. For many
are offered to Baptism by strangers, and slaves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by their Masters. And when Parents are dead,
Children are offered by such as take pity upon them;
and sometimes Children exposed by Parents, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as they are taken up by holy Virgins, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have Children, nor intend to have any. (4.) That
the Answers made by the Sponsors in Baptism in the
name of the Child are a part of the solemnity of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism.
Not as though the Child did really believe, yet
it is said to believe on the account of the Sacrament
which supposeth faith. For the Sacraments because of
the resemblance between them and the things repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by them, do carry the name of the things repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented;
as, <hi>saith he,</hi> the Sacrament of Christs body af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a certain manner is called his Body; and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his blood is called his blood, so the Sacrament
of faith is called faith, i. e. <hi>the Baptismal</hi> Covenant
<hi>supposing believing on one part, the</hi> Church <hi>supplies
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:95208:245"/>
that part by the</hi> Sponsors, <hi>which cannot be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the</hi> Children. <hi>Thence he saith,</hi> ipsa responsio
ad celebrationem pertinet Sacramenti, <hi>so that then the</hi>
Church <hi>looked upon the</hi> Sponsors Answering, <hi>as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
part of the</hi> solemnity <hi>of</hi> Baptism. <hi>Thence
S.</hi> Augustin <hi>elsewhere saith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Serm. 116. de Tempore.</note> 
                     <hi>that the</hi> fide-jussores <hi>or</hi>
Sureties did in the name of the Children renounce the
Devil and all his Pomp and Works; <hi>and in another
place he declares,</hi> that he would not baptize a Child
without the Sponsors answering for the Child that he
would renounce the Devil,<note place="margin">De peccat. me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis &amp; remiss. l. 1. c. 34.</note> and turn to God, and that
they believed he was baptized for the remission of sins.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Those who think themselves bound to <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize
Children</hi> only by vertue of <hi>the Parents right,</hi>
must run into many <hi>perplexing Scruples</hi> about <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Children,</hi> and be forced to exclude the far
greater number of those that are offered. For,
(1.) They are not well agreed, what it is which
gives <hi>Parents a right</hi> to have their <hi>Children baptized;</hi>
whether a <hi>dogmatical Faith be sufficient,</hi> or a <hi>justifying
faith</hi> be necessary? If <hi>saving faith</hi> be necessary, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>outward profession</hi> of it be <hi>sufficient?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that ought to be taken for a <hi>true profession</hi> which
is only <hi>pretended</hi> to be <hi>a true sign of the mind,</hi> or that
only which is <hi>really so?</hi> Whether <hi>profession</hi> be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for it self, or as a <hi>discovery</hi> of <hi>something further?</hi>
Whether <hi>seeming seriousness in profession</hi> be <hi>sufficient,</hi>
or <hi>real serio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>sness</hi> be required? What we must judge
<hi>real seriousness in profession,</hi> as distinct from <hi>inward
sincerity?</hi> What <hi>contradiction</hi> may be allowed to
make a <hi>profession not serious?</hi> Whether besides a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
profession</hi> it be not necessary to be a <hi>practical
profession?</hi> and what is necessary for the judging a
<hi>profession</hi> to be <hi>practical?</hi> Whether besides meer
<hi>practical profession</hi> the <hi>positive signs</hi> of <hi>inward Grace</hi> be
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:95208:245"/>
not necessary? And whether besides all these, <hi>actual
confederation</hi> and joyning in <hi>Church Covenant</hi> be not
necessary? And if it be, whether the <hi>Children of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated
Parents not being confederated themselves, can
convey a right to their Children?</hi> About these, and
other such like Questions, those who go upon <hi>the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
Right</hi> are in <hi>perpetual disputes,</hi> and can neither
give others, nor hardly themselves <hi>satisfaction</hi> about
them. (2.) The consequence of this is, that <hi>they
must baptize many with a doubting mind;</hi> and must
exclude many more, than they can baptize. For
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Preface to Right to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> 
                     <hi>if he took a dogmatical faith it self, or
any short of justifying for the Title and necessary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of them I must admit, I would baptize none,
because I cannot know who hath that dogmatical faith,
and who not.</hi> The like others are as ready to say, of
his <hi>serious, voluntary, not prevalently contradicted,
practical profession;</hi> or at least, that no man can ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize
with a <hi>good Conscience,</hi> till he hath upon good
evidence throughly weighed the <hi>lives</hi> of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi>
and is able to pronounce that the actions of
their lives do not <hi>prevalently contradict their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Others must reject all those in whose <hi>Parents</hi>
they do not see <hi>positive signs of Grace;</hi> or are not <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
confederated</hi> with them. And upon all these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
bars to the <hi>Parents Right,</hi> how few <hi>Children</hi> will
be left, that a man can <hi>baptize</hi> with a <hi>safe Conscience?</hi>
Is not this now a more likely way to reduce the far
greatest part of <hi>Christianity</hi> to <hi>Paganism</hi> than deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>Separation?</hi> Thus I have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
this main Scruple against <hi>the Vse of entitling
and Covenanting Godfathers,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls them;
and have shewed how little reason there is to make

<hi>To which I answer,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1.) That our Question is about <hi>Separation</hi> from
the <hi>Communion</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> on the account of the
<hi>terms that are imposed;</hi> and is this a reasonable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for men not to do what is required, because
they do not know what may be required on the
same grounds? A Father charges his Son <hi>to stand
with his Hat off before him, or else he shall not stay in
his House;</hi> at first the Son demurrs upon <hi>putting
off his Hat</hi> to his <hi>Father,</hi> because he hath some <hi>scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
whether <hi>putting off the Hat</hi> be a <hi>lawful ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
or not; not meerly on the account of its <hi>signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy,</hi>
but because it seems to him to be <hi>giving wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to a Creature.</hi> This he thinks so <hi>weighty a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
that he charges his <hi>Father</hi> with <hi>Tyranny over his
Conscience</hi> for <hi>imposing</hi> such a <hi>condition,</hi> on his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
in his house, and thinks himself sufficiently
<hi>justified</hi> by it in his <hi>disobedience</hi> and <hi>forsaking his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
House,</hi> and drawing away as many of his <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
from him, as he can infuse this <hi>scruple</hi> into.
But let us suppose him brought to understand the
difference between <hi>Civil and Religious Worship,</hi> yet
he may upon Mr. <hi>A.'s</hi> grounds still justifie his <hi>diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi>

it. For, how do I know when you will have
done with your <hi>tokens of respect?</hi> It is true, you
require no more now, but I consider what <hi>you may
do,</hi> and for all that I know, the next thing you
may require me will be to <hi>put off my Shoos before
you,</hi> for that is a <hi>token of respect</hi> in some Countries;
next you may require me <hi>to kiss your Toe,</hi> for
that is a <hi>token of respect</hi> used some where; and
who knows what you may come to at last; and
therefore I am resolved to stop at first, and will
rather leave your <hi>House,</hi> than be bound to <hi>put off

this be a reasonable ground for such an <hi>obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
disobedience</hi> to the <hi>Command</hi> of his <hi>Father.</hi> Or
suppose a <hi>Law</hi> were made to distinguish the <hi>several

far this <hi>imposing Power</hi> may go at last; it is true,
the matter is small at present, but I consider, it
is a <hi>Badge,</hi> it is a <hi>moral significant ceremony,</hi> a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

<hi>bring forth</hi> at last; for how can I or any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
tell, but at last I may be required to wear a

                     </q> Would such an unreasonable jealousie
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:95208:247"/>
as this justifie such a mans <hi>refractoriness,</hi> in rather
choosing to lose the <hi>priviledge</hi> of his <hi>Company,</hi> than
<hi>submitting</hi> to wear the <hi>Badge</hi> of it? So that the <hi>fears</hi>
of what may be required is no ground for <hi>actual
disobedience</hi> to what is required. (2.) There
can be no <hi>reasonable suspicion</hi> that our <hi>Church</hi> should
impose <hi>any other Ceremonies,</hi> than what it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done, supposing that it might do it, on the

But besides, our <hi>Church</hi> gives a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

<hi>the very number of them,</hi>

is a burden; of which S.</hi> Augustin <hi>complained in his

for that cause many were taken away,</hi> And withall,
<hi>it is declared that Christs Gospel was not to be a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial

so as to make a <hi>new argument</hi> against them, from

as for the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in <hi>Vse</hi> among us. For, (1.) <hi>As
to the Vse of Images,</hi> our <hi>Church</hi> hath fully declared
against any <hi>Religious Vse</hi> of them, in the <hi>Homilies</hi>
about the <hi>Peril of Idolatry;</hi> and that from such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as cannot extend to our <hi>Ceremonies: viz.</hi> from
the <hi>express Law of God,</hi> and the <hi>general sense</hi> of the
<hi>Primitive Church;</hi> which allowed and practised <hi>the
sign of the Cross,</hi> at the same time when it disputed
most vehemently against <hi>Images.</hi> (2.) <hi>For Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
                     <pb n="389" facs="tcp:95208:247"/>
which he tells us, <hi>may be used as signifying
the circumcision of the heart.</hi> He knows very well
that our Church joins <hi>significancy</hi> and <hi>decency</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> and no man can
imagine that such a kind of significancy as that he
mentions, should be sufficient to introduce such a
practice which is so repugnant to <hi>Decency</hi> among us.
Besides that S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it so great a <hi>badge</hi> of the
<hi>obligation</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> that he saith, <hi>If ye be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
Christ profiteth you nothing:</hi> which was never
said of any of our <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> And whereas he
saith, <hi>it is observed in</hi> Abassia <hi>as a mystical Ceremony;</hi>

they think so; and that was all I opposed to</hi> T. G.
But is it possible for any man that pretends to be a
<hi>Protestant Divine</hi> to think the case alike? When
(1.) <hi>They confess our Doctrine in the 39 Articles to be
true,</hi> we reject all their <hi>additional Articles,</hi> in <hi>Pius 4.
his Creed,</hi> not only <hi>as false,</hi> but some of them as <hi>absurd</hi>
and <hi>unreasonable,</hi> as men can invent, <hi>viz.</hi> that of
<hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> which is made by them the great
trying and burning point. But what is there, which
the most inveterate enemies of our <hi>Church</hi> can charge
in her doctrine, as new, as <hi>false,</hi> as <hi>absurd?</hi> nay, they
all yield to the <hi>Antiquity,</hi> to the <hi>Truth,</hi> to the <hi>Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness</hi>
of our <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and yet is not Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
ashamed to make the <hi>case</hi> seem parallel. But what
new and strong Reason doth he bring for it? You
may be sure it is some mighty thing; for, he saith,
presently after it, <hi>that my Importunity hath drawn
them out of their reservedness, and they have hitherto
been modest to their prejudice.</hi> Alas for him, that his
modesty should ever hurt him! But what is this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<hi>Secret,</hi> that they have hitherto kept in, out of
meer <hi>veneration to the Church of</hi> England? Let us
prepare our selves for this unusual, this killing
charge. Why, saith Mr. <hi>A. In the Catechism of the
Church, this Doctrine is contained</hi> (It is <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
then, I see; although we are confessed <hi>to be
agreed in the 39 Articles, as far as they concern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doctrine.</hi>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:95208:248"/>
But what is this <hi>notorious doctrine?) It is,</hi> saith he,
<hi>that Infants perform Faith and Repentance by their Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
Did I not fear, it was some <hi>dreadful thing;</hi> some
<hi>notorious heresie,</hi> condemned by one or two at least of
the four <hi>General Councils?</hi> But is it said so, in plain
words? or is it wire-drawn by far-fetched Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences?
No, it is plain enough; for the Question
is, <hi>What is required of Persons to be baptized.</hi> Answ.
<hi>Repentance whereby they forsake sin; and faith, whereby
they stedfastly believe the promises of God made to them
in that Sacrament.</hi> Quest. <hi>Why then are Infants bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
when by reason of their tender age, they cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them?</hi> Answ. <hi>Because they promise them both by
their Sureties; which promise when they come to age them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are bound to perform.</hi> But I pray doth it hence
follow, that <hi>Infants do perform Faith and Repentance
by their Sureties?</hi> Are not the words express, <hi>that
they promise both by their Sureties?</hi> And is <hi>promising</hi>
and <hi>performance</hi> all one? I do not find it so by this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>
For here was a great matter <hi>promised,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>performed.</hi> It is true the <hi>Catechism</hi> saith, <hi>Faith
and Repentance are required of them that are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed:</hi>
which supposeth the persons to be baptized <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi>
of performing these things themselves. And
then comes a <hi>Question,</hi> by way of <hi>objection; why then
are Infants baptized,</hi> &amp;c. to which the sense of the
<hi>Answer</hi> is, that although by <hi>reason</hi> of their Age they
are <hi>uncapable</hi> of <hi>performing</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> and
<hi>Believing;</hi> yet the <hi>Church</hi> doth allow <hi>Sureties</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into <hi>Covenant</hi> for them; which doth imply a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>
on their parts for the <hi>Children,</hi> and an <hi>obligation</hi>
lying on them to <hi>perform</hi> what was then <hi>promised.</hi>
And now let the Reader judge, since this <hi>horrible Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi>
is come out, whether this ought to be ranked in
an equal degree as to the justifying <hi>Separation</hi> with
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:95208:249"/>
the <hi>monstrous, absurd</hi> and <hi>unreasonable doctrines</hi> of the
<hi>Roman Church.</hi> And I know nothing can do them
greater Service, than such <hi>Parallels</hi> as these.</p>
                  <p>(2.) We charge them with those <hi>Reasons</hi> for <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
which the <hi>Scripture</hi> allows; such as <hi>Idolatry,
perverting the Gospel</hi> and <hi>Institutions</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi>
over the <hi>Consciences</hi> of men, in making those
things <hi>necessary to salvation,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> never made
so: But not one of these, can with any appearance
of <hi>Reason</hi> be charged on the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> since
we profess to give <hi>Religious Worship</hi> only <hi>to God; we
worship no Images; we invocate no Sains; we adore no
Host; we creep to no Crucifix; we kiss no Relicks.</hi> We
<hi>equal</hi> no <hi>traditions</hi> with the <hi>Gospel;</hi> we lock it not
up from the <hi>People</hi> in an <hi>unknown language;</hi> we preach
no other <hi>terms</hi> of <hi>salvation</hi> than <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi>
did; we set up <hi>no Monarchy</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
Christs,</hi> and to dispence with his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</hi>
We <hi>mangle</hi> no <hi>Sacraments,</hi> nor pretend to
know what makes more for the <hi>honour</hi> of his <hi>Blood</hi>
than he did himself. We pretend to no skill in <hi>expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
mens sins when they are dead;</hi> nor in turning the
bottomless pit into the Pains of <hi>Purgatory</hi> by a <hi>charm
of words</hi> and a quick motion of the hand. We do
not cheat mens souls with <hi>false bills</hi> of <hi>exchange,</hi> called
<hi>Indulgences;</hi> nor give out that we have the <hi>Treasure</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> in our keeping, which we can apply as
we see occasion. We use no <hi>pious frauds</hi> to delude
the <hi>People,</hi> nor pretend to be infallible, as they do when
they have a mind to deceive. These are things which
the <hi>Divines</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> have with great clearness
and strength of Reason made good against the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome;</hi> and since they cannot be <hi>objected</hi> against our
<hi>Church,</hi> with what face, can men suppose the <hi>cases</hi> of
those who <hi>separate</hi> from each of them to be <hi>parallel?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="393" facs="tcp:95208:249"/>
(3.) As to the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> and
ours, there are these considerable differences,</p>
                  <p>(1.) They have a <hi>mighty number,</hi> as appears by
their <hi>Rituals</hi> and <hi>Ceremonials,</hi> and the great <hi>volums,</hi>
written in <hi>explication</hi> of them; we, <hi>very few,</hi> and those
so very easie and plain; that it requires as great skill
not to understand ours, as it doth to understand theirs.
(2.) They place <hi>great holiness</hi> in theirs, as appears
by the <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>consecration</hi> of their <hi>Water, Oyle, Salt,
Wax, Vestments,</hi> &amp;c. but we allow <hi>none</hi> of these, but
only the <hi>use</hi> of <hi>certain ceremonies,</hi> without any prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> importing any <hi>peculiar holiness</hi>
attributed to them. (3.) They suppose <hi>great vertue</hi>
and <hi>efficacy</hi> to be in them, for the purging away <hi>some
sorts of sins;</hi> we utterly deny any such thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to our <hi>ceremonies,</hi> but declare, that they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
only for <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Deceny.</hi> (4.) They
make their <hi>ceremonies</hi> being appointed by the <hi>Church</hi>
to become <hi>necessary parts of Divine Worship;</hi> as I
have already proved; but our <hi>Church</hi> looks upon
them, even when determined <hi>as things in their own
nature indifferent,</hi> but only required by vertue of that
<hi>general obedience</hi> which we owe to <hi>lawful Authority.</hi>
So that as to <hi>ceremonies</hi> themselves there is a <hi>vast di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparity</hi>
between the <hi>Roman Church</hi> and ours; and no
man can pretend otherwise, that is not either <hi>grosly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,</hi>
or doth not <hi>wilfully misunderstand</hi> the <hi>state</hi> of
the <hi>Controversie</hi> between them and us.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have gone through all the <hi>Pleas</hi> for the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Separation</hi> I could meet with, in the <hi>Books</hi> of my
<hi>Answerers:</hi> and I have not concealed the <hi>force</hi> or
<hi>strength</hi> I saw in any of them. And however
Mr. <hi>A.</hi> reproaches me with <hi>having a notable talent of
misrepresenting my Adversaries,</hi>

Comme j'étois sur le point de vous en faire des excuses,
Monsieur de L' Angle est arrivè en ceste ville, quime les
a fait encor differer, dans l'esperance, qu' il voudroit
bien se charger de ma reponse, &amp; qu' elle pourroit par ce

Monsieur, que si j'en croyois mon déplaisir, je la remet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trois
encor a une autre fois; car je ne peux vous ecrire
sans un extreme douleur, quand je songe a la matiere
surla quelle vous me commandés de vous dire mon sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent.
Ie croy que vous le sçavés dejá bien, et que
vous ne me faites pas l'honneur de me le demander
comme en ayant quelque sorte de doute; vous me faites
plus de justice que cela; &amp; vous ne me comprenéz pas
au nombre de ceux, qui ont touchant l 'Eglise d' Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre
une si mechante opinion. Pour moy, je n'en avois
pas une si mechante d'aucun veritable Anglois, &amp; je
ne pouvois pas me persuader qu' il y en eut un seul, qui
crût qu'on ne peut éstre dans sa communion sans hasar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
son propre salut. Pour ceux qui sont engagés dans
le parti de l' Eglise Romaine, j'en jugeois tout autre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Ils ont des maximes particuliers, &amp; agissent par
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:95208:251"/>
d'autres Interests. Mais pour ceux qui n'ont aucune liai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
avec Rome, c'est une chose bien singuliere de les voir
passer jusqu' a cette extremitè que de croire que dans
l' Eglise Anglicane on ne peut faire son salut. C'est
n'avoir gueres de conoissance de la Confession defoy, que
tout le monde Protestant a si hautement approuveé, &amp;
qui merite en effect les louanges de tout ce qu'il y a de
bons Chrestiens. Car on ne pouvoit rien faire de plus sage
que cette Confession, &amp; jamais les articles de foy n'ont

raisonnable que dans cette excellent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

de la garder avec tant de veneration dans la Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theque
d' Oxford, &amp; le grand Iuellus pour l'avoir si dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement
defendüe, est digne d'une louange immortelle.
C'est d'elle dont Dieu se servit dans le commencement de la
Reformation d' Angleterre, &amp; si elle n'avoit pas été
comme son ouvrage, il ne l'auroit pas benit d'une façon
si avantageuse. Le succes qu' elle out, devroit fermer
la bouche a ceux qui sont les plus animés, &amp; l'avoir
veue trionpher de tant d' Obstacles devroit faire recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitre
a tout le monde, que dieu s'est declarè en sa fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veur,
qu'il est visiblement mélé de son établissement, &amp;
qu'elle a la verité &amp; la fermeté de sa parole, a qui elle
doibt en effect sa naissance, &amp; son origine. Elle est
aujourdhuy ce qu'elle ètoit quand elle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>toit formeé, &amp;
on ne peut pas reprocher a Messieurs les Evéques qu'ils
y ayent depuis cette terme lá, apporté quelque change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Et comment donc s'imaginer qu'elle ayt changé
d'usage? &amp; peut on rien voir de plus inique, que de
dire, qu'un Instrument que Dieu employa autrefois
pour l'instruction de tant de gens de bien, pour
le salut de de tant de peuples, pour la consolation
tant de fidelles soit aujourdhuy devenüe quelque chose
de funeste, &amp; pernicieuse. Si votre Confession de foy
est pure, &amp; innocente, votre service divin l'est aussi
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:95208:251"/>
Car on n'y voit rien de tout qui tende a L'idolatrie;
vous n'adorés que Dieu seul; dans vôtre culte il
n'y a rien qui se termine a la creature, &amp; si l'on y
trouve quelques ceremonies qui ne se rencontrent pas
ailleurs, c'est faire profession d'une terrible Theologie,
avoir depouillé toute charité, ne sçavoir guere ce que
valent les ames, ne conoitre point la nature de choses
indifferentes, que decroire qu'elles sont capables de perdre
eternellement ceux qui s'y veulent assujettir. C'est avoir
une méme dureté que de croire que vôtre discipline ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastique
est capable de damner les hommes. Car ou
a t'on jamais vú que pour des articles de Discipline le
salut des hommes se trouve interessé, &amp; de choses qui
ne regardent que le dehors, &amp; L'ordre de L' Eglise, et
qui ne sont que comme L'ecorce, &amp; les envelopes de la
veritè, peuvent elles causer la mort, &amp; glisser du poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
dans une ame? Certes on ne les comprend jamais
au nombre de verités essentielles, &amp; comme il n'y
a que celles cy qui sauvent, il n'y a qu'elles aussi qui
peuvent exclurre du salut. Pour le gouvernement
Episcopal, qu'a t'il qui soit dangereux, &amp; qui puisse
raisonnablement alarmer des consciences? &amp; s'il
est capable de priver de la gloire eternelle, &amp; de
boucher les avenües du ciel, qui estce qui y est entré
l'espace de plus de quinze cents ans? Puisque pendant
tout ce temps lá, toutes les Eglises du monde n'ont point
eu d'autre gouvernement. S'il étoit contraire a la ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rité
&amp; a l'aquisition du bonheur eternel, est il croyable
que Dieu l'eut si hautement approuvé, &amp; qu'il eut per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
que pendant tant de siecles son Eglise en eust été
tyrannisé? Car qui estce qui l'a gouverné, qui estce
qui a composé ses conciles tant generaux que particuliers,
qui estce qui a combatu les Heresies dont elle a esté de
tout temps attaqué? ont ce pas été les Evéques, &amp; n'
estce pas a leur sage conduite, que la parcle de Dieu
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:95208:252"/>
est redevable, apres Dieu, de ses victoires &amp; de ses Triom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.
Et sans remonter jusq' au berceau, &amp; la naissan ce
de l' Eglise, qui estce qui dans le siecle precedant delivra
l' Angleterre, de l' Erreur dont elle étoit envelopée?
Qui estce qui y fit resveiller si miraculeusement la verité?
fut ce pas le zele, &amp; la fermeté des evéques, leur mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistere?
degagea t'il pas les Anglois de l'oppression sous
laquelle ils gemissoient de puis si long temps; &amp; leur ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emple
aida't y pas puissamment a la Reformation de toute
l' Europe? En verité je croy qu'ils en pouvroient vser
comme fift autre fois Gregoire de Nazianze au milieu de
Constantinople. Quand il y arriva, il trouva que L' Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianismey
avoit fait de fort grand progres, cependant,
son courage, son zele, son sçavoir affoblioent si fort le
parti des Heretiques, qu'en peu de temps la verité y
apparut plus belle que jamais, &amp; il voulut que le Temple
ou il l'avoit si fortement appuiée portoit le nom d' Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie,
parce qu'il L'y avoit comme deterrée, &amp; degagée
de dessous L'erreur, &amp; par ses soins continuels, il y
avoit comme fait sortir du tombeau, &amp; glorieusement
resusciteé, c'est ce qu'ont fait aussi Les Evesques d' Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre.
Ils voyoient non une verité seulement, mais
quasi toutes les verités fondamentales ensevelies sous un
nombre espouvantables d' Erreurs. Ils voyoient le joug
de Rome plus pesant au milieu d'eux qu'il n'étoit nulle
part ailleurs. La difficulté qu'il y avoit a reüssir dans
la Reformation étoit capable de décourager des person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
d'une capacité, &amp; d'un zele mediocre, &amp; neantmoins
rien ne les detourne d'un si gene reux dessein. Les enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
de dehors, ceux de dedans, tous terribles qu'ils pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>russent,
ne les intimident point; ils entreprenent ce
grand ouvrage, et ne l'abandonnent point qu'ils n'en
soient venus au bout, &amp; qu'ils n'ayent remis sur le
throne la verité resuscitée. En sorte qu'ils pouuoient
lusser par tout des monuments de ce miracle &amp; nommer
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:95208:252"/>
justement toutes leur Eglises du nom d' Anastasie &amp; de
resurrection. Mais si ce Tiltre manque a leur Temples,
la chose en soy leur convient, &amp; l'on n'entend ressonner
au milieu d'eux que les Lessons, &amp; Les louanges de la
pure Verité. Ce que doit obliger tous les gens de bien à
ne s'en ecarter pas, &amp; a regarder L' Eglise Anglicane
comme une Eglise tres Orthodoxe. C'est ce qui font Les
Protestants de France, ceux de Geneva, Ceux de Suisse,
&amp; d' Allemagne, &amp; ceux d' Hollande aussi. Car ils se
firent un fort grand Honneur, d'avoir dans leur Concile
de Dordrecht des Theologiens d' Angleterre, &amp; monstre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
bien qu'ils avoient pour L' Eglise Anglicane une
profonde veneration. Et d'oú vient donc, que des An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glois
mémes en ont aujourdhuy si mechante opinion, &amp;
rompre si temerairement comme ils font, avec Elle?
estce pas rompre avec toute L' Eglise Ancienne, avec tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
les Eglises Orientales, avec toutes les Eglises Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes
qui ont toujours fort consideré la pureté de celle
d' Angleterre? estce pas une horrible dureté que de l'ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communier
sans misericorde, &amp; s'en faire etrangement a
croire que de s'imaginer qu'ils soient le seuls en Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre
&amp; méme au milieu de tout le monde chrestien, qui
soient destinés au bonheur eternel &amp; a soustenir, comme
il faut, le verites necessaires au salut. Certes on pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roit
faire un parallele fort odieux entre ces Docteurs, &amp;
le Pape Victor, qui volut excommunier les Eglises d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
par ce qu'elles ne celebroient le feste de Pasque au méme
jour que Rome le faisoit; entre eux &amp; les Audiens, qui
rompoient avec les Chrestiens, &amp; ne vouloient point
souffrir d' Evéques riches. Entre Eux &amp; le Donatistes,
qui ne vouloient point de communion avec ceux qui
avoient esté ordines par des Evéques laches, &amp; qui s'ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginoient
que leur societé étoit la veritable Eglise, &amp;
l'épouse bien aimée qui paissoit son troupeau vers le midi.
Entre eux &amp; ceux de la communion Romaine, qui ont si
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:95208:253"/>
bonne opinion de leur Eglise, que hors d'elle ils ne s'ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginent
pas qu'un puisse jamais acquerir le Salut. Pour
moy quelque enclin que je sois a la tolerance, je ne pourois
pourtant me persuader qu'il en faille avoir pour ceux qui
en ont si peu pour les autres, &amp; que s'ils étoient les
maitres feroient assurement un mauvais quartiér a
ceux qui dependroient d'eux. Ie regarde ces gens lá,
comme de perturbateurs de l'Estat, &amp; de l'Eglise, &amp; qui
sont infalliblement animés d'un esprit de sedition. I'ay
méme de la paine a croire qu'ils soient justement ce
qu'ils disent estre, &amp; je craindrois bien que sous ces Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteurs
il n'y eust des ennemis tres dangereux qui fussent
cachés. Des Societés composées detelles personnes seroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
extrement perilleuses, &amp; on ne les pourroit sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frir
sans ouvrir la porte au disordre, &amp; travailler asa
propre ruine. Ily en a de composées de personnes plus
raisonnables. Mais j'y voudrois qu'elles le fussent assez,
pour ne se point separer de celles qui composent l' Eglise
Anglicane; particulierement au terme ou nous sommes
elles devroient tout faire pour une bonne Reconciliation;
&amp; dans le conjuncture des affaires presentes ils devroient
bien s'aperçevoir qu'il n'y a qu'une bonne reunion qui
puisse prevenir les maux dont l'Angleterre est menacée.
Car pour dire la verité, je ne voi pas que leue <hi>Meetings</hi>

Quand j'estois a Londres, il y a bien tost cinq ans, je me

                  <head type="sub">A Letter from Monsieur le Moyne, Professor of
Divinity at Leyden, to my Lord Bishop of
London, concerning the nature of our present
Differences, and the unlawfulness of Separation
from the Church of England.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>TWo Journeys that I have been obliged to
take, have hindered me from answering the
Letter, with which your Lordship did me
the favour to honour me, so soon as I could
have wished. Just as I was about to excuse my self
to you for it, Monsieur <hi>de l' Angle</hi> came to this Town,
which made me defer it longer yet, in hopes that he
would charge himself with my answer, and that
by that means it might be brought unto you more
safely. It is true, my Lord, that if I should hearken
to my own unwillingness, I should put it off still to
another time; for I cannot write unto you without
being extreamly grieved, when I think upon the
matter, of which you command me to tell you my
opinion. I believe that you know it already, and
that you do not do me the honour to ask it of me,
as if you had any kind of doubt of it. You do me
more right than so; and you do not account me of
the number of those that have so ill an opinion of
the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For my part I had not so
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:95208:255"/>
bad a one of any true <hi>English-man,</hi> and I could not
have perswaded my self that there had been so much
as one, which had believed that a man could not be
of her communion, without hazarding his own sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
For those that are engaged in the party of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I judged quite otherwise of
them; they have particular Maxims, and act by
other interests. But for those that have no tye to
<hi>Rome,</hi> it is a very strange thing to see them come to
that extream, as to believe that a man cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This is not to have
much knowledge of that Confession of Faith, which
all the Protestant World has so highly approved, and
which does really deserve the praises of all good
Christians that are. For there cannot be any thing
made more wise than that Confession, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith were never collected with a more
just and reasonable discretion than in that excellent
piece. There is great reason to keep it with so
much veneration in the Library of <hi>Oxford;</hi> and the
great <hi>Iewell</hi> deserves immortal praise for having so
worthily defended it. It was this that God made use
of in the beginning of the Reformation of <hi>England.</hi>
And if it had not been as it were his work, he had
never blessed it in so advantageous a manner. The
success that it has had, ought to stop the mouth of
those that are the most passionate, and it's having
triumphed over so many obstacles, should make all
the World acknowledge, that God has declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in favour of it, and that he has been visibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in its establishment; and that it has the truth
and confirmation of his word, to which in effect it
owes its birth and original. It is the same at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
as it was when it was made, and no one can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Bishops for having made any change in it
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:95208:255"/>
since that time. And how then can it be imagined,
that it has changed its use? And can there be any
thing more unjust, than to say, that an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which God has heretofore employed for the
instruction of so many people, for the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so many good men, for the salvation of
so many believers, is now become a destructive
and pernicious thing? If your Confession of Faith
be pure and innocent, your Divine Service is so
too: for no one can discover any thing at all in
it that tends to Idolatry: You adore nothing but
God alone; in your Worship there is nothing
that is terminated on the Creature: And if there
be some Ceremonies there, which one shall not
meet with in some other places; this were to make
profession of a terrible kind of Divinity, to put off
all Charity, not to know much what souls are
worth; not to understand the nature of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
to believe that they are able to destroy
those eternally, that are willing to submit themselves
unto them. It is to have the same hardness to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that your Ecclesiastical Discipline can damn
any. For where has it been ever seen, that the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of men was concerned for Articles of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and things that regard but the out-side, and
order of the Church, and are but as it were the
bark and covering of the truth? Can these things
cause death, and distill poyson into a soul? Truly
these are never accounted in the number of essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
truths; and as there is nothing but these that can
save, so there is nothing but these that can exclude
men from salvation. For the Episcopal Government,
what is there in it that is dangerous, and may reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
alarm mens consciences? And if this be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of depriving us of eternal glory, and shutting
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:95208:256"/>
the Gates of Heaven, who was there that entered
there for the space of fifteen hundred years, since
that for all that time all the Churches of the World
had no other kind of Government? If it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the truth, and the attainment of eternal
happiness, is it credible that God had so highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
it, and permitted his Church to be tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
over by it for so many Ages? For who was it
that did govern it? Who was it that did make up
its Councils, as well General, as particular? Who
was it that combated the Heresies with which
it has been at all times assaulted? Was it not the
Bishops? And is it not to their wise conduct, to
which next under God, his Word is beholden for its
Victories and Triumphs? And not to go back so far
as the birth and infancy of the Church; who was it
that in the last Age delivered <hi>England</hi> from the error
in which she was inveloped? Who was it that made
the truth to rise so miraculously there again? Was it
not the zeal and constancy of the Bishops, and their
Ministry that disengaged the <hi>English</hi> from that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
under which they had groaned so long?
And did not their Example powerfully help forward
the Reformation of all <hi>Europe?</hi> In truth I think they
might make the same use of this, as <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi>
did heretofore at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> When he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
there he found that Arrianism had made a very
great progress in that place; but then his courage,
his zeal, his learning did so mightily weaken the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Hereticks that in a little time the truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
there again more beautiful than ever; and the
Church where he had so stoutly upheld it, he would
have to bear the name of <hi>Anastasia;</hi> because he had
brought the truth as it were out of the earth, and
cleared it from the error that lay upon it, and by
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:95208:256"/>
his continual cares had caused it, as it were, to
come out of the Grave to a glorious Resurrection.
It is this too that the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> have done;
they saw not only one truth, but almost all the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
truths buried under a formidable number
of errors; they saw the yoke of <hi>Rome</hi> heavier
among them, than it was any where else: The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
that there was of succeeding in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
was enough to discourage persons of an
ordinary capacity and zeal. Nevertheless nothing
turns them from so generous a design; the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
without, and those within as terrible as they
seem, do not fright them; they undertake this
great work, and do not leave it till they had
brought it about, and raised up the truth, and
placed it again upon the Throne, in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that they might every where have monuments
of this miracle, and justly have called all their
Churches by the name of <hi>Anastasia</hi> or Resurrection.
But if their Churches have not that title, the thing
it self belongs unto them; and you shall hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
discoursed of in these, but lectures and
praises of the pure truth. Which ought to oblige
all good men not to separate from it; but to look
upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as a very Orthodox
Church. Thus all the Protestants of <hi>France</hi> do,
those of <hi>Geneva,</hi> those of <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>German,</hi>
and those of <hi>Holland</hi> too; for they did themselves a
very great honour in having some Divines of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
in their Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and shewed plainly
that they had a profound veneration for the Church
of <hi>England.</hi> And from whence does it then come,
that some <hi>Englishmen</hi> themselves have so ill an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of her at present, and divide rashly from her,
as they do? Is not this to divide from all the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:95208:257"/>
Churches, from all the Churches of the East,
from all the Protestant Churches, which have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
had a very great respect for the purity of
that of <hi>England?</hi> Is it not horrible impudence to
excommunicate her without mercy, and to make
themselves believe strangely of her, for them to
imagine that they are the only men in <hi>England,</hi> nay,
in the Christian World, that are predestinated to
eternal happiness, and to hold the truths necessary
to salvation, as they ought to be held? Indeed one
might make a very odious Parallel betwixt these
Teachers and Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> that would needs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> because they
did not celebrate the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> the same day
they did at <hi>Rome.</hi> Betwixt them and the <hi>Audeans</hi>
that divided from the Christians, and would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
rich Bishops. Betwixt them and the <hi>Donatists,</hi>
that would have no communion with them that had
been ordained by lapsed Bishops, and imagined that
their Society was the true Church, and the well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Spouse, that fed her flock in the South. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them and those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion,
who have so good an opinion of their own Church,
that out of her they do not imagine that any one
can ever be saved. For my part, as much inclined
to Toleration as I am, I cannot for all this perswade
my self, that it ought to be allowed to those that
have so little of it for other men; and who, if they
were Masters, would certainly give but bad quarter
to those that depended upon them. I look upon
these men as disturbers of the State and Church,
and who are doubtlesly animated by a Spirit of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Nay, I can scarce believe, that they are just
such as they say they are; and I should be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
afraid, that very dangerous enemies might be
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:95208:257"/>
hid under colour of these Teachers. Societies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of such persons, would be extream dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
and they could not be suffered without open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gate to disorder, and advancing towards
ones own ruine. There are some of these that are
composed of more reasonable men, but I could wish
they were reasonable enough not to separate from
those of which the Church of <hi>England</hi> is composed.
Especially in the case we are in, they should do all
for a good agreement; and in the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
of affairs, they should understand that
there is nothing but a good re-union, that can
prevent the evils with which <hi>England</hi> is threatned.
For to speak the truth, I do not see that their
Meetings are of any great use, or that one may be
more comforted there, than in the Episcopal
Churches. When I was at <hi>London</hi> almost Five years
ago, I went to several of their private assemblies,
to see what way they took for the instruction of
the people, and the preaching of the Word of
God. But I profess I was not at all edified by it.
I heard one of the most famous <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi>
he preached in a place where there were three men
and three or fourscore women: he had chosen a
Text about the building up the Ruines of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and for the explication of it, he cited <hi>Pliny</hi> and
<hi>Vitruvius</hi> a hundred times, and did not forget to
mention a Proverb in <hi>Italian, Duro con duro non
fa muro.</hi> All this seem'd to me nothing to the
purpose, and very improper for the poor women,
and very far from a Spirit that sought nothing but
the comfort and edification of his hearers. To
cantonize themselves, and make a Schism, to have
the liberty to vent such vanities, is very ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:95208:258"/>
and the people seem very weak to quit their
mutual Assemblies for things that so little deserve
their esteem and preference. I do not think that
any one is obliged to suffer this irregularity. It is
true, that the Assemblies of the <hi>Novatians</hi> were
sometimes suffered at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and
that even the <hi>Donatists</hi> had some kind of liberty in
the first of these places. But they were only stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
and that neither did not indure any long
time; and as there were but few of them,
that is not to be drawn into example. But it is
another case in <hi>England;</hi> and seeing the good of
the State and Church depends absolutely upon the
union of the people in the point of Religion, one
cannot there press an universal union too much.
But it ought to be procured by good means; and
since the Bishops are persons of great experience,
of an extraordinary knowledge, of a true fatherly
zeal and goodness towards their people, I hope
that they will employ themselves in this great
work with all the prudence and charity that are
necessary to the succeeding of such a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
undertaking. You particularly, My Lord,
whose moderation and capacity are acknowledged
by all the World; it looks as if it were a design
reserved for your great Wisdom; and if you do
not succeed, it is clear, that all others will labour
in it but in vain. For my part, I can contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to it where I am, but Vowes and Prayers; and
of these I can protest that I make very sincere ones
every day for the prosperity of the <hi>English</hi> Church;
and that it would please God to order things in such
manner, that all the Protestants of <hi>England</hi> for the
future, might be of one heart and of one soul. I

                  <p>RIen ne vous a deu paroistre si estrange ny si
incivil que mon silence sur la lettre que vous
me fîstes l'honneur de m'escrire il y a environ
trois mois; Il est pourtant vray que je n'ay
rien a me reprocher sur cela, &amp; a fin que vous le croyiez
comme moy, vous voulez bien me permettre de vous
dire comment la chose s'est passée. Quand on m'ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porta
vostre lettre, j'estois retombé dans une grande
&amp; violente fiebvre dont Dieu m'a affligé durant quatre
ou cinq mois, &amp; qui m'a mené jusqu'a deux doits de la
mort. Ie priay un de mes amis, qui estoit alors dans
ma chambre, de l'ouvrir &amp; de me dire le nom de celuy
qui me l'escrivoit, mais il se trouva que vous aviez
oublié de la signer, sur quoy je me l'a fis apporter, pour
voir si je n'en connoistrois point le caractére; Et ce
fut encore inutilement, par ce que jusqu'alors je n'
avois rien veu de vostre main: Cela me fit croire
qu'elle avoit esté escrite par celuy lá mesme qui l'a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voit
apportée, pour m'attrapper dix ou douze sous de
port; car ce petit stratageme est assez commun en cette
ville &amp; aprez cela, je ne me mis pas fort en peine
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:95208:259"/>
de ce qu'elle deviendroit. Elle se conserva pourtant
dans mon cabinet par le plus grand hazard du monde,
&amp; m'estant heureusement tombée sous la main, il y a
deux ou trois jours, je la relus; &amp; l'aiant trouvée
trop sage &amp; trop grave pour avoir esté escrite par un
homme tel que je me l'estois imaginé, je la monstray
à Monsieur Claude qui y reconnut d'abord vostre escri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
&amp; qui me dit que vous en estiez l'Auteur. Ie
pense Monseigneur que cela suffit pour me justifier au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prez
de vous d'un silence, qui bien que je n'en sois
aucunement coupable, ne laisse pas de me donner quelque
espece de confusion. Mais pour venir au contenu de vostre
lettre, je ne vous puis exprimer avec quelle douleur
j'apprens que vos divisions continuent, en un temps au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
il y a des raisons si pressantes de se réünir; Ce
que vous me dites sur tout des escrits que l'on publie
a cette heure, pour faire croire que la communion avec
l' Eglise Anglicane est illégitime, &amp; que les Ministres
ne la peuvent permettre aux particuliers sans crime,
me paroist une chose si deraisonnable en elle mesme,
&amp; si fort à contre-temps, que j'aurois peine a la croire
si elle ne m'estoit attestée par une personne de vostre
mérite &amp; de vostre poids. Vous savez bien Monseig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur
quels sont &amp; quels ont toujours esté mes senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
sur cela, &amp; la maniére dont j'en uzay il y a
deux ans dans mon voiage d' Angleterre, en fréquentant
vos assemblées, &amp; en preschant mesme dans un trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peau
qui est sous la Iurisdiction de l' Eglise Anglicane,
monstre assez que je suis bien éloigné de croire que sa
communion soit illégitime; Et cela mesme prouve d'une
maniére bien évidente, que mon sentiment a cet égard
est celuy de nos Eglises, parce qu'il n'est pas imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
que j'eusse voulu faire, sans nécessité, une chose
qui m'eust attiré l'indignation de mes fréres, &amp; qui,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:95208:260"/>
a mon retour, m'eust expose à leurs reproches ou a leurs
censures. Pleust a Dieu, Monseigneur, que tout ce
qu'il y a de Chrestiens égarez dans le monde vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lussent
recevoir vostre Réformation, que je répandrois
de bon coeur tout ce que j'ay de sang pour leur procurer
un si grand bien. Et que je suis asseuré de la joye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresme
avec laquelle nos Eglises entreroient dans leur
Communion, Si en estant dans la pureté de vos senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
pour les dogmes, ils ne differoient plus d'avec nous
que par des Surplis, par des Cérémonies innocentes, &amp;
par quelque diversité d' Ordres dans le gouvernement
de l' Eglise. Et cela Monseigneur vous fait assez
comprendre, ce que j'ay a respondre a vostre seconde
question. Car puis que l' Eglise Anglicane est une vé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Eglise de nostre Seigneur, Puis que son Culte
&amp; ses Dogmes sont purs, &amp; n'ont rien de contraire a
lu parole de Dieu, Et puis que quand la Reformation
y a esté receüe, elle y a esté receüe avec l'Episcopat. Et
en y establissant la Liturgie &amp; les Cérémonies qui y
sont aujourdhuy en uzage, il est sans doute du devoir
de tous les Réformez de Vostre Royaume de se tenir in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séparablement
unis a Cette Eglise; Et ceux qui ne le
font pas, sous ombre qu'ils desireroient, plus de simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cité
dans les Cérémonies, &amp; moins d'inegálité entre
les Ministres commettent asseurément un tres grand
péché. Car le schisme est le plus redoutable mal qui
puisse arriver à l' Eglise; Et pour l'éviter la charité
Chrestienne oblige tous les gens de bien a supporter
en leurs fréres des choses bien moins supportables que
ne le doivent paroistre celles dont il s'agit, aux yeux
de ceux lá mesmes qui les ont le plus en aversion:
Et c'estoit lá si bien le sentiment de nostre Grand &amp;
Excellent Calvin que dans son traitté de la necessité
de la Réformation il ne fait point de difficulté de dire,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:95208:260"/>
Que s'il se trouvoit des gens assez deraisonnables
pour refuser la Communion d'une Eglise pure dans son
culte &amp; dans ses Dogmes, &amp; pour ne pas se soumettré
avec respect a son Gouvernement, sous ombre qu'elle
auroit retenu l' Episcopat conditionné comme le vostre,
il n'y auroit point de censure ny de rigueur de disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline

fit paroistre l' Eglise Anglicane par la bouche de trois ou

restablissement de sa Majesté Britannique, et qu'il ne
tint qu'a quelques Ministres de ceux qu'on appelle Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriens

qu'il en soit je prie Dieu de tout mon coeur qu'il ouvre
les yeux des uns pour leur faire connoistre la foiblesse
des raisons sur lesquelles ils fondent une séparation si
affligeante, Et qu'il conserve et qu'il augmente de plus

dont ils ont besoin pour travailler heureusement a une
réünion qui réjonira les hommes et les Anges, et qui
attirera mille bénédictions de la terre et du Ciel sur

Monseigneur que je ne servis pas consolable si je voiois
qu'on ne fist pas au moins quelque nouvel effort pour

Second Letter.</head>
                  <head type="sub">From Monsieur de L' Angle one of the present
Preachers of the Reformed Church meeting at
Charenton near Paris, upon the same subject.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>NOthing may seem so strange and so uncivil
to you, as my silence upon your <hi>Letter</hi> you
did me the honour to write me about
three months ago. But yet it is true
that in this case I have nothing to blame my self
for; and that you may believe it, as well as I, you
will give me leave to tell you how the matter hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.
When your Letter was brought me, I was
relapsed into a great and violent Fever, with which
God has afflicted me for the space of four or five
months, and which has brought me very near the
grave; I prayed one of my friends, which was then
in my Chamber, to open the Letter, and to tell me
the name of him that wrote it; but it chanced that
you had forgotten to subscribe it, upon which I
made it be brought to me, to see if I did not know
the Character; but it was to no purpose, because
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:95208:263"/>
till then I had not seen any thing of your hand.
This made me believe that it had been written by
the same man that brought it, to get ten or twelve
<hi>Sons</hi> for the carriage; for that little stratagem is
common enough in this Town. After this, I did
not much trouble my self what became of it; but
yet it was preserved in my Cabinet by the greatest
chance in the world; and being happily fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my hands two or three days since, I read it over
again; and having found it too prudent and grave
to have been written by such a one as I had imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
I shewed it to <hi>Monsieur Claude,</hi> who present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knew your hand, and told me that you were
the Author of it. I think, my Lord, this is enough
to excuse me to you, for a silence, for which though
I am not any way faulty, yet I cannot choose but
be something ashamed.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the contents of your Letter; I
cannot express to you with how much grief I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that your divisions continue, at a time in
which there are such pressing reasons for being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united.
Above all, that which you tell me of
writings that are at this time published, to make
men believe that Communion with the Church of
<hi>England</hi> is unlawful, and that the Ministers cannot
permit it to private persons without sinning, seems
to me a thing so unreasonable in it self, and so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unseasonable now, that I should scarce believe it,
if it were not attested by a person of your merit
and consideration. My Lord, you know well what
my sentiments are, and always have been in this
matter; and the way which I used two years ago,
when I was in <hi>England,</hi> in frequenting your as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
and preaching too in a Congregation that
is under the jurisdiction of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                     <pb n="421" facs="tcp:95208:263"/>
sufficiently shews that I am very far from belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that her Communion is unlawful. And this
also proves very evidently that my opinion in this
matter is the same that is holden by our Churches;
because it is not imaginable that I would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any necessity, have done a thing which would
have drawn the displeasure of my Brethren upon
me, and which at my return would have expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
my self to be blamed, if not to be censured by
them. My Lord, I would to God that all the
mistaken Christians that are in the world would
receive your Reformation; I would with all my
heart spend all the blood I have to procure them
so great a good. And I am sure with what an
exceeding Joy our Churches would enter into their
Communion, if being pure in their opinions for
Doctrine, they differed no more from us, than
by Surplices, and innocent Ceremonies; and some
diversity of Orders in the Government of the
Church.</p>
                  <p>And by this, my Lord, you may perceive what
I have to answer to your second question. For
since the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a true Church of
our Lord; since her Worship and Doctrines are
pure, and have nothing in them contrary to the
word of God; and since that when the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was there received, it was received together
with Episcopacy, and with the establishment of the
Liturgy, and Ceremonies, which are there in use
at this day; it is without doubt the duty of all
the Reformed of your Realm, to keep themselves
inseparably united to the Church. And those that
do not do this, upon pretence that they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
more simplicity in that Ceremonies, and less
of inequality among the Ministers, do certainly
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:95208:264"/>
commit a very great sin. For Schism is the most
formidable evil that can befal the Church: and
for the avoiding of this, Christian charity obliges
all good men to bear with their Brethren in some
things much less tolerable than those, of which the
dispute is, ought to seem, even in the eyes of those
that have the most aversion for them. And this
was so much the opinion of our great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

the Reformation he makes no difficulty to say;

refuse the Communion of a Church that was pure
in its Worship and Doctrine, and not to submit
himself with respect to its Government, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

                  <p>But, my Lord, although the first Authors of the
Separation, which troubles you, be extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to blame, and though those that continue it,
and strengthen it, by their unreasonable and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
Writings, be extreamly so too; it is certain
yet that among the multitude that follows them,
there is a very great number of good-men, whose
faith is pure, and whose piety is sincere, and who
remain separate from you only because their sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
is surprized, and because they have been
frightned with the bugbear words of <hi>Tyranny, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
Limbs of Antichrist</hi> which are continually
beaten into their ears. I rank these with those
weak ones who said they were not of the Body;
and of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> said they were of the Body
for all that. And it seems to me that the good
and charitable Bishops, such as you, ought to say
of them, though in something a different sense, as
<hi>Optatus Milevitanus</hi> said of the <hi>Donatists</hi> of his
time, <hi>Si Collegium Episcopale nolunt nobiscum habere,

Lord, do all that possibly you can to bring them
back to their duty by sweetness and charity, which
is only able to do great things on these occasions.
For men, who have always something of pride, do
commonly oppose every thing that seems to them
to act by bare Authority only: but they scarce
ever fail to yield themselves up to forbearance and
condescension. <hi>Mansuetus homo cordis est medicus.</hi>

I do not pretend, My Lord, to thrust my self in to
give you any particular advice in this case; you that
see things near at hand, and that have a heart deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected with Christian Charity, will judge bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than any man, what remedies are the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for so great an evil; and I am sure that if there
were nothing wanting to cure it, but the a staining
from some expressions, the quitting some Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and the changing the colour of some habits,
you would resolve to do that, and something more
difficult than that, with great pleasure. And I
think I have read in some part of the <hi>Vindiciae</hi> of
Mr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the means of re-union, the first year that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
was restored; and that nothing hindered the
matter from going farther, but some of those Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
they call Presbyterians. However it be, I pray
God with all my heart, that he would open the
eyes of the one to make them see the weakness of
the reasons upon which they ground such an afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Separation; and that he would preserve, and
increase more and more in the other, that piety,
that zeal, and that charity which they have
need of for the happy proceeding to a re-union,
which will rejoice men and Angels, and bring
down a thousand blessings of Heaven and Earth
upon those that shall contribute the most unto
it. And I assure you, My Lord, I should be

de vouloir bien que je vous dise ma pensée sur le different
qui vous trouble depuis long-tems, entre ceux qu'on ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle

Quoy que je m'en sois deja diverses fois expliquè &amp; par
des Lettres que j'ay faites sur ce sujet à plusieurs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonnes,
&amp; dans mon livre mesme de la Defense de la

dans cette occasion, comme je feray toujours en toute

vous diray pas simplement ma pensée particuliere, mais

                     <pb n="428" facs="tcp:95208:267"/>
Premierement donc, Monseigneur, nous sommes si
fort éloignez de croire qu'on ne puisse en bonne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
vivre sous vostre discipline, &amp; sous vostre Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
Episcopal, que dans nostre pratique ordinaire
nous ne faisons nulle difficultè, ni de donner nos chaires,
ni de commettre le soin de nos troupeaux à des Ministres
receus &amp; ordinez par Messieurs vos Evesques, comme il
se pourroit justifier par un assez grand nombre d'exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
&amp; anciens, &amp; recens, &amp; depuis peu Mr. <hi>Duples<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
ordinè par Monsieur l' Evesque de <hi>Lincoln</hi> à esté esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli,
&amp; appellè dans une Eglise de cette Province, &amp;
Monsieur <hi>Wicart,</hi> que vous, Monseigneur, avez receu
au S. Ministere nous fit l'honneur il-n'y-a que quelques
mois de Prescher à <hi>Charenton</hi> à l'edification univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selle
detout nostre troupeau. Ainsi ceux qui nous impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
à cet égard des sentimens éloignez de la paix &amp; de
la concorde Chretienne, nous font assurement inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
                  <p>Ie dis la paix &amp; la concorde Chretienne, car,
Monseigneur, nous croyons que l'obligation à conserver
cette paix &amp; cette concorde fraternelle, qui fait l'unité
exterieure de l'eglise, est d'une necessitè si indispensable
que S. <hi>Paul</hi> n'a pas fait difficultè de la joindre avec l'u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nité
interieure d'une mesme foy, &amp; d'une mesme rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
non seulement comme deux choses qui ne doi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
jamais estre separées, mais aussi comme deux choses
dependantes l'une de l'autre, parce que si l'unité exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eure
est comme la fille de l'interieure, elle en est aussi la
conservatrice. <hi>Cheminez,</hi> dit il <hi>Ephes. 4. comme il
est convenable à la vocation dont vous estes appellez,
avec toute humilitè, &amp; douceur, avec un esprit pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
supportant l'un l'autre en charité. Estant
soigneux de garder l'unitè de l'esprit par la lien de la
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:95208:267"/>
paix.</hi> D'un cotè il fait dependre cette charitè frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelle,
qui nous joint les uns avec les autres, de nostre
commune vocation, &amp; de l'autre il nous enseigne qu'un
des principaux moyens de conserner en son entier cette
commune vocation qu'il appelle l'unitè de l'esprit, est de
garder entre nous la paix. Selon la premiere de ces
maximes nous ne pouvons avoir de paix, ni de Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Ecclesiastique avec ceux qui ont tellement degenerè
de la vocation Chretienne qu'on ne peut plus reconnoitre
en eux une veritable &amp; salutaire foy, principalement lors
qu' à des erreurs mortelles ils ajoutent la tyrannie de
l'ame, &amp; qu'ils voulent contraindre la conscience, en
imposant la necessitè de croire ce qu'ils croyent &amp; de
pratiquer ce qu'ils pratiquent. Car en ce cas le fondement
&amp; la veritable cause de la communion exterieure n'estant
plus, la communion exterieure cesse aussi de droit, &amp;
il-n'y-en peut plus avoir de legitime. Selon la seconde
maxime nous ne croyons pas qu'une simple difference de
gouvernement, ou de discipline, ni mesme un difference
de ceremonies innocentes de leur nature, soient un sujet
suffisant pour rompre le sacrè lien de la communion.
C'est pourquoy nos Eglises ont toûjours regardè &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderè
la vostre, non seulement comme une soeur, mais
comme une soeur aisuée pour qui nous devons avoir des
tendresses accompagnées de respect &amp; de veneration, &amp;
pour qui nous présentons sans cesse à Dieu des voeux tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardens.
Nous n'entrons point dans la comparaison de
vostre ordre, aver celuy sous lequel nous vivons. Nous
savons qu'il-n'y-en a, ni n'y-en peut avoir aucun entre
les hommes, qui par nostre corruption naturelle, ne soit
sujet à des inconveniens, le nostre à les siens comme le
vostre, &amp; l'un &amp; l'autre sans doute ayant leurs avanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
&amp; leurs desavantages à divers égards, <hi>alternis
vincut &amp; vincuntur.</hi> Il nous suffit de savoir que la
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:95208:268"/>
mesme Providence Divine qui par une necessitè indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,
&amp; par la conjoncture des choses, mit au com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
de la Reformation nos Eglises sous celuy du
Presbyterat, à mis la vostre sous celuy de l' Episcopat, &amp;
que comme nous sommes assurez que vous ne meprisez
point nostre simplicitè, nous ne devons pas aussi nous
élever contre vostre dignitè. Ainsi, Monseigneur, nous
desapprouvons entierement, &amp; voyons avec douleur, de
certeines extremitez où se jettent quelques uns de part
&amp; d'autre, les uns regardant l' Episcopat comme un
ordre si absolument necessaire que sans luy il-n'y peut
avoir ni de societè Ecclesiastique, ni de legitime vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ni d'esperance de salut, &amp; les autres le regardant
avec indignation comme un reste d' Antichristianisme.
Ce sont également des chaleurs &amp; des excés qui ne
viennent point de celuy qui nous appelle, &amp; qui pechent
contre les loix de la sagesse &amp; de la charité.</p>
                  <p>Voylà, Monseigneur, nos veritables &amp; sinceres sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timens
communs, pour ce qui vous regarde, &amp; puisque
vous desirez que je descende un peu plus particuliere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
à l'état où se trouve vostre propre Eglise, par les
divisions intestines qui la travaillent, Permettez moy
que je ne vous dise mes pensées qu'en vous expliquant mes
souhaits, &amp; les desirs de mon coeur, sur une chose aussi
importante que l'est celle là. Ie souhaiterois donc de
toute mon ame que ceux qui sont allez jusqu' à ce point
que de songer à rompre les liens exterieurs, &amp; la depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
mutuelle de vos troupeaux, pour donner à chaque
Eglise particuliere une espece de souveraigntè de gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement,
considerassent bien si ce qu'ils prétendent
faire n'est pas directement contraire à l'esprit du Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianisme
qui est un esprit d'union, &amp; de societè, &amp;
non de division. Qu'ils considerassent que sous prétexte
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:95208:268"/>
que le principe des Reformez est d'avoir en horreur la
domination humaine sur la foy, &amp; sur la conscience,
comme une chose destructive de la Religion, il ne faut
pourtant pas ni rejetter tout frein de discipline, ni se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coüer
tout joug de Gouvernement, ni se priver des se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
que nous pouvous tirer de l'union generale pour
nous affermir dans la vraye foy, &amp; dans la vraye pietè.
Qu'ils considerassent enfin que la mesme raison qui leur
fait desirer l' Independence des troupeaux, peut estre
aussi employée pour établir l' Independance des personnes
dans chaque troupeau. Car un troupeau n'a pas plus de
droit de vouloir estre Independant des autres troupeaux,
qu'une personne en auroit de vouloir estre Independante
des autres personnes. Or ce seroit' aneantir toute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
jetter l' Eglise entant qu'en nous seroit dans
une horrible confusion; &amp; exposer l'heritage du Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur
à l'opprobre de ses adversaries.</p>
                  <p>Pour ce qui regarde ceux qu'on appelle parmy vous
Presbyteriens, comme je suis persuadè qu'ils ont de la
lumiere, de la sagesse, &amp; du Zele, je souhaiterois aussi
de tout mon coeur qu'ils gardassent plus de mesure dans
le scandale qu'ils croyent avoir autrefois receu de l'ordre
Episcopal, &amp; qu'ils distinguassent les personnes d'aves
le Ministere. Les personnes qui occupent les charges
non seulement ont leurs defauts, mais il peut mesme
quelquefois arriver que les plus saintes, &amp; les plus emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentes
charges soient possedées par des méchans, &amp; en ce
cas la raison &amp; la pietè voulent également qu'on ne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonde
pas le Ministere avec le Ministre. A present que
Dieu par sa grace a ôtè ce scandale de devant leurs
yeux, &amp; qu'il leur a fait voir dans les personnes de
Messieurs les Evesques de la pietè, du Zele, &amp; de la
fermetè, pour la conservation de la Religion, j'espere
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:95208:269"/>
que cela mesme ne contribuera pas peu à l'adoucissement
des esprits. D'ailleurs je souhaiterois qu'il leur plust de
considerer que si dans le Gouvernement Episcopal il-y-à
des inconveniens facheux, comme je ne doute pas
qu'il-n'y-en-ayt, il-y-en-à aussi &amp; de tres-facheux dans
le Presbyterien, comme je l'ay deja dit. Nul ordre dont
l'exercice est entre les mains des hommes n'en est ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt,
l'egalitè à ses vices, &amp; ses excés à craindre, de
mesme que la superioritè. Le plus sur &amp; le plus sage
n'est donc pas de voltiger de l'une à l'autre, ni de ris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
de faire un ébranlement general, sur l'esperance
d'estre mieux, quand mesme on seroit en autoritè &amp; en
pouvoir de le faire. La prudence, la justice, &amp; la cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritè
Chretienne ne permettent pas d'en venir à ces éclat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes
&amp; dangereuses extremitez, pour une simple dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
de Gouvernment. Le plus sur, &amp; le plus sage
est de tacher d'apporter quelque temperament pour évi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ou pour diminuer autant qu'il se peut les inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens
qu'on apprehende, &amp; non de recourir à des reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
violens.</p>
                  <p>Ie ne craindray pas d'appeller de ce nom celuy de
faire des assemblées à part, de se separer des assemblées
communes, &amp; de se soustraire de vostre gouvernement.
Il-n'y-a personne qui ne voye que ce seroit un veritable
schisme, qui en luy-mesme &amp; de sa nature ne peut ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais
estre qu'odieux à Dieu, &amp; aux hommes, &amp; dont
les auteurs, &amp; les protecteurs ne sauroient eviter qu'ils
ne rendent conte devant le Tribunal de nostre commun
Maitre. Quand S. <hi>Paul</hi> nous a defendu <hi>de delaisser
nostre commune assemblée,</hi> il a non seulement condam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nè
ceux qui ne s'y trouvent point en demeurant dans
leur particulier, mais ceux aussi sans doute qui en font
d'autres opposees aux communes, car c'est rompre le lien
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:95208:269"/>
de la charitè Chretienne qui ne nous joint pas seulement
avec quelques uns de nos freres, mais avec tous nos
freres, pour recevoir d'eux de l'edification, &amp; pour leur
en donner de nostre part, en vivant ensemble dans une
mesme societè. El il ne servirot de rien de pretexter
que la conscience resiste à se trouver dans des assemblées
qui se font sous un Gouvernement qu'on n'approuve pas,
&amp; que ce seroit approuver exterieurement, ce que l'on
condamne interieurement. Car outre qu'il faudroit bien
examiner la question si ces resistances ne viennent pas
d'une conscience trompée, par un jugement precipitè,
puisque les plus gens de bien sont souvent sujets à se for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
de tels scrupules qui au fond ne sont pas tout à fait
legitimes. Outre cela, il faut distinguer trois sortes de
choses, les unes que la conscience approuve, &amp; recoit, &amp;
ausquelles elle acquiesce pleinement, les autres qu'elle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
comme insupportables, &amp; comme destructives de
la gloire de Dieu, de la vraye foy, on de la vraye Pieté,
&amp; de l'esperance du salut, &amp; les autres enfin qui ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennent
le milieu, c'est-a-dire qu'on n'approuve pas à la
veritè pleinement, mais qu'on ne croit pourtant pas mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telles
à la vraye pietè &amp; au salut, en un mot qu'on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
comme des taches &amp; des infirmitez supportables.
I'avoüe que quand on trouve dans des assemblées des
choses de ce second ordre, ou que la conscience les juge
telles, on ne peut y assister, &amp; toute la question se reduit
à savoir, si l'on ne se trompe pas, sur quoy il faut bien
prendre garde de ne pas faire de jugemens temeraires.
Mais de s'imaginer qu'on ne puisse en bonne conscience
assister à des assemblées, que lors qu'on y approuve plei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement
&amp; generalement toutes choses, c'est assurement
ne pas connoitre ni l'usage de la charitè, ni les loix de
la societè Chretienne. Ce principe renverseroit toutes
les Eglises, car je ne say s'il-y-en a aucune dont le Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:95208:270"/>
la Discipline, la forme exterieure, les usa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
&amp; les pratiques soient dans une telle perfection,
qu'il-n'y-ayt absolument rien à redire, &amp; quoy qu'il en
soit comme les jugemens des hommes sont fort diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,
ce seroit ouvrir la porte à des separations conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuelles,
&amp; abolir les assemblées. Il est donc constant
que la conscience n'oblige point à se soustraire des assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blées,
mais qu'au contraire elle nous oblige de nous y
tenir attachez, lors que les choses qui nous y choquent
sont supportables, &amp; qu'elles n'empechent pas l'efficace
salutaire de la parole, du culte divin, &amp; des Sacremens.
Et c'est à la faveur de ce support de la charitè qu'est
couverte l'assistance que nous donnons à des choses que
nous n'approuvons pas entierement. Voyez ce que S. <hi>Paul</hi>
dit à ses <hi>Philippiens,</hi> chap. 3. <hi>Si vous sentez quelque

d'une mesme regle, &amp; sentons une mesme chose.</hi>
Cela est bien éloiguè de dire, des que vous aurez le
moindre sentiment contraire separez vous, la conscience
ne vous permet pas de demeurer ensemble. <hi>Consilia
separationis,</hi> dit S. <hi>Augustin</hi> contre <hi>Parmenian, Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
sunt &amp; perniciosa, &amp; plus perturbant infirmos
bonos, quàm corrigant animosos malos.</hi> Quels
funestes effets ne produiroit pas une telle separation si
elle s'établissoit au milieu de vous? De la maniere
que les esprits des hommes sont faits, on verroit bien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tôt
naitre de là la difference des interets, celle des partys,
celle des sentimens à l'égard mesme de la societè civile,
la hayne mutuelle, &amp; toutes les autres tristes suites que
la division, qui n'est plus temperée par la charitè, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit
naturellement. Ie laisse à part le scandale qu'en
recevroient toutes les Eglises reformées de l' Europe, la
joye qu'en auroient leurs adversaires, &amp; les avantages
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:95208:270"/>
qu'ils en retireroient, qui selon toutes les apparences
ne seroient pas petits. I'ay trop bonne opinion de ces
Messieurs qui croyent que la Gouvernement Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien
est preferable à l' Episcopal, pour n'estre pas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suadè
qu'ils font de sages &amp; de serieuses reflexions sur
toutes ces choses, &amp; sur tant d'autres que leurs lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres
leur fournissent, &amp; que la conscience, &amp; l'amour
de la Religion Protestante les empechera toujours de
rien faire, qui puisse estre blamè devant Dieu, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

aucun parmy eux, qui regarde ni vostre Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopat,
ni vostre Discipline, ni quelques Ceremonies
que vous observez, comme des taches &amp; des erreurs
capitales, qui empechent qu'on ne puisse faire son sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut,
&amp; mesme avec facilitè dans vos Assemblées &amp;

pour le general de la Religion ne consentiront jamais
qu'ils se détachent de vous.</p>
                  <p>Mais, Monseigneur, puisque vous m'avez mis la
plume à la main sur ce sujet, Pardonnez je vous sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
à ma libertè si elle và jusqu'à vous dire ce que je
croy que vous aussi devez faire de vostre part. I'espere
donc que dans ces occasions que Dieu vous presente vous

incredulez que vous aves de la pietè, du zele, &amp; de
la crainte de Dieu, &amp; que vous estez de dignes ouv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers,

&amp; je ne doute pas que vous ne poussiez vostre

vocation jusqu'an bout. Mais outre cela, Monseigneur,
j'espere que vous ne defaudrez point aux devoirs de la
charitè, &amp; de l'esprit de paix, &amp; que quand il ne
s'agria que de quelques temperamens, ou de quelques
Ceremonies qui servent d'achoppement, &amp; qui en elles
mesmes ne sont rien en comperaison d'une entiere reü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
de vostre Eglise sous vostre saint Ministere, vous
ferez voir que vous aymez l'Epouse de vostre Maitre
plus que vous mesmes, &amp; que ce n'est pas tant de vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre
grandeur, &amp; de vostre dignitè Ecclesiastique que
vous desirez tirer vostre gloire &amp; vostre joye, que de
vos vertus Pastorales, &amp; des soins ardens que vous
avez de vos troupeaux. I'espere aussi que ceux que
vous avez choisis, &amp; appellez au S. Ministere, &amp;
ceux que desormais vous y appellerez avec un prudent
discernement, reglez non seulement par la donceur,
mais aussi par la severitè de la Discipline, quand la se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritè
sera necessaire, marcheront sur vos traces, &amp; sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ront
heureusement l'exemple que vous leur donnerez,
pour estre eux-mesmes en exemple, &amp; en edification
aux Eglises qui leur sont commises. Ie finis, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seigneur,
par des prieres tres-ardentes que je présente
à Dieu de tout mon coeur, afin qu'il luy plaise de vous
conserver à jamais le flamebeau de son Evangile, de
repandre sur tout le corps de vostre Ministere, une
abondante mesure de son onction &amp; de sa benediction
celeste, dont celle de l'ancien <hi>Aaron</hi> n'estoit que l'om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,

                  <p>MOnsieur de L'<hi>Angle</hi> having given me the Letter
which you have been pleased to write me, I
was surprized to see by that, that you had done me
the honour to write me another which I have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and to which I had not failed to make an
answer. You do me a great deal of honour to desire
that I should tell you my thoughts of the difference
that has troubled you so long, betwixt those they
call <hi>Episcopal,</hi> and those they name <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
Although I have already explained my self about this
divers tims, both by Letters which I have written
upon this Subject to several persons, and in my Book
too of the Defence of the Reformation, where speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the distinction betwixt the Bishop and the
Priest, I have said expresly, That I do not blame
those that observe it as a thing very ancient, and that
I would not that any one should make it an occasion
of quarrel in those places where it is established,
<hi>pag.</hi> 366. And though I otherwaies know my self
sufficiently not to believe that my opinion should be
much considered, I will not forbear to assure you
upon this occasion, as I shall always do upon any
other, of my Christian esteem, my respect, and my
obedience. This I shall do the rather because I shall
not simply tell you my private thoughts, but the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the generality of our Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="440" facs="tcp:95208:273"/>
First then, my Lord, we are so very far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that a man cannot live with a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
under your Discipline and under your Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Government, that in our ordinary practice we
make no difficulty, neither to bestow our Chairs,
nor to commit the care of our Flocks to Ministers
received, and ordained by my Lords the Bishops;
as might be justified by a great number enought of
Examples both old and new: And a little while
since Mr. <hi>Duplessis</hi> that was ordained by my Lord
Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> has been established and called in
a Church of this Province. And Monsieur <hi>Wicart,</hi>
whom you, my Lord, received to the Holy Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
did us the honour, but some months agoe, to
preach at <hi>Charenton</hi> to the general edification of our
Flock. So that they who in this respect do impute
unto us any opinions distant from peace, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
concord, do certainly do us wrong.</p>
                  <p>I say Peace and Christian concord: for, my Lord,
we believe that the obligation to preserve this Peace,
and this Brotherly concord, which make up the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
unity of the Church, is of a necessity so indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable,
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> has made no difficulty to join
it with the internal unity of the same Faith, and the
same Regeneration; not onely as two things which
ought never to be separated, but likewise as two
things depending the one upon the other; because
if the external unity be as it were the Daughter of
the internal, she is likewise the preserver of it.
<hi>Walk,</hi> says he, Ephes. 4. <hi>worthy of the calling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness,
with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;
Endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:95208:273"/>
of peace.</hi> On the one side he makes this brotherly
love, which joins us one with another, to depend
upon our common vocation; and on the other side
he teaches us that one of the principal means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
our common vocation intire, which he calls the
unity of the spirit, is to keep peace among our selves.
According to the first of these maximes we cannot
have peace, or Ecclesiastical communion with those
that have so degenerated from the Christian vocation,
that one cannot perceive in them a true and saving
Faith; especially when with mortal errours they
join tyranny over the Soul, and that they will force
the Conscience, by imposing a necessity to believe
that which they believe, and to practise that which
they practise. For in this case the foundation and
true cause of external communion being no more,
the external communion to its self ceases of right,
and there is not any that is lawfull to be had any
more with such. According to the second maxime
we do not believe that a single difference of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or discipline, nor even a difference of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
innocent in their own nature is a sufficient occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to break the sacred bond of Communion.
Wherefore our Churches have always looked upon
and considered yours, not onely as a Sister, but as
an Elder Sister, for which we ought to have a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
accompanied with respect, and veneration, and
for which we do present most ardent prayers unto
God without ceasing. We do not enter into the
comparison of your Order, with that under which
we live. We know that there is not neither can
there be any amongst men, which by reason of our
natural corruption is not subject to inconveniencies,
ours has hers, as well as yours; and the one and the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:95208:274"/>
other without doubt have their advantages, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages
in divers respects: <hi>alternis vincunt, &amp;
vincuntur.</hi> It is enough for us to know that the
same Divine Providence which by an indispensable
necessity, and by the conjuncture of affairs, did at
the beginning of the Reformation put our Churches
under that of the Presbytery, has put yours under
that of the Episcopacy; and as we are assured that
you do not despise our simplicity, so neither ought
we to oppose our selves against your preeminence.
So that, my Lord, we utterly disapprove and see
with grief, certain extremes whereinto some of the
one side, and the other do cast themselves. The
one looking upon Episcopacy as an order so absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary, that without it there can be no Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
society, nor lawfull vocation, nor hope of
Salvation; and the other looking upon it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
as a rellque of Antichristianism. These
are equally heats and excesses which do not come
from him that calls us, and which do offend against
the laws of wisedom and charity.</p>
                  <p>These, my Lord, are our true and sincere common
opinions. For what concerns you, since you desire
that I would descend a little more particularly into
the state that your own Church is in, by reason of
the intestine divisions that trouble it; give me leave
not to tell you my thoughts, without declaring my
wishes, and the desires of my heart, upon a matter
so important as this is. I could wish then with all
my sould that those that are gone so far as this point,
to think to break the external bonds, and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
dependance of your Flocks, to give every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church a kind of sovereignty of government,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:95208:274"/>
would consider well whether that they pretend to
doe be not directly contrary to the spirit of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
which is a spirit of union, and society, and
not of division. That they would consider that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretence that the principle of the Reformed
was to abhor men's domineering over Faith, and
Conscience, as a thing destructive of Religion, we
ought not for all that to reject the bridle of Discipline,
nor to shake off the whole yoke of Government,
nor deprive our selves of the succours we might draw
out of a general Union, for to strengthen us in the
true Faith, and in true Piety. That they would
consider, in fine, that the same reason which makes
them desire the Independency of the Flocks, may be
likewise imployed to establish the Independency of
the persons in every Flock. For a Flock has no
more right to desire to be Independent upon other
Flocks, than a person might have to desire to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
upon other persons. But this would be
to bring all discipline to nothing, to throw the
Church, as much as in us lies, into a horrible confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and to expose the heritage of the Lord to the
reproach of its adversaries.</p>
                  <p>For what concerns those which amongst you they
call Presbyterians, as I am perswaded that they have
light, and wisedom, and zeal, so I could wish with
all my heart, that they would observe more modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the scandal they believe they have heretofore
received from the Episcopal Order, and that they
would distinguish the Persons from the Ministry.
The persons that possess the places have not onely
their faults, but it may happen too sometimes that
the most holy, and most eminent places may be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:95208:275"/>
by wicked men; and in that case reason and
peity do equally require that we should not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the Ministry with the Minister. At present
that God by his grace has taken away this scandal
from before their eyes, and made them see piety,
zeal, and constancy for the preservation of Religion
in the persons of the Bishops, I hope that this will not
a little contribute to the sweetning of their spirits.
Besides, I could wish that they would be pleased to
consider that if there be some unpleasant inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in the Episcopal Government, as I do not doubt
but there are, there are too some very unpleasant
ones in the Presbyterian, as I have said already. No
order whose execution is in the hands of men, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from them; an equality has its faults and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
to be feared, as well as a superiority. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not the most safe and wise way to leap from
the one to the other, nor to hazard the making a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
concussion, upon the hopes of being better,
though one should be in authority and power to doe
it. Christian prudence, justice and charity do not
permit us to proceed to such daring and dangerous
extremes, for a single difference of Government. It
is most safe and wise to indeavour to provide some
kind of temper to avoid, or to lessen as much as may
be, the inconveniencies that are feared, and not
have recourse to violent remedies.</p>
                  <p>I shall not be afraid to give that name to the
holding of assemblies apart, and separating from the
publick assemblies, and withdrawing themselves from
under your government. There is no man that does
not see that this would be real schism, which in it
self and of its own nature cannot choose but be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:95208:275"/>
odious to God and men, and of which the
Authours and Patrons cannot avoid the rendring an
account before the Tribunal of our common Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> forbad us to forsake the
assembling of our selves together, he did not onely
condemn those that did not come thither, but stayed
at home; but those too without doubt that held
other assemblies in opposition to the publick ones.
For this is to break the bond of Christian charity
which does not onely join us with some of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
but with all our brethren, to receive from
them, and to give them edification by living toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the same communion. And it would be to no
purpose to pretend that our conscience did oppose
our being present at those assemblies that are held
under a Government that we do not approve; and
that that would be to approve outwardly, what we
inwardly condemn. For besides that it would be
necessary to examin well the question, whether these
oppositions do not proceed from a conscience mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by a precipitate judgment; since that the best
men are often subject to fram to themselves such
scruples, as are not altogether lawfull at the bottom.
Further than this it is necessary to distingush three
kinds of things; the one those which the conscience
approves, and admits of, and in which it does fully
acquiesce; the other which she looks upon as into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
and destructive to the glory of God, and
the true faith, or true piety, and the hopes of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and others lastly which are between these,
that is to say such as we do not fully approve as to
the truth, but yet we do not believe them mortal
enemies to true piety and salvation; in a word such
as we look upon as stains, and tolerable infirmities.
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:95208:276"/>
I affirm that when we find things of this second rank
in any Assemblies, or those which the Conscience
judges such, we cannot be present there; and the
whole question will be reduced to this, to know,
whether we be not mistaken, where we ought to
take good heed that we do not make a rash judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But to imagine that we cannot with a good
Conscience be present at Assemblies, but onely when
we do fully and generally approve of all things in
them, it is certainly not to know neither the use of
charity, nor the laws of Christian society. This
principle would overturn all Churches, for I cannot
tell whether there be any, whose government, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
outward form, usages, and practices be of
such perfection, that there is nothing at all in them
to blame; and however it be, as the judgments of
men are very different, this would be to open the
gate to continual separations, and to abolish all As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.
It is therefore certain that Conscience does
not oblige us to withdraw from the Assemblies, but
on the contrary it obliges us to join with them,
when the things that offend us are tolerable, and do
not hinder the salutary efficacy of the Word, of the
Divine Worship, and of the Sacraments. 'Tis the
favour of this charitable patience that justifies our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
present at those things which we do not perfectly
approve. See what St. <hi>Paul</hi> says to the <hi>Philippians,</hi>
chap. 3. <hi>If in any thing ye be otherways minded, God
shall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheless, whereto
we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule,
let us mind the same thing.</hi> This is very far from say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as soon as ye have the least contrary sentiment
separate your selves, Conscience will not allow you
to remain together. <hi>Consilia separationis,</hi> says St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>
                     <pb n="447" facs="tcp:95208:276"/>
against <hi>Parmenian, inania sunt &amp; perniciosa,
&amp; plus perturbant infirmos bonos, quam corrigant ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosos
malos.</hi> What deadly effects would not such a
separation produce if it were established amongst you?
As the dispositions of men are, one should quickly
see to spring from hence a difference of interests, of
parties, of opinions, even in respect of the civil so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
mutual hatred, and all the other sad conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
which a division not tempered with charity
does naturally produce. I let alone the scandal
which all the Reformed Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> would
receive by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> which their Adversaries would
have, and we advantages which they would draw
from it, which in all appearance would not be small.
I have too good an opinion of those Gentlemen who
believe that the Presbyterian Government is to be
preferred before the Episcopal, not to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that they make wise and serious reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all these things, and many more which their
own knowledge furnishes them with; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and the love of the Protestant Religion
will always hinder them from doing any thing, that
may be blamed before God and men. For in fine
I cannot believe that there is any one amongst them
that looks upon your Episcopacy, or your Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
or certain Ceremonies which you observe,
as blots, and capital errours, which hinder a man
from obtaining salvation, even with facility in your
Assemblies, and under your Government. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
here is not about the <hi>Esse,</hi> or the <hi>bene Esse,</hi> but
onely about the <hi>melius Esse,</hi> that they dispute with
you; and this being so, justice, charity, the love of
peace, prudence, and zeal for Religion in the general
will never allow that they should divide themselves
from you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="448" facs="tcp:95208:277"/>
But, my Lord, since you have put the pen into
my hand upon this subject, I beseech you pardon
my freedom if it go so far as to tell you what I think
you also ought to doe on your part. I hope then
that on these opportunities that God presents unto
you, you will make all the world see, and convince
the most incredulous, that you have piety, zeal, and
the fear of God, and that you are worthy labourers,
and worthy servants of Jesus Christ. This is the
tetimony which all good men do already give you,
and none how spightfull soever he be dares to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
it, and I do not doubt but that you will
carry on your calling to the end. But besides this,
my Lord, I hope you willnot be wanting in the
duties of charity, and the spirit of peace, and that
when the dispute shall be onely of some tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or of some Ceremonies that are a stumbling-block,
and which in themselves are nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of an intire reunion of your Church under
your holy Ministry, you will make it seen that you
love the Spouse of your Master more than your selves;
and that it is not so much from your greatness, and
your Ecclesiastical dignity that you desire to receive
your glory, and your joy, as from your pastoral
vertues, and the ardent care you take of your Flocks.
I hope too that those you have chosen and called to
the holy Ministry, and those which hereafter you
shall with a prudent diseretion call unto it, being
governed not onely by sweetness, but likewise by
severity of discipline, when severity shall be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
will tread in your steps, and happily follow
the example which you shall give them, that they
may be themselves for an example, and edification to
the Churches that are committed to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="449" facs="tcp:95208:277"/>
I conclude, my Lord, with very earnest prayers
which I present to God with all my heart, that it
would please him always to preseve unto you the
light of his Gospel, and to pour out upon the whole
body of your Ministry, an abundant measure of his
unction and heavenly benediction, of which that of
the old <hi>Aaron</hi> was but a shadow; that it may be
not the emblem, and image of brotherly concord,
like the unction of old, but the cause and bond of
it. I pray him that he would more and more bring
back the heart of the Children to the Fathers, and
of the Fathers to the Children, that your Church
may be happy and pleasant as the Paradise of God.</p>
