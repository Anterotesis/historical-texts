            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

are particular duties, the obligation of <hi>them</hi> alwayes doth, and will lie upon me, to the utmost of my power.

            <p>My Lord, I know, and whosoever shall have the happiness to write the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of these times, as he ought, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it, to Your <hi>perpetuall honour</hi> that those most <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>blessed alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which this present age enjoy's, both in <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> and <hi>Politick</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have, in a great part, resulted out of Your <hi>presence,</hi> and <hi>assistance,</hi> to our <hi>sacred Sovereign,</hi> in those intricacies of affaires, with which <hi>He,</hi> and, in <hi>Him, We</hi> were all involved; My Lord, I know

            <p>This is the reason why this <hi>Treatise</hi> creep's under, and expect's Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships protection; It handle's the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental articles of all those things which hitherto you, and all vertuous men, have endeavour'd to preserve, and for which you and they have suffered so much <hi>hardship:</hi> for when this unhappy Author slight's those reasons, which have been brought, to defend the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall infinite being of a God,</hi> this Book hath justifyed it against him; O my Lord; it is <hi>that God</hi> which hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twisted and unravelled those many <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes</hi> with which you were lately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, and hath exalted you to a high place of <hi>Dignity,</hi> wherein you may serve him; as then you have alwayes kept your integrity to him, through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
            <p>REader, I intreat you, take notice, that long since, in a sullen retirement, being amazed at the transactions of businesses in the <hi>Church,</hi> so well as <hi>State.</hi> I not only grieved to observe the ruines of that glorious <hi>hedge,</hi> with which God had fenced his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> (that <hi>hedge</hi> of thorns, which formerly no man could have kicked against, but it would have hurt his foot) broken down; but likewise how the <hi>foxes</hi> had been in the <hi>Vineyard;</hi> how they had eaten up and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most of those desirable fruits of <hi>piety, humility, obedience,</hi> and <hi>fidelity,</hi> which had only a <hi>name</hi> of <hi>honour</hi> left them by former writers, but no <hi>exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence</hi> in the <hi>practice</hi> of men amongst us; Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these sad misfortunes, and studying what would become of them, I found many gallant men, with noble and heroïque spirits, repairing the <hi>hedge,</hi> by shewing the necessity of that discipline whose decay introduced
<pb facs="tcp:56958:6"/>
all those mischiefs to the <hi>Church;</hi> others, with as high a vertue, and as effectuall pens, pruning the <hi>Vines,</hi> and cherishing those decayed fruits; I honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their endeavours, but considered <hi>cui bono,</hi> to what purpose all this learning bestowed; not only the <hi>foxes</hi> have been nibling the fruits and branches, but the <hi>wild Bore</hi> hath been in the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> and hath so far digged at the roots of <hi>Religion,</hi> that the principal <hi>Vines</hi> hang by little strings, and do only live, yea would die if not succoured. (These were my reflexions on those times) I therefore thought it necessary for some body, and applyed my particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to cast fresh Earth about those roots of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; to chase, if I could, that <hi>wild Bore</hi> out of the <hi>Vineyard</hi> into his former <hi>Forest</hi> of heathenish principles; and surely if any one man, for some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years, might be called that <hi>Bore,</hi> it is <hi>Mr. Hobbes,</hi> no one man ever writing so destructively to the principles of <hi>Christianity</hi> as he hath done; Upon this reason I bent my study against him and his Books, and did heretofore publish two pieces in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known name, being willing to have the businesse done, but not caring if my name were lost in the World; the first was meerly <hi>Philosophicall,</hi> against the two first Chapters of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> which yet, because he made that the <hi>Introduction</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56958:7"/>
of his <hi>Divinity,</hi> I thought it necessarily conducing to my intentions against the other, to begin with; Since my writing that I have found some men, of great worth, and deserved reputation in Letters, that have opined with some things in that piece, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I thought to have suspended my putting it out again, untill I had enlarged my Discourse with them; but, upon perusal, supposing they could not <hi>prophesie,</hi> nor had foreseen by <hi>reason</hi> what I urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I resolved to publish it as it is, and take some other leisure to censure them, if God give me life. The other piece was against the <hi>12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</hi> and <hi>14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</hi> Chapter; both so falsly printed, that, when I saw them, I could scarce know them for mine own.

                  <p>Here first he undertakes to set down the <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> as if it had but one (as indeed, by his Philosophy,<note place="margin">Pressure of the heart, or brain, made by the external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not the true cause of sense.</note> it might seem to have) this <hi>cause</hi> he makes to be the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal object,</hi> which presseth the <hi>Organ,</hi> proper to each sense, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this <hi>pressure</hi> he followes to the <hi>brain</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> (I wonder which way from the <hi>eye,</hi> or <hi>ear,</hi> it gets to the <hi>heart,</hi>) there this <hi>pressure</hi> caused a <hi>resistance,</hi> or counter-passion, or endeavour of the <hi>heart</hi> to deliver it self, (mark now, the <hi>brain,</hi> which doubtless is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>sense,</hi> is left out) which <hi>endeavour,</hi> because out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, seemeth to be some <hi>matter without</hi>; consider the strange uncouthness of this language; if there be such an <hi>endeavour</hi> which universally cannot be true, yet this <hi>endeavour</hi> is <hi>inward,</hi> although that which <hi>presseth</hi> it be put out; like a man who thrusteth another out of doors, that <hi>endeavour</hi> to thrust him out is <hi>within,</hi> although the man be thrust out, all his <hi>endeavour</hi> must be within, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he follow him out of doors, which I think he will not affirm of the <hi>brain,</hi> or <hi>heart.</hi> Secondly, consider that it is impossible that the <hi>heart,</hi> or <hi>brain,</hi> should be so displeased with all apparitions, although they <hi>press</hi> them, as to <hi>endeavour</hi> to be delivered of them; for there are some things of this nature, as sweet Musick, Tast, Beauties in visible objects, in all senses some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects so grateful to the <hi>Organ,</hi> yea, <hi>heart,</hi> or <hi>brain,</hi> yea all, that they cannot chuse but delight in them, yea hug and embrace them with all kindness; if so, why should they <hi>endeavour</hi> to <hi>expell</hi> them? yes, (he may say) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

He proceeds [<hi>All qualities, called sensible, are in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that causeth them, but so many several motions of the matter by which it presseth our Organs diversly.</hi>] I will let passe this, because I shall have full occasion to speak of it in the second part, concerning his <hi>Element of Policy:</hi> He goes on, (<hi>neither in us are they any thing but divers motions (for motion produceth nothing but motion) but their appearance to us is fancy, the same waking or dreaming.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Here is an Aphorisme (as if it were undeniable) but without any proof or reason of it to be received by the Reader, without examining for his authority;<note place="margin">Motion begets somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side motion.</note> the Axiome is; That <hi>motion begets nothing but motion</hi>; a speech far from all truth in Philosophy; for were it not that there is an aim at <hi>quiet,</hi> there would scarce be any <hi>motion, Finis belli Pax,</hi> the end to which, and the end for which it is; but to say, <hi>it produceth nothing but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is against all the experience in the world; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in some, and most <hi>motions,</hi> it may be said, that the effect is not produced by the power of the <hi>motion,</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56958:27"/>
but the vertue of that Agent which operates by <hi>motion,</hi> and whose instrument that <hi>motion</hi> is; yet that way that <hi>motion</hi> doth produce any thing, all things are produced by <hi>motion,</hi> Substances, Men, Beasts, Trees, Accidents, Colours, Quantities, Places, all whatsoever; but all these things are not <hi>motions,</hi> yea, this last, which is <hi>Place,</hi> and in which <hi>motions,</hi> and the effects of <hi>motions,</hi> are most sensibly discovered, is so far from being <hi>motion,</hi> that in our sublunary <hi>places</hi> there can be no <hi>motion in</hi> them, but onely <hi>motions to</hi> them; nor can they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be <hi>locally moved,</hi> for the <hi>place</hi> of every thing is the Ambient Superficies: Now that, with us, is either of Aire or Water, and if a man stir in any place, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a new <hi>place,</hi> and alters the old, so that in that <hi>place</hi> he stirs not, and you cannot remove the Ambient Aire or Water, but it alters his condition; so that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he conceive that all things are <hi>motion,</hi> it cannot be true, that <hi>motion</hi> begets nothing but <hi>motion,</hi> for <hi>motion</hi> produceth all sublunary things. When he writ his <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi> there was <hi>motion,</hi> but this <hi>Leviathan,</hi> I hope, is not <hi>motion</hi>; it may, perhaps, in needlesse Readers, cause <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>commotion,</hi> but certainly it lies still under my paper at this time, and will do all this night. This is the strangest Proposition that ever was obtruded upon men, but I desist from it at this instant, perhaps to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large hereafter, although I think this abundantly enough. Where he addes, that <hi>their appearance to us is fancy,</hi> I deny it, but that act which discerns the <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> may in some sense be called <hi>fancy,</hi> I grant. What he addes afterwards,<note place="margin">Philosophy Schooles, and Universities, how necessary to Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> concerning the <hi>pressure</hi> of the <hi>eye, &amp;c.</hi> I refer to another place, but mean not to lose it. At the latter end he censures all the <hi>Philosophy Schooles</hi> throughout Christendom, but he is not so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere

against them, as to wish them an utter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he will hereafter reserve a room and office for them in the Commonwealth; but he lets us see, by the way, what things (when he is made <hi>Visitor General</hi> of all Christendom) would be amended. In the mean time I shall shew this use of <hi>Universities,</hi> that there may be alwayes a certain company of learned men in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, by whom, as by a Standard, all dangerous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines may be tryed, whether they be Orthodox, or useful to the Commonwealth, or no; which censure I am confident his <hi>Leviathan</hi> will never abide. And now I will examine this same businesse of <hi>Sense,</hi> as it is set down more at large in the second Chapter of his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature</hi>; Chapter 2. censures the 2.

I will not trouble the Reader with cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring every line, but because that which is material in this Chapter consists in four propositions, which he undertakes to prove, I will content my self with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into them.</p>

All <hi>Images</hi> certainly are the apparitions of those things whose <hi>Images</hi> they are, the <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>horse,</hi> is the apparition of a <hi>horse,</hi> for they are the apparitions of such things as they make appear, and they make these things, and these things onely appear, whose <hi>Images</hi> they are: Now these visible <hi>species</hi> make red and greene coloured things appear, to wit, the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> not the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>brain</hi>; which without doubt can have none of these <hi>colours.</hi>
                  </p>

Thus here is poor Logick in this argument, where there is no semblance, how this conclusion, set down here, is deduced out of the premises: first, it is absolutely naught (as I have shewed) to prove an Universal conclusion, concerning sense, from a particular instance, and that instance from an indisposed <hi>Organ,</hi> and that instance it self no where offered to be proved; for where doth he prove, that that <hi>light is nothing without?</hi> where doth he prove, that <hi>all that is real in that light, is the concussion or motion, of the Optick Nerve?</hi> Now for a man to enforce a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion against all the Universities of Christendome, and all the reason of Philosophy out of Christendome, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi> and ancient <hi>Grecians,</hi> and not shew any proof, or evidence, of his premises, was, as if, like another <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> he would maintaine his opinion by his sword, without which he hath no one argument.</p>

which,<note place="margin">His inference amiss.</note> leaving it, as he doth, unexplained, gives a great trouble to the understanding of this proposition, and that is [<hi>In such manner as is proper thereunto</hi>] what is this <hi>proper manner,</hi> he should have cleared, I am sure he making it an Inference, with a <hi>Therefore,</hi> out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, we ought to conceive nothing but a violent stroak, which a lucide body at a distance cannot give, as will, I think,<note place="margin">And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> appear hereafter.

Now, as I have said before, there is no reason why the <hi>brain</hi> should expell every object; and againe, it may be urged, that either the <hi>brain</hi> or the <hi>eye</hi> is the organ of this sense, (no man knows by his discourse what he will say) If the <hi>brain,</hi> why should it only then perceive the object when it <hi>rebounds</hi> to the <hi>Optick Nerve,</hi> and not whilst the <hi>stroak</hi> is within it self? If the <hi>eye</hi> be the organ, as certainly it is, why doth it not perceive the object before the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,</hi> as well as after; as it passeth <hi>to</hi> the <hi>brain,</hi> as well as when it cometh <hi>from</hi> it? I am perswaded he can answer nothing to this <hi>Dilemma</hi>; what he saith, that (<hi>we not conceiving as motion, or rebound from within, do think it is without</hi>) is true, if he affirm it of <hi>light</hi> or <hi>colour,</hi> as he doth, for we can learn from him no reason to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,

and all sense shewes us the thing without, and therefore we conceive it such; what he speaks of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a <hi>stroak,</hi> I have spoke to it before, but here add, that there is a mighty difference betwixt that <hi>violent motion,</hi> which he expresseth from a <hi>stroak</hi> upon the eye, which flasheth <hi>fire</hi> out of the eye, and this natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which proceeding from the visible object, creeps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eye by the sight of it: I can conceive the first may happen to a blind eye; such sparks, with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent blow, may be beat out of it; I am confident, if his Philosophy were true, that it comes from the <hi>Optick Nerve,</hi> it may be done upon an eye that is blind, but this other passage of the object to the eye, is onely by the sight, and cannot be where the eye is not fitted for vision.</p>

                  <p>His further Philosophy about the <hi>Sun,</hi> is as strange (methinks) when he sayes, (<hi>we have no reason to doubt, that the Fountain of light, the Sun, worketh any other wayes then the fire, at least in this matter.) This matter</hi> is in vision I conceive,<note place="margin">The Sun works not as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> fancieth.</note> and that he would have the <hi>Sun</hi> work as he describes <hi>fire:</hi> but that will be hard to prove: For first, he must shew that the <hi>Sun</hi> moves by <hi>dilation,</hi> and <hi>contraction</hi>: Secondly, that it hath ambient ayre, or some such easily <hi>moved</hi> body to be <hi>rejected</hi> by it: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he must prove, that the <hi>Sun</hi> must so <hi>reject</hi> that body, as to make it passe through the inferiour Orbs; or else he must deny that there are any Orbes, from all these things, which will be very difficult, and those things which I have objected against that <hi>motion</hi> of <hi>fire,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> must be vindicated from their opposition, before that conclusion will appear probable, that the <hi>Sun worketh,</hi> in this act of vision, according to his method before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed;

                  <p>ANd first, that <hi>colour</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> is not the <hi>Apparition</hi> of that <hi>Motion,</hi> I thus prove;<note place="margin">Colour, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, not the apparition of motion, but of the object.</note> That which is the <hi>apparition</hi> of any thing, makes it appeare in his own co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as we speak.</p>
                  <p>But this <hi>image</hi> or <hi>colour</hi> (I take them as he puts them down together) makes not that <hi>motion</hi> appear in its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; <hi>ergo</hi>:<note place="margin">2 Argument.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The major is evident, for if a thing appeare truly as it is, it appears in its own likenesse, and with such <hi>colours</hi> as it hath, and unless it be a <hi>colour,</hi> this <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>colour,</hi> he speaks of, makes nothing appear.</p>
                  <p>The minor I thus prove, If this <hi>image</hi> or <hi>colour</hi> make the <hi>motion</hi> appeare in its <hi>colours,</hi> then that <hi>motion</hi> had <hi>colour</hi> before; but that he denies, for he makes <hi>colour</hi> to be nothing but the <hi>apparition</hi> of <hi>motion,</hi> and if <hi>colour</hi> or <hi>image</hi> be the <hi>apparition</hi> of that <hi>motion,</hi> that <hi>motion</hi> must have <hi>colour</hi>; because it makes the <hi>motion</hi> appear in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>colour,</hi> either it must have <hi>colour,</hi> or it cannot appear by <hi>colour,</hi> or the <hi>image</hi> of <hi>colour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, I can confute this his conclusion, thus;<note place="margin">2 Argument.</note> That which is the <hi>apparition</hi> of any other thing, when that other is the same, then that is the same, and when that other varies or changes, that doth so likewise; but when the stroak or <hi>motion</hi> from the object is the same, the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi> or <hi>image</hi> varies, and when that is divers, the <hi>image</hi> is the same, therefore it cannot be the apparition of that <hi>motion:</hi> The major is evident, for the <hi>apparition</hi> of any thing, is nothing but the shewing of it as it is: The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56958:37"/>
will be thus illustrated; Suppose two walls equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly big, the one black, the other greene, these equally strike the brain, the one as the other, but the <hi>image</hi> or <hi>colour</hi> represented is black or green, divers; but if any man shall object, that these doe not equally strike the brain, I will let him make them equall in all things but the <hi>colour,</hi> and then they must equally strike, or if, not, the <hi>colour</hi> of the wall, not the <hi>motion</hi> in the braine, is that which onely appeares and makes the difference. Again, when the stroak is divers, sometimes the <hi>colour</hi> or <hi>image</hi> is the same; so if we should conceive the strength and difference of <hi>motions,</hi> we must needs think that solid and strong bodies should move and strike the eye harder then soft and gentle, yet they may easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of one <hi>colour</hi>; as we may see a Downe-bed, and a stone; either of these instances is enough to shew, that <hi>colour</hi> or <hi>image</hi> is not the <hi>apparition</hi> of that <hi>motion,</hi> but of the object which makes that <hi>motion.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Colour a real thing in the object.</note>This I conceive, with what went before, may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly enough for the confutation of his conclusion.

                  <p>The major hath its evidence from hence, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can cause an effect nobler,<note place="margin">1 Argument.</note> or more excellent then it self, which if colour, that is in the object, be not a real thing, it should do, when it produceth real effects.

them, which are real effects: As for instance, take one of your ordinary Burning glasses, use all the art you can, it will not burn white paper or linnen, they scatter the beames; but black, or colour the paper or linnen, it will enflame it, and so much the easier, the neerer any <hi>colour</hi> comes to black, which will collect these beams; this is a sign undeniable, that there is some <hi>colour</hi> in that linnen or paper which hath these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Again, some <hi>colours</hi> hurt the sight of the eye, as red, white, and light <hi>colours</hi>; some are grateful to it, as black or green, these are real effects, and every mans daily experience sheweth them to be so.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Argument.</note> This may be proved from that operation it hath upon a mans eye; for since the <hi>stroak,</hi> which he conceives is made upon the eye, must needs be the same made by a white or black wall, as I have shewed, or more close, the same wall now white, and anon souted or blacked, it cannot be that the divers <hi>species</hi> or <hi>Image,</hi> which is wrought in the eye, can proceed from any thing but that very <hi>Colour</hi> which is in the wall, because the diversity of the <hi>Image</hi> must needs argue some diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of cause, which can be none but the <hi>colour</hi> of the object, upon examination of all other pretended causes, for that varying, the <hi>image</hi> alters; and that remaining the same, the <hi>image</hi> doth so likewise, and this so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, that to all eyes, well disposed, it appeares such, whatsoever they are, so the <hi>medium</hi> be not some way or other clouded; which must needs argue a certainty of causation to him, who in this very Proposition allows the object a causing vertue; because it is a <hi>motion</hi> from the object, which is by this <hi>image</hi> made appear; now the <hi>motion</hi> is the same from black or green, but the <hi>colour</hi> only differs.</p>

It is a strange thing that his wit should think to perswade a man, not onely against his own eyes, but all the eyes in the world, and all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son too, but his owne.

                  <p>The major is evident, because the same cannot be, and not be, at the same time, which would be true, if at the same time <hi>colour</hi> and <hi>light</hi> being the same, <hi>colour</hi> should be, and <hi>light</hi> not.</p>
                  <p>The minor will be proved thus; <hi>Colours</hi> are in the dark where <hi>light</hi> is not, that will be proved, because at night, when <hi>light</hi> leaves our Horizon, yet the <hi>colours</hi> remaine the same they were before; and that is proved, because when light (although another <hi>light</hi>) is brought to them, yet they are, and they apppear the same they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Now we have an Axiom in nature, and to be over-master'd and check'd by nothing but divine power, <hi>à privatione ad habitum non datur regressus,</hi> there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling a word that is spoke, no making that not done, which is once done; not making that up individually and compleatly the same which is destroyed; no restoring a forme, and being once lost; now this being the same it was, and appearing so at the coming of the second <hi>light,</hi> which it was at the manifestation of the first, it is evident that the <hi>light</hi> did not give this <hi>colour</hi> its being, but onely the manifestation of its being, and this <hi>colour</hi> was something besides <hi>light,</hi> which was made appear by <hi>light</hi>; I know not what can be answered to this any further.</p>

                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56958:40"/>For answer to this argument, we must know that the being and nature of things consists not in their <hi>second acts</hi> as they are called,<note place="margin">Wherein the being and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things consists, and how they are distinguished.</note> which are their operations, but in their <hi>first acts,</hi> which give them their abilities to work, and they are distinguished by their abilities to operate, when time, and other opportunities, and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are offered; not by their operations themselves. Thus <hi>vegetative</hi> creatures are distinguished from things <hi>inanimate,</hi> not by their operations of growth or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for then they should not be <hi>vegetable</hi> creatures in Winter, but by their abilities to grow or generate when their season is offered; and as their abilities di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them from others, so amongst themselves their several species, natures, or kinds are distinguished by their abilities to produce several sorts of things by those operations, not by the operations themselves: so it is in all things, the <hi>abilities</hi> to sense, not the <hi>act</hi> of sensation, make an <hi>Animal</hi>; the abilitie to discourse, not the act, makes the man; for else a beast should not be a beast when he is asleep, nor a man a man, when he is either asleep, or a child. I could instance in all things, quantities, qualities whatsoever: This explains and answers this argument, although <hi>colour</hi> cannot actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be seen in the dark, yet that concerns not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the operation of <hi>colours,</hi> their <hi>second act,</hi> not their <hi>first</hi>; they have in them a power of being seen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasions and opportunities, even when they are in the dark; darknesse to them is like Winter to vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, like sleep to beasts, like infancy to man; and as well may they say, that the springing weather, which reduceth the tree to grow, is the tree; that the stroak or blow which wakened the sleepy Lion, is the Lion; that act which inabled the child first to discourse, is the

                  <p>Another main argument,<note place="margin">2 Argument.</note> which is urged against the distinction betwixt <hi>light</hi> and <hi>colour,</hi> is thus formed; There is the same reason of all <hi>colours,</hi> as <hi>colours,</hi> as of any; but we know that some <hi>colours</hi> are nothing but <hi>light</hi> reflected, therefore we may conclude the same of all.</p>
                  <p>The major it self stands upon its own strength, by that word (as <hi>colours</hi>) for where there is the same being, there is the same reason or cause of that being. The minor is exemplified in the <hi>colours</hi> of Pidgeons necks, in those <hi>colours</hi> made by a glasse of Red-wine, set upon a white cloth, when a great <hi>light,</hi> or the <hi>Sun</hi> shines upon the Wine, it will give an eye of red to the white cloth which is under it, as likewise the <hi>Sun</hi> shining through the coloured glasse; these are real <hi>colours,</hi> but are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>light</hi> variously reflected; therefore there are <hi>colours</hi> which are nothing but <hi>light.</hi>

                  <p>For answer to this, we may say to the major,<note place="margin">Answ. Colours real and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal not the same.</note> that there is the same reason of all <hi>colours,</hi> as <hi>colours,</hi> which are reall <hi>colours</hi> and material; but that there should be the same reason and nature with them, and intentionall, apparent or spiritual <hi>colours</hi> (for by these names they are called) there being but a nominal, and some outward circumstantive convenience only, is very illogically spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; as if one should say, that a living, and painted, or dead horse were the same, and had the same nature. To shew the convenience and difference of these from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56958:41"/>
real <hi>colours,</hi> observe that they both are the object of the sight; that when the eye sees that broken light through the red glasse, it sees a thing, for what is not, cannot be the object of sense, and because it is seen, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly called a <hi>colour,</hi> for <hi>colour</hi> is the object of sight, and in that actual relation to the sight, they have both one common nature; but here is the difference, that to the one <hi>light</hi> gives its being, to the other, onely its being seen, for the <hi>light</hi> falling thick in with that <hi>species</hi> and <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi> sent forth in their first and strongest emission, when they come immediately from the object, it min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with them, and gives them a lustre from it selfe, which is a shining <hi>colour</hi>; but in all real <hi>colours</hi> the <hi>light</hi> adds nothing but a making of them fit to be actually seen; and that they are one real, the other intentional <hi>colours,</hi> appeares by this, that the real are inherent in the object, which is their subject, and so the white of this paper I write upon is inherent in it, and is moved with the motion of this paper, which is the object of my sight at this time; but red, which falls from the glasse of wine upon a white cloth, or these <hi>colours</hi> on Pidgeons necks, move not with the cloth or the Pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, for take the Pidgeon out of the flaring light, and you shall see onely his reall <hi>colours</hi>; and remove the white cloth, and it retaines onely its whiteness, which is the inherent <hi>colour,</hi> and the intentionall <hi>colour</hi> follows the glass and <hi>light,</hi> not its subject; so that here we find the perfect nature of a reall, absolute, <hi>inherent</hi> accident in the one, and but of an intentional relative <hi>adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> accident in the other. And here appeares a diverse nature in these two sorts of <hi>colours,</hi> they differ in their reall nature, although they agree in the relative; and you may see it further illustrated thus: The same
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56958:41"/>
thing cannot at the same time have two real <hi>colours,</hi> red and white, but the white cloth, though shadowed with red from the wine, is white at that time it is so shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which appears, because remove the shadowing body onely, which is the glasse, and there is the same white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, without any alteration or motion in the cloth; and therefore it was the same before, but onely received an eye of red from the glasse. This may serve for the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> that there is the same reason of all <hi>colours,</hi> I say all reall, not intentionall and reall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to the <hi>minor,</hi> that must prove that these intentional <hi>colours</hi> doe not differ from the <hi>light,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Intentional colours not the same with light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> which I deny; for although <hi>light</hi> is an ingredient in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of them, yet it is not the total, no not refracted <hi>light,</hi> but as it mixeth with divers <hi>colours,</hi> so it appears diversly, and then, as you cannot say a book is nothing but paper, or paper inked, but a paper written or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as a medicine cannot be said to be Rubarb, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Rubarb be in it, when there are many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, and perhaps others more predominant. So is it with this matter, although these intentional <hi>colours</hi> have <hi>light</hi> in them, yet they are something else besides <hi>light.</hi> And thus superabundantly; this latter part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not his book, nor indeed, had he erred in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion onely, that <hi>light</hi> is <hi>colour,</hi> would I have censured him, he had learned men in the same cause engaged with him; but when he thought this should countenance these other Propositions, that there was nothing but an <hi>apparition</hi> of <hi>motion:</hi> Secondly, that <hi>colour</hi> was no <hi>reall</hi> thing in the <hi>object,</hi> which was abhorring to all sense and teason that was ever bestowed upon these things; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the lump, and thinking it a mistake, have wasted this paper about it.</p>

                  <p>The first reason of <hi>Aristotle</hi> is drawn from our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience thus; We all observe,<note place="margin">Aristotles first reason for them.</note> that when we have discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things by our senses, and the act of <hi>sensing</hi> (pardon that word <hi>sensing,</hi> it is unusuall, yet significant) is done, yet there remains in the sensative memory, that <hi>image,</hi> which represented the object at the first; now it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that that should be any material corporeal thing, for then how could so many huge Towers, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Towns, Kingdoms, yea heaven it self, if a materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al heaven, remaine crowded in so narrow a compass? how could such contraries, as black and white, hot and cold, fire and water, high and low, remaine in that little Ark of mans memory? if they were material and reall things, they could not, but being spiritual, intentional, and things, as Philosophers speak, <hi>diminutae entitatis,</hi> they make a shift, with their little entities, to creep into such a corner: And this confounds likewise another Proposition of his, that the <hi>reception</hi> of these <hi>species</hi> makes <hi>sense</hi>; for these entities are <hi>received</hi> and <hi>retained,</hi> and kept fast in that box which <hi>received</hi> them, the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> but are not <hi>sense</hi> any longer then they are hot, and fresh from the object; well, then there must be such things as these <hi>species,</hi> or else there could be no <hi>memory</hi> of the object, which, in a material condition, could not exist in the <hi>memory.</hi>

To this I answer, that the <hi>sight</hi> judgeth of colours,<note place="margin">Sight, when, and when not, deceived.</note> and therein is not deceived, when the distance is not too great, nor the organ, or <hi>medium,</hi> ill disposed; for that is its proper <hi>object,</hi> over which it hath power to judg; but in such things as are <hi>a common object</hi> to it, and other senses, it is easily mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56958:49"/>
of which kind are figures, greatnesse, or littleness, distance of place, and many the like. Thus it mistakes the distance of the Moone from the earth, the bigness of the stars; but then, besides these <hi>common objects,</hi> there are other which are <hi>objectum per accidens,</hi> as Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, an <hi>object</hi> not out of its own nature affecting that act or faculty in its self, but by reason of some other thing to which it is annext, or happens to be joyned; so we may say, we see <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> when we see them not, but their <hi>colour,</hi> and that <hi>colour,</hi> of theirs, is the onely thing by which they are discerned by <hi>sight.</hi> Now there are mighty mistakes in our <hi>senses</hi> concerning these; so when we see one man's cloaths worne by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we think him, at the first, to be the man whose cloaths he weares; so when we see that man to have a red, who had a pale face, we think him not the same man. My opinion of this mistake is, because although the vision of the <hi>colour</hi> is an act of <hi>sight,</hi> yet the apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>colour</hi> to the person seemes to be an act of <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> a work out of the reach of pure <hi>sense.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sense judgeth not of colour, but Reason by collection from it.</note> This by the way of explication, to make all plain, that the Reader may the fuller apprehend my answer to this objection; punctually then I answer, first, that there is no such judgment of <hi>sense</hi> as to say, that <hi>colour is not in the object</hi>; for although <hi>sense,</hi> perhaps, can onely discern the <hi>colour</hi> in the glass; yet <hi>sense</hi> meddles not with that question, whether the same <hi>colour,</hi> can be in two subjects; much less, whether this be a <hi>real</hi> colour in the glasse, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>intentional,</hi> or whether it be in the glass or not; but if it do meddle with this last, yet in that speech, which sayes it is in the glasse, <hi>sense</hi> meddles beyond its sphere, it judgeth in a cause which belongs not to its Judicature, that may be disputed by <hi>reason</hi> between him
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56958:50"/>
and me, and <hi>sense</hi> may give in evidence concerning what it knows circumstantially conducing to the truth, but cannot judg of it, it is not its proper <hi>object</hi>; so then to say, <hi>sense</hi> sees it in a glass, therefore there is no <hi>colour</hi> in the <hi>object,</hi> is vaine to <hi>reason,</hi> which can discerne that every accident follows its subject; remove the <hi>glass</hi> from the face which got that image, and there is no such image in the <hi>glasse</hi>; and contrariwise, remove the <hi>man</hi> whither you will, the <hi>colour</hi> is with him, sticks in him, therefore <hi>colour</hi> is inherent in him, but only from him represented in the <hi>glasse:</hi> The businesse of <hi>inhesion</hi> or <hi>adhesion</hi> belongs not to <hi>sense</hi> to meddle with; the eye sees divers <hi>colours</hi> in a Rain-bow, it belongs not to sense to judge whether they <hi>inhere</hi> there or no; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the Pidgeons neck, and wheresoever it findes them, <hi>Reason</hi> may dispute and collect from <hi>sense,</hi> but <hi>Sense</hi> judgeth not. So that first, as I said, <hi>sense</hi> when it sees an image in a Looking-glasse, collects no negative Proposition, that it is <hi>not</hi> in the <hi>object,</hi> no more then the <hi>sense</hi> of that man, who thinks he sees a man in the Moon, should collect that, therefore there are none up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth. Secondly, if it judg at all of the subject of inherence, whether the glass or <hi>object</hi> be the subject, yet this is so extrajudicial an act, so out of the reach of <hi>sense,</hi> as therefore there is no strong building upon it; thus have I knowne horses mistaken, and sheep, when the <hi>colouts</hi> have been the same, and the mistake hath seized upon <hi>reason</hi> guided by <hi>sense,</hi> so that men have sworne cleane contrary; so weak is <hi>Sense</hi> in judging of any thing but its proper <hi>object</hi>; when other things are accidentally joyned with the <hi>object,</hi> they pass an accidental and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain judgment upon them; and his first conclusion is true, <hi>Sense telleth</hi> me, or rather, by the information of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56958:50"/>
                     <hi>sense,</hi> I collect, that <hi>colour</hi> is in the <hi>object,</hi> when I see <hi>it directly</hi>; but his second can no way be true, that <hi>Sense telleth me, when I see by reflection, that colour is not in the Object</hi>; for <hi>Sense</hi> makes no such Judgment, and <hi>Reason</hi> with <hi>Sense</hi> makes a cleane contrary collection.</p>

                  <p>This Proposition I censure, and shall shew first, that there is such a thing; then answer his objection.<note place="margin">The distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Appetite into Natural and rational, their conflicts, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite</hi> may be distinguished into <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Rationall; Natural</hi> is the bent, the disposition every thing hath to the preservation of its self, as it is a particular body; or the generality of the Universe, as it is a part of the whole. <hi>Rational appetite</hi> is that which a thing hath out of the knowledge it hath of the goodnesse and fitnesse which a thing hath for him who doth desire it. Now that there is such an <hi>appetite,</hi> which we call <hi>natural,</hi> in every thing which hath not reason, is apparent in every such thing; so that no man can give any account of such actions but by the <hi>appetite</hi>; As, Why should the Foxes have holes, and the Fowls of the Air have nests, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they may lay up and preserve their young, but this, that they have an <hi>appetite</hi> to preserve them; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, to come lower to his instance, Why do heavy things fall downeward, after they have been forced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but that they would preserve themselves; nay, to see these two <hi>appetites</hi> in the same man, will make it more evident. Every man findes in himself, besides those politique designs which he hath upon study, and arise out of reason, <hi>natural desires,</hi> and <hi>appetites</hi> of Meat and Drink, and this against his <hi>reasonable appetite</hi>; for when his <hi>Reason,</hi> upon grounds of Physick, directs him not to eat, and, upon the controul of <hi>Reason,</hi> he denies himself Meat, yet he cannot choose but, by his <hi>natural appetite,</hi> desire Meat; so likewise he hath a <hi>natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite</hi> to live, even when <hi>Reason</hi> shews him it is fit for him to dye, and to fall downwards, even when he would mount upward. Thus we see there are <hi>appetites</hi> in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56958:53"/>
                     <hi>irrational</hi> things, and the <hi>irrational</hi> part in man, which is not <hi>rational</hi>; and these cross <hi>appetites</hi> make great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation in man about his actions; and sometimes the subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I see what is good, and in my <hi>reason</hi> approve it, but act what in <hi>reason</hi> I detest. This invincibly shews this <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,</hi> and that there is even in <hi>Natural</hi> things, which have not the use of <hi>reason,</hi> an <hi>appetite</hi> to satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in what, some way or other, is good for them.

                     <note place="margin">Gods wisdom, not Art, in the natures of all he made, and disposing the principles of their several operations.</note> he gave each of them their several beings and natures, which were the principles of all their operations, which according to those beings they produced; not as he, in his Introduction to his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> began with somewhat too high a line, (<hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Art whereby God hath made and governs the world</hi>) certainly if it were lawfull to call that infinite wise coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Gods Will, whereby he worketh all things, and <hi>made and governs the World, an Art</hi>; yet we could not call that <hi>Art, Nature,</hi> for <hi>Nature</hi> is a thing made by God, and therefore not that thing, or <hi>Art,</hi> by which <hi>God did make the World,</hi> and in, or with it <hi>Nature</hi> her self.

And each of these (besides that general nature of a sensitve soul, in which they all agree) must have some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar soul, or substantial difference in that soul, by which each of these is distinguished from the rest: Now this, whatsoever it is, (which I find not named by Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers)
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56958:62"/>
but whatsoever this is, it must be the Author of those actions which belong to each; and these peculiar fancies, which do appear in some with a great resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of wit, of ingenuity; of docibility, of stupidity and blockishnesse in others; and this quality, as natural, is propagated throughout the whole kind or <hi>species,</hi> failing in very few particulars, in some degrees onely. And when the peculiar property of any Animal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the condition of it to act like those of men, this in them is called by Philosophers (as I remember) <hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> and will appear in divers actions of Elephants,<note place="margin">Their Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</note> Dogs, Birds, which fill the stories of those who write their lives; but all these are wrought not by <hi>reason,</hi> but by that principle of Nature, which dictates, <hi>Eschew evil, and get good,</hi> and is directed by the several kinds of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity,</hi> which in every kind of Animals hath some addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the general condition of a sensitive creature, but attains not the height of <hi>understanding</hi>; but because it may be objected here, how can we discern <hi>understanding in man,</hi> concerning these simple terms, from that of a <hi>beast?</hi> I will answer this by experience; for <hi>man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands</hi> these simple terms in their proper notion, but a <hi>beast</hi> onely in general; I have seen a dog running fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at a horse, a woman rebuke him by this <hi>Word (Out)</hi> which, in its genuine signification, imports <hi>Go abroad</hi>; and if that <hi>Word (Out)</hi> had been used to a man, he would have answered, <hi>I am out</hi>; but the Dog, knowing it onely in generall to be a phrase of Rebuke, ceased from his barking, and went his way, although other more mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>words,</hi> by other men which were present, prevailed not with him, they being, as it is likely, such <hi>words</hi> which had not been used in his ordinary correction, did not, yet this which, likely, was the <hi>Word</hi> which had

Perhaps some man, not satisfied in this, may instance in some of those famous Stories of Beasts, which seem to express an apprehension more particular; but I beleeve, if they were examined, there can be no other further knowledge of simple terms, then this of pleasure and pain to his particular, which may be easily conceived to arise out of that <hi>Sagacity</hi> which is in every kind of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> in several and distinct wayes. What he adds, that, <hi>understanding which is peculiar to man, is the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only his will,</hi> (this should be a Parenthesis, and a most unnecessary one) <hi>but his conceptions and thoughts, by the Sequele and Contexture of the names of things into Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations and Negations.</hi> I can agree with him, that this is peculiar to man, and yet as much may be cavil'd against this, as that went before; and the <hi>sagacious</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many Beasts would perswade us as soon, that they make Propositions and syllogise, as that they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, <hi>understanding</hi> the simple terms.</p>

                     <hi>Infinite</hi> is that which hath no bounds nor limits; and although, concerning these terms, in the first sounding, a man would think that <hi>Infinite</hi> should express a meere negation, as <hi>finite</hi> an affirmation; yet upon judgment of these things, expressed by these termes, we shall find the cleane contrary; for by <hi>finite</hi> we understand <hi>non ultra,</hi> as much as hitherto, and no farther; but by <hi>Infinite</hi> we apprehend such a vastness, to which we can alwaies say <hi>ultra,</hi> that there is further, there is somewhat beyond, and there must be something more. And out of this regard, <hi>finite</hi> things must have a cause of their <hi>finite</hi> nature, because whatsoever is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is bounded by somewhat, but <hi>infinite</hi> can have no cause, because unbounded or limited. These bounds or limits we may consider in three things; in the <hi>essence</hi> of things, in their <hi>quantities,</hi> and in their <hi>qualities</hi>: In their <hi>Essence,</hi> and so we consider all <hi>finite</hi> things to be this, and no other; as a Tree is a tree, and not a Beast or Bird, nor another tree; the being of it is bounded, and limited by that difference which constituted it either
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56958:72"/>
in its specifical, or particular being; and whatsoever is the Cause of that being, is that which limits that thing, and makes it thus <hi>finite</hi> in being. But that which is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> in <hi>essence</hi> hath no bounds, no limits of that being; it is all essence, without limitation, and, in a most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner, comprehends all being, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. It is true, it is not <hi>finite,</hi> and therefore it is not a Man, a horse, a dog, a tree, all which names doe import a restraint and confinement; but is the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all these, so that no perfection of any thing can be denied of that which is <hi>infinite</hi> essentially, to say that this <hi>infinite</hi> is not that; Let us conceive a line <hi>infinite</hi>; imagine such a thing; This line you cannot say it is a span, a foot, a yard, or mile long, yet it contains in it all these measures, without their limitation; so doth an <hi>infinite</hi> being containe all beings without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, in a more excellent and eminent manner. What I have spoken concerning that which is <hi>infinite in essence,</hi> or being, may be applied to all other <hi>infinites</hi> in immensity, in quantity; what is immense must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all bounds of quantity; it must have no limits, but contains eminently all quantities in it: so must number be likewise, if there be any such, which I shall disprove (God willing) hereafter: so must, in respect of duration, Eternity be; It must comprehend all durations, and its self be without beginning and end; so must all <hi>Infinites,</hi> in respect of quality, be, in regard of wisdome, of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, of power, comprehend all those Acts of those qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which are in that which is <hi>finite,</hi> and themselves be without all bounds and limits.

                  <p>And first, I hope Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> will not say, he is the wisest man that ever was in the world; or that he only found out right reasoning (and yet he speaks somewhat like this now and then) but, howsoever, because I write not onely to him, but to other men, and, I hope, he harh not gained an universal esteem of such with the generality, I thus answer; There was never any sort of reasoning men who denyed an <hi>Eternity</hi>;<note place="margin">An Eternity acknowledged by all of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinions.</note> for whether they held the world had a beginning, or no beginning, which all did, and must doe; those which held it had no beginning (as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in my judgement) held the world <hi>eternall</hi>; those which held it had a beginning from Water, as <hi>Thales</hi>; or Ayre, as <hi>Anaximenes</hi>; or Fire, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi>; or from Atomes, as <hi>Democritus,</hi> by chance meeting together in the great and infinite <hi>Vacuum</hi>; not to lose time in confuting all, or any of these, which are most absurd, (yet all these, that held it was principi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56958:74"/>
by these meanes, held likewise that that Principle was <hi>eternall</hi>; so likewise <hi>Plato</hi> his <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>Chaos</hi> were eternall.) Let us from the fact consider the manner in one or two instances. If, with <hi>Democritus,</hi> we make the world constituted by <hi>Atomes,</hi> when we resolve these mixed bodies into their principles, we come to their Elements, then, with <hi>Democritus,</hi> those Elements may be resolved into their <hi>Atomes</hi>; by <hi>Aristotle</hi> into their <hi>Principles,</hi> matter, forme and privation; these <hi>Atomes,</hi> according to <hi>Democritus,</hi> are <hi>Eternall</hi>; that <hi>matter,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Aristotle</hi>; so here is an <hi>eternity</hi> found; So likewise may be said of <hi>Aire, Water,</hi> which are by some imagined to be the Principles; or Chaos, and Ideas; If any man can imagine any thing further, that these had a beginning, and were not <hi>eternall,</hi> his judgement can fly to none but an eternal God; So that still there is, by the ratiocination of man, found out something that is <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> When he said [that <hi>by the ascending from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cause to the more remote, a man would lose himself</hi>] it was most ingenious, and had a truth with it (which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will be farther examined hereafter) if it had been applyed to efficient causes; as out of what Egge this Hen was hatched, and what Hen layd this egge, &amp;c. But when we resolve things into their constitutive causes, which make their natures that which they are, then the work will be short as is shewed, and the result easie; man need not lose himself in the inquest. What he saith, [<hi>that a man tyred in the search will be ignorant whether he can go further or no</hi>] is not so boldly, as finely affirmed by him; for certainly, although a man be weary in his journey; yet he can discern whether he can go further or no.</p>

his Argument; for at the first blush it appeares not. The maker of the world is <hi>Eternal,</hi> that is, <hi>infinite</hi> in duration, and therefore <hi>infinite</hi> of dayes may be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him; therefore he cannot have more dayes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him, for if no <hi>infinite</hi> can be longer then another, then he, that had an <hi>infinite</hi> duration in the dayes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> could have no addition in the life of <hi>Isaac</hi>; so that the denyal of an imparity of <hi>infinite</hi> numbers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes likewise, by consequence, the <hi>infinite</hi> of God.

So <hi>Plato</hi> concerning his <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ideas,</hi> before they were incorporated with <hi>Chaos</hi>; So <hi>Democritus</hi> must think of his <hi>eternal Atomes,</hi> before that good luck, which brought them together had, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted them into those bodies which they made. Now although this, which is eternal, have no <hi>before,</hi> or <hi>after</hi> appliable to him existing in himself; yet when he hath made Creatures, then coexisting with them, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to them, these phrases may be applyed, as <hi>before</hi> this man, this thing; <hi>before</hi> a day, a yeare, or the like; for such relations may then be had to other things, though none in himself, or to himself; Now, because
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56958:77"/>
of this, no duration of time, no <hi>Aera,</hi> no computation can be applyed to God, <hi>before</hi> the world, to say he was a day or yeare, or so, by such time as we make our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, or can tell how to make any; but it is true to say, he was <hi>before</hi> the world, which signifies no more but to say, <hi>he was,</hi> and the <hi>world</hi> was <hi>not</hi>; but to say, he was a <hi>Day,</hi> a <hi>moneth,</hi> or <hi>yeare,</hi> or the like, is not true, nor to be imagined; for time its self (and therefore the parts of it) is the measure of duration, in regard of its priority or posteriority; so a year hath divers moneths, weeks; those, dayes; and they, houres, distinguished by the first, second, &amp;c. Now where is not this priority or posteriority, there can be no imagination of time; so that, for my part, I am of opinion that these, who hold the whole world to be <hi>Eternal,</hi> must not, cannot reckon the <hi>duration</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> (because the whole being must be altogether) to say that it lasts yeares, dayes, or so forth, for it must be immutable in its self, although the parts of it are mutable and subject to change, and they may be reckoned by these times, or part of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which they exist; and this world, in the bulk coexisting with its mutable parts, may, in relation to them, be said to be <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> them; But now the case is otherwise with God, who was when there was no world, nor any mutable thing, and then could have none of those relations, which concerne them, attributed to him; for when there is no yeare, day, houre, how can he be said, to endure and last those times? nay, although we should fancy such a thing which is not, as a day, or houre, before this mutable world, yet we cannot apply it to him who hath no succession in him, when he hath no successive thing coexisting with him; as concerning his immensity, he having no quantity, we can say he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56958:78"/>
coexists with these quantitative things that are in the world; but he being such that neither the Heaven, nor heaven of heavens can contain, he must exist without them, and there he cannot be said to exist with any quantity or measure; and to say, Gods being was a day a year, &amp;c. <hi>before</hi> the <hi>world,</hi> when there was no time, were as improper as to say, he were a yard long, or a mile, where there was no continued quantity, or body for him to subsist with.</p>

I am confident there is no one place of Scripture which expresseth any certaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of duration belonging to him. I know it may be objected to this, that in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 1. vers. 10, 11, 12. The Apostle, speaking of the <hi>Eternity</hi> of our Saviour, according to his Divinity, saith; <hi>Thou Lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the works of thy hands.</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:56958:79"/>
Verse. 11. <hi>They shall perish, but thou remainest, and they all shall wax old as doth a garment.</hi> Verse 12. <hi>And like a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy yeares shall not faile.</hi> In this place the <hi>eternity</hi> of Christs divinity is called <hi>yeares</hi>; and therefore those measures of our times must be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to that <hi>Eternity,</hi> and then <hi>dayes</hi> may, of which <hi>years</hi> are composed. To this we may most reasonably answer, that the Apostle accommodates his manner of language to the capacity of the vulgar, and the language of men, concerning durations, so well as actions; so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he said, <hi>the Heavens were the works of Gods hands,</hi> as if he had said, because all great <hi>works</hi> are wrought by <hi>hands</hi> amongst men, God had <hi>hands,</hi> by which he wrought those <hi>heavens,</hi> So, <hi>thy yeares shall not faile</hi>; that is, thou art <hi>Eternal,</hi> because men reckon their duration by yeares; and yet observe the language, it is said, they are <hi>indeficient</hi> yeares, <hi>yeares</hi> which <hi>faile</hi> not, all our yeares, <hi>faile,</hi> the last yeare is <hi>gone,</hi> this farre in <hi>going,</hi> and untill the end of the world, <hi>mans</hi> yeares, the <hi>worlds</hi> yeares, and their <hi>durations</hi> will <hi>faile</hi>; but <hi>Gods</hi> yeares, no part of his <hi>duration,</hi> reckon it what you will, shall faile. This is the sense of the Scriptures, and men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, without a contradiction, expound it of our time, every part of which is <hi>deficient</hi>; Thus the Philosophy I have delivered being framed according to Scripture, I shall answer his Argument. The <hi>dayes,</hi> which may be attributed to God, and the measures of our time, can onely be in regard of his <hi>coexisting</hi> with time in this world, and therefore he doth not, nor can be said to be of more dayes, then the world hath; for he, who affirms he hath more <hi>dayes,</hi> or any such Computation, affirmes a falshood; there were not more <hi>dayes,</hi> therefore not a

                     <hi>coexisting</hi> with them; and therefore he had more <hi>dayes</hi> when <hi>Isaac</hi> was born, then when <hi>Abraham</hi>; but in neither of them had he an <hi>infinite</hi> number, but <hi>finite</hi> numbers of dayes; nor doth the world yeeld more; his durance is without number of <hi>weeks,</hi> or <hi>dayes,</hi> what successive thing soever we accompt by; and therefore that Argument, against the worlds <hi>eternity,</hi> hath no force, applied to God.</p>

When the <hi>Iewes</hi> wondred that our Saviour should have seen <hi>Abraham,</hi> he answered, <hi>before Abraham was</hi> (not I <hi>was,</hi> but) I <hi>am.</hi> There is a difference in exposition, some say that this speech is understood of his <hi>Humanity,</hi> that his <hi>humanity</hi> was in the thoughts of God, and his <hi>Decree,</hi> before <hi>Abraham</hi>; but this cannot be the sense;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56958:80"/>
for Christ being the son and posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> even in the knowledge and <hi>decree</hi> of God, as well as in his birth in the world, therefore it could not be spoke of his <hi>humanity,</hi> that it was in the <hi>Decree</hi> of God before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> for <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the same <hi>Decree,</hi> must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Christs humanity,</hi> as the father of him: But suppose it were, let me enquire, was that being, which <hi>Christ</hi> had then in the knowledge or being of God before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> was that being existing when he spake these words, or no? If no, then he could not say <hi>I am,</hi> but <hi>I was</hi>; if so, it proves my Conclusion, that there was a <hi>nunc stans,</hi> a <hi>standing instant</hi> neare two thousand years. But I am well satisfied, that that speech, of his, was meant of his <hi>Divinity</hi> which is <hi>eternally</hi> the same, and was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> when <hi>Abraham</hi> was; and after him, he being that <hi>which is, which was, and is to come, Revelation</hi> 1.4. And certainly there must needs be the same reason, that that <hi>instant</hi> must be <hi>Eternall,</hi> as that it should <hi>stand still</hi> so long as before <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Saviour. But his words, presently after, seeme to make another reason of the absurdity in <hi>nunc stans,</hi> thus.</p>

            <p>NOw Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> if this Treatise come to your hand, as, it is likely, it may, give me leave to advise you a little with words that may lye by you, and so not passe sleightly away. You are a man, as I observe, in this <hi>Philosophy-treatise,</hi> of more then ordinary conceipt; you have spent much time in the search of <hi>Nature,</hi> although you are full of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes,</hi> and those not strengthened with any greater reason then your own Authority; yet they tast of a mighty <hi>Acumen ingenii,</hi> as likewise of a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious and working head, to contrive and bring those apparent Errors to such ends as you have brought them; but, good Sir, consider why do you so constantly in your <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and upon all occasions, so unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, take advantages to speak against the known, and most received Truths in <hi>Divinity</hi>? What need had you in this place to dispute the case of the <hi>Eternity</hi> of the World, and to say, that <hi>the question of the origin of the world should be left to those which are lawfully over us in ordering Divine worship, Pag. 237.</hi> Sir, we know who you meane by that from your <hi>Leviathan,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Supream Magistrate;</hi>

suppose he should be an <hi>Atheist,</hi> and deny the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;</hi> would you doe so likewise? you seem to be ready, and invite others to it, in scorning those reasons are brought for it, and labouring to weary the <hi>faith</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> man in it; It is true, <hi>Faith</hi> is able to support a fainting Soul against the distractions which wicked <hi>Reason</hi> can object; but it is a wicked Reason that troubles and distracts it. <hi>John 20.20.</hi> It is said of the <hi>Disciples,</hi> that <hi>they were glad when they saw the Lord</hi> after his Resurrection; not that they doubted of it before, they were not all <hi>Didy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musses;</hi> but Faith her self is comforted by Reason and visible experiments, as it is tyred and wearied in strugling against Reason. Consider with your self what you will answer Almighty God at the last day, when he shall say, <hi>I have assisted thee in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of so much Learning, how hast thou used it to my honour? why didst thou abuse it to my dishonour, in disputing against, and disturbing my poore servants from their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to those Divine truths I prescribed in my word?</hi> It will not serve your turn to say, You did it by <hi>Fate;</hi> for the same <hi>Fate</hi> will <hi>fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize</hi> you to a worse condition then that brought you to this, if you do not repent; it is not in this one point, but twentie more, you are guiltie

            <p>And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> do thou forgive the tediousness of this digression; in general, let me advise this, that if thou meetest with any of these <hi>muddy-souled</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which, with <hi>Thomas,</hi> will beleeve nothing but what they see, doe then consider our Saviours answer, <hi>Jo. 20.29.

Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> would have pleaded with God, <hi>there is no propriety in any thing; All men have title to all things; where is no coercive power upon earth, there is no injustice: the woman is any mans who can get her by fraud or force, so long as he can keep her; they who have no common power above them (as these had not) to make Lawes, which might appropriate interests to particular persons, these are bound to no law, nor have any propriety but such as force gives them</hi>; and then both <hi>Abimelek</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or other of them, might lawfully have kept <hi>Sarah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> wife from him; but the Principles of the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> say it was <hi>unjust,</hi> and they did not doe it.

First then, let me observe, that as in the beginning of this <hi>Chap.</hi> he define's <hi>right</hi> by equity, <hi>liberty</hi>;<note place="margin">Mr. Hobbes mistaken in his definition of Right, and division of it from Law.</note> so immediately after he define's <hi>liberty</hi> to be the <hi>absence of external impediments</hi>; and again a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, putting a distinction betwixt <hi>right</hi> and <hi>law,</hi> he saith, that <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> differ as much as <hi>Obligation</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> which in one and the same matter are <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi>; in which proposition he discovers a mighty weakness; for in his definition of <hi>right</hi> he make's it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> to doe what he <hi>will,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he make's it afterwards, when <hi>right</hi> implies an equitable title to what he doth; and a man may have <hi>right,</hi> when he hath not <hi>power</hi> to doe accordingly, but is hindred by <hi>externall impediments</hi> from acting according to his <hi>right</hi>; that definition of his is therefore very weak; for what he speaks, that <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> are <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent,</hi> I am so directly in my judgement against it, that I think there is no <hi>right</hi> to any thing but by <hi>law,</hi> which I will thus confirme by what followes.</p>

                     <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>wrong,</hi> or <hi>injury,</hi> are opposite termes; so that <hi>right</hi> is the convenience or agreement which one thing hath with another;<note place="margin">What right is properly, and what wrong.</note> and <hi>wrong</hi> is the disagreement; as it is a <hi>right line</hi> which agree's with the rule of streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; a crooked line or a <hi>wrong</hi> one, which deviates from those rules; a right shot that which hit's the white, and a <hi>wrong</hi> which misseth. So it is a <hi>right action</hi> which is according to the rules of Actions, and a <hi>wrong</hi> which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer's from them. These rules are that we call <hi>law,</hi> which regulate's our actions; and when they are done, accordingly they are <hi>right,</hi> and we have <hi>right</hi> to doe them; and to this purpose, he said in the preceding <hi>Chap.</hi>

may observe then in the 9.

Or, methinkes, it was like entercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners in the same pasture; every entercommoner hath right to the whole Common, and his Cattle hath right to feed in any place, and eate what they will, and can get, and so hath every mans Cattle that entercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munes with him, they have all the same right; yet that which any mans Cattle hath seised on, is proper only to those Cattle, and when he hath mouthed any grass, it is an injustice in another entercommoner to take that away out of his mouth, which his Cattle had seised upon; So was it with those sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> they were entercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners of the world, they might, <hi>de jure, any one,</hi> seize upon <hi>any thing, any part</hi> of it, and being seized of it, it was then his, and he had a propriety in that which before he was only a Commoner of; this was the donation of

God, and they were all put out into their Common; and you shall find, not long after, how they took their shares and severall possessions, and from thence forward it was unlawfull to dispossesse any of what they were seised. For my part I cannot beleeve, as some men, that are over-wise, do think, that the world was divided by consent amongst such a handfull of men, none of all which, I can guesse, knew half the world; but, as I expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before,<note place="margin">They had not the world di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among them by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but by casual occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancy, or choice, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them thought fit.</note> being entercommoners thrust into the same Common, as they found places fit for them, and not possessed of others, they entred upon them, and enjoyed them, and those places they enjoyed in common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and every one had a title to them before that entrance; but afterwards the possessed enjoyed by their private title; and it were injustice to defraud them of those possessions.</p>

First, the Conclusion (as he expresseth it,) is no where delivered in the Schooles; for with one consent, unlesse some passages in <hi>Gregorius Ariminensis,</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi> expounded otherwise, The Schooles, both old and later agree to deliver, that <hi>Heaven or Glory</hi> (which he calls Paradise) <hi>is merited ex Condigno</hi>; because that righteous men, acting such things by the assistance of God's <hi>grace,</hi> in the mystical union with Christ their head, to which God hath promised heaven, heaven is <hi>due</hi> to them, as a <hi>reward</hi> of such actions, not for their owne' excellency in an <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> proportion, as some;<note place="margin">How other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Schooles.</note> but a <hi>Geometrieal</hi>; or as others, by their <hi>Arithmetical</hi> proportion taken <hi>vertually,</hi> as a seed is vertually a Tree, and hath abilities vertually, as a tree hath actually; so these gracious acts have glory <hi>vertually</hi> in them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the seed of glory; and then, although God can be no <hi>debtor</hi> to any mans <hi>Merits</hi>; yet, he having put such a <hi>prise</hi> upon them in his Gospell, these have such a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>due</hi> to them, not out of <hi>Congruity</hi> onely, but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity,</hi> at which rate God doth value them, by his stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard; but then as they say; <hi>Heaven</hi> is <hi>merited</hi> by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>ex Condigno,</hi> so they say that these <hi>Graces,</hi> which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable a man to <hi>merit heaven ex Condigno,</hi> by Gods <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> those graces are <hi>merited, ex Congruo,</hi> by that man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is justified or righteous; so that then to understand the distinction better, lest a Reader should be misguided by him who is no way acquainted with School-Divinity, know that <hi>Merit ex Condigno</hi> necessarily requires a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>

but <hi>ex Congruo</hi> none. The first can never faile, because founded upon <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>title</hi>; the other may, because built onely upon <hi>Grace,</hi> as thus; a man promiseth that he who fights this day well shall be made a <hi>Captaine</hi>; or a King promiseth that he who plead's such a cause ably shall be made a <hi>Judge</hi>; these places are <hi>due</hi> to him who doth it; there is another, who by industry in the Law hath greater abilities then he, and hath pleaded a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred causes better; another man who hath fought in twenty battailes better, yet not being imployed in these services to which the promise was made, they <hi>deserve</hi> those places <hi>ex Congruo,</hi> but the other <hi>ex Condigno</hi>; the one is truly, and as truly <hi>merit</hi> as the other, but he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves</hi> it not legally out of a <hi>law</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> but his owne <hi>vertue,</hi> and the gallantry of his Commander in chiefe who <hi>rewards vertue</hi>; or thus, he who meeting a poore man in necessity shall bargaine with him to pay him doubly for those Clothes he supplies him with when he comes to a better fortune, which he then adventures upon: when he doth come to such a Condition the other <hi>merits</hi> that <hi>ex Condigno,</hi> he must &amp; ought to have it payd, it is his due; the who seeing that or such another in that sad case should, without any <hi>compact,</hi> supply him, when he came to a happier estate, <hi>ex Congruo merits</hi> a returne from him; although he cannot claime any thing upon <hi>debt</hi> or <hi>due,</hi> yet out of <hi>Congruity</hi> it is fit he should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. I do not here justifie the distinction in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication by the Schoole-men, but onely set downe my observation of his unjust dealing with them, and how unlike their meaning is to his; for the <hi>Prise</hi> he speaks of, which is proposed to him who <hi>winneth it out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> that man who gaineth it hath it out of right of <hi>Condignity,</hi> not out <hi>of the equality his worke hath</hi> to the

                  <p>And this is also to be gathered <hi>out of the ordinary defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Iustice in the Schooles; for they say, that</hi> Justice is the constant rule of giving to every man his own: <hi>And therefore where there is no owne, that is, no propriety, there is no Injustice, and where there is no coercive Power erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, where there is no Commonwealth, there is no propriety, all men having Right to all things: Therefore where there is no Commonwealth, there nothing is unjust.</hi>] I am glad to find him speaking something in the <hi>Schooles,</hi> although not fully approving it: the <hi>definition</hi> shall passe without any further trouble; although I thinke it not perfect yet it will prove much better then any thing he hath produced.

yet was never granted to men in this world.

Thus have men <hi>Philosophiz'd</hi> by reason: but the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is not filled with this; as you may observe a Country-man, when he see's another write, walke, speake, and the like, he can tell you, these are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of some excellent principles in that man who doth them; ask him, what it is? he can, with all the world, tell you, it is his <hi>Soule</hi>; but ask, what that <hi>Soule</hi> is? he is at a stand, he knowe's nothing of it; such are our thoughts of God, from whose works of his we know there is a cause which bringe's these mighty things to passe, which we call God; but what that God is, who doth them, we are at a losse, by all the reason man can find out; for as a dog can apprehend his master's kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to him, or his anger, yet cannot know the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Master's Wisdome, power, &amp;c. because he is in a lower rank of things then man is; much lesse is man able to reach at that infinite excellency of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many degrees much lower then God, than any Creature is below man. This is the knowledge a man may have of God; if there be any thing else, it must be that other way, in which many Divines have trod, besides these negatives of imperfections, to conceive these things we call perfections to be in a much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely excellent manner in him who is God: So a husbandman may know that a learned man exceed's him in knowledge, and that this knowledge is in divine, naturall, and morall things; but what that knowledge of his is, he cannot tell, unlesse that learned man reveale it to him; so it is in respect of God,<note place="margin">None positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, but by revelation.</note> we know he hath excellencies beyond us, that these consist in these or these eminencies; but what is the nature of these emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, no man can know, but he to whom God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale's them; yet he cannot choose but desire to know

make's man's happinesse to consist in the enjoying the world, or in a Complacencie or contentment with other men; yet, when he make's death so fearfull a thing, as he doth, it is in vaine for that man to look for happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, who knowe's he must die, when he shall lose this happinesse, and he may dy this day, and suddenly lose it, by that which he, and such men, make their greatest evill, <hi>death</hi>: so that <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and his Sect, went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> and spake more justifiably, out of these Principles, then he did.

                     </note> yet certainly it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare's a miserable shift in this place; first, observe here, that there is in this sentence, [<hi>whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting</hi>] no word which in any place of the Bible is pretended to signify a <hi>Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> or <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>Ancestors</hi>; if no where else, why should it be so here then? nay; here is not any one word, that by any interpretation, or wresting, can signify <hi>forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> which were before, but only the <hi>times</hi> in which they lived; if they will read it their own way, which is <hi>ab initio &amp; priscis diebus,</hi> this can only intimate the <hi>time</hi> in which this <hi>egression</hi> was, not the <hi>person</hi> from whom it was. Next, consider that if this <hi>emanation,</hi> this <hi>egression,</hi> here, be understood of his <hi>birth</hi> in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that as <hi>Socinus</hi> disputed, our <hi>Saviour</hi> must be born there, when this was done in it, and yet he, <hi>Smalcius, Valkelius,</hi> all agree, it doth meane that <hi>egression,</hi> that <hi>Birth</hi>; but, <hi>Smalcius</hi> in tertiam partem <hi>Smig.

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:56958:178"/>
how this phrase of <hi>being from the beginning</hi> and <hi>in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient times,</hi> should be applyed to that <hi>birth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem</hi>; but the unreasonablenesse of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare's (besides my former reasons) in that there is not the least tending to such an expression out of this, that such a phrase added no distinct knowledge of this Ruler, which should be borne, more then was before; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man had his rise from most eminent Progenitors, <hi>yea, but this was one born in</hi> Bethlehem; why all that were borne in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> must needs be so; <hi>yea, but this was descended</hi> ab initio, <hi>that is, from</hi> David, <hi>who was the beginning of that kingdome of Israel</hi>; so were many more, no doubt, who were borne in <hi>Bethlehem</hi>: In my judgement, this Text is the most wretchedly tortured by them, that ever any, when no one word in the Text ever else was used to that purpose; nor in this use is a man taught any thing which was not full in the Text before, which expressed his <hi>birth in</hi> Bethlehem.</p>

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:56958:178"/>
but this is our consideration, the Text saith of him, <hi>who shall be borne in</hi> Bethlehem, but yet is not; that <hi>his goings forth have been from of old</hi>; now untill a man <hi>is,</hi> he cannot be said, to have his <hi>going forth from of old</hi>; a man may say it <hi>will be</hi>; not that it <hi>hath been</hi>; and therefore, without doubt, this Text, speaking of the same person, which he said should be <hi>borne in Bethlehem [whose goings forth</hi>] we must understand by it something of that person which was in those <hi>ancient times,</hi> which can be nothing but our <hi>Saviour's divinity</hi>; but they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject against this Phrase, that it is said <hi>goings forth,</hi> in the plurall number; now according to true doctrine, our <hi>Saviour's divinity</hi> hath but one <hi>emanation,</hi> or <hi>egression,</hi> or <hi>going forth,</hi> therefore, say they, this cannot be understood of that <hi>egression.</hi> That our <hi>Saviour's Egression,</hi> according to his <hi>divinity,</hi> was but one, will easily be granted by us; but it is excellently observed by <hi>Hebricians,</hi>

a man may object, that all this is but one <hi>goeing forth</hi>; it is true, but yet, that one contayne's in it ten hundred thousand <hi>goings forth,</hi> like that Sun which perpetually shine's forth its light, that emanation or <hi>goeing forth</hi> of light is one continued Act, yet measuring it by <hi>dayes,</hi> or time, it hath divers <hi>goeings forth,</hi> according to divers <hi>dayes,</hi> in which it shined, <hi>yesterday,</hi> the other <hi>day,</hi> &amp;c. so may I say of this <hi>eternall emanation,</hi> or <hi>goeing forth,</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> from his <hi>Father,</hi> it was one <hi>eternall egression</hi> or <hi>goeing forth</hi>; but measuring it by <hi>dayes,</hi> as it is here, it was an hundred thousand, his goeings forth were in the <hi>dayes</hi> of <hi>age</hi> or <hi>time,</hi> as <hi>they,</hi> or of <hi>eternity,</hi> as <hi>we</hi> read it. Thus I conceive, that the errours of the <hi>Photinian,</hi> or <hi>Socinian,</hi> and the <hi>Arian,</hi> are both convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of this, and it is proved, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> had not onely a being, before his birth at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but from all <hi>eternity</hi>; this by the way of <hi>egression</hi> or <hi>emanation</hi>

of <hi>Mary,</hi> as he terme's her; for although he grant's him an additionall after his baptisme, by the descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of <hi>Christ</hi> unto him; yet that person had no being before, and that additionall was long after his birth of the <hi>blessed Virgin</hi>; and it is not expressed that he thought that <hi>Christ,</hi> which came into <hi>Jesus,</hi> had any being before that coming down; And <hi>Tertullian adversus haereticos Num.</hi> 312. affirme's of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> that he say'd, [<hi>Christ was onely a man, without Divinity</hi>] to which that of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> well enough agree's; I quote <hi>Tertullian</hi> now in <hi>Pamelius</hi> his edition, 1617. So that there, it seem's, that <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> concerning our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Divinity, had the same opinion with <hi>Socinus.</hi> Well, to goe on with the story of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> he was a man of a most turbulent Spirit; <hi>Epiphanius</hi> saith, <hi>he was the man that raised the charge against</hi> St. Peter <hi>at</hi> Jerusalem,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epiphanius con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra haeret.</hi> tom. 2. cap. 28</note> 
                     <hi>for communicating with the</hi> Gentiles, Acts 11. <hi>in the Case of</hi> Cornelius; as likewise, <hi>that he raised the tumult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> St. Paul, <hi>about Circumcision,</hi> with a whole leafe of such schismaticall practices of his; for they say, he was a <hi>Jew</hi> by his Father, and so stood, still, for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of their Nation, and the observation of their Rites; upon this ground the loving Spirit of St. <hi>John,</hi> justly abhorred him, and therefore, as <hi>Irenaeus in his third Book, and third Chapter, there are some who have heard</hi> Polycarpus <hi>report,</hi> &amp;c. (which <hi>Polycarpus</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> by St. <hi>John,</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi> and all agree, and that <hi>Angell</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> writ to, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 2.8.) <hi>he,</hi> say'd <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (who, himselfe had seene <hi>Polycarpus) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that</hi> St. John, <hi>goeing to wash himselfe in the Bath</hi> at Ephesus, <hi>saw</hi> Cerinthus, <hi>and presently hasted out againe, unwashed, saying, that he might feare the Bath would fall,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:56958:184"/>
where was that enemy of the Truth</hi> Cerinthus; so that here you see two things, that the Opinion of <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was much the same with that of the <hi>Socinians</hi>; that this <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was abhorred by St. <hi>John,</hi> not as a man, but as an enemy to truth; so that St. <hi>John,</hi> hating his opinions, might be reasonably thought to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; and all this evident out of that most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Author, which <hi>Socinus</hi> himselfe quote's; now let us see, <hi>de facto,</hi> what was done: The same Author, <hi>Irenaeus, in his eleventh Chapter of his third Book,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before the midle of that Chapter, affirme's in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse termes, <hi>that</hi> St. <hi>John was willing, by his declaring the Gospell, to take away the errour of</hi> Cerinthus; then which we could have nothing more cleare, a most Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique Author affirming it, upon most just and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable grounds; <hi>Socinus</hi> then say'd too much, when he affirmed, that <hi>it was farre from all reason, that</hi> Saint John <hi>should write against</hi> Ebion <hi>and</hi> Cerinthus; here we see the contrary, as much as it is possible for story to give; but he dispute's againe against it page 7. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde versimile non est, &amp;c. Moreover it is not likely that</hi> John <hi>would passe over so great a matter so slightly with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but that he would name the haeretiques, or at the least their haeresy, either secretly, or openly, and detest it; which since he hath not done, why did he not somewhere clearely say, that</hi> Christ was by nature God and Man, <hi>or</hi> that he existed before he was born of <hi>Mary? why did he affect to be so obscure and sparing, in a thing of so great moment, the ignorance whereof bring's eternall destruction, &amp;c.</hi> thus farre he; I will not undertake to understand all the Apostle's reasons, but am confident, he had abundance of reason for all he did, but will answer all he sayth; first that the <hi>Scripture</hi> seldome set's down the <hi>haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi>
                     <pb n="322" facs="tcp:56958:185"/>
or <hi>haeresyes</hi> against which it write's, although some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it doth. Secondly, to that he saith the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth not clearly witnesse that <hi>Christ was by nature God and Man,</hi> or <hi>existed before he was born of Mary,</hi> I shall shew him that he hath, in as cleare termes, as possibly could be, although not in the same; and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,<note place="margin">The shifts of the <hi>Socinians.</hi>
                     </note> that had he expressed this Mystery in those very words he set's down, he and his Companions would have cavilled at them, that those Termes are used o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise in some places; that there was some Copy, or other, without one of them, or all; that they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to something before, or behind, and not to <hi>Christ</hi>; which are their usuall evasions; but it is a vanity of them to teach the Apostle how he should expresse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he hath done it abundantly, and as clearly, as those words would doe, as we shall see shortly.</p>

                  <p>To which I shall say first, that these <hi>figures</hi> are often used by <hi>Christ,</hi>

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56958:187"/>
would hardly assent to him in any but a literal sense. There are abundance of other such like names affirmed of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> besides those particularly specified by him in this place, all which to handle would require a Volume: I will not therefore engage upon them, but these, he instanceth in now, I will touch upon, that by them the rest may be discerned: First then he call's himself a <hi>vine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">So that of a vine.</note> John 15.1. <hi>I am the true vine,</hi> that is, I am <hi>like</hi> a true vine, a <hi>true,</hi> not a <hi>false</hi> vine, which look's like a vine, but is not a true vine, that may be confided in, which will bring forth fruit, and not deceive the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman: now that ye may discern the similitude, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, he adde's, <hi>my Father is the husbandman,</hi> and so go's on with the <hi>branches:</hi> which evidently shew that it is a Similitude. For the second, John 10.11. <hi>I am the good shepheard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Shepheard.</note> he explain's it immediately, <hi>a good shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard giveth his life for his sheep,</hi> and so along in that chapter he shew's how his <hi>sheep</hi> are <hi>righteous,</hi> which make's it apparent that it was a Similitude. Again, his last <hi>Metaphor</hi> is used in the same chapter, ver. 7. <hi>I am the Door of the sheep</hi>;<note place="margin">A Doore.</note> we see he was the <hi>shepheard,</hi> and he is the <hi>door,</hi> in a diverse sense; as he is the <hi>door,</hi> he admit's, and shut's out: now these things are so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that the words all about them express them to be Similitudes; if not, a thousand places of Scripture might teach us, that he could not otherwise be a <hi>Wooden door</hi>; or a <hi>vine,</hi> that is, a <hi>plant</hi>; or a <hi>shepheard,</hi> such as a countrey-<hi>shepheard,</hi> whose sheep were beasts. Now let us examine his <hi>Metonymy:</hi> He saith, he is the <hi>truth, life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of being the Truth, Life, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>resurrection</hi>; two of these I find in one sentence in the 14. of this Gospel the 6. <hi>I am,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>the way, the truth, and the life: Truth and Life</hi> are his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; our <hi>Saviour</hi> having told the Disciples ver. 4.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:56958:187"/>
                     <hi>Whither I go, ye know, and the way ye know:</hi> Thomas <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, Lord, we know not whither thou goest, how can we then know the way? Jesus</hi> answered to this, <hi>I am the way, the truth, the life</hi>; in this word, <hi>the way,</hi> no doubt but there may be both those figures he speakes of; a <hi>Metaphor</hi> first, for as a <hi>way</hi> is that <hi>Middle</hi> place which is between the two Termes (<hi>à quo</hi> and <hi>ad quem) from whence, and whither,</hi> participating of both and leading whither a man tend's; so our <hi>Saviour,</hi> God and man, participating of both the extreames, heaven and earth; and Man, walking a long by him, shall come to heaven; next we may observe a <hi>Metonymy,</hi> he was the <hi>way,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by his word he direct's us the way; because by his life he hath trod it out for us; and by his graces he help's us to walke in it; and this is apparent to any man who shall consider how impossible it is, for <hi>Christ</hi> to be a <hi>way,</hi> a trodden path of ground; or how impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it is for any such way to lead to the Journeyes end, which he aimed at.</p>
                  <p>The second Terme which is mentioned by <hi>Socinus</hi> is <hi>Truth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>life</hi> may be taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a figure.</note> and for this I may say that I doubt whether there be any figure necessary; for <hi>Christ,</hi> as God, being <hi>Truth</hi> it self, he must needs likewise be <hi>verax, true spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> as well as <hi>verus</hi>; and if he should deceive or misguide in the way, he should go against his nature, and deny himselfe, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> phraseth it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. now I can justly say that here is no <hi>figure</hi>; or, if any, it is but this, which the context exact's, <hi>I am the way, by directing you to it, and that an infallible one, which no man can be deceived by, for I am truth its self,</hi> which make's good all I have said; and the same I may speake of his last Terme (<hi>Life</hi>) I may justly affirme that there needs be no <hi>figure</hi> in it; <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>life,</hi> there is an Article to

every Terme, <hi>life</hi> its selfe, <hi>life</hi> in the fountaine; all other <hi>lives</hi> are <hi>Peters, Pauls,</hi> a horse's or dog's <hi>life,</hi> but he is <hi>life</hi> its self, <hi>life</hi> in the fountaine, like light in the Sun, much more glorious then any other; therefore <hi>thou, who seekest life, life eternal, which is the journeys end of every man, must come by the way which I appoint who am</hi> Truth; <hi>and come to me, and thou shalt have it.</hi> I know as he is <hi>life</hi> in the fountain, and so may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; so he may be a <hi>life</hi> to us, and called <hi>our life,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of men, of which hereafter, both as an effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and an object; as an efficient producing that life; as an object, that life of ours consisting in the <hi>beatificall vision</hi> of the most sacred and <hi>blessed Trinity</hi>; but I see no necessity forcing me to this second exposition; but if so the context lead's to it, I think I may run through Twenty more, and certainly there are Twenty more, such speeches; but we shall find that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the matter of the discourse, or in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Text, which induce to it; but in that I have in hand nothing to perswade any man that this Term (<hi>word</hi>) should be understood according to any of those <hi>figures.</hi>

terms; now consider if he had said, that <hi>no man ascended into heaven, but he that descended, who was in heaven</hi>; what would this last clause adde to the rest? <hi>no man can</hi> ascend up to heaven, <hi>but then he must be</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>no man can</hi> descend from heaven, <hi>but then, when he</hi> descended, <hi>he must be there:</hi> and this is apparent to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, upon the repeating of the very Terms, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand's them; and therefore if it should be constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>who</hi> was <hi>in heaven,</hi> there must be something more in it then I can discern, or else it is a Tautology; but no such thing, taking it, <hi>who</hi> is <hi>in heaven,</hi> because that was neither expresly nor impliedly delivered before; so then, to understand this Text, we may go two wayes, either take these words figuratively, and that <hi>Socinus</hi> seem's to allow in his 7. chap. against the 10. of <hi>Wiceus</hi> thus; a man may be said to <hi>ascend</hi> into heaven, as I spake before (as <hi>Socrates</hi>) by contemplation, and to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend</hi> by looking down and busieing himself about the things of this world; so God is said to <hi>humble himself,</hi> to <hi>behold the things that are in heaven and earth,</hi> and he is in heaven, now at this instant, who contemplate's divine Excellencies, even in this Discourse. Or else we may expound it thus, according to those two natures which were in that one person; <hi>no man ascended,</hi> &amp;c. Christ's <hi>humanity</hi> was elevated by the incarnation and union it had with his Divinity; it was a great <hi>descent</hi> of his <hi>Divinity,</hi> to be united to his <hi>Humanity,</hi> and by this <hi>Divinity</hi> he is still in heaven; and this mightily enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his Argument to prove what went before to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus; If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</hi> he reprove's them for not <hi>believing</hi> him, who onely can tell them, being the onely person who is acquainted truly

Now, Reader, consider how unfit this answer is for their months; certainly, if then <hi>in the beginning</hi> he did go up to heaven in his <hi>Humanity,</hi> he was as much a <hi>Priest</hi> then as the <hi>Word,</hi> for he was not, nor could be, the <hi>Word</hi> by their Doctrine, untill he delivered the Will of God; that he could not do, untill he received his Commission

and direction from God; if they say, he had it by the <hi>decree</hi> and <hi>predetermination</hi> of God; it is answered, that undoubtedly so was his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and therefore he was then as much <hi>Priest</hi> as <hi>Word</hi>; and if it might be said, <hi>the word was with God,</hi> a man may say, <hi>the Priest was with him,</hi> which that Text to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> denye's, because it saith, <hi>he entred but once into the holy place,</hi> which was <hi>after</hi> his death, therefore, could not be said to do it <hi>before</hi>; this Argument, thus pressed, I have not read urged by others, and I do not know, how they can avoid it; well then, I know not of any thing more need be said to these words; we see them inconsistent with <hi>their</hi> glosse, and not agreeing to <hi>ours,</hi> who hold, that the <hi>word</hi> is eternally produced and <hi>with God.</hi>

providence, and the like; but these internal excellencies which are onely in God, and onely work as one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the outward works, concerning the Creation or Government of the world, these he hath no occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on further to busie his Soul about; but then when they are revealed by <hi>faith,</hi> a contemplative Soul ambitiously strive's how he may climb up to them by <hi>reason.</hi> These permitted, I shall undertake the Question.</p>

                     <hi>Aquinas</hi> himself, who indeed hath spoken as fully as any of his followers; his discourse is in <hi>prima parte Quest.</hi> 32 <hi>Art. primo in corpore: I answer</hi> (saith he) <hi>It must be said,</hi> that it is impossible, by <hi>naturall reason,</hi> to come to the knowledge of the <hi>Trinity</hi> of the divine persons; <hi>for it is proved before</hi> (which is <hi>Quest.</hi> 12. <hi>Art</hi> 12. <hi>in corpore) that man,</hi> by naturall reason, <hi>cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the knowledge of God by the Creatures, but the Creature induce's to the knowledge of God, as effects induce to the knowledge of the cause; that therefore onely can be known of God, which is necessary to be affirmed of him, as he is the beginning and cause of the creatures, but the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive vertue of God is common to the whole</hi> Trinity, <hi>therefore it appertaine's to the</hi> unity <hi>of the</hi> essence, <hi>not to the</hi> Trinity <hi>of the</hi> persons.

Lully,</hi> whom I most honour, in this case, hath thought of other wayes of arguing, of as great force and convincing a man's understanding as these, to wit <hi>demonstratio per aequiparantiam,</hi> by the <hi>proportion</hi> and <hi>equality</hi> of things, and <hi>per similitudimem,</hi> by their <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> that by <hi>equiparance</hi> or <hi>equivalence</hi> he conceiveth to be, when by one or two of an <hi>equall</hi> excellencie an other quality is proved to be as excellent; as thus; because God is infinitely <hi>excellent,</hi> therefore he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>knowing,</hi> infinitely <hi>good</hi>; againe this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>equivalence</hi> may be brought from the <hi>power</hi> to the <hi>acts,</hi> thus; the <hi>act</hi> is proportioned to he <hi>power</hi>; where is an infinite <hi>power,</hi> there is an infinite <hi>act</hi>; where a finite <hi>power,</hi> there but a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>act</hi>; now by these wayes I apprehend that a man may prove the <hi>Trinity,</hi> although not by the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of God in the Creature, as <hi>effects.</hi>

                  <p>His second Argument is, that to prove the <hi>Trinity</hi> by <hi>reason</hi> were derogatory from <hi>faith,</hi>

                  <p>To this I answer, that from the same inconvenience, the infinite <hi>creating power</hi> and <hi>act</hi> of <hi>creating</hi> were not proveable by <hi>reason,</hi> which is an article of our <hi>faith,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, I answer, that although these things of <hi>faith</hi> are <hi>unseen</hi> by <hi>mere naturall</hi> men, without all <hi>faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Bishop's second answer concerning the after-sight of Reason.</note> yet when a man hath <hi>faith,</hi> then that light of <hi>faith,</hi> may shew him this or that thing of them, and his <hi>Reason</hi> may afterwards likewise discern it; for you may conceive a
