            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Find by Experience, that it is nothing but the <hi>Narrownes</hi> of our <hi>Spirits</hi> that makes us miſerable; for if our Hearts were enlarged beyond our ſelves, and opened to lay hold of the <hi>Advantages</hi> which God doth offer, whereby we may become joyntly ſerviceable unto one another in <hi>Publicke Concernments</hi>; we could not be without <hi>Lucriferous Employments</hi> for our ſelves; <hi>nor Unfruitfull</hi> to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as now for the moſt part we are, only becauſe we mind not the <hi>Objects</hi> of that <hi>Induſtriouſneſs,</hi> which without a mutuall Concurrence cannot be advanced.

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, the <hi>ſuppoſed Impoſſibility</hi> of performing (on my part) the thing promiſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Newneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Invention</hi> or <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi> which renders it within the liſt of things ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>

            <p>Firſt, upon moſt aſſured, and generally experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented grounds I affirme; that one Acre of good
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42811:10"/>
ground to be ſowed with <hi>Wheate</hi> in the more <hi>uſuall way</hi> of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> will (one place in this Nation with another) require the <hi>charges</hi> or <hi>expence</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

(now more) twice ploughing, ſowing, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing &amp;c. uſually 10. s. (now more) for weeding 3 s. for reaping &amp;c. 6. s. 8. d. for fencing one (Acre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many) 3. s. 4. d. which in all amounts to 3. pound <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>9. s. 10. d. out of which deduct 20. s. which will remaine to be accompted with the following crops, in reſpect of the vertue of the dung remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill in the land. Thus the <hi>Charge</hi> of ſowing one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of <hi>Wheate,</hi> amounts to 2. pound 19. s. 10. d. and for the returne of this, it is not unuſuall to have 3.4. or 5. quarters: But take it at the leſſer, and more generally certain rate, of three quarters on an Acre, and value that at the more conſtant and leſſer price, of 5 s. a buſhel, or 40. s. a quarter; yet the returne amounts to 6. pound, which is double to the charge. I could illuſtrate this with many other examples as full: but let this ſuffice.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond I ſay, that the <hi>Newneſſe</hi> of my better <hi>way</hi> of planting or diſpoſing of Corne into the ground, ſo as (God bleſſing my endeavours) to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a yet greater increaſe; is ſo farre (well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) from being a reaſon to hinder: that it is to me, and may be to others (when once rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) a <hi>ſpurre</hi> to haſten towards ſuch an <hi>Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or conjunction: When it is conſidered that the <hi>Invention</hi> is yet our own, entirely; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt juſt and ready way to wealth and all that outward honour &amp; happineſſe (that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42811:10"/>
riches well gotten) is open to us, and to us prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally; we having the opportunity (while we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for, and open the door to ſo great a <hi>Publique Good</hi>) to Chriſten our own childe firſt (as they ſay) which alſo is moſt lawful, and appointed, that <hi>the Ox that treadeth out the fodder, ſhall not be muzled.</hi> Which of all thoſe (almoſt infinite) wayes or means, by which man hath been made Inſtrumental to the increaſe of his own well-being, was not in one age or other, as <hi>new</hi> as this <hi>Invention</hi> of <hi>mine</hi> doth ſeem to be in this?</p>
            <p>Certainly it is not the <hi>Newneſſe,</hi> but the <hi>Vanity</hi> or <hi>Invalidity</hi> of any <hi>Invention,</hi> that layes it open to the <hi>diſlike</hi> of the more <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>Noble</hi> perſons: Or if the <hi>Newneſſe</hi> of an <hi>Invention</hi> can any way render it fit to be <hi>ſuſpected,</hi> it is onely in ſuch as being altogether <hi>New,</hi> ſeem alſo to diſagree with <hi>Natural reaſon,</hi> and treade quite beſide the path of Experience: Of this kinde it would be, if a man ſhould pretend to make bread of ſtones; but to ſay, that I can make more or better bread of the ſame <hi>Wheate,</hi> will appear impoſſible to none but inconſiderate perſons. And the thing which I hold forth is nothing elſe, but to ſcrew the moſt profound <hi>Myſtery</hi> of good <hi>Husbandry</hi> a note or two higher; but to do the ſame thing by a better way, and to more advantage.</p>
            <p>To the the third and laſt, before I anſwer I will ſo farre digreſſe, as to enquire, what is or can be here meant by <hi>Security</hi>? If it be required in the moſt high and ſtrict ſence, 'tis vaine and impoſſible to be had in humane affaires, and is not to be had or hoped for in this world, where <hi>the Moth and ruſt do corrupt, and where thieves break through and ſteal:</hi> this is only to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42811:11"/>
be had in Heaven; and can be no way procured on Earth; but by laying up the Treaſures of GOOD WORKES: Therefore he that will put forth his money upon good <hi>Security</hi> indeed, muſt vent it in the wayes of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> as relating to Gods glory and his ſoules <hi>Eternal happineſſe</hi>; at leaſt in a way of bounty and nobleneſſe for the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good</hi> of his Neighbour and <hi>Native Countrey,</hi> as relating to his good fame after death. But if by <hi>ſecurity</hi> be meant ſomething more moderate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, onely a <hi>providential care</hi> to defend a mans ſelfe from being abuſed; ſo farre as ſuch proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are juſt, and agreeable to good reaſon, and the Nature of the thing in queſtion, I allow; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it altogether: but not when it rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from frowardneſſe, baſe and groundleſſe ſuſpition, and a naturall averſneſſe and enmity to all good. Thus when a man lends to another <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically</hi> as a meer man, he requires <hi>bills, bonds, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages,</hi> or the like. But if he gives, he doth not ſo, neither if he lend to the Poor, or to perſons ſo juſt that he eſteems their word ſufficient. I ſuppoſe there are very many in <hi>London,</hi> that do frequently take up great ſums without giving any formal <hi>ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>; nay that would take it for a great afront to have ſuch a thing required of them; and yet ſurely it is no abſolute <hi>miracle</hi> to ſee ſuch a one break; why then are men ſo eaſie in that, and ſo difficult in this? or is it for the mutual <hi>Advance</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi>? why, that very argument ſerves here too; unleſſe they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to advance no trade, but their own. And even that alſo comes in here; for what trade can more advance the Engagers <hi>Private,</hi> then that which is faithfully driven on for the <hi>Proſperity</hi> of him
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42811:11"/>
and his Poſterity? Or what can more <hi>magnify</hi> a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>populous City,</hi> then to ſtand in the midſt of a <hi>fertile ſoile,</hi> that affords her plenty and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all good things, which is already the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of <hi>London</hi>? and this happineſſe ſhall by this meanes, <hi>by Gods bleſſing</hi> given unto and upon this <hi>means,</hi> be continually encreaſed.</p>
            <p>Again, it is <hi>rationall,</hi> when men lend money for <hi>little</hi> or <hi>no advantage</hi> to themſelves, but onely to do their friend a courteſie; it is but <hi>reaſonable,</hi> that they ſhould by all good meanes <hi>ſecure</hi> the repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their principall. But when men put forth their moneys in hope of <hi>great Advantage,</hi> they muſt, and do uſually forbear to ſtand upon ſuch preciſe <hi>Security</hi>; rightly conſidering, that <hi>Gods providence</hi> is (as the beſt <hi>Inheritance</hi>; ſo alſo) the beſt <hi>Security</hi> that can be named, and will not faile to returne with a bleſſing, any thing that ſhall be thereto intruſted faithfully. Thus, what other <hi>Security</hi> (more then <hi>rational Probabilities</hi>) hath the <hi>Souldier</hi>; that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures his life, limbs, liberty and all, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other <hi>Security</hi> then a good <hi>conſcience,</hi> (or a <hi>good confidence</hi> at leaſt) in life or death; reſting in that ſucceſſe the <hi>Lord of hoaſts</hi> ſhal pleaſe to appoint. Thus the <hi>Merchant</hi> puts (if not alwayes himſelfe; yet) his Eſtate into a weak wooden veſſel; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it to the mercy of the winds and waves, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet up his reſt in the goodneſſe of that God that parted the Red-Sea by his power. Thus, the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſt</hi> layes out much money in ſincking his pits and quarries, onely in hope to finde that richer veine he conceives to be there. Thus the <hi>Patient</hi> commits his life health and eaſe (under God) into the <hi>phyſitians</hi> hands, as relying on his care and skill.

I ſay, that all theſe, and many more, even all men in almoſt all humane actions, runne ſome kind of <hi>hazard</hi>; and more or leſſe do and muſt <hi>depend</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods <hi>mercy</hi> and mans <hi>integrity,</hi> without any other outward formal <hi>Security.</hi> Thus alſo do I propound (and that upon <hi>Probabilities</hi> as <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> (if not more as any of theſe) that we may agree, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and ſowe in hope; that that God that never ſuffers hope (rightly placed) to be fruſtrate; may make us <hi>return and bear our ſheafes with us,</hi> may make our <hi>valleys ſtand ſo thick with Corne, hat they ſhall laugh and ſing.</hi> Which that it may be thus, ſhall alwayes be the faithfull deſire and earneſt prayer of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir,</p>

            <p>SIr, by what is above ſaid, and by many other ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evident reaſons, it is or may be proved, that in ſuch a caſe as this, it is not much <hi>rational</hi> to demand any other <hi>Security</hi> then the <hi>Propounders</hi> own obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

I OFFER &amp; am content, that if the <hi>Subſcribers</hi> and conſequently <hi>Engagers</hi> ſhall think fit to meet, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves chuſe three ſuch as I ſhall alſo like of, I will endeavour to give them (in the behalf, and as the <hi>Truſtees</hi> of and for all the reſt) ſome more plain and ſatisfactory <hi>Security,</hi> which is impoſſible to be done to every particular perſon, that ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps underwrite and engage onely 25. pound. or ſome ſuch <hi>ſum.</hi>
