            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OR
Covent-Garden Morning Frolick.</head>
            <head type="sub">Being an Account of ſome Odd and Humorous Pranks which were play'd off Yeſterday
Morning between Three Perſons of Fortune and Peg Tear'em a Waſherwoman.</head>
            <p>THAT merry Monarch King Charles the Second, was not only highly delighted with the
mad Pranks of the Earl of Rocheſter and other Courtiers, but often made one himſelf in
their humerous Adventures; but of all their Tricks none came up to this, which is as follows.
Three Gentlemen of high Rank, in a frolickſome Humour, met with a poor Waſherwoman
under the little Piazza in Covent-Garden about three o'Clock in the Morning, who was going
to a Day's Work; <q>'s Blood, Jack, ſays one, let's ſee if this Woman has not got Run-goods
about her</q> and immediately began to rummage her lower Apartments. Says Margery, <q>I
aſſure you, Gentlemen, you will find nothing there but what has been fairly Enter'd; and if you
will but put your Noſes to it, you will be convinc'd that I carry a wholeſome <hi>Britiſh</hi> Commodity
about me. We'll not take your Word, you Slut,</q> ſays they, and immediately one of them
Gaug'd the Caſk. Upon his declaring all was Right, they concluded among themſelves to make
Margery amends for the Affront they had put upon her, in diſputing the Goodneſs of her Ware.
They ſaid ſo good a Thing ought to be properly ornamented, and turning Margery's Smock and
Petticoat over her Head, ty'd them cloſe over it; they then hung her Candle and Lanthorn in a
String juſt before Margery's <hi>Dumb-Glutton,</hi> and in that manner march'd in Triumph with her to
Bloomſbury Square, and knock'd at the Gentleman's Door ſhe was going to, ſtanding at a Diſtance
to ſee the Event of their Frolick. The firſt that came to the Door was a Weſt-Country Maid-Servant,
who ſeeing ſo ſtrange a Sight, and taking it for an Apparition, immediately fainted
away. The reſt of the Women-Servants being afraid to go to the Door, prevail'd on a blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Iriſh Footman to go to the Spectre, and ſpeak to it. Teague coming up, and ſeeing ſo odd
a Figure, cries out, <q>O hu! by Jeſus, but this is not an Iriſh Ghoſt! I never ſaw before I
was born an Apparition with a Candle and Lanthorn ſtuck in her A-ſe! In the Name of Jeſus
who are you? Nobody but poor Margery, the Waſherwoman, eries th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> poor Creature; and
for God's Sake deſire the Maids to help to undo me, and then I'll tell you how I've been ſerv'd.</q>
Teague burſting into a Fit of Laughter, runs and tells the Maids who it was;<q> By Heavens,
ſays he, but they have made a Pudding-bag of her Petticoats to boil her Head in; and they have
cut a great Gaſh in her Belly and tied it round with a Counſellor's Perriwig. Upon my Conſcience
but it is true; and they have hung a lighted Candle and Lanthorn before it, becauſe nobody
ſhould ſee it, agra.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After a deal of Laughter on all ſides, they untuck'd Margery, and on examining her Pockets
ſhe found they had robb'd her of her Pocket Gin-bottle; but to comfort her for her Loſs, they
left in the room of it three fine Handkerchiefs, with a Guinea in each, which Margery thinks a
charming Recompence for their Fun.</p>
