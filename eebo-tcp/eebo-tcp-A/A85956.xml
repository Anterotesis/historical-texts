         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

About five of the clock in the Afternoon, Col.

Maſter. And thus much I do here ingenuouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that if I had as many lives as haires upon my head, willingly ſhould I ſacrifice them in his Cauſe; and under his Banner, my Loyalty ſhall now iſſue ſorth with ſtreams of blood, being aſſured, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my paſſing through the violent Billows of this raging ſea, I ſhal then arrive at the eternal Haven of happineſs, and there ſing hallelujah with my glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous father in heaven, who is the moſt high and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Protector, of all the low and inferior Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors here on Earth. And after ſome conference and prayer with the Miniſter, with an affable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, he caſt off his Doublet, and putting on a white Waſtcoat, and a linnen Cap, he then went to prayers, where immediatly after taking leav of his friends, he proſtraced himſelf before the block; and laying his head down, roſe up again, and ſaid, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, when I am dead and gone, remem<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber you have a Royal Soveraign; and the Lord unite your hearts and affections unto him After which, he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmitted himſelf to the block, and the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner coming to him, to ask forgiveneſs, and know the ſign; He replyed, the Lord forgive thee for I cannot. But when I lift up my right hand, do thy office;</p>

his head from his ſhoulders; which being done, the head and the body were both put into a Coffin, &amp; ſo carryed off the Scaffold.</p>
            <p>Then the Portugal Ambaſſadors brother was guarded up to the Scaffold, being extreamly deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſpirit, and in a mourning Gown, where he endeavoured (by way of ſpeech) to plead inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; and then by his Interpreter to impute the chief Cauſe of the Riot and Murder to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; but this was onely grounded by the way of excuſe; ſo that ſuch circumſtances proved ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; and after his Confeſſion to the Prieſt, the abſolving him of his ſins, and the reſigning up of the Crucifix, he likewiſe ſubmitted to the block, &amp; at two blows, and a race, his head was ſevered from his ſhoulders.</p>
