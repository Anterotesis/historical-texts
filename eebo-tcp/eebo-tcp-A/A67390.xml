            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Fourth LETTER, Concerning the Sacred Trinity.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN a former Answer (from I know not whom) to my First and Second Letter; we had <hi>Two Persons</hi> (a <hi>Friend</hi> and his <hi>Neighbour</hi>) in <hi>One Man.</hi> Of which I have given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in my Third Letter. We have now an Answer to that also. But whether from the <hi>Friend,</hi> or the <hi>Neighbour,</hi> or from a <hi>Third Person,</hi> he doth not tell me. Yet all the <hi>Three Persons,</hi> may (for ought I know) be the <hi>same Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, whether it be, or be not, the same <hi>Man,</hi> it is not amiss for him to act a Third <hi>Person</hi> (as of an <hi>Adversary</hi>), as being thereby not obliged to insist upon, and maintain what was before said; but may fairly decline it if he please.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102625:3"/>
The one may Grant what the other Denies, and Deny what the other Grants: And still, as the <hi>Scene</hi> changes, the <hi>Man</hi> may Act another <hi>Person.</hi> And so I find it is. As for instance:</p>
            <p>The former Answerer, takes it <hi>unkindly,</hi> and would have it thought a <hi>Calumny,</hi> that I charged it on some of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> That <hi>How clear soever the Expressions of Scripture be for our purpose, they will not believe it, as being Inconsistent with natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: And though they do not think fit to give us a bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Rejection of Scripture, yet they do</hi> (<hi>and must, they tell us</hi>) <hi>put such a Forced Sense on the words, as to make them signify somewhat else.</hi> Therefore, to shew that this is not a <hi>Calumny,</hi> but a clear <hi>Truth,</hi> I cited their own Words, and quoted the Places where they are to be found, wherein themselves say the same things, in as full Expressions as any that I had charged them with; <hi>That every one is to interpret the Scripture according to his own sense; and what so seems grateful to him, he is to imbrace and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, though the whole World be against it: That he is not to heed what Men teach or think, or have at any time taught or thought, whoever they be, or have been, or how many soever: That though, even in the sacred Monuments, it be found written, not Once only, but Many times; he should not yet for all that believe it so to be: That what plainly appears cannot be</hi> (or, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102625:3"/>
explained, what <hi>He thinks so,</hi> though all the World beside think otherwise,) <hi>is not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; even though in the sacred Oracles it appear to be Expresly affirmed: But those sacred Words are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,</hi> (<hi>though it be by Unusual Ways or Tropes,</hi>) <hi>to some other Sense than what they speak: That</hi> (<hi>because it seems to him absurd</hi>) <hi>he must</hi> (<hi>with</hi> Augustine's <hi>good leave, and of the rest who think as he doth</hi>) <hi>put a Force</hi> (<hi>how great soever</hi>) <hi>upon</hi> Paul's <hi>words, rather than to admit such Sense. That, if our Reason dictate to us ought otherwise than the Scripture doth; it is an Errour to say, That in such case we are rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture.</hi> Now our new Answerer (though he would still have it to be a <hi>Calumny</hi>) shuffles it off with this, <hi>He is not concerned, that</hi> Socinus, <hi>or any other Author, has dropt imprudent words,</hi> and <hi>leaves it to the</hi> Socinian to answer, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. (for he is now to act the <hi>Arian, pag.</hi> 11, 12, 14, 16, 17.) This point therefore I look upon as yielded; concerning the slight opinion which (some of) the <hi>Socinians</hi> have of <hi>Scripture,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with <hi>Humane Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again; when I had spoken of our <hi>Immortal Soul,</hi> in its <hi>separate Existence</hi> after Death, as of an <hi>Intellectual Being;</hi> (but, with an <hi>IF at lest those who deny the Blessed Trinity will allow that there are such Beings:</hi>) To shew the <hi>suspicion</hi> intimated, was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102625:4"/>
not groundless; I cited <hi>Socinus</hi>'s own words, where he expresly tells us, that <hi>the Soul after death doth not subsist; nor doth so Live as to be then in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of being Rewarded or Punished,</hi> (that is, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, It is no more Alive, than is the Dead Body, not sensible of pain or pleasure.) Which I think is ground enough for such a <hi>suspicion,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>uncharitable.</hi> Nor doth this new Answerer clear <hi>Socinus,</hi> or <hi>himself,</hi> from this suspicion. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells us (<hi>pag.</hi> 10.) it is an <hi>Insinuation,</hi> as if <hi>they believe not Angels.</hi> Which is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of <hi>the Soul's separate Existence,</hi> (which is that I insisted on) nor doth he so much as tell us, that <hi>he doth believe Angels</hi> (much less that he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Souls separate Existence,) so that the ground of suspicion still remains. I had shewed him how different <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Opinion is, from that of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> when he <hi>desired to be dissolved,</hi> or <hi>to depart hence,</hi> and <hi>to be with Christ,</hi> as <hi>much better</hi> for him, than to <hi>abide in the flesh,</hi> Phil. 1. 23, 24. And, <hi>to be absent from the Body</hi> (which must be after Death, and before the Resurrection) <hi>and to be present with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 8. And this new Answerer, though he takes notice of the charge, doth not so much as tell us, that he is not of <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Opinion herein. Which (if it be so) he might reasonably have told us upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102625:4"/>
I might have added that of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>Fear not those who kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul:</hi> Whereas, if the Soul after Death be as insensible as the Body, That is as much killed as This. And that of Christ to the Converted Thief on the Cross, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 43. <hi>This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</hi> For surely by <hi>Paradise</hi> he did not mean <hi>Purgatory;</hi> nor yet, that he should be <hi>with him in Hell, amongst the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and the Damned;</hi> nor that his <hi>Soul</hi> should be in a condition as <hi>senseless</hi> as his Body: For <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi> doth not sound like any of these. I might have added also that of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the <hi>Rich Glutton,</hi> Luk. 16. 23, 24, 25, 28. For though <hi>Parables</hi> are not strongly Argumentative, as to all the Punctilio's of them; yet, as to the main scope of them, they are: (else, to what purpose are they used.) Now here we have that <hi>Glutton</hi> represented as <hi>Tormented in Hell,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> at <hi>Rest</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Bosom;</hi> and there <hi>Comforted,</hi> while the other is <hi>Tormented:</hi> And all this, while yet he had <hi>Brethren upon Earth,</hi> to whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be <hi>sent.</hi> All which is not agreeable to <hi>a condition not capable of reward or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi> And upon the whole, we have reason to suspect, that <hi>Socinians</hi> may have some other odd Tenents, which they think fit rather to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:102625:5"/>
than to <hi>Deny.</hi> So that I look upon this point as gained also; That <hi>Socinus</hi> (uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Answerer) doth deny the subsistence of the <hi>Soul</hi> after Death, as then capable of Reward or Punishment.</p>
            <p>Another point which I look upon as granted, is concerning that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word; and the Word was with God; and the Word was God; and the Word was made flesh, and dwelt amongst us.</hi> Concerning this place, we were come to this Issue with our former An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer, (at his <hi>p.</hi> 9.) If by <hi>Word</hi> be meant a <hi>Person, (pre-existent</hi> to Christs Incarnation by the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi>) and, by <hi>God,</hi> be meant the <hi>True God,</hi> or <hi>God Almighty;</hi> then <hi>this place is to our purpose;</hi> for else (he tells us) <hi>St. John writes Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense.</hi> Now, that <hi>St. John writes Non-sense,</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he will not say (whatever he thinks) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he pretends a great Reverence for Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures (and doth not take it kindly that I should suspect the contrary.) Whether of the other two points he would stick to, he did not think fit to tell us; For indeed his business was not to tell us what he would have, but what he would not have; and concludes nothing thereupon, but that <hi>the place is obscure</hi> (he knows not how to make it serve his turn;) and (that it may so
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102625:5"/>
seem) he indeavours to cast what dust he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Spring, and then to say, The Water is not <hi>clear.</hi> I have given him my Reasons (and I think they be cogent) why I judge the place <hi>clear</hi> enough, as to both points. And should I admit (as I think I may) that, by <hi>Word,</hi> is meant somewhat else (as he tells us) <hi>in forty other places:</hi> this is nothing to the purpose. For we are not here enquiring, what by the word <hi>Logos</hi> is meant in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or what in <hi>Plato,</hi> or what in <hi>forty other places;</hi> but what is meant, by <hi>the Word,</hi> in This place: Nor what, by <hi>Gods,</hi> is meant in <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 6, 7. <hi>I have said ye are Gods, but ye shall die like Men;</hi> But what by God is <hi>here</hi> meant, where it is said, <hi>The Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> Nor is here any need of a <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Lecture,</hi> to inquire, by what <hi>Trope,</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> or with what <hi>Allusion,</hi> Christ is here called <hi>The Word;</hi> It is enough that 'tis <hi>Christ</hi> who is here so called. And, after all his toil, I do not find, that himself hath the confidence to Deny (though he doth not think fit to grant it) but that here, by <hi>the Word,</hi> is meant <hi>Christ;</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> here mentioned, is <hi>God Almighty;</hi> and consequently, If St. <hi>John</hi> do not <hi>write Non-sense</hi> (as he is pleased to phrase it) <hi>the place is to our purpose.</hi> Now our new Answerer, seems to me, to quit the first of these points; and chooseth rather to act the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102625:6"/>
than the <hi>Socinian,</hi> as taking that to be more defensible, <hi>pag.</hi> 11, 14, 17. And doth admit that, by <hi>the Word</hi> here, is meant the Person of <hi>Christ;</hi> and <hi>pre-existent</hi> to his <hi>Incarnation;</hi> as by whom <hi>the World was made,</hi> at least as by <hi>an Instrument;</hi> and doth allow him to be <hi>God,</hi> though not the <hi>same</hi> God; but that <hi>the Father</hi> and <hi>the Word</hi> are <hi>Two Gods;</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 17.) and can allow him the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of <hi>Being over all, God blessed for ever;</hi> and can so <hi>be as liberal of the Title of God, to Christ, as any Trinitarian whatever;</hi> p. 16. So that now the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is reduced to this; When it is said, <hi>The Word</hi> (meaning <hi>Christ</hi>) <hi>was with God, and the Word was God;</hi> whether by <hi>God,</hi> be meant the <hi>True</hi> God, <hi>God Almighty.</hi> Of which we are to say more anon.</p>
            <p>Another grant we have, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. where he doth admit, that <hi>a thing may be</hi> Unum <hi>and</hi> Tres (<hi>One and Three</hi>) <hi>in several respects:</hi> And that <hi>'Tis true indeed, he cannot say, that there is a Contradiction in holding, that there may be Three Persons in God.</hi> And, in granting this, he grants what I undertook to prove. For he knows very well, that the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which I undertook, was not, to discourse the whole Controversy at large; but so stated the question, as to confine it <hi>to this single Point,</hi> Whether it be an <hi>Impossibility,</hi> or <hi>Inconsistence with Reason,</hi> that there may be <hi>Three somewhats</hi> (which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102625:6"/>
we call <hi>Persons</hi>) which are but <hi>One God?</hi> And when he grants me, that there is in it no <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> or <hi>Inconsistence with Reason;</hi> all the rest is beside the Question. I know very well, that both this and the former Answerer have made it their business to change the state of the Question: And if what I bring to prove what I undertake, do not prove the task they set me; they glory as if they had the better. But the Lawyers tell us, that, when Issue is once joined; if we prove the thing in Issue, we carry the Cause; and what is more than so, is over and above, or to spare. And a Mathematician, if he prove what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, concludes with <hi>quod erat demonstrandum,</hi> (<hi>he hath proved what he undertook to prove;</hi>) if he prove more than so; 'tis more than he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do. And if a Logician prove (<hi>proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem negatam</hi>) the Proposition which is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on him to prove, he hath done his work; and if he prove more than so, it is more than he need to do. And accordingly, when this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer doth acknowledge that I have proved what I undertake to prove, (that there is no <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility,</hi> there is no <hi>Contradiction,</hi> nor <hi>Inconsistence with Reason,</hi> that <hi>Three somewhats</hi> may be <hi>One God</hi>) he ought to acquiesce therein, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I have done my Work. For when the Controversy was divided into two Branches,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102625:7"/>
Whether the thing be <hi>True,</hi> and whether it be <hi>Possible;</hi> and it was the latter of the two that I undertook: If I have shewed, <hi>It is not impossible,</hi> (which this Answerer doth grant that I have done,) I have done the work that I undertook. And if this be once agreed, it goes a great way as to the other Branch, That the thing is <hi>True.</hi> For I find the last Result of our Adversaries, (when they are close pressed,) is commonly this, It is <hi>Impossible,</hi> It is <hi>Absurd,</hi> It is <hi>Non-sense,</hi> It is <hi>Inconsistent with Reason,</hi> and therefore it cannot be <hi>True.</hi> And that therefore <hi>a Force, no matter how great,</hi> must be put upon the Words which do, how <hi>expresly soever, affirm it</hi> (to make them signify somewhat else than what they <hi>plainly do signify</hi>) then to admit it. And if I have (as is now confessed) destroyed this last Reserve, let them press this point no more. Or, if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract this grant, let the next Answerer keep to this point, to prove it <hi>Impossible,</hi> or <hi>Inconsistent with Reason,</hi> and not ramble out into other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, which are nothing to the purpose of what I proposed to prove.</p>
            <p>Amongst his other Concessions, I shall reckon that in <hi>pag.</hi> 14. where he argues from <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13. That there is between <hi>the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> a Distinction so great, as that they may not unfitly be called <hi>Three Persons</hi> (where I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102625:7"/>
observe also, that he owns the <hi>Personality</hi> of the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> as of the <hi>Father,</hi> and of the <hi>Son.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, he seems to make the Distinction between them, Greater than I do. But I thus far agree with him, That there is, <hi>in Truth,</hi> a <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> and that more than <hi>Imaginary,</hi> or what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends only upon our Imagination; and Greater than that of what we call the <hi>Divine Attributes.</hi> And therefore we reckon the <hi>Persons</hi> to be but <hi>Three;</hi> but the <hi>Attributes</hi> to be <hi>more.</hi> And we do admit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Persons,</hi> a certain <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Oeconomy;</hi> such as in the Scripture we find assigned to them. But do not own the Distinction so great as to make them <hi>Three Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that also of <hi>p.</hi> 13, 14. where he argues, that Christ is indeed <hi>God,</hi> (not only a dignified Man:) <hi>That God in Christ was tempted, suffered, and died; not Man only. That the Merits thereof are founded on the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. In plain terms,</hi> (saith he) <hi>if Christ were only a Man, extraordinarily assisted by God, and thereupon meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Sufferings and Death: 'twas the Man redeemed us by His Blood, and not God.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 16. the like from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Of whom, as concerning the Flesh, Christ came; who Is over all; God Blessed for ever.</hi> And asks, <hi>If I ever knew an Unitarian, especially an</hi> Arian, <hi>deny him that Character?</hi> And from Heb. 1. 8. <hi>To the Son he saith, Thy Throne, O God, endureth for ever; a Scepter of Righteousness is the Scepter of thy Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. He argues, That <hi>it is not the Humanity of Christ that</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:102625:8"/>
               <hi>is here spoken of. For what! Is the Humanity of Christ called God? Is the Humanity preferred before Angels? Or did the Humanity frame the World? Indeed</hi> (he says) <hi>they are apt to clog it with a Limitation,</hi> (as not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him <hi>Co-equal with the Father.</hi>) <hi>But under that restriction, they can be as liberal of the title of God to Christ as any Trinitarian whatever.</hi> Where I take what he grants: And, as to the <hi>Co-equality,</hi> shall discourse it afterwards.</p>
            <p>More of this kind I shall have occasion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afterward. Yet do not blame him for taking this advantage (of shifting the Person) where he sees cause to <hi>Grant</hi> what was before <hi>Denied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our new Answerer hath yet another Art. When he seems to cite what I say; he takes the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty very often to vary therein (according as he thinks fit) both from my Words, and from my Sense. And therefore I desire the Reader not to take all as Mine, which seems to be cited as such; but so much only as he finds to be truly cited. It would be too long to mention all the places where I am so used. I shall only give instance in some of them.</p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. <hi>That I indeavour to illustrate the Trinity by an Example in a Cube,</hi> or Die: and so far he says true. But not so in what follows, <hi>where three sides, he says, make one Cube; and which Cube, he says, is not to be made without all the three sides.</hi> But certainly he can no where find these to be my Words. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102625:8"/>
I am no great Gamester at that Sport: but I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought (till now) that a <hi>Die</hi> had <hi>six sides,</hi> and not only <hi>three.</hi> I have said indeed, that <hi>in a Cube,</hi> or Die, there be <hi>three Dimensions,</hi> (<hi>Length, Breadth, and Thickness;</hi>) But I never called these, <hi>the three sides of a Cube;</hi> nor have I any where said, that <hi>a Cube hath but three sides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am represented, <hi>pag.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. as maintaining <hi>three personal Gods.</hi> But he knows very well this is not my Language; but, that <hi>the three Persons</hi> are <hi>One God;</hi> not <hi>three Gods,</hi> nor a <hi>Council of Gods,</hi> as he calls it.</p>
            <p>So, where <hi>he would ask the Doctor,</hi> p. 17. <hi>Whether these two Gods, to wit, the Father and the Word, be one.</hi> He knows my Answer must be, that <hi>these two,</hi> (not, <hi>these two Gods,</hi>) are <hi>one God.</hi> And that I do no where call them <hi>two Gods,</hi> but <hi>one and the same God;</hi> according to that of Christ himself; <hi>I and the Father are One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, where he talks of <hi>adding several Persons to our one God,</hi> pag. 3, 8. For he knows, that is not my Language, but these three <hi>Are</hi> God; not that they are <hi>Added to</hi> God: much less that <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus &amp;c.</hi> may be thrust into the number. And <hi>p.</hi> 8. <hi>one of your Gods:</hi> We have but <hi>One</hi> God. 'Tis He and his <hi>Arian,</hi> that own <hi>two Gods,</hi> p. 17. Not we.</p>
            <p>Another there is which runs through most part of his whole Discourse; wherein he willfully mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes the state of the Question: And then, what
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102625:9"/>
is brought to prove one thing, he mis-applies as brought to prove another; And then makes a great out-cry, that it doth not prove, what it was never brought to prove. And this he calls <hi>cross purposes.</hi> He knows very well, that the question was by me clearly stated (not as to the whole Doctrine of the Trinity at large, but) as to the <hi>Possibility.</hi> That (whatever the <hi>Socinians</hi> pretend) there is no <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Non-sense,</hi> or <hi>Inconsistence with Reason,</hi> that <hi>three somewhats</hi> (which we call <hi>Persons</hi>) may be <hi>One God.</hi> And this he owns to be the state of the Question, p. 1. <hi>to prove the same agreeable to the common notions of humane Reason.</hi> And it is done by shewing that, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common notions of humane Reason,</hi> nothing is more common than that what in one considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are <hi>Three,</hi> or Many, is yet in another conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration but <hi>One.</hi> Thus in <hi>one Cube</hi> there be <hi>three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions;</hi> length, breadth, and thickness. So the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Will,</hi> and <hi>Memory,</hi> in <hi>one Soul.</hi> So the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Power to <hi>Know,</hi> to <hi>Will,</hi> and to <hi>Doe,</hi> in the same <hi>Intelligent Agent;</hi> and the like. 'Tis therefore not <hi>Inconsistent with Reason</hi> (and this Answerer doth allow it) for <hi>one to be three;</hi> nor is it <hi>Non-sense</hi> to say, <hi>these three are one;</hi> or <hi>I and the Father are One;</hi> or that <hi>three somewhats</hi> may be <hi>One God.</hi> The former Answerer complains of these <hi>Resemblances,</hi> as <hi>impossible to be apprehended by the common people;</hi> and desires <hi>some more Familiar Parallel</hi> (than that of a Cube, or Die) that the <hi>Tankard-bearer</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:102625:9"/>
may apprehend (in his <hi>p.</hi> 8, 9.) Yet I believe his <hi>Tankard-bearer</hi> is not so dull of apprehension, as he would have us think. For if he have ever <hi>seen a Die</hi> (as most of them have,) or shall now be <hi>shewed</hi> one, he may be able to <hi>apprehend,</hi> (without a <hi>Metaphysick,</hi> or <hi>Mathematick Lecture</hi>) That in a <hi>Die,</hi> there is <hi>length, breadth, and thickness,</hi> (and that it is <hi>as broad as it is long,</hi> and <hi>as thick</hi> as either;) and yet <hi>it is not three Dies, but one Die.</hi> However, to gratify his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, I have given him some other; as that the same <hi>Man,</hi> may have <hi>three Dignities,</hi> or <hi>three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> and sustain <hi>three Persons,</hi> or <hi>three Relations,</hi> without thereby becoming <hi>three Men;</hi> with other like. With this, our new Answerer is not pleased. He is <hi>Ashamed,</hi> he doth <hi>Blush for me,</hi> &amp;c. (How much am I obliged for this his great <hi>Compassion!</hi>) But all this is but <hi>Banter,</hi> (it is not <hi>Argument,</hi>) and no sober Man will be more of his Opinion for this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: And much less for that of St. <hi>John's writing Non-sense,</hi> of a <hi>lying Revelation,</hi> of a <hi>three-headed Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> p. 3, 5. and other such Indecent Language of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Scripture.</hi> But, why so displeased with these Simile's? These are <hi>too mean,</hi> too <hi>familiar;</hi> He expected somewhat <hi>higher,</hi> somewhat more <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,</hi> p. 5. (I see it is as hard a matter to please my <hi>two Answerers,</hi> as to serve <hi>two Masters.</hi> The one complains my Simile's are <hi>not familiar enough;</hi> the other that they are <hi>too familiar;</hi> he expected some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more sublime<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) These do not prove, that a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102625:10"/>
               <hi>Trinity in Unity is necessary to the perfection of the Godhead, p.</hi> 6. True: <hi>These alone</hi> do not prove that <hi>there is a Trinity in Unity in the Godhead;</hi> much less do they prove, that a Trinity in Unity is <hi>necessary to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Godhead.</hi> Nor were they brought to prove it. They were brought to prove, There is no <hi>Inconsistence,</hi> but that there <hi>may be</hi> a Trinity in the Unity of the Godhead. And if they prove thus much, (he perhaps may have cause to be Ashamed, but) I see no reason why I should be Ashamed, (or any one <hi>for me.</hi>) Now, that they prove thus much; he hath already granted, <hi>That a thing may be one and three,</hi> in divers respects: And that <hi>'tis no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to hold, that there May be Three Persons in God.</hi> They have proved therefore, what they were brought to prove. But, says he, <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>Our Debate is not, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there May be three Persons in God.</hi> Yes; our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is, <hi>whether there May be.</hi> Not, <hi>whether there Be.</hi> And he knows the Question was so stated by me; and so acknowledg'd by himself; upon this <hi>single point,</hi> whether there be any <hi>Impossibility in it.</hi> (And so owned by himself, <hi>p.</hi> 1.) not whether <hi>it be so</hi> (for this, I had before said, was not to be argued upon the Topick of <hi>Reason</hi> alone;) but whether <hi>it be agreeable to the common notions of Humane Reason,</hi> that it <hi>May be so.</hi> And if this were the Question, (as he owns;) and this be proved (as he owns also;) Then I have proved, what I undertook to prove. And have no reason to be <hi>Ashamed,</hi> either of <hi>the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:102625:10"/>
or of the <hi>Proof.</hi> 'Tis our new Answerer (who doth wittingly and willingly mis-state the Question) that is at <hi>cross purposes;</hi> while he applies those Arguments to one point, which he knows were brought to prove another, (which point himself grants to be proved; <hi>He cannot say, there is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in it,</hi> pag. 6.) and then complains, that they (alone) do not prove what they were never brought to prove.</p>
            <p>Of like nature is that other point; where he tells us, that we do now <hi>venture,</hi> to prove it to be <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the common notions of humane Reason;</hi> that is, <hi>not Inconsistent with it.</hi> And we do so. But he would have it thought, that it is <hi>but now of late</hi> that any have <hi>presumed to this confidence,</hi> pag. 1, 2. and would have us <hi>content, modestly to acknowledge it a meer mystery; and to rely upon the Authority of the Church, and Tradition;</hi> without pretending, that it is <hi>agreeable to Reason.</hi> Now, that there is in it a <hi>Mystery,</hi> we readily grant, (and so there is in the whole Doctrine of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; God manifested in the Flesh,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 3. 16.) as that which, without <hi>Revelation,</hi> we could not have found out by meer Reason; And, that it is <hi>above Reason,</hi> (that is, <hi>more</hi> than what <hi>Reason alone</hi> could have taught us:) But not that it is <hi>Against Reason,</hi> or <hi>Inconsistent</hi> with it. This is not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinitarians; nor ever was that I know of. Nor is it <hi>Tradition</hi> only, or the <hi>Church's Authority;</hi> but the <hi>Authority of Scripture</hi> that we rely
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102625:11"/>
upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is a <hi>True,</hi> not <hi>a lying Revelation.</hi> Nor is it (as he pretends) a new Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>not raised till several hundred years after Christ,</hi> (as if the Doctrine were to be dated from the time of penning the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasian</hi> Creed;) but (as old at least as the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament;) and never contested (that I know of) till <hi>several hundred years after Christ,</hi> when the <hi>Arians</hi> arose. But here again my Answerers are not agreed: (So hard it is to please them both;) While one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>'tis but of late;</hi> the other tells me, <hi>'tis old-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned,</hi> (in his <hi>p.</hi> 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Thus Dr.</hi> Wallis <hi>may see, that his Notions concerning the Trinity are old-fashioned; not of a new mode.</hi>) And truly I take him to be more in the right; that 'tis not a <hi>new quirk,</hi> but <hi>old-fashioned Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and I like it never the worse for being so. As to what I have said of <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. it is more than <hi>Forty</hi> years, (and well towards <hi>Fifty,</hi>) since I first Preached it in <hi>London,</hi> on that Text, (as I have since done, there and elsewhere, more than once;) and I did not then take it to be New, but what I had been always Taught. And as to that of <hi>the three dimensions in a Cube,</hi> it is <hi>Forty</hi> years or more, since I first discoursed it at <hi>Oxford,</hi> with Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> then <hi>Astronomy-Professor</hi> there, and since Bishop of <hi>Salisbury;</hi> And as to the Doctrine in general, (of <hi>Three Persons in One God,</hi>) it is no Newer, than the New Testament. But here again our Answerer forsakes the Question: For the Question is not, Whether it be a New, or Old, <hi>Adventure:</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102625:11"/>
it be <hi>Inconsistent with Reason,</hi> that <hi>Three May be One:</hi> or (as he words it, <hi>p.</hi> 3.) that <hi>a Trinity in Unity is absurd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another piece of the same Art it is, where my word of <hi>Personality</hi> is by him changed for <hi>Personation, p.</hi> 5, 6. For which I would not have quarrelled with him, if by changing the <hi>Word,</hi> he had not meant to change the <hi>Sense</hi> also. For to <hi>personate a Man,</hi> (he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 6.) <hi>is but to compose ones Actions in Likeness of him;</hi> and that <hi>one cannot personate three together, but one after another.</hi> But my <hi>Personality</hi> (he knows) is more than this <hi>Personation.</hi> It is not only <hi>Acting</hi> a Person, but <hi>Being</hi> a Person. A Man may successively <hi>Personate,</hi> or <hi>Act the Person</hi> of, a <hi>King,</hi> and a <hi>Father;</hi> without <hi>being</hi> either This or That: But when the same Man <hi>IS</hi> both a King and a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which he may be at the same time, as well as successively,) this is more than only to <hi>Act</hi> them. And if by <hi>Personation</hi> he mean no more than <hi>Acting a Person,</hi> I wonder how he can tell us, <hi>p.</hi> 5. That <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonation is the greatest Perfection of Being;</hi> and that <hi>he never could apprehend any other real Unity but Personation.</hi> What? <hi>No real Unity but acting a Person by imitation?</hi> Sure there is. The Bottom, and Top, and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a Mountain, are <hi>one Mountain:</hi> Yet I do not take <hi>Mount Atlas</hi> to be a <hi>Person,</hi> or to <hi>Act</hi> a person; much less to become One Mountain by <hi>Personation,</hi> or <hi>Acting a Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of like nature is it, where (to do me a kindness)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102625:12"/>
               <hi>he will state my Cube more to my purpose;</hi> p. 5. (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary.) But how? In a <hi>Marble Cube</hi> may be two Accidents, <hi>Hardness,</hi> and <hi>Coldness.</hi> There may be so. But what then? <hi>Then,</hi> (he says,) <hi>here are Three Cubes more for me.</hi> He would have it thought, I suppose, that I had before discoursed of <hi>Three Cubes</hi> (whereas I spoke but of <hi>One Cube,</hi> under <hi>three Dimensions;</hi>) and he will now help me to <hi>another Three.</hi> But he is out again. For the <hi>Cold</hi> Cube, the <hi>Hard</hi> Cube, and the <hi>Marble</hi> Cube, are but <hi>One</hi> Cube, not <hi>Three Cubes.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>same Cube</hi> that is <hi>Cold,</hi> and <hi>Hard,</hi> and <hi>Marble.</hi> It would have been much the same, if, instead of a <hi>Cube,</hi> he had taken a Marble <hi>Bowl,</hi> or <hi>Ball;</hi> and then told me, 'Tis <hi>Cold,</hi> and <hi>Hard,</hi> and <hi>Round.</hi> True. And yet it is but <hi>One Bowl, not Three Bowls: One Ball, not Three Balls.</hi> And what is there in all this of <hi>Inconsistent Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity?</hi> It seems to me very <hi>Consistent;</hi> not <hi>Absurd:</hi> and it suits my Notion very well.</p>
            <p>But, says he, p. 5. <hi>not to suppose the simile altogether impertinent,</hi> (very well!) yet <hi>it is in our case.</hi> Why in our case? <hi>For our Debate</hi> (he says) <hi>is not, whether there May not be three persons in God.</hi> Yes: That is our Debate: And the true state of the Question. All his other Excursions are beside the Question.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the simile,</hi> though not impertinent, <hi>is yet</hi> (he says) <hi>most Absurd,</hi> because <hi>not Adequate;</hi> and <hi>it is a general rule with him</hi> (p. 6.) <hi>where he brings a simile, to have it Adequate, that it may really prove the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:102625:12"/>
Now that my Simile's are not <hi>Adequate</hi> (so as to prove all that is to be said of God, or the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity) I had told him at first, and more than once; and that they were not <hi>intended</hi> so to be; (and I tell him now, that I did purposely make choice of such as were a great way off, that it might not seem as if I would have them thought to be <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate,</hi> as to all that is to be said of the Trinity.) And as to the <hi>Rule</hi> he goes by; perhaps it may be his Method, where much is to be proved, to prove it all at once, (and take all Arguments to be <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,</hi> which do not at once prove All.) But we who are <hi>conversant in Cubes and Demonstrations</hi> (as he phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it) think fit sometimes to use another Method: and, where much is to be proved, to proceed by steps. We first propose one thing, and prove that: then another, and prove that: and so on. And if what be brought to prove the first step, do prove what it is brought to prove; we do not say, The Argument is <hi>Absurd,</hi> because it doth not prove all at once: But, That it is a <hi>Good</hi> Argument <hi>so far.</hi> And, I think, (if he will here give me leave to use a <hi>Simile</hi> which is not <hi>Adequate,</hi>) it is a Method used by other Men, as well as <hi>Mathematicians.</hi> For, if a Man be to mount a pair of <hi>Stairs;</hi> we do not say, The first step is <hi>Absurd,</hi> because that alone doth not bring him to the <hi>Top:</hi> or, if to go a <hi>Journey,</hi> That the first step is <hi>Absurd,</hi> because it doth not bring him to his Journeys <hi>End:</hi> But the first step brings him so Far;

and the second, somewhat farther; and so on, till (step by step) he comes to the <hi>Top,</hi> or to his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys <hi>End.</hi> Now, there being divers Points concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Doctrine of the Trinity; I stated my Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, not so as to prove all at once; but <hi>singled</hi> out this one Point, That <hi>it is not Inconsistent with Reason</hi> (or, to use his own words; <hi>it is agreeable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions of humane Reasoning,) That what in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration are Three, May in another Consideration be One;</hi> and, that <hi>there May be three somewhat's, which are one God.</hi> But, whether indeed <hi>there be so,</hi> is Another step; and whether these <hi>somewhat</hi>'s may fitly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Persons,</hi> is yet Another. Now, if I have made good my first step; my <hi>Argument</hi> or <hi>Simile,</hi> is not only <hi>not altogether impertinent,</hi> but neither is it <hi>most Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,</hi> yea <hi>not Absurd</hi> at all; because it proves what it was brought to prove. And, that so it doth, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self allows; and tells us plainly, p. 3. <hi>He cannot say, there is a Contradiction, in holding, that there May be Three Persons in God.</hi>

            <p>But I find, he would fain be upon another Point, <hi>p.</hi> 4. and draw me to it. A Point not to be argued upon the Topick of <hi>Reason</hi> only, (for, Reason alone, can go no further than to prove it <hi>Possible,</hi> or <hi>not Inconsistent;</hi>) but to be argued from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Divine Revelations,</hi> whether indeed <hi>there are</hi> three <hi>somewhats</hi> (which we call <hi>Persons</hi>) that are but <hi>One God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this, I have told him already, is <hi>Beside the</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102625:13"/>
               <hi>Question</hi> which I undertook. And, in this, it is He that is the <hi>Aggressor,</hi> not I: and I only upon the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> Yet, because he is so desirous of it, I am content to go somewhat out of my way, to wait on him; and to hear what he hath to say, why we should think <hi>that Is not,</hi> which he confesseth <hi>May be</hi> without any <hi>Contradiction</hi> to natural <hi>Reason.</hi> And I shall take notice as I go along, what it is wherein we Agree, as well as wherein we Differ: That so we may not quarrel about what is Agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</p>
            <p>He begins with the <hi>First Commandment,</hi> p. 1, 2, 3, 4. And seems mightily to <hi>dread the Guilt of Idolatry,</hi> in admitting <hi>more Gods than one:</hi> (<hi>our Case is, we are afraid of Idolatry,</hi> p. 9.) contrary to this Commandment, of having <hi>no other God.</hi> (And so I would have him be. But we shall find this <hi>Fear</hi> will be over with him by and by.) <hi>What</hi> (says he) <hi>was that Commandment made for? What! to prevent Polytheism. Why, how is that to be done? By denying many Gods. If it be not made to deny personal Gods, 'tis made to no purpose.</hi> And soon after (with some indignation.) <hi>What! is the Divinity of Christ implied in the New Testament? 'tis denied in the First Commandment.</hi> And, <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>Pray, what Scripture shall we regard, in competition with this Commandment, written by the Finger of God, and one of the only Precepts he himself immediately delivered?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I am so far from disliking his Zeal for the First Commandment; that I do perfectly agree
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102625:14"/>
with what I find in that Commandment; <hi>I am the Lord Thy God</hi> (the Lord God of <hi>Israel</hi>) <hi>Thou shalt have No other God but Me.</hi> (And this I shall desire Him to remember by and by.) He may add that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 6, 7. (for in this I agree also) <hi>Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God</hi> (the Lord God of <hi>Israel</hi>) <hi>is one Lord.</hi> And that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord Thy God</hi> (the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi>) <hi>and Him only shalt thou serve.</hi> And that of 1 Cor. 8. 6. <hi>To us there is but One God.</hi> (And as many more places, as he pleases, to that purpose.) And from all these I do agree, that we are to have but <hi>one God</hi> and <hi>no more;</hi> (not <hi>two Gods.</hi>) No <hi>other</hi> God than <hi>the Lord God of Israel:</hi> That we are to Worship <hi>Him</hi> alone, and <hi>none else;</hi> (not <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> not <hi>the god of Ekron,</hi> not any God, or Man, or Angel, who is not <hi>the Lord God of Israel.</hi>) For all this I grant to be there fully Taught. And I am willing to put as great weight upon this <hi>solemn set Precept of the First Commandment,</hi> as he doth, (and perhaps more.) <hi>He would have us shew</hi> (if we can) p. 9. <hi>where this Commandment is Abrogated.</hi> I say, No where. It was never <hi>Abrogated:</hi> Never <hi>Repealed:</hi> It remains (I grant) still in its full force. And therefore we own no <hi>other</hi> God, but <hi>the Lord God of Israel.</hi> And this <hi>Lord God of Israel,</hi> we say is <hi>One Lord, One God,</hi> and no more Gods than <hi>One.</hi> We say indeed, there is a <hi>Wise</hi> God, a <hi>Powerful</hi> God, an <hi>Almighty</hi> God, an <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> God, a <hi>Just</hi> God, a <hi>Merciful</hi> God, God the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> God the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> God the <hi>Sanctifier;</hi> a God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102625:14"/>
               <hi>who in the beginning created the heaven and the earth,</hi> a God who <hi>in the beginning laid the foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of his hands,</hi> a God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> a God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> a God <hi>who brought the Children of Israel out of</hi> Egypt, a God who brought them <hi>out of the North Country,</hi> a God who is <hi>our Mighty Redeemer,</hi> a God who is <hi>a Saviour of all that trust in him,</hi> a God who doth <hi>create in us a clean heart, and doth renew a right spirit within us,</hi> a God who <hi>gives us a heart of Flesh,</hi> a God who <hi>gives us a New Heart,</hi> who <hi>putteth his Fear in our Hearts,</hi> who <hi>writes his Law in our inward parts,</hi> a God who <hi>searcheth the Heart and trieth the Reins,</hi> a God who <hi>hath Visited and Redeemed his People, and hath raised up a mighty Salvation for us.</hi> But we say, <hi>the Lord God of Israel</hi> is all this; and, in being all this, he is but <hi>One God;</hi> and, that there is <hi>no other God but One.</hi> And we grant, that whoever owns any <hi>other</hi> God as a <hi>true God,</hi> or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships a <hi>false God,</hi> breaks this Commandment. I do not know what he would have us <hi>Grant</hi> more upon this Commandment. I wish He do not think we have <hi>Granted too much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He says, p. 3. <hi>We vitiate this Commandment, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in New persons, by Adding several Persons to our One God.</hi> No: We <hi>Add no Persons to our God;</hi> We say, that <hi>God the Creator, God the Redeemer, God the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier,</hi> (or, in other words, <hi>the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghost,</hi>) <hi>ARE</hi> this One God; not <hi>added to him.</hi> Nor are they <hi>new Persons added to</hi> God; but, <hi>are God;</hi> and <hi>ever were so.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102625:15"/>He would have us think, <hi>p.</hi> 17. that the <hi>Father only,</hi> (and not the <hi>Son,</hi> or <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi>) is the <hi>Only true God;</hi> because of <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. The words are these, <hi>This is Life Eternal, to know Thee</hi> (not <hi>only Thee</hi>) <hi>the only True God</hi> (to be that God, beside which there is no other <hi>true God,</hi>) <hi>and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> And we say the same that is here said. The <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>the only True God</hi> (the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> beside whom there is no other <hi>true God;</hi>) The <hi>Son</hi> is also, not <hi>another</hi> God, (as the <hi>Arians</hi> say, and this Answerer, <hi>p.</hi> 17.) but the same <hi>only true God</hi> (the Lord God of <hi>Israel;</hi> and he is expresly so called, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 16, 17.) And the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> likewise, (for <hi>these Three are One,</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7.) And the words (without any force put upon them) may be thus read, <hi>To know Thee (and whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ) to be the only True God.</hi> For the word <hi>only</hi> is not a restrictive to <hi>Thee,</hi> but to <hi>the True God.</hi> And this is not only a <hi>new Querk or Criticism</hi> (which is the only Answer he gives to this Defence,) but is the true sense of the place. For the same Writer doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in another place, say the <hi>very same</hi> thing of God <hi>the Son,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 20. <hi>We are in him that is True, even in his Son Jesus Christ; This is the True God, and Eternal Life.</hi> Now if <hi>Scripture must interpret Scripture,</hi> (as he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 16.) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly S. <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Epistle</hi> (1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Joh. 5. 20.) understood what himself said in his <hi>Gospel</hi> (Joh. 17. 3.) And that, what he said of the <hi>Father</hi>'s being the <hi>Only True God,</hi> was not exclusive of the <hi>Son;</hi> to whom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102625:15"/>
gives the same Title, <hi>This is the True God,</hi> and this is <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> And this I think is a full Answer to what he would urge from this place; or from (what he joins with it) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4, 5, 6. <hi>To us there is but One God.</hi> Which is no more express to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, than This is: Nor doth he pretend that it is; but puts them both together, <hi>p.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>There is one place more, which comes under consideration, which (because he finds it pinch) he would fain shake off, <hi>p.</hi> 17. It is that of <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 10, 14. <hi>In the beginning was the Word; and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; The World was made by him; All things were made by him; And without him was not any thing made which was made; And the Word was made Flesh, and dwelt amongst us.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Answerer would fain shuffle off this place (in his <hi>p.</hi> 9.) upon one of these three Points; (for, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, he grants, <hi>it is for our purpose;</hi>) either that by <hi>the Word</hi> is not meant <hi>Christ;</hi> or, by <hi>God,</hi> not the <hi>True God;</hi> or else that S. <hi>John writes Non-sense.</hi> Now the last of the Three, I suppose our New Answerer will not say; because he pretends a great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for <hi>Scriptures.</hi> The first he Quits; and doth admit (according to the <hi>Arian</hi> sense, which he looks upon as more defensible than that of the <hi>Socinians</hi>) that, by <hi>the Word,</hi> is here meant the <hi>Person of Christ</hi> (who was afterward incarnate of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi>) and that he was <hi>pre-existent</hi> to his Incarnation; as <hi>by whom the World was made,</hi> at lest as <hi>by an Instrument.</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:102625:16"/>
And that he was <hi>with God</hi> (the True God) at least <hi>in the beginning of the World</hi> (if not sooner;) and that <hi>he was God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the doubt is, whether these <hi>Two Gods</hi> (for so he calls them) <hi>to wit the Father and the Word,</hi> be <hi>One,</hi> p. 17.</p>
            <p>Now, if he <hi>be God;</hi> he must be either a <hi>True</hi> God, or a <hi>False</hi> God. That he is a <hi>False God,</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks they should not say. And, if he be a <hi>True God,</hi> he must be the same God with the Father; who is <hi>the ONLY True God,</hi> Joh. 17. 3.</p>
            <p>That he is to be <hi>Worshipped</hi> with Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; both the <hi>Arians</hi> and the <hi>Socinians</hi> do allow. And if he <hi>be God</hi> (as the <hi>Arians</hi> and this Answerer do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,) this <hi>Worship,</hi> must be <hi>Divine Worship.</hi> And he must be then the <hi>Lord God of Israel;</hi> or else they break that Precept, <hi>Thou shalt Worship the Lord Thy God</hi> (the Lord God of Israel <hi>and Him ONLY shalt thou serve,</hi> Mat. 4. 10.</p>
            <p>If he be <hi>the Lord God of Israel,</hi> but not <hi>the same</hi> Lord God of <hi>Israel:</hi> How doth this agree with that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Hear, O Israel) the Lord Our God is One Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if he be <hi>another</hi> God (whether True or False) then do they break the Great and <hi>First</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thou shalt have No Other God but me;</hi> (no other God, True or False, Great or Little, Equal or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal; but the <hi>Lord God of Israel.</hi>) On which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment this Answerer doth (deservedly) lay so
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102625:16"/>
great a stress; as we heard before. <hi>What was it made for, if not to prevent Polytheism? How shall it be done, but by denying many Gods? If not to deny Personal Gods; it is made to no purpose. How is it consistent with that First Commandment, (that solemn and set Precept of the First Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, that was delivered by God himself; written by the Finger of God; and never Abrogated;) to bring in New Persons; to Add Persons</hi> (one or more) <hi>to this Only God, though particularly prohibited, and not Break it? What! Is the Divinity of Christ implied in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? It is denied in the First Commandment</hi> (if he be not the same God who is there meant:) And <hi>Pray, what Scripture shall we regard in competition with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment?</hi> With more to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>Whether he will make use of the Popish distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Latria</hi> and <hi>Doulia,</hi> (for his <hi>Two Gods,</hi> not <hi>Co-equal</hi>) I cannot tell. But the Commandment says expresly, <hi>Thou shalt have NO OTHER God, but Me,</hi> Equal or Unequal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor doth this Error end here</hi> (as he proceeds:) <hi>For our Adversaries are not always so lucky as to see Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For should some Revelation (such as,</hi> he says, <hi>is not impossible) deify more Men than ever the Heathen did; here's no fence left.</hi> (Here's room enough to <hi>thrust in</hi> his <hi>Jupiter, Bacchus, Venus,</hi> &amp;c. of which he tells us, p. 8.) <hi>And 'tis in vain</hi> (he tells us) <hi>in such a case, to pretend that the number would be of offence to us: For if we consider aright, there is no more reason for one number than another.</hi> And he <hi>thinks,</hi> that if there be <hi>more</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:102625:17"/>
               <hi>than one,</hi> it is <hi>more honourable</hi> they should be <hi>Infinites;</hi> because <hi>all between one and infinite, is Imperfect.</hi> With much more of like nature. Of all which I know not what better to think, than that he had <hi>forgot</hi> all this, when afterwards (at <hi>p.</hi> 17.) he will have <hi>these two Gods</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>to wit, the Father and the Word,</hi> not to be <hi>One,</hi> but <hi>Two and Separate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will it excuse the matter to say, That this <hi>Other</hi> God, is not <hi>Co-equal</hi> with the Father. For, at this rate, the <hi>Polytheism,</hi> or <hi>many Gods</hi> of the Heathen, would be excused, as out of the reach of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. For they did not make All their Gods <hi>Co-equal</hi> to their great <hi>Jupiter</hi> (nor perhaps any of them Equal to <hi>Our God.</hi>) But <hi>Jupiter</hi> was their <hi>God Paramount,</hi> and the rest were either <hi>Middling</hi> Gods, or <hi>Lesser</hi> Gods. But yet this did not excuse them from <hi>Polytheism</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> within the reach of the <hi>First Commandment.</hi> For that Commandment (that <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repealed Law</hi>) forbids <hi>All other</hi> Gods, whether Equal or Unequal: The <hi>Leeks and Onions in</hi> Egypt (which are said to have been there Worshipped) as well as the <hi>Calves at</hi> Dan <hi>and</hi> Bethel. Nor is it less <hi>Idolatry,</hi> nor less within the reach of <hi>this Commandment,</hi> to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>the god of</hi> Ekron, because not <hi>Co-equal</hi> to <hi>the God of</hi> Israel.</p>
            <p>We therefore chuse to say, That Christ is indeed <hi>God</hi> (as he is expresly called, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>The Word was with God, and the Word was God;</hi> and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Thy Throne, O God, endureth for ever:</hi> And in many other

Nor can he say, This is <hi>Impossible,</hi> a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> or <hi>Inconsistent with Reason,</hi> and that therefore, though the <hi>Words</hi> be <hi>Clear and Plain,</hi> yet we must seek out some <hi>Other sence</hi> to be <hi>Forced</hi> upon them: For this Point is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Gained; and he doth Confess it, <hi>p.</hi> 3. that <hi>there is no Contradiction, in holding that there may be Three Persons in God.</hi> And, if there be <hi>no Contradiction</hi> in it, why should we be afraid to say, what in Scripture is said so plainly? Or, why should we set up <hi>Two Gods</hi> where <hi>One</hi> will serve, and when the Scripture says, <hi>There is but One?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He'll say perhaps, <hi>God made the World by Christ.</hi> And we say so too. But not as by a <hi>Tool</hi> or <hi>Instrument,</hi> (as he would have it, <hi>p.</hi> 17.) but rather as by his <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Wisdom.</hi> But the Power and Wisdom of God, are not Things diverse from God himself; but <hi>Are Himself.</hi> (Much less are they <hi>different Gods</hi> from God himself.) And, even amongst us, the Power and Wisdom of a Man, are not <hi>Things</hi> distinct from the Man; (in that sense wherein the Words <hi>Thing</hi> and <hi>Mode</hi> are contra-distinguished;) much less are they distinct <hi>Men</hi> from the <hi>Man</hi> whose <hi>Power and Wisdom</hi> they are. The <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>Wisdom;</hi> the <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>Power;</hi> are not distinguished <hi>ut res &amp; res,</hi> (as the Schools speak) but <hi>ut res &amp; modus.</hi> And <hi>Power</hi> and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102625:19"/>
               <hi>Wisdom</hi> (in the same Man) <hi>ut modus &amp; modus.</hi> For though a <hi>Man</hi> may subsist without <hi>Wisdom</hi> (but God cannot;) yet <hi>Wisdom</hi> cannot subsist without <hi>somewhat that is Wise;</hi> nor <hi>This Man's Wisdom</hi> without the <hi>Man;</hi> and therefore <hi>this Wisdom</hi> (according to the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinction) must be <hi>Modus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and not <hi>Res.</hi> (And the like of <hi>Power.</hi>) So that if we say, that <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>the Power of God;</hi> or <hi>the Wisdom of God</hi> (as he is called 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24.) and that <hi>God, by his Power and Wisdom, made the World;</hi> it doth not follow, that this <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Wisdom of God,</hi> is another <hi>God</hi> from <hi>God himself:</hi> but <hi>God and his Wisdom,</hi> or <hi>God and his Power,</hi> are <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> Consonant to this it is, where it is said, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>In him are hid all the treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge.</hi> And perhaps it is this Divine <hi>Wisdom,</hi> who tells us, Prov. 8. 22, 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27. <hi>The Lord possessed Me in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his ways; I was from Everlasting, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; When he prepared the Heavens, I was there;</hi> and much more to the same purpose. So the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is called the <hi>Power of God,</hi> Luk. 1. 35. <hi>The Holy-Ghost shall come upon Thee, and the Power of the Highest shall over-shadow Thee.</hi> Now shall we say, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Because <hi>God is Wise in heart, and Mighty in Strength,</hi> Job 9. 4. or Because <hi>by his Wisdom and Power he made the World;</hi> Therefore his Wisdom and his Power are distinct Gods from himself? Or if we should say, that God as the <hi>Fountain of Being,</hi> may be called the <hi>Father;</hi> and the same God, as the <hi>Fountain of Wisdom,</hi> be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Son;</hi> and, as the <hi>Fountain of Power,</hi> be called
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102625:19"/>
the <hi>Holy-Ghost:</hi> There is nothing of this that is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with Reason,</hi> but very <hi>Agreeable with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions of Humane Reasoning;</hi> and yet all these (however under divers Considerations) are but <hi>One God.</hi> But here I must caution again (for I find peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are willing to Mistake, or mis-apply what I say.) That I do not set down this as the <hi>Adequate</hi> Distinction between the Three Persons (for this I do not pretend throughly to Understand;) but only that it is not <hi>Inconsistent with Reason,</hi> that it <hi>May be</hi> so: And that there is no necessity, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to set up <hi>Another God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or we may say (much to the same purpose) that <hi>God</hi> by his <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> made <hi>the World;</hi> and yet that his <hi>Word,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit,</hi> are not therefore <hi>Distinct Gods</hi> from <hi>Himself.</hi> And we have them all men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the story of the Creation. <hi>God created the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> Gen. 1. 1. <hi>The SPIRIT of God moved upon the face of the waters,</hi> ver. 2. And <hi>God SAID,</hi> (or spake the <hi>Word</hi>) <hi>Let there be Light, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24. And Ver. 26. <hi>Let US make Man.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 6, 9. <hi>By the WORD of the Lord were the Heavens made; and all the Host of them by the SPIRIT, or BREATH of his Mouth: He SPAKE and it was done, He Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and it stood fast.</hi> (And to the like purpose, <hi>Psal.</hi> 148. 5. <hi>Job</hi> 26. 13.) Yet are they not <hi>Three Gods;</hi> but rather <hi>Three somewhats</hi> which are but <hi>One God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have insisted the longer on this; because I do
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102625:20"/>
not know, but that (through the Grace of God) such a discourse as this, may have a like effect on him (or some of his Party) as that of <hi>Wittichius</hi> had on his Friend <hi>Sandius.</hi> And I have Argued it <hi>Calmly.</hi> I have used no scurrillous Language; nor given any Reproachful terms. I do not oppress him with the Authority of <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Councils;</hi> but with <hi>Scripture</hi> only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Plain <hi>Reason.</hi> And it seems to me so <hi>clear,</hi> that if they cannot <hi>see</hi> it; it is from some other reason than from <hi>want of Clearness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what I have said for Explication of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasian</hi> Creed (though I cannot expect he should approve of that Creed, while he retains his Opinion,) I do not find that he takes any great Exceptions to what I say of it.</p>
            <p>He doth not like the Words <hi>Trinity in Unity,</hi> as <hi>Foreign and Unscriptural,</hi> p. 19. He may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (if that will please him better) put it into plainer English, and call it <hi>Three in One:</hi> and then the <hi>Words</hi> are <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These Three are One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Possibility</hi> of <hi>Gods being Incarnate,</hi> he doth not Deny. Only he likes the <hi>Arian</hi> Incarnation better than Ours.</p>
            <p>He seems well pleased, <hi>p.</hi> 19, 20. That I do not possitively Affirm, <hi>This Creed to be written by Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius:</hi> That I do not <hi>Anathematize the Greek Church:</hi> That I do not <hi>Damn all Children, Fools, Madmen, and all before Christ;</hi> (as, he tells us, some <hi>Rigid Irinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> I know not who, <hi>have done too often:</hi>) That I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102625:20"/>
own the word <hi>Person</hi> to be but <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> (which at <hi>p.</hi> 7. he did not like:) which, I will not disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him, by Unsaying.</p>
            <p>Where it is that I have <hi>blamed the Fathers,</hi> I do not remember. For I think the Fathers do concur in this; That there is a <hi>Distinction</hi> between <hi>the Three</hi> (which we call) <hi>Persons;</hi> greater than that between the <hi>Divine Attributes;</hi> but <hi>not such</hi> as to make them <hi>Three Gods:</hi> And, that by calling them <hi>Persons,</hi> they mean no more. And I say the same.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude with this Observation upon the whole. He was at the Beginning of his Discourse, a Direct <hi>Socinian; Dreading the guilt of Idolatry in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more Gods than One;</hi> as contrary to <hi>the First Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment:</hi> (And therein I agree with him:) But <hi>Denied</hi> the <hi>Divinity of Christ;</hi> as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do. And thus he continues till toward the end of <hi>p.</hi> 10. But then begins (silently) to tack about; and, after a while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth with as much earnestness <hi>Affirm</hi> the Divinity of Christ, as he had before <hi>Denied</hi> it; that Christ was God from the Beginning, before the World was; that he was afterward Incarnate and became Man; and, as God and Man, Redeemed us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And here he is Orthodox again. But then tells us, that this <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>the same God,</hi> or <hi>Co-equal</hi> with the <hi>Father,</hi> but <hi>another</hi> God. And at length tells us plainly, that there are, at least, <hi>Two Gods, to wit the Father and the Word:</hi> (for now the Fear of having more Gods than One, is over with him:)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102625:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and is by this time a perfect <hi>Arian.</hi> And he who, from a <hi>Socinian,</hi> is thus turn'd <hi>Arian,</hi> may at the next turn (for ought I know) turn <hi>Orthodox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to which, I would advise him to keep to the sound part of his first Opinion, while he was a <hi>Socinian,</hi> namely, <hi>That we ought to acknowledge and Worship but One God:</hi> And the sound part of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Opinion when he was turned <hi>Arian;</hi> namely, That Christ (<hi>the Word</hi>) was <hi>God, from the Beginning,</hi> (<hi>before the World was;</hi>) that he was afterward <hi>Incarnate,</hi> and so became <hi>God and Man;</hi> that, as such, he <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, Died<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and wrought out <hi>our Redemption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>;</hi> that <hi>the Merits</hi> of his <hi>Sufferings are founded on his Godhead;</hi> which otherwise would not have been meritorious, <hi>if he were only a Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> however <hi>extraordinarily assisted by God.</hi> And when he hath <hi>so</hi> joined these two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to make them Consistent: he will be therein <hi>Orthodox.</hi> And if, to these Two, he add a Third (which he owns also) namely, that <hi>there is no Contradiction, in holding, there may be Three Persons in God:</hi> he will then be able to Answer all the Cavils which either the <hi>Arian</hi> or the <hi>Socinian</hi> shall bring against it.</p>
