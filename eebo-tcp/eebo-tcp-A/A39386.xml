            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Since therefore 'tis now my part, to strengthen your hands, that they may never hang down, in the pursuit of so sacred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And I think there is enough contained in the Text, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer my end; for it intimates your Work to be honourable in God's account, and that it shall redound to your own immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal honour in the issue.</p>
            <p>Humane Nature never acts with more violence and force, than when it feels the power of Aspiring Ambition after great Renown, and tho', my Brethren, I hope the fading honour of this World is contemptible in your Eye, as Sounding Brass, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

all ambition is just, but none too great, nor any contention too warm where this is the Prize.</p>
            <p>How suitable an Application to the present occasion, my Text will admit of, may better be seen, after a little enquiry into the Context. 'Tis part of a sad Message from God, and for the greater solemnity sent by a Man of God to <hi>Eli,</hi> who was over the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> a Judge; and over the House of God the High-Priest; how he came by the latter Dignity is not evident; both from Scripture and <hi>Iosephus</hi> it appears, that he was not of the Elder Line of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Family by <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> but of the younger, from <hi>Ithamar,</hi> and consequently not the legal Heir to that Honour; but sometime, during the Rule of the <hi>Iudges</hi> over <hi>Israel,</hi> the High-Priesthood was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the younger Line, for what cause is not known: A very Learned Author,<note place="margin">

So that when better Remedies are in our power, a bare Reproof of bold Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is no sufficient discharge of our Duty; God counts this for nothing in <hi>Eli</hi>; He as a Magistrate should have made 'em Publick Examples, for a warning to others: For neglecting this, God sends him a severe Message, <hi>upbraiding</hi> him with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude for past Favours, so ill requited; <hi>charging</hi> him with honouring his Sons above his God, to fave their Reputation, he let God's sink and fall; and then <hi>recanting</hi> all his former thoughts of Kindness, all his Conditional Promises, he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens him and his Family with Utter Ruine to the Generations to come.

            <p>The latter Branch may serve to enforce the former, which I will prosecute under these General Heads. <hi>First,</hi> I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to shew that such as are sincerely engaged in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, do honour God in it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That God will repay their Zeal, by honouring them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I shall apply the whole to excite, and encourage you that are, or may be engag'd in this happy affair.</p>
            <p n="1">I. They who endeavour to suppress the Scandalous Crimes of the Age, do greatly honour God: He who is the best Judge of his own honour, plainly owns it here, in that he charges
<hi>Eli</hi> with failing to honour him, by neglecting this work.</p>
            <p>And here I must consider first what it is to honour God, And then how we may apply it to such persons. As for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God in general, 'tis not like his honouring us, which is by conferring some Excellency or Dignity upon us, to make us greater than we were before: 'Tis God's honour that he is not capable of such as this; he cannot be a more Glorious, Exalted Being, than he is. We can therefore honour God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such ways as these, <hi>either Internally,</hi> by high and lofty conceptions of his Being and Perfections, by being fill'd with adoring, admiring Apprehensions of his Infinite Majesty, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power and Goodness; making him the Object of our Chief Esteem, and Superlative Love. <hi>Or Externally,</hi> by some sensible Manifestation of this; of vvhich open, visible ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I am principally to speak; and it is to be given one of these tvvo Ways in general.</p>

               </gap> preventing or removing what may tend to disparage his perfections, to weaken his Authority with men, to abate of his due reverence, or to render him cheap and mean in the Eyes of any; this is to preserve his Honour.</p>
            <p n="2">II. When we do any thing that represents him great and glorious to others, when we express our own high thoughts of God, so as to give occasion to them to raise their esteem of him, whether it be by Words or Actions, and these either of Worship or other obedience, so praise glorifies God, <hi>Ps.</hi> 50.

            <p>Now I come to apply it, by shewing that they do thus honour God, who labour to suppress open profaness: And this will fully appear if we consider.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That open profaness is a great dishonour to God, from the reproach of which, these persons seek to rescue his Name. Tho' the Eyes of God are so very pure, that the least Mote of Sin offends them, as truly as the greatest Beam, yet not in the same measure: God is dishonoured, and his Law affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by every indulged Sin, be it never so well covered under the Vail of Secrecy, or disguised by the Arts of Hypocrisie; but then 'tis but like a private affront, which puts not half that disgrace upon a man, as some open abuse. Some reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for God is yet preserved among men, when the Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> do in outward behaviour imitate the Sons of God, when the Devil dares not appear in his own colours, but as of old, in <hi>Saul</hi>'s time, shrouds himself under the Prophets Mantle. But when men declare their Sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> when their Crimes are of the first Magnitude, and in open view; when they Swear in the Market place, Reel in the Streets, and Assemble themselves by Troops in Harlots Houses; then the Honour of God receives a deep Wound, and the highest contempt is poured on that Being of infinite <hi>Majesty,</hi> as tho' he were a Being of no Authority, whose will they dare at any time contradict, whose Indignation they Challenge, and his Threatnings they treat with Mockery and Scorn. Such things as these, sink the esteem of God in the World, and

<p>Now from this grievous contempt, the friends of God wou'd gladly see his name Vindicated; which must be either by <hi>Reclaiming</hi> such vile Offenders, of which there is almost no hope,<note place="margin">

                  <p>And among all the Works of Darkness that are common, I think there are none, against which the wounded Honour of God more requires your zealous help, than against those enormities, which you of <hi>these Societies</hi> have taken special cognizance of, <hi>viz.</hi> Profane Swearing and Cursing, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Sabbath, and abominable Uncleanness; Crimes so hainous, that one can hardly say, as God to the Prophet, Son of man, I will shew thee yet <hi>greater abominations</hi> than these. As for <hi>profane Oaths and Curses,</hi> the monstrous Sins of our Age, in which for a long time, Oaths have vyed with

words for number, &amp; the Studyed Eloquence of the times hath seen how to Swear, in the most thundring &amp; terrifying dialect; can any thing express more scorn of the Sacred and Tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous name of God, than to make it the wanton by-word of our common talk, and the mention of it the usual fruit of our <hi>Madness and Fury</hi>? that men, when angry at their fellow Creatures shou'd take their revenge upon God, by tearing and rending his dreadful name! That God and the Devil shou'd both be regarded alike by them! For either word serves the turn, that which first comes in their way, and usually where God's name is at the beginning of a Sentence, in an horrid Oath, the Devil's is at the end of it, in an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Curse, and they seem to have an equal respect for both.</p>
                  <p>As for the breach of the Holy Sabbath, since nothing hath a more direct aspect upon the Honour of God, than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Solemnities of his publick Worship, in United Assemblies; and since he hath intimated his will, that this be on one day in Seven, it must needs be a bold stroke at his Honour, in them that needlessly refuse to contribute openly to it. It was a Sacrilegious thieving from God's Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that was part of the heavy charge against <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons, they would have God's Portion, and force him to change without his consent, <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>v</hi> 15, 16.

               </item>
               <item>2. Such persons do directly honour God, in their sincere attempts of this kind, as they plainly manifest their own great esteem of God, and reverence for his Laws: What greater representation can men give of God, than that he is a Being whose reproach they cannot bear, one so great, so good, so loved by his Servants, that they are content to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his Honour with the most expensive zeal? Sure 'tis to the Glory of God when the World shall see, he hath some friends who dare espouse his Quarrel, some who are open Advocates for his despised Authority; that in a degenerate age, there are some to protest against the Usurpation of Satan; so that if he be not honoured in the Resormation of the Publick, yet in as much as you have vigorously contended for it, I may say as the Apostle;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He may probably place visible marks of Honour upon them in this Life. Our good Name is in God's keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who hath many ways to advance our esteem, and when he pleases our rankest enemies shall contribute to it, as <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> found; all promotion hath its rise in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">
