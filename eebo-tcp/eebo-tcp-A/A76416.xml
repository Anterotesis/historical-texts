            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF WILLIAM BENTLEY, Printer at FINSBURY near LONDON, touching his Right to the Printing of BIBLES and PSALMS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat in 1644. the late Kings Printers (who before did ſolely print Bibles at <hi>London</hi>) were Delinquents in Arms, and no Impreſſions of Bibles then made: By means whereof the books became very ſcarce, and the prices very dear: Which gave occaſion to the <hi>Dutch</hi> to print them beyond Seas, and import them hither; but ſo notoriouſly falſe, and erroneous, as that the then Aſſembly of Divines, taking notice thereof, and deſiring to redreſſe ſo great a miſchief (for the better Communication of the word of God to all ſorts of people in its purity) ſent for the <hi>London</hi> Stationers to know at what rates they would undertake to ſerve the Common-wealth with Bibles &amp; Pſalms, who affirmed, they could not, under 4. <hi>s.</hi> 6. <hi>d. per</hi> book in quires, and ſo declined the work.</p>
            <p>That thereupon <hi>Bentley</hi> gave over a very good trade in <hi>London,</hi> and ſold above 40. <hi>l. per annum</hi> Lands of Inheritance, and for the publick good did, by the favour of the Parliament, erect a Printing-houſe on purpoſe, and undertake to furniſh the Common-wealth with Bibles and Pſalms, (better printed and corrected than any former Editions) in Octavo (with Marginal references) and in twelves, at 2. <hi>s. per</hi> book. And (finiſhing five conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Impreſſions) did accordingly afford the ſame.</p>
            <p>That in 1649. upon the Armies advance to <hi>Ireland, Bentley</hi> ſupplied them with 4000 of the ſaid books in Octavo bound up in Leather, at no more than 2. <hi>s.</hi> 4. <hi>d. per</hi> book.</p>
            <p>And thereupon, and for his former ſervices, The Parliament in the <hi>Act</hi> for regulating Printing, dated 20. <hi>Sept.</hi> 1649. made an <hi>explicite Proviſo,</hi> that (notwithſtanding the particular Reſtrictions thereby made) That <hi>Act</hi> ſhould not extend to the printing Preſſe at Finsbury, <hi>for printing Bibles and Pſalms:</hi> but that it ſhould continue to all intents and purpoſes, as if that <hi>Act</hi> had not been had, or made.</p>
            <p>That in 1650. upon the Armies advance to <hi>Scotland, Bentley</hi> furniſhed them with 5000 of his ſaid books in Octavo in Quires, at no more than 20. <hi>d. per</hi> book.</p>
            <p>That in 1652. <hi>Robert Barker</hi> the younger, claiming a title and Intereſt to the ſole printing of the tranſlated Copy of the Bible, called the new Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, endeavoured to have it confirmed to him by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament; And to that end before the paſſing of the <hi>Act</hi> 7. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1652. for reviving the former <hi>Act</hi> for regulating Printing, put in a Proviſo to the Houſe: which being twice read, and after full Debate put to the queſtion was with a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Vote caſt out (the Parliament no wayes intending to Monopolize the Printing of the Bible.) And the ſaid 7. <hi>Jan.</hi> upon reading <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Petition to have a Liberty according to his Proviſo in the <hi>Act</hi> 20. <hi>Sept.</hi> 1649. the Parliament paſſed the <hi>Act,</hi> reviving and continuing all the clauſes and things of the former. As by the Records of Parliament may appear. By which <hi>Bentley</hi>'s right is Implicitely confirmed, both <hi>Acts</hi> being relative and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexive, and now in force as a Law.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Bentley</hi> provided himſelf with Letter and Materials for ſeveral impreſſions of Bibles and Pſalms, above twelve moneths ſince, to be afforded at reaſonable rates, engaging himſelf and friends to a very great value.</p>
            <p>But by ſome irregular dealings, and upon misinformation, the Company of Stationers have been enforced the ſixth of <hi>March</hi> laſt, to make an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Entry in their Regiſtry, contrary to their cuſtome, to <hi>Henry Hills</hi> and <hi>John Field</hi> (his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> Printers) of that Individual Copy of <hi>Barker,</hi> which the Parliament rejected, and adjudged as a Monopoly; Notwithſtanding, that <hi>Bentley</hi> and others had put in their Caveats upon better grounds before hand, but never were heard, contrary to all right and equity. Whereby <hi>Hills</hi> &amp; <hi>Field</hi> have ſought to appropriate to themſelves by abuſing the Supream Authority, that Book, which is the common Intereſt, and evidence of all Chriſtians indefinitely, and concern's the State no further than to have it well Tranſlated, and publiſhed by a prudential ſecuring the doing of the work by able men in that Myſtery; neither ought it to be reſtrain'd to the Ceremony of an Entry as any mans private Copy, It being (truely Tranſlated) the Word of God and infallible truth, and not to be conceived in the qualification of mens private works, though never ſo Divine.</p>
            <p>That 7. <hi>March</hi> laſt, <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Field</hi> (pretending good ſervice to the Common-wealth) obtained Deputations to themſelves from Sir <hi>John Barkstead,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Foxcroft,</hi> (his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> Commiſſioners for regulating of printing) in purſuance of his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> Inſtructions of 28. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1655. onely to ſearch for, and ſeize all ſcandalous, and unlicenſed books and Pamphlets: Who unlawfully, and contrary to the purport of their Deputations, abuſing their power by proſtituting it to their own private ends, ſuppreſſe all printing of the Bible and Teſtament, by thoſe who were upon the work, or bring them to unreaſonable compoſitions with them; whereby the prices of Bibles and Teſtaments are very much raiſed: And in particular the 28. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> laſt, <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Field</hi> aſſiſted by ſome Souldiers, and producing nothing, but the ſaid Deputations, did carry away from <hi>Bentleys</hi> houſe the Form and Materials for printing part of the New Teſtament, and ſeized the Sheets to his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> uſe, as if the ſame were ſcandalous. And ſeveral times before, and ſince have otherwiſe wrongfully diſturbed him; So that he, his Wife, and 7. Children being debarred of their livelyhood, ſo adviſedly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for by the Parliament, are likely to be utterly ruined and undone.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Bentleys</hi> Bibles (being for the fairneſſe of the print, and truth of the Editions generally approved of to be the beſt that ever were printed) are now ſold at 8. <hi>s. per</hi> book in Quires, at the leaſt, by the Book-ſellers: And <hi>Field</hi> hath ſo far advanced the prices of his Bibles, that he will get above 1500. <hi>l.</hi> in one bargain, more, than otherwiſe he could have done, if <hi>Bentley</hi> was not obſtructed. And thoſe ſinging Pſalms which <hi>Bentley</hi> ſold at 2. <hi>d.</hi> and 3. <hi>d.</hi> are now ſold at 6. <hi>d.</hi> by the Stationers Company; to the apparent charge and loſſe of the people as well of the three Nations, as of all the forreign Plantations. And moreover, <hi>Bentley</hi> during the time that he printed his ſaid Impreſſions, did conſtantly keep an able, and Judicious Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour in his Houſe, and allowed him above 100 <hi>Marks per Annum,</hi> for his care and pains. But in 1653. <hi>Field</hi> made an Impreſſion of the <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Pſalms</hi> in 24<hi rend="sup">o</hi>;. which for the ſmalneſſe to carry in a pocket, hath ſold very much: but it is ſo egregiouſly and wilfully falſe printed, (In which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>Field</hi> ſtandeth peremptorily to juſtifie himſelf, upon this nugatory pretence; that becauſe a ſociety of Stationers having a great ſtock, did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ſell him, he could not bear the charges of the carefull, and well correcting, and printing his books) That if theſe Texts (amongſt many hundreds of other dangerous, and pernicious faults and errours) <hi>viz. John</hi> 9.21. (wherein theſe words are omitted) <hi>Or who hath opened his eyes, we know not</hi>) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> Rom. 6.13. <hi>Neither yield ye your Members as inſtruments of righteouſneſſe unto ſin,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8.3. Rom. 9.29. 1 Cor. 6.15. 2 Epiſt. Joh. verſ. 5. Rev. 22.16.) be all of them ſeverally compared with the true, &amp; Authentick tranſlation, Thoſe <hi>Bibles</hi> are worthy of ſome remarkable diſtinction, to prevent the danger of the loſſe of many poor ignorant Souls, who ground their belief up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what they hear, or read, or of others, who being wickedly inclined, will found to themſelves a Doctrine of licentiouſneſſe, by avouching a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Text; The very publiſhing whereof ſhall bear a kinde of allowance, and approbation of Authority, being paſt over in ſilence.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Hills</hi> never yet perfected, or publiſhed any Impreſſion of the <hi>Bible;</hi> And if his knowledge and experience in the Art of printing be duely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, he may perhaps upon ſome good grounds, be adjudged no proper qualified perſon for ſo ſerious Employment.</p>
            <p>That his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> 2. <hi>July</hi> laſt, upon <hi>Bentley's</hi> Petition referred his right, and matter of fact to be examined, and certified by ſeveral honourable and reverend perſons: Who 10. <hi>Sept.</hi> laſt, after a full hearing have reported in writing their opinion, As to his right to the printing of Bibles and Pſalms by virtue of the ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> of Parliament: But (through the great affairs of the Common-wealth) <hi>Bentley</hi> hath had no opportunity to preſent it to his <hi>Highneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas a Bill is preparing to be offered to the Parliament by <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Field,</hi> and the Company of Stationers, to have (according to their pretences of ſeveral proprieties) the ſole power of printing Bibles and Pſalms, and totally to exclude <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Intereſt ſo provided for by the ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> of Parliament. Therefore leaſt any thing ſhould be done for regulating of printing in general, or particular, (being of ſuch grand concernment to this Common-wealth) to his prejudice for want of a true Information of the premiſes, (which he is ready to make good) <hi>Bentley</hi> doth humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this to your Honour; And prayes your noble favour and aſſiſtance, that he may be truely repreſented to his Highneſſe, and the Parliament, and receive Juſtice, as to their wiſdomes ſhall ſeem meet.</p>
