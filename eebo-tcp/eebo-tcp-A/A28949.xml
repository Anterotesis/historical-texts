         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAving at the beginning of the Treatiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
This is a Continuation, acquainted my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
with ſeveral things that belong in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
as well to the following Experiments, as to
thoſe There publiſh'd; it will not be neceſſary for
me to trouble the Reader with a repetition of what
he may have met with there already, nor to acquaint
him in this Addreſs with any Other particulars then
Thoſe that concern the Experiments I am now about
to preſent him.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but it will be remembred by ſome, that I
ſeem'd in the above mentioned Book to have promis'd
a Second part of it, or a large Appendix to it: but Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of that kind do many times reſpect onely the
Thing it ſelf, leaving the Giver of them free in point
of Time: and I wanted not ſufficient inducements to
delay a while to perform my Promiſe, if I made any.
I had indeed, partly before the Book already referr'd
to came from the Preſs, and partly ſometime after,
made divers other Tryals in order to a Supplement of
it: but being oblig'd to make ſome Journeys and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves,
which allowed me no Opportunity to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Experiments, I had made no very great Progres
<pb facs="tcp:102306:3"/>
in my Deſign, before the convening of an Illuſtrious
Aſſembly of <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> which has ſince made it ſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
known under the Title of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi>
And having then thought fit to make a Preſent, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſo like to imploy it well, of the great Engine, I
had till then made uſe of in the Phyſico-Mechanical
Experiments about the Air; and being unable after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to procure another ſo good, I applied my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to other Subjects, and gave over for a great while
the care of making more Experiments of that kind: and
the rather, becauſe that finding by the very favourable
reception Thoſe I had publiſh'd had met with among
the Curious in ſeveral parts of Europe, that they were
like to be Conſidered and Peruſed; I thought I might
ſafely leave the Proſecution of them to Others, who
would probably come more Freſh and untired to ſuch
an Exerciſe of their Curioſity.</p>
            <p>But obſerving, that the great Difficulties men met
with in making an Engine, that vvould exhauſt and
keep out a Body ſo ſubtle as the Air, and ſo ponderous
as the Atmoſphere, (beſides perhaps ſome other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments)
vvere ſuch, that in five or ſix year I could
hear but of one or two Engines that vvere brought to
be fit to Work, and of but one or two Nevv Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that had been added by the Ingenious Owners
of Them; I began to liſten to the Perſwaſions of
Thoſe that ſuggeſted, That unleſſe I reſum'd this work
<pb facs="tcp:102306:3"/>
my ſelf, there would ſcarce be much done in it. And
therefore having (by the help of Other work-men
then Thoſe I had unſuccesfully imploy'd before) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
a new Engine leſſe than the Other, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in ſome Circumſtances from it, we did (though
not without trouble enough) bring it to work as well
as the Other, and, as to ſome purpoſes, better. And
having once got This, I made haſt to try with it thoſe
Experiments, that belonged to the deſign'd Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and do now make up this Book.</p>
            <p>I hope, that to ſuch Readers as the following Papers
are principally intended for, I ſhall not need to make
an Apology either for the Plaineneſſe of my Style,
(wherein I aim'd at Perſpicuity, not Eloquence,) or for
my not having adorn'd or ſtufft this Treatiſe with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
or Sentences of Claſſick Authors, which I had
neither the leiſure to ſeek, nor thought I had any great
need to imploy, though it had been far more eaſie then
perhaps it would have proved, to borrow from them
things that would have been very proper to a Treatiſe
where my main Deſign was, to make out by practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Experiments divers things among other that
have not hitherto been advantaged by that way of
Probation, nor perchance thought very capable of it;
ſo that I ſhall have obtained a great part of what I
aim'd at, if I have ſhewn, that thoſe very <hi>Phaenomena,</hi>
which the School-Philoſophers, and their party urge,
<pb facs="tcp:102306:4"/>
and ſometimes triumph in, as clear Proofs of Natures
abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> may be not onely explicated,
but actually exhibited, ſome by the <hi>Gravity,</hi> and ſome
alſo by the bare <hi>Spring</hi> of the Air. Which Latter I now
mention as a diſtinct thing from the other, not that I
think it is actually ſeparated in theſe Tryals, (ſince the
Weight of the upper parts of the Air does, if I may ſo
ſpeak, bend the Springs of the lower,) but becauſe
that having in the already publiſhed Experiments,
and even in ſome of Theſe, manifeſted the Efficacy of
the Airs gravitation on Bodies, I thought fit to make it
my Task in many of Theſe, to ſhew, that moſt of the
ſame things that are done by the Preſſure of all the
ſuperincumbent Atmoſphere acting as a <hi>VVeight,</hi> may
be likewiſe performed by the Preſſure of a ſmall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Air, included indeed (but without any new
Compreſſion) acting as a <hi>Spring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preſent firſt part of our Continuation might I
confeſſe have been not inconveniently divided into
two parts. For <hi>firſt</hi> it contains ſome Experiments that
are already related in the Printed book, though they
be here ſo repeated, as to be confirmed, illuſtrated, or
improved, by being reiterated either with better Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or with better Succeſſe than when they were
made in my large Receiver, which holding (if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remember
not) about eight Gallons, could not eaſily
be ſo well exhauſted as thoſe ſmall Receivers I often
<pb facs="tcp:102306:4"/>
ſince imployed. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the other and far more
numerous ſort of Experiments, related in this Firſt
part, are new and ſuperadded. And yet I forbear to
aſſign each of theſe two ſorts a place by it ſelf, becauſe
I could not conveniently ſet down my Tryals other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then as they came to hand among my Notes;
and I conſidered, that in divers places the New ones
and the Old ones being mentioned together, might
ſerve by their neighbourhood to illuſtrate or confirm
each other. And however at another Edition of our
Continuation it will be a very eaſie task, if it appear
to be a requiſite one, to give the improvements of the
former Experiments, and the ſuperadded new ones,
diſtinct Titles and Places.</p>
            <p>As for the Mechanical contrivances I imployed in
making the following Experiments, though moſt of
them have had the good fortune to meet with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
and ſome of them with more than that,
from no mean <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> and Mathematicians; yet as I
expect that Critical Readers will judg, that in ſome
Experiments more artificial Inſtruments might have
been made uſe of, ſo I hope that they will not look
upon thoſe I was reduced to imploy, as alwayes the
beſt that ever I could have directed, ſince it ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears by diverſe paſſages of the following Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,
that they were not made at <hi>London,</hi> but in
places where the want of a Glaſs-houſe and other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accommodations
<pb facs="tcp:102306:5"/>
reduced me to make my Tryals not
after the beſt manner I could deviſe, but in the beſt
way I could then and there put in practice. And let
me add on this occaſion to what I have elſewhere ſaid
to the like purpoſe, that tis both a great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to many ingenious men, and no ſmall hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to the advancement of Natural Philoſophy, that
ſome nice Criticks are ſo cenſorious in exacting from
Attempters the very beſt Contrivances, and many that
would be attempters ſtand too much in awe of ſuch
mens judgments; for though in very nice Experiments
the exactneſſe of inſtruments is not onely deſireable
and uſeful, but in ſome caſes neceſſary; yet in many
others, where the production of a new <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is
the thing aimed at, they are to be looked upon as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors
to the Hiſtory of Nature, that performe the
ſubſtantial part of a Diſcovery, though they do it not
by the moſt eaſie and compendious wayes deviſeable,
or attain not to the utmoſt preciſeneſs that might be
wiſhed, and is poſſible. For ſuch performances, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their being ſhort of perfection, make
diſcoveries to the World of new and uſeful things;
which though others, that are more lucky at Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
and have better accommodations, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
by more compendious wayes, or with greater
preciſeneſſe; yet ſtill the World is beholding to the firſt
Diſcovery for the improvements of it, as we are to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102306:5"/>
for the firſt deviſing a way, to find by weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bodies in Water, how much Gold or how much
Silver a mixture of thoſe Metals does contain, though
(if Hiſtorians have not injured that great man in the
relation) he went a more laborious and leſſe accurate
way to work than modern Hydroſtatians, who (as I
elſewhere ſhew) may perform the ſame thing by a far
better way, which yet probably we ſhould not have
thought of, if that attributed to <hi>Archimedes</hi> had not
preceded, and afforded us a fundamental Notion.
And that the not being ſo dexterous at contriving the
wayes to effect a thing, is no ſure argument that a
man has not a true and ſolid knowledge of it, we
may eaſily learn from <hi>Euclid,</hi> vvhom our Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
generally and juſtly acknowledge to be their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and to have enriched the World with many uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Truths, and ſolidly demonſtrated all his Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though divers of his modern Commentators
have found out more compendious wayes for effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
ſeveral of his Problems, as vvell as of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
divers of his Theorems, eſpecially ſince the
excellent invention of <hi>ſpecious Algebra,</hi> by whoſe help
that accurate Mathematician Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> has, beſides
other Specimens upon intricate Propoſitions, clearly
demonſtrated the ten firſt and for the moſt part per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing
Theorems of the ſecond Element, in litle
more than as few lines. In ſumme, in Experiments
<pb facs="tcp:102306:6"/>
that are very nice, accurate Contrivances and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are induſtriouſly to be ſought, and highly to be
valued, and even in ſuch other Experiments as are
frequently to be reiterated the moſt commodious
and eaſie ways of performing them are very deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but thoſe practical Compendiums, though very
welcome to them that would repeat Tryals, are not ſo
important to the generality of Readers, as being but
uſeful to ſave pains, not neceſſary to diſcover Truths;
to vvhich men may oftentimes do good ſervice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>peculiar</hi> gift at Mechanical Contrivances, ſince
in moſt caſes They may be lookt upon as promoters of
Natural Philoſophy, who deviſe Experiments fit to
diſcover a new Truth if the attempt ſucceeds, and
propoſe wayes of bringing it to Trial, which though
perhaps not the moſt skilful or expeditious, are yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
and practicable, the increaſe of Phyſical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
being the product of the things themſelves that
are diſcovered, whatever were the Inſtruments men
imploied about making the Diſcoveries.</p>
            <p>As for the Cuts, I endeavoured to make their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Deſcriptions of moſt of the Experiments, ſo
full and plain, as to need as few Schemes as might be
to illuſtrate them: but though I hope, that they who
either were verſt in ſuch kind of Studies, or have any
peculiar facility of imagining, would well enough
conceive my meaning onely by words; yet leſt my
<pb facs="tcp:102306:6"/>
own accuſtomance to deviſe ſuch Trials, and to ſee
theſe made, ſhould make me think them more eaſily
intelligible than moſt Readers will find them, I advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with a Learned friend or two, fit to be conſulted
on ſuch an occaſion, what Experiments were requiſite
to be illuſtrated with Diagrams, and to ſuch I took
care they ſhould be annexed. Onely I forbore to
adde to the Figure of each Inſtrument Alphabetical
explications of its parts, as judging that troubleſome
work leſſe eaſie for me, than it would be for ſuch
Readers as this Tract is deſigned for, to underſtand
what is delivered by the help of a litle Attention in
conferring the Schemes of the Inſtruments with the
Verbal accounts of the Experiments they relate to.
But there is one Particular about the Cuts may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
both to be given notice of and excuſed: which
is, that having occaſion to alter the method of my
Experiments, when I began to foreſee that I ſhould
be obliged to reſerve divers things for another oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity;
and being my ſelf abſent from the Graver for a
good part of the time he was at work, ſome of the
Cuts were misplaced, and not graven in the Plates, in
which, according to the preſent <hi>ſeries</hi> of Experiments,
they might moſt properly have been put.</p>
            <p>But perhaps I may (for I am not ſure of it) more
need the Readers pardon for (unknowingly) trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
him in this Continuation with ſome paſſages,
<pb facs="tcp:102306:7"/>
that he may have already met with in the Book it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to: which though I had not read over for ſome
years before, I chanced not to have at hand, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the following Papers were written; and
though afterwards I recovered it, yet the indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my Eyes made me think it unfit rather to tire
them by reading over the whole Book, than to truſt
to the Readers good Nature (in caſe I ſhould need it)
for the pardon of a few unintended Repetitions.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, many Readers will be inquiſitive to
know, why this Treatiſe is ſtiled the Firſt part of a
Continuation: To give theſe ſome account of the
Title, I muſt put them in mind, that in the already
publiſhed Experiments I intimated, that two ſorts of
Tryals might be made by the help of our Engine: the
one, ſuch as needed but a ſhort abſence of the Air,
and the other ſuch as required that the Air ſhould not
onely be withdrawn for a vvhile, but kept out for a
conſiderable time, from the Bodies vvhereupon the
trial is made. Of the former ſort of Experiments are
theſe this preſent Book does (as vvell as that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
publiſhed did) conſiſt of. And though I have
been ſo much called upon, and troubled for certain
Writings, whereof I had made ſuch mention in thoſe
that paſt the Preſſe, as ſome Readers interpreted to be
an engagement, that it made me think fit, when I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
their demands, to be thence forward very ſhy
<pb facs="tcp:102306:7"/>
of making the Publick any promiſe; yet I was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
not to alter the Title of this Treatiſe, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it may intimate to the Curious, that there are yet
a great many things to be performed by our Engine,
beſides the productions of it I have hitherto preſented
them, and partly becauſe, though I ſtill perſiſt in my
former averſneſſe to make promiſes to the World; yet
tis very poſſible, that if God grant me life and health,
I may in due time preſent my Friends with what may
ſerve for a Second part of our Continuation, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
of Experiments that require a longer abſence of
the Air from the bodies to be wrought upon; and
I ſhall think, if this Firſt part prove not unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Curious, that the Latter will be not unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to them, as being deſigned to conſiſt of Sets
of Experiments, which by their being moſt of them
New, and ſome of them odd enough, may perchance
afford ſome not deſpicable hints to the Speculative.
But the very nature of theſe Experiments, requiring
that ſome of them ſhould be long in making, my
Friends could not reaſonably expect a quick diſpatch
of a work of this kind, though I ſhould not meet for
the future with ſuch intervening impediments, as have
hitherto diſturbed it, (as want of inſtruments, of
health, of leiſure, and of the liberty, which is ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
in this caſe, of ſtaying long enough in one place:)
notwithſtanding all which difficulties I have by
<pb facs="tcp:102306:8"/>
ſnatches been able through God's bleſſing to make
forty or fifty of deſigned Tryals, being ſuch as require
the leaſt of time to be performed in, though I now
think not fit to mention any of them, as well for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſons, as becauſe though they be made by the
help of our Engine, yet they require a peculiar appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus
of Inſtruments, very differing from thoſe we have
hitherto mentioned, and not to be intelligibly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
without many words and divers figures. In the
mean time, leſt the induſtrious ſhould be diſcouraged
by a ſurmiſe, that there is nothing left for them to do
by the help of our Engine, at leaſt as to the firſt ſort of
Experiments, I ſhall inform them, that I had thoughts
to have added divers others of that kind to theſe that
now come forth, and particularly two Cluſters of
Pneumatical trials, the one about Reſpiration, and the
other about Fire and Flame; but ſeveral of my Notes
and Obſervations being at preſent out of the way, my
having neither health nor leiſure to repair theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
and proſecute Tryals of that ſort with any
aſſiduity, makes me chuſe rather to reſerve them for
an Appendix, than to make thoſe that now come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
ſtay for them. Which will not (I preſume) be
the more diſliked, becauſe by taking this courſe I may,
in delivering of the <hi>phaenomena</hi> of Nature, imitate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <head>Some Advertiſements touching the Engine it ſelf.</head>
               <p>THough the Engine already <hi>publiſhed,</hi> and that which I imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the following Tryals, have the ſame Uſes, &amp; agree both
in the ground and the main part of their Conſtruction, yet they
differ in ſome particulars fit to be taken notice of: for after I had
preſented the great Engine I formerly made uſe of to the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Society, partly the difficulty of procuring ſuch another of that
Size and Make, and partly the deſire of making ſome improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
invited me to make ſome alterations in the Structure;
ſome of them ſuggeſted by others, (eſpecially by the Ingenious
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hook,</hi>) and ſome of them that I added my ſelf, as finding that
without them I could not do my work. Wherefore it will not
be amiſs to point at the chief differences between the former and
the latter Engine, and to intimate ſome of the conveniences and
inconveniences that attend them.</p>
               <p>As for the Conſtruction of the ſecond Engine it ſelf, ſince
tis preſumed, that the Readers of this Book have already peruſed
That of which this is a Continuation, and underſtood the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the Inſtrument that belongs to it, it was preſumed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to exhibit in the firſt Plate the delineation of the entire
Engine ready to be ſet at work; and in the ſecond, the figures of
the ſeveral Metalline parts that compoſe it, before they are ſet
together. For though theſe have not verbal and Alphabetical
explications annexed to them, yet the ſight of them may ſuffice
to make thoſe that have an imagination fitted to conceive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
contrivances, and are acquainted with the former En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
comprehend the ſtructure of this; which, Alphabetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
would ſcarce make ſuch Readers do, as are not ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified:
onely two things there are, which being of ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as well as of importance to be conceived, I ſhall here particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb facs="tcp:102306:9"/>
tak notice of. The firſt of which is, that in regard the Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is to be alwayes under water, and the perforation <hi>p q,</hi> that
paſſes perpendicularly quite through it, and ſerves together with
the ſtick <hi>r s</hi> for a Valve, is to be ſtopt at the bottom of the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder,
as at <hi>n o,</hi> when tis full of water, twas requiſite to make
the ſtick <hi>r p</hi> of a conſiderable length, as two or three foot: The
other and chief thing is that in the ſecond Plate, the Pipe <hi>AB,</hi>
whoſe end <hi>B</hi> bends upward, is made to lie in a gruve or gutter
purpoſely made in the flat wooden Board <hi>c d e f,</hi> on which the
Receivers are to reſt; which ſquare board I cauſed to be overlaid
with very good Cement, on which I took care to apply a ſtrong
plate of iron, of the bigneſs and ſhape of the Board, leaving one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a ſmall hole for the erected part of the Pipe to come out at,
which I added, not onely to keep the wooden Board the better
from warping, but becauſe I knew (what will perhaps be thought
ſtrange) that the preſſure of the Atmoſphere on one ſide of the
Board, when there is no preſſure or but very litle on the other
ſide, will enable many Aerial particles to ſtrain through the very
wood, though of a good thickneſs, and imbued with oyl to choak
the Pores; to this iron-plate we ſometimes fit a Lip turning up
about it, to hinder the Water that on ſome occaſions will come
from the Receiver from falling on the Room; (and to add that
upon the by) though the Stop-cock <hi>g h i k,</hi> that belongs to the
hitherto mentioned Pipe, may be inſerted at <hi>I.</hi> into the Barrel or
Cylinder <hi>l m n o</hi> by the help of Soder, yet we choſe as a much
better way to have the Branch <hi>I.</hi> of the Stop-cock made like a
Screw, which being once firmly ſcrewed in to the Barrel, is not
apt to be broken off, and may be more eaſily mended if any thing
happen to be out of order, which the Engine is the moſt liable
to be in or about the Pipe, partly becauſe it may fall out, (though
but very rarely if due care be but taken,) that the Air will inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
it ſelf between the wooden Board and the iron-plate, and
ſo get up (where the Pipe bends upwards) into the cavity of the
Receiver, and partly becauſe the Pipe being for a juſt reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:102306:9"/>
made but ſlender, and the part of it that looks upwards very ſhort,
it happens not very unfrequently, that when we imploy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
with narrow Orifices, where the Cement muſt lie cloſe to
the opening of the Pipe, it happens, I ſay, that the Cement, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
if it be much ſoftned by heat, is ſuckt (as they ſpeak)
into the Pipe, and ſo choaks it up; or elſe that ſome part of the
body included in the Receiver is drawn to the orifice of the Pipe,
and lying upon it as a Cover hinders the free paſſage of the Air
into the Barrel, againſt which inconvenience, to add that upon the
by, we uſe amongſt other Expedients to place juſt about the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Pipe a ſmall cover of Tin, like that of a litle Box,
which covers it at the top to hinder any thing from lying imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon the Pipe, and has a ſmall opening or two in the
ſide, to give the Air of the Receiver free acceſs to the Pipe.</p>
               <p>The ſquare and hollow wooden part of this Engine, diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the firſt plate, is ſo made, that it may contain not onely the
Cylinder, but ſo much water, as will alwaies keep the Cylinder
quite cover'd with that liquor; by which means the Sucker, lying
&amp; playing alwaies under water, is kept ſtill turgid and plump, and
the water being ready at hand to fill up any litle interval or chink,
that may happen to be between the Sucker and the inſide of the
Barrel, does together with the newly mentioned plumpneſs of
the Sucker very much conduce to the exact keeping out of the
Air. But this advantage is not without ſome inconvenience, for
divers times, if great care be not taken in turning the Stop-cock,
the water will be impell'd into the Receiver, and much prejudice
ſundry Experiments, when the included bodies are ſuch that may
be ſpoiled or impaired (at leaſt for the preſent) by that liquor.
The ſmalneſs of our Cylinder is a convenience in regard of the
facility it affords to make and diſpatch thoſe many Experiments
that may be performed in ſmall Receivers, though it make thoſe
more troubleſome and tedious, that require the Exhauſtion of
large and capacious ones.</p>
               <p>The flat Plate (mentioned a litle above) has this great conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
<pb facs="tcp:102306:10"/>
in many Experiments, that the Receiver needs no Stop-cock
of its own; for ſuch a veſſel being made all of an entire piece
of Glaſs, and whelmed on upon the Plate well covered with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
can better keep out the Air, than if there were a ſtop-cock,
at which the Air does but too frequently get in; but beſides that
in divers Experiments ſuch Receivers do uſually require to be
wide mouthed, whereby a greater compaſs is to be fenced againſt
the ingreſs of the Air, ſeveral Experiments cannot ſo convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be tryed in this ſort of Receivers.</p>
               <p>But becauſe, that though this ſecond form of our Engine hath
as to ſeveral purpoſes its peculiar conveniences and advantages,
yet ſome <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> may be furniſhed with the other already, and
ſome may conceive it the more clearly of the two, or may judg it
preferable for their particular deſigns; I ſhall here intimate, that
for moſt of the Experiments, if not all, that follow in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
they may make uſe of, or at leaſt make a ſhift with the firſt
Engine, with a very few alterations; whereof the chief is to be
this, That to the upper part of the great Cylinder, on the ſide
oppoſite to the iron-rack, there is to be faſtned ſuch a ſquare
Board, and ſuitable iron-plate, as is uſed in the ſecond Engine,
betwixt which Board and Plate is to be lodged ſuch a Pipe as was
lately deſcribed, being either a continuation of the outward
branch of the Stop-cock, or elſe firmly faſtned to it by ſodering
or ſcrewing: for by this means, when the Sucker is depreſt, the
Air will through the Cavity of this Pipe, and the Stop-cock
whereto it is annexed, paſs freely by virtue of its own Spring out
of the Receiver into the exhauſted Cylinder; though this, and the
Sucker that moves in it, being not kept as in the ſecond form
of the Engine under water, the greater care will be needed to
keep the Air from inſinuating it ſelf between them. A good
Cement, to faſten the Receivers to the often mentioned Plate
of Iron, is a thing of no ſmall moment in making the following
Experiments, of which we imploy differing Compoſitions for
differing purpoſes, ſome of which are not neceſſary to be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:102306:10"/>
in that part of this work that now comes forth; but that
which in almoſt all the following Tryals we chiefly make uſe of,
is a well wrought mixture of (yellow) Bees wax and Turpentine,
which compoſition as it ſerves better than moſt others to keep
out the Air, ſo it has the conveniency, which is no ſmall one, of
ſeldome needing to be heated, and ſeldomer to be much ſo; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if we imploy a litle more Turpentine in Winter than in
Summer, in the former of which ſeaſons, as much, or very near as
much of that ingredient as of the Wax does well, for as in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
a mixture of three parts of Wax to about two of Turpentine
is more proper.</p>

               <p>DIvers ways have been propoſed to ſhew <hi>both</hi> the Preſſure of
the Air, as the Atmoſphere is a heavy Body, and that the
Air, eſpecially when compreſs'd by outward force, has a Spring
that enables it to ſuſtain or reſiſt a preſſure equal to that of as
much of the Atmoſphere, as can come to bear againſt it, <hi>and</hi> alſo
to ſhew, that ſuch Air as we live in, and is not condens'd by any
humane or adventitious force, has not onely a <hi>reſiſting</hi> Spring,
but an <hi>active</hi> Spring (if I may ſo ſpeak) in ſome meaſure, as when
it diſtends a flaccid or breaks a full-blown Bladder in our exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted

               <p>But obſerving that there ſeems to want a viſible Experiment
to convince thoſe that are not ſo eaſily ſatisfy'd with Reaſons,
though drawn by juſt conſequence from Phyſical or Mechanical
Truths, or even from other Experiments, taking notice, I ſay,
hereof, I made the following Experiments; not ſo much to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
or removed a ſcruple no better grounded, as to have a new
way of making an Eſtimate by ſome known and determinate
meaſure of the force of the bare Spring of the Air, both in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
ſtate, (as tis ſaid to be when not compreſs'd nor ratify'd,
more then the free Air we breath,) and according to its ſeveral
degrees of Expanſion.</p>
               <p>We took then a Viol, with a neck not very large, and having
fill'd about a fourth part of it with Quick-ſilver, we ſo erected
and faſtned a long and ſlender Pipe of Glaſs, open at both ends in
the neck of the Viol, with hard ſealing wax, that the lower end
reach'd almoſt to the bottom of the Quick-ſilver, and the upper
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102306:16"/>
more then a yard above the viol. Then having blown in a little
air, to try whether the Inſtrument did not leak, (which tis very
difficult to keep ſuch inſtruments from doing,) we conveigh'd it
into a long and ſlender Receiver,<note place="margin">See plate the III Figure the</note> fit for ſuch an uſe, and having
withdrawn the Air as well as we could, we found according to our
expectation, that the Spring of the Air, included in the viol, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
up the Quick-ſilver into the erected Pipe, to the height of
27. inches, and having ſuffer'd the External air to return into the
Receiver, the Quick-ſilver ſubſided in the Tube, ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
and ſometimes quite as low as the ſtagnant Quick-ſilver in
the viol.</p>
               <p>For the better illuſtration of this Experiment, thus ſummarily
related, but with the like ſucceſs, as to the main, ſeveral times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
we will ſubjoyn the following Obſervations and Notes.</p>
               <p>I. That we try'd this Experiment ſeveral times, and the laſt
time in the preſence of the famous Savilian Geometer, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Wallis,</hi>
who ſaw the Quick-ſilver in the Pipe impell'd up to 27. inches,
being one himſelf of the meaſurers; and though at other times
we found it to be much about the ſame height with the laſt, yet
once it ſeem'd plainly to be a pretty deal higher; which yet we
ſpecifi'd not, becauſe a miſchance took off the mark, which we
had made to meaſure the height by.</p>
               <p>II. Having once, to try the ſtanchneſſe of the viol, blown in
ſo much Air, (without taking out any thing as we uſe to do in the
like caſe) that the Air in the cavity of the viol raiſ'd and kept the
Quickſilver 3. inches high in the Pipe, when we went on with the
reſt of the Experiment, according to the way above deſcrib'd, we
found, by emptying the Receiver of air, that we were able to
raiſe the Quickſilver in the Cane 30. inches, or ſomewhat more
above that in the viol.</p>
               <p>III. Sometimes it may happen, that the Mercury, when ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
very ſoon out of the Receiver, will not appear to have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
to its firſt lowneſſe, which perhaps 'twill not ſink to in ſome
while after: which is not to be wondred at, ſince in ſuch a Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102306:17"/>
which contains but little air, the heat of the Cement and
the iron, imploy'd to melt it quite round the Receiver, may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
a little warmth to the air in the viol, which will after return
to its former Temper. But this Accident is neither conſtant
nor neceſſary to the Experiment.</p>
               <p>IV. Tis very remarkable, that if the Receiver be fitly ſtopt,
and ſlender enough; upon the turning of the Stop-cock, to let out
the air at the firſt exuction, the Mercury will be impell'd up by
the ſpring of the Air in the viol, ſuddenly flying abroad or ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſelf, ſo that it will be raiſ'd ſeveral inches above the height
it will reſt at afterwards, and will make ſeveral vibrations up and
down before it come to ſettle, juſt as the Mercury does in the
<hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, (the bare preſſure of the little air do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here to the Mercury, what the weight of the Atmoſphere
does there,) and ſuch motions of the Mercury will be made four
or five ſubſequent Exuctions, upon the withdrawing of the air
in the Receiver. But as theſe grow leſſer and leſſer, as the Spring
of the included Air grows fainter, ſo none of them is any thing
near ſo conſiderable as the vibrations made upon the firſt Suck.</p>
               <p>V. Agreeable hereunto we obſerv'd, that at the firſt Exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
when the Spring of the included Air was yet ſtrong, the
Mercury would be raiſ'd by our Eſtimate above half, if not ⅔ of
the whole height, whereto 'twill at length be brought, (though
that muſt be according to the bignes of the Receiver, and other
circumſtances,) and the ſubſequent Exuctions do ſtill adde leſs
and leſs proportions of height to the Mercurial Cylinder, and
that for two Reaſons: the one, becauſe the more there is of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
impell'd into the Tube, the greater weight of Mercury preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
upon the included air: and the other, becauſe the air has ſo
much the more room in the viol to expand it ſelf, whereby its
ſpring muſt be proportionably weakned.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when we made moſt of theſe Tryals, I had the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to obſerve the height of the Mercury in a good Barometer,
and thereby found, that the Air was then but light; its greateſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102306:17"/>
height reaching but to 29 inches, and ⅜, and its height ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Tryal, whereof D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Wallis</hi> was a witneſſe, amounting but
to 29. inches.</p>
               <p>To make an eſtimate of the Quantity of Air, that had raiſ'd
the Quickſilver to 27 inches, we took the viol that was imploy'd
about this Experiment; and having counterpois'd it, whilſt it was
empty, we afterward fill'd it with water, and found the Liquor to
weigh 5. Ounces, 2. Drachms, and about 20. Grains; and then
having pour'd out the water, till it was ſunk to a mark which we
had made on the outſide of the Glaſs, to take notice how high the
Quick-ſilver reach'd that we pour'd in: and laſtly, weighing the
remaining water, equal in bulk to the Quick-ſilver, we found it
to amount to 1. Ounce, 2. Drachms, 14. Grains; ſo that the air,
that had rais'd up the Mercury, poſſeſs'd (before its Expanſion)
in the viol the place but of 4. ounces, and a few odde grains, <hi>i. e.</hi>
of about ¼ of a Pint of water. And as for the Pipe alſo, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
about the ſame Experiment, we found its Cavity to have
about ⅛ part of an Inch in Diameter.</p>
               <p>It was one of the Uſes I hop'd to make of this Experiment,
that by comparing the ſeveral degrees of Expanſion of air inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the viol, with the reſpective and increaſing heights of the
Mercury that was impell'd up into the Pipe, ſome eſtimate might
be made of the force of the Spring of the Air weaken'd by ſeveral
degrees of Dilatation; but for want of conveniences I forbore to
venter upon ſuch nice Obſervations, eſpecially becauſe the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the dilated air, that remains in the Receiver, and is exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to the air included in the viol, muſt alſo be taken into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Another Uſe of our Experiment may be this: That it may
ſupply us with a conſiderable Argument againſt ſome Learned
men, who attribute the ſuſpenſion of the Quick-ſilver in the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricellian</hi>
Experiment to a certain rarify'd matter, which ſome call
a <hi>Funiculus,</hi> and whereto others give other names; which rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
ſubſtance they ſuppoſe to draw up and ſuſtain the Quick-ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102306:18"/>
in compliance of Natures abhorrency of a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> For in
the Experiment under conſideration, the Quick-ſilver being not
onely ſuſtain'd at the height of 27 inches in the Tube, but eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thither; if the cauſe of This be demanded, it will be anſwer'd,
according to their <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> that the air in the Receiver, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to that of the Viol, being, by reaſon of the ſucking out of
ſome of it by the Pump, more rarified than that in the viol, it
draws up to it the Quick-ſilver in the Cane, and the more it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd,
the higher it is enabl'd to draw it. But then I demand,
whence it comes to paſs, that though we can, by perſevering to
pump, more and more rarifie the little remaining air, or the Aë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
ſubſtance in the Receiver, That in the viol not appearing to
be alſo rarified, yet the air in the Receiver does not by virtue of
its ſuperadded rarefaction, whereby it exceeds that of the air in
the viol, pull up the Quick-ſilver to a greater height in the Tube
then 27. inches: For, that this is not the greateſt height, to which
Mercury may be raiſ'd by this rarefy'd ſubſtance, our Adverſaries
muſt not deny, who tell us, that in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment
it ſuſtains a Mercurial Cylinder of 29. inches, and ½, and can
raiſe a Cylinder of 29 inches to 29 ½, or higher, in caſe that the
Cylinder be made to vibrate up and down in the Tube.</p>
               <p>And as for thoſe,<note place="margin">See the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment.</note> that will in ſuch caſes, as our Experiment
ſuggeſts, have recourſe onely to that which they call the <hi>Fuga
Vacui,</hi> they may pleaſe alſo to conſider, that ſince the Quick-ſilver
remains the ſame, its aſcenſion in the Tube will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable
for what they think to be Natures purpoſe; for, whether
it reach higher or lower in the Tube, it will adaequately fill no
more ſpace in one poſture, or in one figure, then in another, in
what part ſoever of the cavity of the Receiver it be plac'd.</p>

               <head type="sub">Shewing, that much included Air raiſ'd Mercury in an open Tube,
no higher than the weight of the Atmoſphere may in a Baroſcope.</head>
               <p>IN the former Experiment, by reaſon of the ſmalneſs of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol,
that was employ'd about it, there was ſo little Air included,
that the Expanſion of it ſo far, as was requiſite to impell up the
Mercury in the Pipe to the above mentioned height of 27. inches,
may be probably ſuſpected to have very much weaken'd its
Spring, and therefore it may be thought, that (eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the great force that ſeveral of our Experiments manifeſt
impriſon'd air to have,) if there were a greater Quantity of air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the veſſel, ſo that the Expanſion, ſufficient to raiſe the
Mercury to the former height, would not need to be conſiderable,
(becauſe that the capacity of the Tube being but the ſame, the
whole included air will be ſo much the leſſe expanded, by how
much the more of it there is,) it ſeem'd probable that the Spring
of the Air, being but a little weakned by ſo ſmall a dilatation,
would remain ſtrong enough to raiſe a much taller Cylinder of
Mercury in the Tube, and perhaps make the Liquor run over into
the Receiver.</p>
               <p>But though this Suggeſtion ſeem probable enough, yet when
I conſider'd, that the weight of the Atmoſphere is able to ſuſtain
a Cylinder of Quick-ſilver but of 30. inches, or thereabouts, (in
perpendicular height,) and conſequently that the preſſure of ſuch
a Mercurial Cylinder is equivalent to that of an Atmoſpherical
Cylinder of the ſame bore; 'twas not difficult to conclude, that
ſince the Air in a viol, before the mouth is clos'd, has a Spring but
equal in ſtrength to the weight of the Atmoſpherical Pillar that
leans upon it, (for if the Spring were too ſtrong for the weight
that leans on it, ſome of the air would get out of the viol,) a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
viol, and conſequently a greater quantity of included air would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102306:19"/>
not be able by its ſpring to elevate and ſuſtain a longer Cylinder
of Mercury, than the weight of the Atmoſphere is able to do; nor
indeed altogether ſo much, becauſe of ſome little (though but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle)
Diminution of the Spring by ſome (though but a ſmall) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion,
that the included Air ſuffers, by ſucceeding in the place
of the Mercury, that is impell'd up.</p>
               <p>To clear therefore this matter by an Experiment, we took a
ſtrong glaſs-bottle, capable of holding about a Quart of Liquor,
and having put into it a convenient quantity of Quick-ſilver, we
erected in it a very long and ſlender pipe of Glaſs, open at both
the ends, and reaching at the lower end beneath the ſurface of
the ſtagnant Mercury, and having faſten'd this pipe in the neck
of the Bottle, by choaking up that neck very accurately with
good Cement, that none of the included air might be able to get
out, we conveigh'd the whole into a Receiver, like that imploy'd
about the I. Experiment in ſhape, but much larger, that it might
be able to contain ſo great a veſſel; and then the Engine being ſet
a work, we quickly rais'd the Quick-ſilver to a greater height than
formerly, and when we ſaw it come to a ſtand, we did by the help
of ſome marks, made before hand on the pipe, and by the help of
a very long and well divided Ruler, meaſure, with as much care
and accurateneſs as the figure of the veſſels would allow us to do,
the height of the Mercurial Cylinder, which we found to be 29.
inches, and about ⅞, to which abating half an inch, which was rais'd,
before the Pump was employed, by ſome air that had been
blow'd into the Bottle, to try whether it were ſtanch; deducting,
I ſay, this half Inch of Quick-ſilver, which remain'd in the Tube
after the external Air was let in, (as well as it had been there before
the Receiver was exhauſted,) out of the newly mention'd number
there remain'd 29. inches, and neer ⅜, for the height of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
rais'd by the Spring of the Air, ſhut up in the Bottle: and
then conſulting with the above mentioned Baroſcope, which ſtood
in a window in another part of the houſe, I found, that the weight
of the Atmoſphere did bear a Mercurial Cylinder of about 29.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102306:19"/>
Inches and ½, which was higher by ⅛ than that to which the
Spring had rais'd the Quick-ſilver in the exhauſted Receiver: and
the Difference perhaps would have been greater, if the place,
where the Experiment was made, had not by its warmth added
ſome little matter to the Spring of the Air, and if alſo we could
have kept the Mercury ſo long elevated, as to give it leave to
diſcharge its ſelf of thoſe ſmall bubbles, which tis almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in ſuch Experiments as this to free Quick-ſilver from, without
ſome help from time.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, though we caus'd the Pump to be ply'd, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we could not, by the more diligent Exuction of the Receiver,
raiſe the Quick-ſilver above the height of that which the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere
kept ſuſtain'd in the Baroſcope, yet our labour gave us
but a confirmation, that the Spring of the <hi>Air</hi> would not raiſe the
Mercury higher, then did the <hi>weight</hi> of the Atmoſphere, which
may not a little confirm the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Obſervation.</p>
               <p>N B. This was not the onely nor the firſt Experiment we
made of this kind, but this being carried on without miſchances,
(with which divers others were attended,) and made with much
care, I thought fit to ſet down This in ſtead of all, intimating ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
about the reſt, that they ſeem'd to agree well for the
main with that, which is here recited; onely there is one thing
relating to thoſe other Experiments, that ſeems not altogether
unworthy to be taken notice of; which is, that when our Tryals
were made in veſſels, that contain'd a conſiderable quantity of Air,
though upon the exhauſtion of the Receiver the Spring of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
Air could not raiſe the Quick-ſilver to the top of the pipe,
yet ſometimes by other Effects it manifeſted it ſelf to be very
ſtrong, as once or twice by the blowing out or breaking the
Cork or Cement, and other matter that was imploy'd to ſtop the
Glaſs it was ſhut in; and once by an Accident too memorable to
be here paſt over in ſilence.</p>
               <p>I had one day invited D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Wallis</hi> to ſee ſuch an Experiment as I
have been relating, made with (not a viol, but) a bottle of Green
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102306:20"/>
Glaſs, (ſuch as we uſe now for Wine,) and 4 or 5 pounds of
Mercury. After this Learned Perſon and I had continued Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators
as long as we thought fit, we withdrew into another
Room, where we had not ſat long by the fire, before we were
ſurpriz'd by a ſuddain noiſe, which the perſon, that occaſion'd it,
preſently came running in to give us an account of, by which it
appear'd, that this Ingenious young Man, (whom I often imploy
about Pneumatical Experiments, and whom I mention'd to Your
Lordſhip, becauſe <hi>I. M.</hi> has the honour to be ſomewhat known
to You,) being deſirous in our abſence to ſatisfie the Curioſity
he had to know, whether the Quick-ſilver could not be rais'd
higher in the pipe than I had foretold, plyed the Pump ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
that at length, the Bottle being not, it ſeems, every where
equally ſtrong, the impriſon'd air found it more difficult to make
the Quick-ſilver run over at the top of the pipe, than to break the
Bottle in the weakeſt place, and accordingly did not onely throw
off a piece of the Bottle, but threw it with ſuch violence againſt
the large and ſtrong Receiver, as broke that alſo, and render'd it
unſerviceable for the future. But the Doctor and I laying toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Pipe, which happen'd to be broken into but few pieces,
concluded by the place, to which we were told it reacht when this
Accident happened, that it had not exceeded, nor indeed fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall'd
the height, to which the weight of the Atmoſphere might
have rais'd it.</p>

               <head type="sub">Shewing that the Spring of the included Air will raiſe Mercury to

               <p>HAving ſhown in the two former Experiments, that the <hi>Active</hi>
ſtrength of the Airs Spring is very conſiderable, I thought
good alſo to examine, whether or no to the other reſemblances
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102306:20"/>
in operation between the weight of the free Air, and the preſſure
of the included Air, this alſo may be added, that as the gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Atmoſphere is able (as we ſhall hereafter prove) to
ſuſtain the Mercury at the ſame height in leſſer and greater Tubes,
ſeal'd at the top; ſo the Preſſure of the included Air may be able
to ſuſtain the Mercury at the ſame height in ſlenderer and in lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Tubes, though in the latter it muſt ſuſtain a far greater
weight of Mercury than in the former; provided allowance be
made for the weakning, which the Spring of the included Air
muſt be ſubject to, by reaſon that, to ſucceed in the place of a large
Cylinder of Mercury impell'd up into the greater Tube, it muſt
expand it ſelf more, and conſequently have its Spring more
weakned, than if the Tube were ſlender.</p>
               <p>To proſecute this Experiment, I thought on a peculiar ſhape
of veſſels, which, if I had been where there is a Glaſs-houſe, I
would have cauſ'd to be blown for the more convenient trying
of two Pipes of different bores at the ſame time. But though I
wanted this Accommodation, I thought I might well enough
ſhow what I intended by imploying ſucceſſively two Tubes of
very differing ſizes, provided the veſſel for the including of the
Air were the ſame.</p>
               <p>Wherefore taking the Glaſs bottle, made uſe of to try the
former Experiment, and erecting in it after the manner above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
a Cylindrical pipe of Glaſs, a good deal larger than the
former, (if not as large agen,) we proſecuted the Experiment as
we had made it, with the ſlender Tube above mentioned, and
found that we were able, by the Spring of the Air in the bottle,
to raiſe the Quick-ſilver to a conſiderable height, which, meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
as well as the veſſel would allow us, was, by the leaſt eſtimate
that was made of it, (which was mine) 28. inches, and ⅛, by which
it appear'd to want ſomewhat above an Inch of the height of the
Mercurial Cylinder, which the weight of the Atmoſphere could
have ſuſtain'd, as appear'd by the Barometer, wherein the Quick-ſilver
at that time was about 29. inches, and ¼ high; which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102306:21"/>
was no more then I expected, conſidering that, whereas
the weight of the Atmoſphere is ſtill the ſame when the Mercury
is at its full height (and that whether the Pipe be great or ſmall)
in a ſeal'd Tube; the Spring of our included Air muſt needs be
weakned the larger the Tube is, and the higher the liquid Metal
is impell'd in it, ſo that it ſeem'd a conſiderable <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> that
the Spring of ſo little Air ſhould be able to raiſe the Mercury as
high within an Inch or thereabouts in a wider as in a ſlenderer
Tube, ſince the Diameter of the Cavity of the former being by
our eſtimate double to that of the latter, (into which the ſlender
Pipe could eaſily be put <hi>as into</hi> a Caſe too big for it:) The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Mercurial Cylinder may be ſuppoſ'd to have weighed near
four times as much as the leſſer; I ſay, <hi>near,</hi> becauſe there was an
Inch difference in their heights: but in caſe theſe had been equal,
then the Solidities of the Cylinders would have been to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as their Baſes; and ſince theſe, being Circular, are in duplicate
proportion to their Diameters, that is, as the Squares of their
Diameters; its plain, that if the Diameters be as one to two, the
Squares of them muſt be as one to four; and theſe Cylinders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of the ſame Mercury, their Weights will have the ſame
Proportions with their Solidities, and conſequently would be as
one to four, making the abatement formerly intimated for the
Inch and a little more of Mercury, by which the larger Cylinder
came ſhort of the height of the former.</p>
               <p>NB. 1. This and the two former Experiments tryed by us
with Quick-ſilver, may be alſo tryed with Water; but beſides
that we could hardly procure Tubes long enough for ſuch Tryals,
we were not very ſollicitous about it: for if we attentively enough
conſider, what has been already deliver'd, and the Proportion in
ſpecifick gravity betwixt Water and Quick-ſilver, (whereof the
latter is near 14. times as heavy, bulk for bulk, as the former,)
'twill not be difficult to foreſee the Event of ſuch Experiments,
which he, that has a mind to make, ſhould be furniſh'd not onely
with long Tubes, but with capacious Veſſels to ſhut up the Air in.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102306:21"/>
Elſe the Air will be ſo far expanded before the Water has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
near the height, to which the weight of the Atmoſphere
may raiſe it, that the Experiments will not ſeem to ſucceed near
ſo well with Water, as ours did with Quick-ſilver.</p>
               <p>2. We thought it worth trying, whether, when the included
Air had rais'd the great Cylinder of Mercury to the utmoſt
height, it could elevate it to, by the Spring it then had; it would
not be brought to raiſe the Quick-ſilver yet higher, if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Expanſion it had already, there were an agitation
made by the heated Corpuſcles of the ſame Air. And in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of this Curioſity having caus'd an hot Iron and a Shovel
of kindled Coals to be held near the oppoſite parts of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
we perceiv'd after a while, that the Mercury aſcended ⅛ of an
inch or better above the greateſt height it had reach'd before. But
conjecturing that it would have riſen higher, were it not that
whilſt the application of the hot bodies was making, ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Air had unperceivably ſtolen into the Receiver, I cauſ'd
the Pump to be ply'd again to withdraw the Air, I ſuſpected to
have got in, by which means the Mercury was quickly rais'd ⅝ of
an inch, (or better,) by virtue of this Adventitious Spring, (if I
may ſo call it,) which the included Air acquir'd by heat, and I
made no doubt, that it might have been rais'd much higher, but
I was unwilling by applying a leſs moderate heat to hazard the
breaking of my Glaſſes, in the place I then was in, where ſuch a
miſchance could ſcarce have been repair'd.</p>

               <p>We took a Glaſſ-bottle with a convenient quantity of Water
in it, and fitted this Bottle with a ſlender glaſs-pipe open at both

hard Cement imploy'd to fill the ſpace betwixt the Pipe and the
inſide, ſo well and firmly clos'd, that no Water or Air could get
out of the bottle,<note place="margin">See plate the Figure the</note> nor no externall Aire could get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, but by paſſing through the Pipe. This Inſtrument was
convey'd into a large Receiver ſhap'd like a Pear, of which a good
part of the blunt end, and a ſmall part of the ſharp end are cut off
by Sections parallel to the Horizon, and conſequently to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
And becauſe this Receiver was not (nor ought to be)
long enough to receive the whole Pipe, there was Cemented on
to the upper part of it a ſmaller Receiver of white Glaſs, of ſuch a
length and bigneſs, that the upper end of the Pipe might reach to
the middle of its Cavity, or thereabouts, and that the motions of
the ſpringing water might have a convenient Scope, and ſo be the
better taken notice of.</p>
               <p>This double Receiver being cemented on to the Engine, a little
of the Air was by one Suck of the Pump drawn out from it, by
which the Preſſure of the remaining Air being weakned, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that ſince the Air included in the Bottle had not its Spring
likewiſe weakned, it ſhould expand it ſelf, and conſequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
up the water in the ſame Bottle through the Pipe, which it did
ſo vigorouſly, as to make it ſtrike briskly at firſt againſt that part
of the top of the ſmaller Receiver, which was juſt over the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Pipe. But after it had a while made the Water thus
ſhoot up in a perpendicular line, as the Spring of the Air in the
Bottle grew by that Airs dilatation to be weaken'd, the Water
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102306:22"/>
would be impell'd up leſs ſtrongly and leſs directly, till the Air
in the Bottle being as much expanded as that in the Receiver, the
Aſcent of the Water would quite ceaſe, unleſs by Pumping a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more Aire out of the Receiver we renew'd it again.</p>
               <p>About the making of this Experiment theſe Particulars may
be noted.</p>
               <p>1. Tis convenient, that the upper part of the Pipe be made
(as it eaſily may be at the flame of a Lamp) very ſlender, that the
Water having but a very ſmall Orifice to iſſue out at, may be
ſpent but ſlowly, and thereby make the Experiment laſt ſo much
the longer.</p>
               <p>2. You may, if you pleaſe, in ſtead of making the upper part
of the Pipe ſlender, as was juſt now directed, Cement on to it a
Top either of Glaſs or Braſs, conſiſting of three or more very
ſlender Pipes, with a Pin-hole at the end of each, that one of theſe
pointing directly upwards, and the others to the right hand and
to the left, the Water may ſpin out ſeveral ways at once, by which
kind of branched Pipes we have ſometimes imitated the <hi>Jets
d' eau</hi> (as the French call them) and Artificial fountains of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
and Groto's.</p>
               <p>3. In regard that ſo ſhort a Cylinder of Water, as exceeded
not the length of our Glaſs pipe, could not make any conſiderable
reſiſtance to the expanſion of the included Air, it was thought
and found ſafe enough to imploy in ſtead of a ſtrong Glaſs-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a much larger Viol, without being ſollicitous about its ſhape,
or that it ſhould be very ſtrong, and by this means we could make
this pleaſant Spectacle laſt a great while, eſpecially if we alſo made
uſe of the expedient to be mentioned in the following Note.</p>
               <p>4. If you find that the included Air have by expanding it ſelf
too much weaken'd its Spring, whilſt there yet remains with it a
good quantity of Water in the Bottle or Viol, you may reinforce
the preſſure of the Air by onely turning the Stop-cock, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in what air you think fit to the exhauſted Receiver: for upon

               <p>That if, inſtead of the above mentioned braſs Hoop, both
whoſe Orifices are of equal breadth, you imploy a hollow (but
taller) piece of Braſs, or (which is more eaſily made) of Latton,
ſhap'd like a <hi>Conus iruncatus,</hi> or a Sugar-loaf, whoſe upper part
is taken off parallel to the bottom; and if you make the two Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of a breadth ſufficiently unequal, as if the larger being made
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102306:25"/>
as wide as that of our Braſs-hoop, the ſtraiter were leſs than an
Inch in Diameter; You will find, that if this piece of Metal be
made uſe of, as the other was in the foregoing Experiment, the
flat Glaſs cemented on to the Orifice, will be eaſily broken, as
formerly when tis faſtned to the wider Orifice; but if the ſtraiter
Orifice be turn'd upward, the Glaſs that covers it, if it be of a
due thickneſs, (though no thicker than the former,) will remain
entire, notwithſtanding the withdrawing of the Air from beneath
it: Which ſeems ſufficiently to argue, that tis not preciſely Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
abhorrency of a <hi>vacuum,</hi> that is the cauſe why Glaſſes are
uſually broken in ſuch Experiments, ſince whether the wider or
the narrower Orifice be uppermoſt, and cover'd, (the Metalline
part of the veſſel being the ſame, and onely varying its poſture,)
the capacity of the exhauſted veſſel will be equal; and therefore
Nature ought to break the Glaſs as well in one caſe as the other,
which yet the Experiment ſhows ſhe does not.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this Diverſity ſeems much better explicable by
ſaying, that when the wider Orifice is uppermoſt, the Glaſs that
covers it muſt ſerve for the Baſis of a large Atmoſpherical Pillar,
which by its great weight may eaſily force the reſiſtance of the
Glaſs: whereas when the ſmaller Orifice is uppermoſt, there leans
upon its Cover but ſo ſlender a Pillar of the Atmoſphere, that
the natural tenacity or mutual cohaeſion of parts in the Glaſs
is not to be ſurmounted by a weight that is no greater.</p>

               <p>THe foregoing Experiments having ſufficiently manifeſted the
ſtrength of the Airs Spring upon fluid Bodies, I next
thought fit to try, whether the force of a little included Air would
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102306:25"/>
alſo upon conſiſtent and even Solid bodies emulate the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the weight of the Atmoſphere. In the proſecution of
which Enquiry we thought fit to make two ſorts of Tryals: the
one, where the Air is included in the Bodies, on which its Spring
does work; and the other, where tis External to them. Of the
firſt ſort are this 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and the two following Experiments; and of
the ſecond ſort are ſome other Tryals, to be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Experiment.</p>
               <p>Having formerly mention'd to Your Lordſhip, that we were
ſeveral times able (though ſometimes not without much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
to make a blown Bladder break with the Spring of its own
Air; I ſhould not think it worth while to ſay any thing here about
the ſame <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> but that (beſides that it ſeems odd enough,
and is not unpleaſant to many Spectators,) it may deſerve not to
be wholly neglected, becauſe a Good way to break Bladders in
the much Exhauſted Receiver, may ſometimes prove an uſeful
Expedient, eſpecially in ſuch caſes where the Experimenter (who
ſometimes either is not skilful enough, or well enough furniſh'd
with accommodations to regulate the ingreſs of the Air) would
very ſuddainly ſupply the Receiver with freſh Air, when it has
been much emptied, without danger of letting in too much Air
from without. Not to mention, that the Air, included in the
Bladder to be broken, may be ſo mingled with ſtreams, or imbu'd
with divers qualities, as to be much fitter than common Air for
ſome particular Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>We ſhall then for the affinities ſake between this Tryal and the
former, ſubjoyn now the way, by which we ſeldom fail'd of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Bladders in our emptied Receivers. For this purpoſe, the
blown Bladder that was to be burſt, having the neck very cloſely
and ſtrongly tyed, was kept a pretty while in the Receiver, whilſt
the Air was pumping out, and then taken out again, that, now
the fibres were ſtretcht and relax'd, the Capacity being leſſen'd
by a new ligature that I order'd to be ſtrongly made near the
Neck, the Bladder might be leſſen'd though the Air were but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102306:26"/>
the ſame, and the Membrance being not ſo capable of yielding as
before, upon the ſecond exhauſtion of the Receiver the Bladder
in it would break, far more eaſily then otherwiſe, and perhaps be
oddly enough lacerated.</p>
               <p>We ſometimes alſo varied this way of diſpoſing Bladders to
be burſt, by omitting the preparatory putting in of the Bladder
into the Receiver, and onely taking it in a little near the Neck,
that, the Bladder having not been blown very full at firſt, the
tenſion of the included Air might be greater. But this laſt way
is to be made uſe of, when the thing we deſire is, that the Bladder
by breaking at a certain time may part with its Air, and not when
tis onely to give an inſtance of the force of the Spring of <hi>uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ'd</hi>
Air againſt the ſides of the Veſſel that contain it.</p>

Bladders tis included in, is conſiderable, if I here adde, that a ſmall
quantity of Air, which will not fill ¼ of a Bladder, will not onely
ſerve to blow it quite up, but will manifeſtly ſwell it, though that
Effect be oppoſ'd not onely by the reſiſtance of the Bladder it
ſelf, but by a conſiderable weight tied to the bottom of it, as in
the following Experiment.</p>

preſs'd out the Air, till there remain'd but about a fourth or

String, that it would not be made to ſlip off by a not inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

weight we hung at it. Then faſtning the Neck of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the turning Key, we convey'd the Bladder and the Weight
hanging at it into a large Receiver, in which when it began to be
pretty well exhauſted, the Air within the Bladder being freed from
the wonted Preſſure of the Air without it, did by its own Spring
manifeſtly ſwell, and thereby notably ſhorten the Bladder that
contain'd it, and by conſequence viſibly lifted up the Weight,
(that reſiſted that change of figure,) which exceeded 15 pound
of 16. ounces to the Pound.</p>
               <p>After that we took a larger Bladder, and having let out ſo
much Air, that it was left lank enough, we faſten'd the two ends
of it to the upper part of the Receiver, (for which elſe it would
have been too long,) and tyed a Weight (but not the ſame) ſo
as that it hung down from the middle of the Bladder; then exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
the Receiver as before, though the Bladder, and this new
Weight which ſtretcht it, reach'd ſo low, as that for a while we
could ſcarce ſee whether it hung in the Air or no, yet at length we
perceiv'd the Bladder to ſwell, and concluded that it had lifted up
its Clog about an Inch; which was confirm'd by the return we
permitted of the Air into the Receiver, upon which the Bladder
became more wrinkled than before, and the Weight deſcended,
which being taken off, and weighed in a <hi>Statera,</hi> amounted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovt
28 Pounds. We would have reiterated the Experiment,
but ſo heavy a Weight having broken the Bladder, we were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged

bare Spring of their own Air.</head>
               <p>I Shall premiſe to the following Tryals an Experiment, wherein
Uncompreſs'd Air is made by its own bare Spring to break the
ſolid body it ſelf tis ſhut up in. And this I the rather ſet down
before the ſubſequent Tryals,<note place="margin">Exp. 8. pag. 36.</note> becauſe in our already publiſh'd
<hi>Phyſico-Mechanical Experiments</hi> mention has been made of this
Tryal, as of one that we could not then make to ſucceed; we have
ſince, imploying ſmaller Receivers, made it often enough proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
ſomewhat to the wonder of eminent <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> who confeſs'd
to me they had made frequent and divers attempts to perform
the ſame thing, without ever ſucceeding in any of them.</p>
               <p>But it will not be requiſite to multiply relations about this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and therefore I ſhall ſet down but this one, which I meet
with among my looſe Notes.</p>
               <p>A large Glaſs Bubble Hermetically ſeal'd being put into the
Receiver, and the Air drawn out as much as in uſual Operations,
and ſomewhat more, though I told the Company before hand
that I had ſeveral times obſerv'd, that ſuch Bubbles would not
break immediately, but ſomewhile after the withdrawing the Air
from about them, yet this continued ſo long entire after we had
left off Pumping, that preſuming it had been blown too ſtrong,
I began to diſpair of the Experiments ſucceeding; when, whilſt we
were providing ſomething elſe to put into the Receiver, and as I
gueſs'd 4. minuts after the Pump had been let alone, the Bubble
ſurpriz'd us with its being broken with ſuch violence by the
Spring of the included Air, that the fragments of it were daſh'd
every way againſt the ſides of the Receiver, and broken ſo very
ſmall, that when we came to take it up, the Powder was by the
By-ſtanders compar'd to the ſmall Sand wont to be imploy'd to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102306:27"/>
dry Papers, that have been newly writ upon with Inck. The
Reaſon why the Bubble broke ſo ſlowly I cannot now ſtay to
propoſe, no more then to examine whether the difficulty of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
veſſels of Glaſs, no thicker then theſe Bubbles, proceed from
ſome weakning of the Spring of impriſoned Air, by its ſtretching
a little the including Glaſs, (for in another caſe we have obſerv'd
this Glaſs to be ſtretchable by the preſſure of Air;) or from
hence, that 'twas very hard, as I have elſewhere mention'd, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
rarifying the Air a little, and conſequently weakning its
Spring, by the heat that was neceſſary to be imploy'd about the
ſealing up the Bubble.</p>

               <p>IN proſecution of the Enquiry propos'd in the Title, we made

                  <head>The I. TRYAL.</head>
                  <p>1. WE took the Braſs-hoop, mention'd in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(whoſe Diameter is ſomewhat above 3. Inches,)
and having cauſ'd a Glazier to cut ſome Plates of Glaſs, ſuch as
are uſed for making the Quarrels of Windows, till he had brought
them to a Size, &amp; a roundneſs fit to ſerve for Covers to that braſs-hoop,
we carefully faſten'd one of them with Cement to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Orifice of the Hoop or Ring, and then cementing the lower
Orifice to the Engine, ſo that the Veſſel, compos'd of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and Glaſs, ſerv'd for a ſmall Receiver; we whelm'd over it a
large and ſtrong Receiver, which we alſo faſten'd on to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
with Cement after the uſual manner. By which Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
it was neceſſary, that when the Pump was ſet on work, the
included Receiver (of Braſs and Glaſs) ſhould have its Air with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
and yet the Air in the larger Receiver ſhould not be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102306:28"/>
pump'd out but by breaking through the Glaſs, ſo that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Air of the Metalline Receiver (as we may call it for diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſake) being pump'd out, the Glaſs Plate, that made part of
that Receiver, muſt lye expos'd to the preſſure of the Ambient
Air ſhut up in the other Receiver, without having the former aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of the now withdrawn Air to reſiſt the Preſſure; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as we expected, at the firſt or ſecond Exuction of the Air,
included in the ſmall metalline Receiver, the Glaſs-plate was, by
the Preſſure of the incumbent Air, contain'd in the great Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
broken into an 100 pieces, which were beaten inwards into
the Cavity of the Hoop.</p>

                  <head>The II. Tryal.</head>
                  <p>2. This done, to ſhew that there needed not the Spring of ſo
great a quantity of included Air to break ſuch Glaſſes, we took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Roundiſh one, which, though wide enough at the Orifice to
cover the Braſs Ring &amp; the new Glaſs-plate that we had cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on it, was yet ſo low, that we eſtimated it to hold but a 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
part of what the large Receiver, formerly imploy'd, is able to
contain; and having whelm'd this ſmaller veſſel, which was ſhap'd
like thoſe Cups they call Tumblers, over the Metalline Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and well faſten'd it to the Engine with Cement, we found
that though this External Receiver had a great part of its Cavity
fill'd by the included one, yet when this Internal one was exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
by an Exuction or two, the Spring of the little Air that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd,
was able to break the Plate into a multitude of frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="trial">
                  <head>The III. Tryal.</head>
                  <p>3. Becauſe the Glaſs-Plates hitherto mention'd ſeem'd not ſo
thick, but that the Preſſure of the included Air might be able to
give conſiderabler Inſtances of its Force; in ſtead of the Metalline
Receivers hitherto employed, we took a ſquare Bottle of Glaſs,
which we judg'd to be able to contain about a Pint (or Pound) of
Water, and which had been provided to keep ſubtle Chymical
Liquors in, for which uſe we are not wont to chooſe weak ones.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102306:28"/>
This we inverted, and apply'd to the Engine as a Receiver, over
which we whelm'd the large Receiver formerly mention'd; and
having cemented it on, as in the foregoing Experiments, we ſet
the Pump on work to empty the internal Receiver, (or ſquare
Bottle,) by which means the withdrawing of the Air, and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the veſſel (which was inconvenient for reſiſting) ſuffer'd
the Preſſure of the Air included in the external Receiver to cruſh
the viol into a great number of pieces.</p>
                  <p>And to vary this Experiment, as we did that of breaking the
metalline Receivers, we took another Glaſs of the ſhape and about
the bigneſs of the former, and having apply'd it to the Engine as
before, and cover'd it with a Receiver that was little higher than
it ſelf, we found, that upon the exhauſtion of the Air the ſecond
ſquare Glaſs was likewiſe broken into many fragments, ſome of
which were of ſo great a thickneſs, as mov'd ſome wonder,
that the bare Preſſure of the Air was able to break ſuch a veſſel,
though probably the Cracks, that reacht to them, were begun in
much weaker parts of the Glaſs.</p>
                  <p>NB. 1. The bottoms and the necks of both theſe ſquare
Bottles were entire enough; by which it ſeem'd probable, that
the veſſels had been broken by the Preſſure of the Air againſt
the Sides, which were not onely thinner than the parts above
named, but expos'd a larger Superficies to the <hi>lateral</hi> Preſſure of
the Air, than to the <hi>perpendicular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. We obſerv'd in one of the two laſt Experiments, that the
Veſſel did not break preſently upon the laſt Exuction that was
made of the included Air, but a conſiderable time after, which it
ſeems was requiſite to allow the compreſt parts of the Glaſs time
to change their places; and this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> I therefore mention,
becauſe the ſame thing that here happen'd in the breaking a Glaſs
inwards by the Spring of the Air, I elſewhere obſerv'd to have
happen'd in breaking a Glaſs outwards by the ſame Spring.</p>
                  <p>3. To confirm, that it is the Spring of the External Receivers
Air that is the Agent in thoſe Fractures of Glaſſes, and to prevent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102306:29"/>
or remove ſome ſcruples, we thought fit to make this variation
in the Experiment. We applyed a Plate of Glaſs, juſt like thoſe
formerly mentioned, to the Braſs-hoop; but in the cementing of
it on, we plac'd in the thickneſs of the Cement a ſmall Pipe of
Glaſs of about an Inch long, whoſe Cavity was not ſo big as that
of a Straw, and which being left open at both the ends might ſerve
for a little Channel, through which the Air might paſs from the
External Receiver to the Internal; over <hi>This</hi> we whelm'd one of
the ſmall Receivers above mentioned, &amp; then, though we ſet the
Pump on work much longer then would have needed if this litle
Pipe had not been made uſe of, we found, as we expected, that the
Internal Receiver continued entire, becauſe the Air, whoſe Spring
ſhould have broken it, having liberty to paſs through the Pipe,
and conſequently to expand it ſelf into the place deſerted by the
Air pump'd out, did by that Expanſion weaken its Spring too
much, to retain ſtrength enough to break the Metalline (or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal)
Receiver.</p>
                  <p>But here tis to be noted, that either the Pipe muſt be made
bigger than that lately mentioned, or the Exuction of the Air
muſt not be made by the Pump as nimbly as we can, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Plate of Glaſs may be broken notwithſtanding the
Pipe; becauſe the Air contain'd in the External Receiver, having
a force much greater than is neceſſary to break ſuch a Plate, it may
well happen (as I have ſometimes found it do) that if the Air be
haſtily drawn out of the Internal Receiver, that Air, which ſhould
ſucceed in its room, cannot get faſt enough out of that external
Receiver through ſo ſmall a Pipe, and the Air remaining in that
external Receiver will yet retain a Spring ſtrong enough to break
the Glaſs. To illuſtrate which, I ſhall propoſe this Experiment,
That ſometimes, when I have at the flame of a Lamp caus'd Glaſs
Bubbles to be blown with exceeding ſlender Stems, if they were
nimbly remov'd out of the flame whilſt they were ignited, they
would according to my conjecture be either broken, if they cool'd
too faſt; or compreſs'd inward, if they long enough retain'd the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102306:29"/>
Softneſs they had given them by Fuſion. For the Air in the
Bubble being exceedingly rarified and expanded, whilſt the Glaſs
is kept in the flame, and coming to cool haſtily when remov'd
from thence, looſes upon refrigeration the Spring the heat had
given it, and ſo, if the External Air cannot preſs in faſt enough
through the too ſlender Pipe, there will not get in Air enough to
reſiſt the Preſſure of the Atmoſphere, and therefore if this Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
find the Bubble yet ſoft, it will preſs it a little inwards, and
either flatten it, or make a dimple in it, though the Orifice of the
Pipe be left open.</p>

the Spring of the Air; though I deny not, that other Cauſes
may contribute to that Preſſure of the Air, which I take to be the
grand and immediate Agent in theſe <hi>Phaenomena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We took a Braſs-Pipe bended like a Siphon, and fitted at the
bigger end with a Stop-cock &amp;c,<note place="margin">See Plate the Fig. the and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations at the cloſe of this Experiment.</note> as is delineated in the
Figure, (which Inſtrument for brevities ſake I often call an
Exhauſting (or Sucking) Siphon,) and to the ſlender end
of this we faſtned with good Cement the upper end of a
Cylindrical Pipe of Glaſs, of about fifty inches long, and open at
both ends, and having the lower end open into a Glaſs of ſtagnant
Quick-ſilver, whoſe upper Superficies reacht a pretty deal high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the immerſt Orifice of the Glaſs Cane. Theſe things
being thus prepared, we cauſ'd the Pump to be ſet on work,
whereby the Air being by degrees drawn out of the Exhauſting
Siphon, and conſequently of the Glaſs-Cane that open'd into it;
the ſtagnant Mercury was proportionably impell'd up into the
Glaſs-pipe, till it had attain'd to its due height, which exceeded
not 30. inches. And then, though there remain'd in the upper
part of the Pipe above 20 inches unfill'd with Quick-ſilver, yet
we could not by further pumping raiſe that fluid Metal any
higher.</p>
               <p>By which it ſeems manifeſt enough, that whatever many Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men have taught, or others do yet believe about the unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
power that Nature would exerciſe, to prevent what they call
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102306:30"/>
a <hi>Vacuum;</hi> yet this power has its bounds, and thoſe depend not
ſo much upon the Exigency of that Principle, which the School-men
call a <hi>fuga vacui,</hi> as upon the ſpecifick Gravity of the Liquor
to be rais'd by Suction. For confirmation of which, we ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
in ſtead of the ſtagnant Mercury a baſon of Water, and
though inſtead of the <hi>many</hi> Sucks we had fruitleſly imploy'd to
raiſe the Quick-ſilver above the lately mentioned height, we
now imploy'd but <hi>one</hi> Exſuction, (or leſs then a full one,) which
did but in part empty the Exhauſting Siphon: yet the Water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the opening of the Stop-cock was not onely impell'd to the
very top of the Glaſs-Cane, but likewiſe continued running for
a good while through the Exhauſting Siphon, and thence fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the plate of the Engine; ſo that it ſeem'd an odd ſpectacle to
thoſe that knew not the reaſon of it, to ſee the Water running
very briskly of its own accord as they imagined out of the ſhorter
leg of a Siphon; eſpecially that leg being perhaps not above a
a quarter ſo long as the other. And here I muſt not omit this
conſiderable circumſtance, that though ſometimes in the <hi>Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Experiment I have obſerv'd the Mercury to ſtand at thirty
inches, and now and then above it, yet the height of the Mercury
elevated in our Glaſs-Cane appear'd not, when meaſured, to reach
fully 29. inches and a quarter, which I thought it was not difficult
to render a reaſon of, from the varying weight of the Atmoſphere;
and accordingly conſulting the Baroſcope, (that ſtood in another
room,) I found the Atmoſphere to be at that time ſomewhat
light, the Quick-ſilver in it being in height but 29. inches and an
eighth, which probably would have been the very height of the
Quick-ſilver raiſ'd by the Engine, if it had had time by ſtanding
to free it ſelf from Bubbles.</p>
               <p>From whence we may conclude, that Suction will elevate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
in Pumps no higher then the weight of the Atmoſphere is
able to raiſe them, ſince the cloſeneſs requiſite in the Pump of
our Engine to be ſtanch makes it very unlikely, that by any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Pump a more accurate Suction can be effected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:102306:31"/>
I have nothing to adde about the related Experiment but this
one; that it may afford us a notable confirmation of the argument
we formerly propos'd againſt them, that aſcrib'd the elevation
and ſuſtentation of the Quick-ſilver in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to a certain rarified Air, which the more highly it is rarified,
the greater power it acquires to attract Quick-ſilver, and other
contiguous Bodies; for in our Experiment though by continuing
to pump we can rarifie or diſtend more and more the Air in the
Exhauſting Siphon, yet we were not able to raiſe the Mercury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
30 inches, (which exceeds not the height to which the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere
is able to elevate it,) and this, though, the ſtagnant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
being expoſed to the free Air, it cannot be pretended (as in
ſome other caſes it may, though not ſatisfactorily, be done) that
the Mercury cannot be raiſed higher, without offering violence to
the body incumbent on the ſtagnant Mercury: for in the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we are conſidering if Nature ſhould raiſe the Quick-ſilver
higher and higher in the Pipe, to ſucceed in the room of the Air
that is withdrawn; the formerly Stagnant Mercury, that would
on this occaſion be rais'd, might be immediately ſucceeded by the
free and undilated Air, ſo that Nature would be put to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to the Quick-ſilver onely, which if ſhe were ſcrupulous to
do, what ayl'd her to raiſe it (as ſhe did in our Tryal) againſt the
inclinations of ſo ponderous a body, to above 29. Inches high?</p>

                  <p>Though the Exhauſting Siphon, mentioned at the beginning
of this Experiment, may be eaſily enough conceiv'd by an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
inſpection of the Figure, yet becauſe I frequently make uſe
of it in Pneumatical Experiments, twill not be amiſs to intimate
here once for all theſe three particulars about it. 1. That
though the bending Pipe its ſelf may be for ſome uſes more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
made of Glaſs than of Metal, becauſe the Tranſparency
of the former may inable us to diſcover what paſſes in it; yet for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102306:31"/>
the moſt part we chooſe to imploy Pipes of the latter ſort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the others are ſo very ſubject to break. 2. That tis conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to make the longer leg of the Siphon a little larger at the
bottom than the reſt of the Pipe uſually needs to be, that it may
the more commodiouſly admit the ſhank of a Stop-cock, which
is to be very carefully inſerted with Cement; by ſeaſonably turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and returning of which Stop-cock, the paſſage (for the Air)
between the Engine and the Veſſel to be exhauſted is to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſhut. 3. That though we ſometimes content our ſelves
to apply immediately the braſs Siphon its ſelf to the Engine, by
faſtning with Cement the external ſhank of the Stop-cock to the
Orifice of the little Pipe, through which the Excuction of the Air
is made; yet the bended Pipe alone, if it be not almoſt conſtantly
held, is ſo apt to be looſen'd by the motion of the Engine, and the
turning of the Stopcock, (which frequently occaſions Leaks, and
diſturbs the Operation,) that for the moſt part we make uſe of a
Siphon conſiſting of a braſs Pipe,<note place="margin">See plate the Figure the</note> and Stop-cock, and a Glaſs of
6, 8, or 10 Inches in height, and of ſome ſuch ſhape (for it need not
be the very ſame) as that repreſented in the Figure: for by this
means, though the Exhauſtion is becauſe of this additional Glaſs,
ſomewhat longer in making, yet it is more ſecurely and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptedly
carried on by reaſon of the ſtability, which the breadth
of the lower Orifice of the Glaſs gives to the whole Inſtrument.
Beſides which, we have theſe other conveniences, that not onely
the Siphon is hereby much lengthned, which in divers Tryals is
very fit; but alſo that we may commodiouſly place in the Glaſſie
part of this compounded Syphon a Gage, whereby to diſcern from
time to time how much the Air is drawn out of the Veſſel to be
exhauſted.</p>

               <p>IF, when I was making the foregoing Experiment, I had been
able to procure a Pipe long enough, I had tried to what height
I could raiſe Water by Suction, though I would have done it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſatisfie Others then my ſelf, who ſcarce doubted, but that
as Water is (bulk for bulk) about 14 times lighter than Quick-ſilver:
ſo it would have been rais'd by Suction to about four or
five and thirty foot, (which is 14 times as high as we were able to
elevate the Quick-ſilver,) and no higher. But being not furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
for the Tryal I would have made, I thought fit to ſubſtitute
another, which would carry the former Experiment ſomewhat
further. For whereas, in That, we ſhew'd how high the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere

declares. In which contrivance I aim'd at theſe two convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
one that I might exhauſt two Glaſs-Canes at the ſame time;
and the other, to prevent its being ſurmis'd that the Engine was
not equally applied to both the Glaſses to be exhauſted. This
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102306:32"/>
additional Braſs-pipe being carefully cemented into the Sucking
Syphon, we did to each of its two branches take care to have well
faſtned with the ſame Cement a Cylindrical Glaſs of about 42
Inches in length, (that being ſomewhat near the height of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting
Syphon above the floor,) the lower Orifice of one of
theſe two Glaſses being immerſt in a veſſel of ſtagnant Mercury,
and that of the other in a veſſel of Water, where care was taken by
thoſe I imploy'd, that as the Tubes were choſen near of a bigneſs,
(which yet was not neceſſary,) ſo the ſurfaces of the two different
Liquors ſhould be near of a height. This being done, we began
to pump warily and ſlowly, till the Water in one of the Pipes
was elevated to about 42 inches, and then meaſuring the height of
the Quick-ſilver, in the other Pipe above the ſurface of the Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Quick-ſilver, we found it to be almoſt 3 Inches; ſo that the
Water was about 14 times as high as the Quick-ſilver. And to
proſecute the Experiment a little further, we very warily let in a
little Air to the Exhauſting Syphon, and had the pleaſure to ſee
the two Liquors proportionably deſcend, till turning the Stop-cock
when the Water was about 14 inches high, we thereby kept
them from ſinking any lower, till we had meaſured the height of
the Quick-ſilver, which we found to be about one inch.</p>
               <p>We tried alſo the proportion of theſe two Liquors at other
heights, but could not eaſily meaſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo well as we did at thoſe
newly mentioned; and therefore though there ſeem'd to be ſome
ſlight variation, yet we lookt upon it but as what might be well
imputed to the difficulty of making ſuch Experiments exactly;
and this diſpleas'd me not in theſe Tryals, that whereas it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
and ſomewhat wondred at, that the Quick-ſilver for the
moſt part ſeem'd to be ſomewhat (though but a very little) high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then the proportion of 1 to 14 required, I had long before by
particular Tryals found, that though 14 and 1 be the neareſt of
ſmall <hi>integer</hi> numbers that expreſs the proportion between the
Specifick Gravities of Quickſilver and Water, yet the former of
thoſe Fluids (or at leaſt that which I made my Tryals with) is not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102306:33"/>
quite ſo heavy as this proportion ſuppoſes, though I ſhall not
here ſtay to determine preciſely the difference, having done it in
another Tract, where the method I imployed in the inveſtigation
of it is alſo ſet down.</p>
               <p>The above mentioned Experiment, made by the help of our
Engine, as to Quick-ſilver and Water being confirmable by Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
(to be by and-by mentioned) made in other Liquors, affords
our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> two conſiderable advantages above the vulgar do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Schools, (for I do not apply what follows to all
the <hi>Pleniſts,</hi>) who aſcribe the aſcenſion of Liquors by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to a Traction made <hi>ob fugam vacui,</hi> as they are wont to
ſpeak.</p>
               <p>For firſt it is manifeſtly agreeable to our Doctrine, that, ſince
the Air, according to It, is a Fluid that is not void of Weight, it
ſhould raiſe thoſe Liquors that are lighter, as Water, higher then
thoſe that are ponderous, as Quick-ſilver; and that anſwerably to
the diſparity of their Weights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſecondly, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why, if the Air be withdrawn by Suction from Quick ſilver
and Water, there ſhould be leſs left a <hi>vacuum</hi> above the one then
above the other, in caſe either of them ſucceed not in the place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
by the Air, and conſequently when the Air is withdrawn
out of both the forementioned Glaſs-pipes, if there would be no
<hi>vacuum</hi> in caſe no liquor ſhould ſucceed it, why does Nature
needleſly to prevent a <hi>vacuum</hi> make the Water that is an heavy
body aſcend contrary to its own nature, according to which it tends
towards the Center of the Earth? And if the ſucceeding of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
be neceſſary to prevent a <hi>vacuum,</hi> how chance that Nature
does not elevate the Quick-ſilver as well as the Water, eſpecially
ſince tis manifeſt by the foregoing Experiment that ſhe is able to
raiſe that ponderous Liquor above 26 inches higher than ſhe did
in the Experiment we are now diſcourſing of.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it would not be amiſs to take notice, on this occaſion,
that among other applications of this Experiment it may be made
ſomewhat uſeful to eſtimate the differing Gravities of liquors, to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102306:33"/>
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> purpoſe I caus'd to be put under the bottom of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Glaſs pipes two veſſels, the one with freſh water, &amp; the other
with the like water impregnated with a good proportion of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalt
that I had caus'd to be diſſolv'd in it, for want of Sea-water,
which I would rather have imploy'd. And I found, that when the
freſh water was rais'd to about 42 inches, the Saline ſolution had
not fully reacht to 40.</p>
               <p>But though this difference were double to that which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
and Gravity betwixt <hi>our</hi> Sea-water and freſh water would
have required, yet to make the diſparity more evident, and alſo
becauſe I would be able the better to gueſs at the proportion of
the diſſolv'd Salt by making it as great as I could, I caus'd an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
Brine to be made, by ſuffering Sea-ſalt to deliquate in the
moiſt Air. And having applyed this Liquor and freſh water to
the two already mentioned Pipes, and proceeded after the former
manner, we found that when the pure water was elevated to near
42 Inches, the liquor of Sea-ſalt wanted about 7. Inches and a
quarter of that height; and when the water was made to ſubſide
to the middle of its Pipe, or thereabouts, the Saline liquor in the
other Pipe was between 3 and 4 inches lower then it.</p>
               <p>I would have tryed the difference between theſe Liquors and
Oyl, but the Coldneſs of the Weather was unfavourable to ſuch
a Tryal: but to ſhew a far greater Diſparity then That would have
done betwixt the height of Liquors of unequal Gravities, I took
fair Water, and a liquor made of the Salt of Pot-aſhes ſuffered to
run in a Sellar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> (this being one of the ponderouſeſt
Liquors I have prepar'd,) and having proceeded as in the former
Tryals, I found that when the common Water was about 42
inches high, the newly mention'd Solution wanted ſomewhat of
30 inches; and when the Water was made to ſubſide to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of its Pipe, or thereabouts, the deliquated Liquor was between
6 and 7 inches lower then it.</p>
               <p>I had ſome thoughts, when I applied my ſelf to make theſe
Tryals, to examine how well we could by this new way compare
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102306:34"/>
the Saltneſs of the waters of ſeveral Seas, and thoſe alſo of Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprings;
and likewiſe whether, and (if any thing near) how far we
might by this Method determine the proportion of the more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Liquors that may be mingled in compounded ones, as in the
mixture of Water and Wine, Vinegar and Water, &amp;c. but being
not provided with Inſtruments fit for ſuch nice Tryals, and a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
having impair'd the Glaſſes lately mentioned before the
laſt Tryals were quite ended, and having ſoon after broken one
of them, I laid aſide thoſe Thoughts.</p>

               <p>We took a ſtrong Glaſs-bottle, capable to hold above a Pint

(becauſe this Liquor was to be impell'd up many times high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the other,) and having provided two ſlender Glaſs-pipes,
each open at both ends, we ſo plac'd and faſtned them, by means
of the Cement wherewith we choak'd the upper part of the neck
of the Bottle, that the ſhorter of the Pipes had its lower Orifice
immerſt beneath the ſurface of the Quick-ſilver, and the longer
Pipe reacht not quite ſo low as that Surface, and ſo was immerſt
but in the Water, by which contrivance we avoided the neceſſity
of having two diſtinct veſſels for our two ſtagnant Liquors, which
would have been inconvenient in regard of the ſlenderneſs of the
upper part of our Receiver. This done, we conveyed the Bottle
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102306:34"/>
into a fitly ſhap'd Receiver, (formerly deſcrib'd at the firſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,)
and having begun to pump out the Air, we took notice
to what heights the Quick-ſilver and Water were impell'd up in
their reſpective Tubes, on which we had before made marks from
inch to inch with hard Wax, (that they might not be remov'd by
wet or rubbing,) and we obſerv'd, that when the Quickſilver
was impell'd up to two inches, the Water was rais'd to about

of wax was conſiderable, when the Quick-ſilver was but about an

in regard that the Quick-ſilver never aſcending ſo high

               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:102306:35"/>
We caus'd then to be convey'd into a fitly ſhap'd Receiver two
Pipes of Glaſs very uneven in length, but each of them ſeal'd at
one end, the ſhorter Tube was fill'd with Mercury, and inverted
into a ſmall Glaſs Jarr, wherein a ſufficient quantity of that Liquor
had been before lodg'd: the longer Pipe was fill'd with common
Water, and inverted into a larger Glaſs, wherein likewiſe a fit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the ſame Liquor had been put.</p>
               <p>Then the Receiver being cloſely cemented on to the Engine,
the Air was pump'd out for a pretty while before the Mercury
began to ſubſide; but when it was ſo far withdrawn, that its Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
was no longer able to keep up a Mercurial Cylinder of that
height, that liquid Metal began to ſink; the Water in the other
Tube, though this were three times as long, ſtill retaining its full
height. But when the Quick-ſilver was fallen ſo low, as to be
but between three &amp; four inches above the ſurface of the Stagnant
Quick-ſilver, the Water alſo began to ſubſide, but ſooner then
according to the laws of meer Staticks it ought to have done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
many Aerial Particles emerging from the body of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the upper part of the Glaſs, did by their Spring concurr
with the Gravity of the water to depreſs this Liquor. And ſo
when the Quick-ſilver was three inches above the ſtagnant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
the water in the other Pipe was fallen divers inches beneath
42, and ſeveral inches beneath 28 when the Mercury had ſubſided
an inch lower. But this being no more then was to be expected,
after we had cauſ'd the Pumping to be a while continued, to free
the water the better from the latitant Air, we let in the external
Air, and having thereby impell'd up again both the Liquors into
their Pipes, and remov'd the Receiver we took out thoſe Pipes,
and inverting each of them again to let out the Air, (for even
that wich held the Quick-ſilver had got a ſmall Bubble, though
inconſiderable in compariſon of the Air that had got up out of the
Water,) we fill'd each of them with a little of the reſtagnant
Liquor belonging to it, and inverting each Tube once more into
its proper liquor, we repeated the Experiment, and found it, as it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102306:35"/>
ſeem'd, to require more pumping then before to make the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
begin to ſubſide; ſo that when the Mercury was fallen to
three inches, or two, or one, the water ſubſided ſo near to the
heights of 42, 28, or 14 inches, that we ſaw no ſufficient cauſe to
hinder us from ſuppoſing, that the litle differences that appear'd
between the ſeveral heights of the Quick-ſilver, and fourteen
times as great heights of the Water (which fell ſomewhat lower
than its proportion in Gravity required) proceeded from ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erial
Corpuſcles yet remaining, in ſpite of all we had done, in the
water, and by their Spring, though but faint, when once they had
emerg'd to the upper part of the Glaſs, furthering a little the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

having met with an opportunity to borrow a place ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
convenient to make a Tryal to what height Water may be

I know what is ſaid to have been the Complaint of ſome
Pump-makers. But I confeſs the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> 'twas grounded
on, ſeem'd not to me to be certainly enough deliver'd by a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or two, that mention what they complain'd of; and their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
ſeems not to have been made determinately or carefully
enough for a matter of this moment. Since that which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of ſeems to have been in general, that they could not by
pumping raiſe Water to what height they pleaſe, as the common
Opinion of Philoſophers about Natures <hi>fuga vacui</hi> made them
expect they might. And it may well have happen'd, that as
they endeavoured onely to raiſe it to the height their occaſions
required, ſo all that their Diſappointment manifeſted, was, that
they could not raiſe it to that particular height: which did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
whether if the Pump had been a Foot or a Yard ſhorter,
the Water would then have been elevated to the upper part of it
or no: but that which I chiefly conſider is, that theſe being but
Tradeſmen, that did not work according to the Dictates of, or
with deſign to ſatisfie, a Philoſophical Curioſity, we may juſtly
ſuſpect, that their Pumps were not ſufficiently ſtanch, nor the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
Critically enough perform'd and taken notice of.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, <hi>partly</hi> becauſe a Tryal of ſuch moment ſeem'd not
to have yet been duely made by any; and <hi>partly</hi> becauſe the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
weight of the Atmoſphere was not (that appears) known,
nor (conſequently) taken into conſideration by the ingenious
Monſieur <hi>Paſchal</hi> in his famous Experiment, which yet is but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogous
to this; and <hi>partly</hi> becauſe ſome very Late as well as
Learned Writers have not acquieſc'd in his Experiment, but do
adhere to the old Doctrine of the Schools, which would have
Water raiſeable in Pumps to any height, <hi>ob fugam vacut,</hi> (as they
ſpeak,) I thought fit to make the beſt ſhift I could to make the
Tryal, of which I now proceed to give Your Lordſhip an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>The place I borrowed for this purpoſe was a flat Roof about
30 foot high from the ground, and with Railes along the edges
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102306:36"/>
of it. The Tube we made uſe of ſhould have been of Glaſs, if
we could have procured one long and ſtrong enough. But that
being exceeding difficult, eſpecially for me, who was not near a
Glaſs-houſe, we were fain to cauſe a Tin-man to make ſeveral
Pipes of above an inch bore, (for of a great length 'twas alleadg'd
they could not be made ſlenderer,) and as long as he could, of
Tin or Laton, as they call thin Plates of Iron Tinn'd over; and
theſe being very carefully ſoder'd together made up one Pipe, of
about one or two and thirty foot long, which being tied to a Pole
we tried with Water whether it were ſtanch, and by the effluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that Liquor finding where the Leaks were, we caus'd them
to be ſtopt with Soder, and then for greater ſecurity the whole
Pipe, eſpecially at the Commiſſures, was diligently caſ'd over
with our cloſe black Cement, upon which Plaiſter of Paris was
ſtrewed to keep it from ſticking to their hands or cloaths that
ſhould manage the Pipe. At the upper part of which was very
carefully faſtned with the like Cement a ſtrong Pipe of Glaſs,
of between 2 and 3 foot in length, that we might ſee what ſhould
happen at the top of the water. And to the upper part of this
Pipe was (with Cement, and by the means of a ſhort elbow of
Tin) very cloſely faſtned another Pipe of the ſame Metal, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
of two pieces, making a right Angle with one another,
whereof the upper part was parallel to the Horizon, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which was parallel to the Glaſs-pipe, reacht down to the
Engine, which was plac'd on the flat Roof, and was to be with
good Cement ſollicitouſly faſtned to the lower end of this deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
part of the Pipe, whoſe Horizontal leg was ſupported by
a piece of Wood, nail'd to the above mentioned Rails; as the
Tube alſo was kept from overmuch ſhaking by a board, (faſten'd
to the ſame Rails,) and having a deep Notch cut in it, for the
Tube to be inſerted into.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Apparatus</hi> being made,<note place="margin">See plate the Figure the</note> and the whole Tube with its Pole
erected along the Wall, and faſtned with ſtrings and other
helps, and the deſcending Pipe being carefully cemented on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102306:37"/>
to the Engine, there was plac'd under the bottom of the long
Tube a convenient veſſel, whereinto ſo much Water was poured,
as reach'd a great way above the orifice of the Pipe, and one was
appointed to ſtand by to pour in more as need ſhould require, that
the veſſel might be ſtill kept competently full.</p>
               <p>After all this the Pump was ſet on work, but when the water
had been raiſed to a great height, and conſequently had a great
Preſſure againſt the ſides of the Tube, a ſmall Leak or two was
either diſcovered or made, which without moving the Tube we
caus'd to be well ſtopt, by one that was ſent up a Ladder to apply
ſtore of Cement where it was requiſite.</p>
               <p>Wherefore at length we were able after a pretty number of
Exuctions, to raiſe the Water to the middle of the Glaſs-pipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
mentioned, but not without great ſtore of bubbles, (made
by the Air formerly conceal'd in the pores of the water, and now
emerging,) which for a pretty while kept a kind of Foam upon
the ſurface of it, (freſh ones continually ſucceeding thoſe that
broke.) And finding the Engine and Tube as ſtanch as could be
well expected, I thought it a fit ſeaſon to trie what was the utmoſt
height to which Water could by Suction be elevated; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though the Pump ſeem'd to have been plyed enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet for further ſatisfaction, when the Water was within few
inches of the top of the Glaſs, I caus'd 20 Exuctions more to be
nimbly made, to be ſure that the water ſhould be raiſed as high
as by our Pump it could be poſſibly. And having taken notice
where the Surface reſted, and caus'd a piece of Cement to be ſtuck
near it, (for we could not then come to reach it exactly,) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
to the Ground where the ſtagnant water ſtood, we
caus'd a ſtring to be let down, with a weight hanging at the end
of it, which we applied to a mark, that had been purpoſely made
at that part of the (Metalline) Tube, which the ſuperficies of the
ſtagnant water had reſted at, when the water was elevated to its
full height: and the other end of the ſtring being, by him that let
it down, applied to that part of the Glaſs, as near as he could gueſs,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102306:37"/>
where the upper part of the Water reacht, the Weight was pull'd
up; and the length of the ſtring, and (conſequently) the height
of the Cylinder of Water was meaſur'd, which amounted to 33
foot, and about 6 inches. Which done, I return'd to my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which was not far off, to look upon the Baroſcope, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the preſent weight of the Atmoſphere, which I found
to be but moderate, the Quick-ſilver ſtanding at 29 inches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
2 and 3 eights of an inch. This being taken notice of, it
was not difficult to compare the ſucceſs of the Experiment with
our <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> For if we ſuppoſe the moſt received proportion
in bulk between Cylinders of Quick-ſilver and of Water of the
ſame weight, namely that of 1 to 14, the height of the water
ought to have been 34 foot and about two inches, which is about
8 inches greater than we found it. But then Your Lordſhip may
be pleaſed to remember, that I formerly noted (before ever I
made this Experiment) that I did not allow the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Mercury and Water (at leaſt ſuch water as I made my
Tryals with) to be altogether ſo great, and though in ordinary
Experiments we may with very litle inconvenience make uſe of
that proportion to avoid fractions, yet in ſo tall a Cylinder of
Water as ours was, the difference is too conſiderable to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
If therefore in ſtead of making an Inch of Quick-ſilver
equivalent to 14 inches of Water, we abate but a quarter of an
inch, which is but a 56 part of the height of the Water, this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement
being repeated 29 times and a quarter, will amount to
7 inches, and above a quarter, which added to the former height
of the Water, namely 33 Foot and 6 inches, will make up 34 foot
and above an inch; ſo that the difference between the height of
the Mercury ſuſtain'd by the weight of the Atmoſphere in the
Baroſcope, and that of the Water rais'd and ſuſtain'd by the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the ſame Atmoſphere in the long Tube did not appear to
differ more than an Inch or two from the proportion they ought
to have had, according to the difference of their ſpecifick Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
And though in our Experiment the difference had been
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102306:38"/>
greater, provided it exceeded not 8 or 10 Inches, it would
not have been ſtrange: <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe of the difficulty of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
all things ſo exactly in ſuch an Experiment, <hi>partly</hi>
becauſe as Waters are not all of the ſame weight, ſo a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
diſparity of it in ſo long a Cylinder may be conſiderable,
and <hi>partly</hi> (and perhaps chiefly) becauſe the Air flying out of the
bubbles, that roſe out of ſo great a quantity of water, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the top of it, and ſo near that of the Tube, might by its
Spring (though but very weak) aſſiſting the weight of ſo much
water, ſomewhat (though not much) hinder the <hi>utmoſt</hi> elevation
of that Liquor. But our Experiment did not make it needful
for me to inſiſt on theſe conſiderations, and the inconſiderable
difference that was betwixt the height of the water we found, and
that which might have been wiſh'd, did rather countenance then
at all difavour the thing to be made out by our Experiment, ſince
by no Pumping we could raiſe the Water <hi>quite</hi> ſo high (though
I confeſs it wanted but very little) as the weight of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere
was able to keep up a Cylinder of Mercury proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to it in height, and equivalent in weight: and yet I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
Your Lordſhip will eaſily grant, that there was at leaſt as
much care uſed in this Experiment, to keep the things imploy'd
about it tight, as has been wont to be uſed by Tradeſmen in their
Pumps, where tis not ſo eaſie either to prevent a little inſinuation
of the Air, or to diſcern it.</p>
               <p>Tis not that I am ſure, that even all our care would have kept
the water for any long time at its full height; but, that the Air
was ſufficiently exhauſted for our purpoſe, when we determin'd
the height of the water, I was induc'd to conclude by theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p>1. As well the conſtruction of the Engine, as the many (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
related) Experiments, that have been ſucceſsfully tryed
with it, ſhew that tis not like it ſhould be inferiour in cloſeneſs to
the great Water-Pumps, made by ordinary Tradeſmen: and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102306:38"/>
the XI. Experiment foregoing, manifeſts, that by this
Pump Quick-ſilver was rais'd to as great a height, as the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere
is able to ſupport in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment.</p>
               <p>2. The ſtanchneſs of the Pipe appear'd by the Diminution (as
to number) of Bubbles, that appear'd at the top of the Water,
and by their ſize too, for when there was a leak, (though but ſo
very ſmall, that the water could not get out at it in the Tube,)
it might uſually be taken notice of by the attentive ear of him
that ſtood to watch upon the Ladder, erected by the ſide of the
Tube; and the Air that got in, did eaſily diſcover it ſelf to the
Eye by large Bubbles, manifeſtly differing from thoſe that came
from the Aerial particles belonging to the water; and if the leak
were not ſo very ſmall, the Air that got in would ſuddenly lift
up the water above it, and perhaps fill with it the deſcending
Pipe.</p>
               <p>3. Though there had been ſome imperceptible Leak, yet that
would not have hindred the ſucceſs of the Experiment for the
main. For in leaks that have been but ſmall, though manifeſt
enough, we have often, by cauſing the Pump to be ply'd leſs nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
then it now was, been able to proſecute our Tryals; becauſe
the Pump carried of ſtill more Air than could get in at a leak that
was no greater.</p>
               <p>4. And that litle or no (intruding) Air was left in the upper
part of our Tube, was evident by thoſe marks, whereby it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
for them that are well acquainted with the Pump, to eſtimate
what Air is left in the veſſel it ſhould exhauſt, and particularly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of our operation I obſerv'd, that when the Sucker
was depreſt, there came out of the Water that cover'd the Pump,
ſo very few bubbles, that they might be imputed to the Air af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
by the Bubbles, ſpringing from the water in the Tube;
whereas if any adventious Air had got into that Cylinder of
water, it would have appear'd in the water that cover'd the
Pump.</p>
               <p>5. Laſtly, it were very ſtrange, that if the water was but caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102306:39"/>
hindred by ſome Leak from aſcending any higher, it ſhould
be ſo eaſy to raiſe it to the very number of feet that our <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
requires, and yet we ſhould be unable by obſtinate Pumping to
raiſe it one foot higher.</p>
               <p>Note, 1. as ſoon as we had made our Experiment, and thereby
found, that what was requiſite to it was in order; I ſent to give
notice of it to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Wallis,</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Wren,</hi> as Perſons whoſe curioſity
makes them as well delighted with ſuch Tryals, as their deep
knowledg makes Them moſt competent Judges of them. But
before They could be found, and come, it being grown ſomewhat
late and windy, I that was not very well, and had tired my ſelf
with going up and down, could not ſtay with them ſo long as I
intended, but leaving the reſt of the Repeated Experiment to be
ſhewn them by <hi>I. M.</hi> (who had been very induſtrious in fitting
and erecting the Tube) they and their Learned friend (whom they
brought with them) Doctor <hi>Millington,</hi> told me a while after,
that they alſo had found the greateſt height, to which they could
raiſe the water, to be 33 foot and an half.</p>
               <p>2. When the Water began firſt to appear in the Glaſs, the
Bubbles would be, as I had foretold, exceeding numerous; ſo as
to make a froath of near a foot high, if the water were newly
brought, and had never been rais'd in the Tube before. But if
the Pumping were long continued, the number and height (or at
leaſt one of the two) of the Aggregate of Bubbles, would (as
there remain'd fewer and fewer Aerial particles in the water) be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
and leſſer; but their emerging did never that I remember
wholly ceaſe.</p>
               <p>3. At the beginning alſo there would appear great vibrations
of the water in the upper part of the Tube; the riſing and the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
amounting ſometimes to a foot, or near half a yard: but theſe
grew leſſer and leſſer, as thoſe of the Quickſilver in the <hi>Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Experiment uſe to do.</p>
               <p>4. One may uſe an ordinary Pail to hold the ſtagnant water;
but we rather imploy'd a veſſel of Earth made (for another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102306:39"/>
ſomewhat ſlender, and of a Cylindrical ſhape, becauſe in a
narrow veſſel tis more eaſie to gueſs by the riſing and falling of
the Liquor, how the Pump is ply'd, and to perceive even ſmaller
Leaks.</p>
               <p>5. I muſt not forget to take notice, that though the newly
nam'd Gentlemen came to me (when they had ſeen the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
tryed) within leſs than an hour after the time I had look'd
upon the Baroſcope, and obſerv'd the Quick-ſilver to ſtand ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
beneath 29 inches, and 3 eights; yet when preſently upon
their return I conſulted the ſame inſtrument again, the Mercury
appear'd to be ſenſibly riſen, being ſomewhat (though but very
litle) above 9 and 20 inches, and 3 eights, and 5 or 6 hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(at bed-time) I found it to be yet more conſiderably riſen.
Which may keep Your Lordſhip from wondring at what I inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
a little above, touching Monſieur <hi>Paſchal's</hi> Experiment, as
well as touching the diſappointment of the Pump-makers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
For tis not onely poſſible, that (as I have elſewhere
noted) Water may be raiſed in the ſame Pump (though we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it ſtill equally ſtanch) higher at one time than at another: but
'twas contingent, that, in Monſieur <hi>Paſchal's</hi> noble attempt to
imitate the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment with Water in ſtead of
Quick-ſilver, the proportion betwixt the heights of thoſe two
Liquors in their reſpective Tubes anſwer'd ſo well to their ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
Gravities. For, the varying weight of the Atmoſphere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not then (that appears) known, or conſequently taken into
conſideration; if Monſieur <hi>Paſchal,</hi> having tryed the <hi>Torricellian</hi>
Experiment, when the Air was for inſtance very heavy, had tryed
his own Experiment, when the Atmoſphere had been as light as I
have often enough obſerv'd it to be, he might have found his
Cylinder of Water to have been half a Yard or two foot ſhorter
than the formerly meaſur'd height of the Quick-ſilver would have
required.</p>
               <p>I have now no more to adde about this 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Experiment, but
that it may ſerve for a ſufficient confirmation of what I note in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

Treatiſe, againſt thoſe Hydraulical &amp; Pneumatical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who pretend to teach wayes of making Water paſs by infle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Pipes, and by the help of Suction, from one ſide of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the other, be the Mountain never ſo high. For, if the
Water be to aſcend as 'twere ſpontaneouſly above 35 or 36 foot,
a Sucking Pump will not ordinarily, at leaſt here in <hi>England,</hi> be
able to raiſe it.</p>
               <p>And now I ſpeak of Mountains, it will not be altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to add, that if it had not been for unſeaſonable weather,
I had thought fit to make the foregoing 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Experiment (of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levating
Mercury by Suction) to be tryed at the top of an Hill,
not far from the place I then was at. For by what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
delivered, it appears, that we might have eſtimated the
height, to which the Water may be there elevated by Suction,
without repeating the Experiment with a thirty five foot Tube,
(which we could not hope for conveniency to do,) by the utmoſt
height to which our Engine could have rais'd Mercury: and it
may be of ſome uſe to be able from Experiments to make <hi>ſome</hi>
eſtimate (for it can ſcarce be an accurate one) how much it may be
expected, that Pumps ſhall (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) looſe of their power
of elevating Water by Suction, by being imploy'd at the top of
an Hill, in ſtead of being ſo at the bottom, or on a Plain. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
always what I lately intimated, that even in the ſame
place Liquors will be brought to aſcend by Suction to a greater
or leſs height at one time than another, according to the varying
Gravity of the Atmoſphere.</p>

by ſome Modern Corpuſcularians, and eſpecially <hi>Carteſians;</hi>
but ſince divers Learned and Judicious men do ſtill look upon
the cauſe of Elaſticity, as a thing that needs to be yet farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into; and becauſe I am not my ſelf ſo well ſatisfied as to
blame their Curioſity, I held it not unfit to examine by the help
of our Engine their Conjecture, who imagine that the Air may
have a great ſtroak in the making of bodies Springy; and this I
the rather did, becauſe I had<note n="*" place="margin">In Notes about the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticity.</note> elſwhere ſhewn, that there is no
need to aſſert, that in all Bodies, that have it, the Elaſtical power
flows immediately from the Form, but that in divers of them it
depends upon the Mechanicanical ſtructure of the Body.</p>
               <p>To make ſome Tryal therefore, whether the Air have any
great Intereſt in the Motion of Reſtitution, we took a piece of
Whalebone of a convenient bigneſs and length, and having fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd
one end of it in a hole made in a thick and heavy Trencher,
to be placed on the Plate of the Engine, we tyed to the other
end a Weight, whereby the Whalebone was moderately bent,
the weight reaching down ſo near to a Body plac'd in a level poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
under it, that if the Spring were but a little weaken'd, the
weight muſt either lean upon, or at leaſt touch the Horizontal
plain: or if on the other ſide the Spring ſhould grow ſenſibly
ſtronger, it might be eaſily perceiv'd by the diſtance of the
weight, which was ſo near the plain, that a litle increaſe of it muſt
be viſible.</p>
               <p>This done, we convey'd theſe things into the Receiver, and
order'd thoſe that pump'd to ſhake it as litle as they could, that
the weight might not knock againſt the Body that lay under it, or
ſo ſhake it, as to hinder us from diſcerning whether or no it were
depreſs'd by the bare withdrawing of the Air.</p>
               <p>And when the Air had been well pump'd out, I watcht atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
whether any notable Change in the diſtance of the weight
from the almoſt contiguous plain would be produc'd upon its
being let in again: for the weight was then at reſt, and the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102306:41"/>
Air flowing in much more ſpeedily than it could before be
drawn out, I thought this the likelieſt time to diſcover whether
the abſence of the Air had ſenſibly altered the Spring of the
Whalebone. But though the Experiment were made more
than once, I could ſatisfie my ſelf onely in this, that the depreſſion
or elevation of the Weight, that was due to the true and meer
change of the Spring, was not very <hi>conſiderable,</hi> ſince I did not
think my ſelf ſure, that I perceiv'd any at all: for though it be
true, that ſometimes, when the Receiver was well exhauſted, the
Weight ſeem'd to be a little depreſt, yet That I thought was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
litle, if any thing more than what might be aſcrib'd to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Air, not conſider'd as a Body that had any thing to do
directly with the Spring, but as a Body that had ſome (though but
a litle) Weight; upon which account it made the <hi>medium,</hi> wherein
the Experiment was tried, contribute to ſupport the Weight that
bent the Spring; which Weight, when the Air was abſent, muſt
(being now in a lighter <hi>medium</hi>) have its Gravitation increas'd by
as much weight, as a quantity of the exhauſted Air, equal to it
in bulk, could amount to. But this Experiment being tried on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

how the Receiver is exhauſted.</head>
               <p>BEcauſe the Air being inviſible, it is not always eaſie to know
whether it be ſufficiently pump'd out of the Receiver that
was to be exhauſted; we thought it would be very convenient
to have ſome Instrument within the Receiver, that might ſerve
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102306:41"/>
for a Gage, or Standard; whereby to judge whether or not it were
ſufficiently exhauſted.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe divers Expedients were thought on, and ſome
of them put in practiſe; which, though not equally commodious,
may yet all of them be uſefully imploy'd, one on this occaſion,
and another on that.</p>
               <p>The Firſt (if I miſremember not) that I propoſ'd, was a Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
(which may be greater or leſs, according to the Size of the
Veſſel it is to ſerve for) to be very ſtrongly tied at the neck, after
having had onely ſo much Air left in the folds of it, as may ſerve
to blow up the Bladder to its full dimenſions, when the Receiver
is very well exhauſted, and not before. But though Your Lord-ſhip
will hereafter find that I yet make uſe of ſmall Bladders on
certain occaſions, in which they are peculiarly convenient, yet in
many caſes they do, when the Glaſſes are well exhauſted, take up
too much room in them, and hinder the Objects, included in the
Receiver, from being obſerv'd from all the ſides of it.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of Gage was made with Quick-ſilver, pour'd into
a very ſhort Pipe, which was afterwards inverted into a litle Glaſs
of ſtagnant Quick-ſilver, according to the manner of the <hi>Torri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellian</hi>
Experiment. For this Pipe being but a very few inches
long, the Mercury in it would not begin to deſcend, till a very
Great proportion of Air was pump'd out of the Receiver; becauſe
till then, the Spring of the remaining Air would be ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be able to keep up ſo ſhort a Cylinder of Mercury. And
this kind of Gage is no bad one. But becauſe, to omit ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
litle inconveniences, it cannot eaſily be ſuſpended, (which in
divers Experiments 'tis fit the Gage ſhould be,) and the Mercury
in it is apt to be too much ſhaken by the motion of the Engine,
there was another kind of Gage by ſome Ingenious man (who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he were) ſubſtituted in its place, conſiſting of a kind of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,
whoſe ſhorter leg hath belonging to it a large Bubble of
Glaſs, moſt commonly made uſe of at an Illuſtrious meeting of
<hi>Virtuoſi;</hi> where Your Lordſhip having ſeen it, I ſhall not need to

               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:102306:42"/>
But none of the Gages I had formerly us'd, nor even this laſt,
having the conveniences that ſome of my Experiments require;
I was fain to deviſe another, which is That I moſt make uſe of, as
having advantages, ſome or other of which each of the Gages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
mentioned wants; for even that with Spirit of Wine, not
to mention leſſer diſadvantages, hath a Bubble too Great to let it
be uſeful in veſſels ſo ſlender, as for ſome purpoſes I divers times
imploy; and this ſhort Cylinder of ſo light a Liquor as ſpirit of
Wine, makes the ſubſidence of the Liquor be indeed a good ſign
that the Receiver is well exhauſted, but gives us not an account
what Quantity of Air may be in the Receiver, 'till it be arriv'd
at that great meaſure of Rarefaction; and the ſame Liquor, being
upon a very ſmall leak (ſuch as would not be prejudicial to many
Experiments) impell'd up to the top of the Gage, we cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by this Inſtrument take any meaſure of the Air that gets
in at the Leak. But now there are divers Experiments where I
deſire to ſee the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that will happen, not onely (or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not at all) upon the uttermoſt Exhauſtion of the Air, but
when the Preſſure of it is withdrawn to ſuch or ſuch a meaſure, and
alſo when the Air is gradually readmitted.</p>
               <p>To make the Gage we are ſpeaking of, take a very ſlender and
Cylindrical Pipe of Glaſs, of 6, 8, 10, or more Inches in length,
and not ſo big as a Gooſe-quill,<note place="margin">See plate the Figure the</note> (but ſuch as we imploy for the
Stems of ſeal'd Weather Glaſſes,) and having at the flame of a
Lamp melted it, but not too near the middle, to make of it by
bending it a Siphon, whoſe two Legs are to be not onely parallel
to one another, but as litle diſtant any where from one another as
conveniently may be. In one (which is uſually the longer) of
theſe Legs, there is to be left at the top, either half an inch, or a
whole inch, or more or leſs than either, (according to the length
of the Gage, or the ſcope of the Experimenter) of Air in its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſtate, neither rarefied, nor condens'd; the reſt of the longer leg,
and as great a part of the ſhorter as ſhall be thought fit, being to
be fill'd with Quick-ſilver. This done, there may be Marks
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102306:42"/>
plac'd at the outſide of the longer (or ſealed) leg, whereby to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the Expanſion of the Air included in the ſame leg, and theſe
marks may be either litle Glaſs Knubs, about the bigneſs of Pins
heads, faſten'd by the help of a Lamp at certain diſtances to the
longer leg of the Siphon, or elſe the diviſions of an Inch made
on a liſt of Paper, and paſted on either to the Siphon it ſelf, or to
the ſlender Frame, which on ſome occaſions we faſten the Gage
to.</p>
               <p>This Inſtrument being convey'd into a Receiver, (which for
expedition ſake we chooſe as ſmall as will ſerve the turn,) the Air
is to be very diligently pump'd out, and then notice is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to what part of the Gage the Mercury is depreſt, that we
may know, when we ſhall afterwards ſee the Mercury driven ſo
far, that the Receiver, the Gage is plac'd in, is well exhauſted.
And if it be much deſired to know more accurately (for one may
arrive pretty near the truth by Gueſs) what ſtations of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
in the Gage are anſwerable to the degrees of the Rarefaction
of the Air in the Receiver; that may be compaſſed either by
Calculation, (which is not ſo eaſie, and ſuppoſes ſome <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi>)
or (though not without ſome trouble) by letting in the water as
often as is neceſſary, into a Receiver, whoſe intire capacity is firſt
meaſured, and in which there may be Marks made to ſhew when
the water to be let in ſhall fill a fourth part, or half, or three
quarters &amp;c. of the Cavity. For if (for inſtance) when the Quick-ſilver
in the Gage is depreſt to ſuch a Mark, you let in the water,
and that Liquor appears to fill a fourth part of the Receiver, you
may conclude, that about a 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of the Air was pump'd out,
or that a 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of the Spring, that the whole included Air had,
was loſt by the Exhauſtion, when the Quick ſilver in the Gage
was at the Mark above mentioned; &amp; if the admitted water do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
either fall ſhort of, or exceed the quantity you expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
you may the next time let in the water either after the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
has a litle paſt the former Mark, or a litle before it is arriv'd
at it. And when once you have this way obtain'd one pretty
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102306:43"/>
long and accurate Gage, you will not need to take ſo much pains
to make others, ſince you may divide them by the help of that
one; for this being plac'd with any other in a ſmall Receiver, when
the Mercury in the Standard-Gage (if I may ſo call it) is depreſt
to any of the determinate diviſions obtain'd by obſervation, you
may thence conclude how much the Air in the Receiver is rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and conſequently by taking notice of the place where the
Mercury reſts in the other Gage, you may determine what degree
of Exhauſtion in a Receiver is denoted by that ſtation of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
in this Gage.</p>
               <p>Perhaps I need not tell your Lordſhip that the Ground of this
contrivance was, that whereas in divers other Gages, when the
Pump came to be obſtinately ply'd, the Expanſion of the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Air would be ſo great, that it would either drive out the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
eſpecially if it were light, or in part make an eſcape through
it: I judg'd that in ſuch an Inſtrument, as that newly deſcrib'd,
thoſe inconveniences would be avoided, becauſe that the more
the Air ſhould come to be dilated, the greater weight of Quick-ſilver
it would in the ſhorter Leg have to raiſe, which would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
hinder it from making that heavy liquor run over; and
the ſame ponderouſneſs of the Liquor, together with the ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Pipe, would likewiſe hinder the included Air from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
through in Bubbles.</p>
               <p>NB. 1. For moſt Experiments, where exact meaſures are not
required, it will not be ſo neceſſary to mark the Gage at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtation of the Quick-ſilver then that which tis brought to by
the Exhauſtion of the Receiver, for by that alone we may know
when the Air is well pump'd out of the Receiver, wherein the
Gage is included: and when one is a litle uſ'd to ſome particular
Gage, one may by the ſubſidence of the Mercury gueſs at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of the Airs rarefaction, ſo near as may ſerve the turn in ſuch
Experiments. But when this Inſtrument is to be us'd about nice
Tryals, where it may be thought requiſite to have it divided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to one of the ways formerly propoſed, it will on divers
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102306:43"/>
occaſions be more ſecure (in caſe the maker of the Gage has skill
to do it,) to put to the Diviſions rather by litle Knubs of Glaſs,
than by Paper; becauſe this will on ſuch occaſions be in danger
either to be rubb'd off, or wetted. And if Glaſs-marks be us'd,
it will be convenient that every fifth, or tenth, or ſuch Ordinal
number as ſhall be judg'd fit, be made of Glaſs of a differing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
for diſtinction ſake, &amp; the more eaſie reckoning. We ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for a need apply, in ſtead of theſe Glaſs-knubs, little marks
of hard ſealing Wax, which will not be injur'd by moiſture, as
thoſe Papers will that are paſted on; but theſe of Wax, though
in many caſes uſeful, are not comparable to the other in all, ſince
if they be very ſmall, they are eaſily rubb'd off, and if large, they
make not the Diviſion exact enough, and often hide the true
place of the Quick-ſilver.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here about the Mercurial Gages add onely this Hint,
that what I propos'd to my ſelf in that Contrivance, was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to eſtimate the Air pump'd out of the Receiver, or that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in it; but alſo, by the help of this Inſtrument (as elſewhere
by another Experiment) to meaſure (ſomewhat near) the ſtrength
of the Spring of rarefied Air, according to its ſeveral degrees of
Rarefaction; and by this Obſervation, in concurrence with other
things, I hoped we might (according to what I have elſewhere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated)
be aſſiſted to eſtimate, by the Cylinder of Mercury
rais'd in the open leg, the Expanſion of the Air included in the
ſealed leg: but of theſe things I deſign'd in this place to give but
an Intimation.</p>
               <p>3. That leg of the Gage that includes the Air, may be ſeal'd
up either at the beginning, before the Pipe be bent into a Syphon,
or (which is much better) after the following manner. Before
you bend the Pipe, draw out the end of it, which you mean to
ſeal, to a ſhort and very ſlender Thread; then having made the
Pipe a Siphon, pour into the leg, which is to remain open, as much
Quick-ſilver as you ſhall judg convenient, which will riſe to an
equal height in the other leg; out of which by gently inclining
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102306:44"/>
the Siphon, you may pour out the ſuperfluous Mercury, (if there
be any,) and when you ſee that there is an inch, or half an inch (or
what part you deſign'd to leave for Air) unfill'd with Mercury,
next to the end that is to be clos'd; and that the reſt of that leg,
and as much (as you think fit) of the other is full of Quick-ſilver,
you may, by keeping the Siphon in the ſame poſture, and warily
applying the ſlender <hi>Apex</hi> above mentioned to the upper part
of the flame of a Lamp, blown Horizontal, eaſily ſeal up that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pex</hi>
without cracking, or prejudicing the open leg, or conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
injuring the Air hole, that was to be ſeal'd up in the other.
And this ſealing of one leg muſt (as tis evident) keep the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſuſpended in it, though it be higher by divers inches than that
in the open leg, till the withdrawing of the external Air enable
the included, by expanding it ſelf to depreſs the Mercury in the
ſeal'd leg, and raiſe it in the open.</p>
               <p>4. How the length of theſe Mercurial Gages is to be varied,
according to the Bigneſs and Shape of the ſlender Receivers they
are to be imploy'd in, and how they may eaſily be made either to
ſtand upright at the bottom of the Receiver, or be kept hanging
in the middle, or near the top of it (as occaſion may require,) and
how the open end may be made to ſecure the Mercury, in caſes
where that is needful, belongs not ſo properly to this Treatiſe,
as to the Second part of the Continuation; where, if ever I trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Your Lordſhip with it, the Uſefulneſs of this ſort of Gages,
and the Circumſtances that may advantage them, will beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>5. There being ſome Experiments, wherein it is not deſir'd
that the Receiver ſhould be neer exhauſted, but rather that the
degrees of the Airs rarefaction, which ought not to be very great,
ſhould be well meaſur'd; we may in ſuch caſes make uſe of Gages
ſhap'd like thoſe hitherto deſcrib'd, but made as long as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
will well admit, and furniſh'd in ſtead of Quick-ſilver <hi>either</hi>
with ſpirit of Wine coloured with Cocheneel, <hi>or elſe</hi> with the
tincture of red Roſe-leaves, drawn onely with common Water,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102306:44"/>
made ſhap by a litle either of the Oyl, or the ſpirit of Vitriol, or
of common Salt. For the lightneſs of theſe Liquors in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Quick-ſilver will allow the Expanſins of the Air included
in the Gage to be very manifeſt, and notable enough, though
not half, or perhaps a quarter of the Air be pump'd out of the
Receiver.</p>
               <p>6. You may alſo in ſuch caſes as theſe, where the Receiver is
large enough, and is not to be quite exhauſted, make uſe of a
Mercurial Gage, differing from thoſe above deſcrib'd onely in
this, that the ſhorter leg need not be above an inch, or half an
inch long, before it expand it ſelf into a Bubble of about half an
inch, or an inch in Diameter; and having at the upper part a very
ſhort and ſlender unſeal'd Pipe, at which the Air may get in and
out: by which Contrivance you may have this Convenience, that
You need not include ſo much Air, as otherwiſe would be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
at the top of the longer Leg, becauſe the Mercury in the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cannot, by reaſon of the breadth of the Bubble, whereinto the
Expanſion of the Air drives it, be conſiderably rais'd: Upon which
account it becomes more eaſie to eſtimate by the Eye the degrees
of the included Airs Rarefaction, which may be done almoſt as
eaſily, as if there were water in ſtead of Mercury: provided it be
remembred, that Quick-ſilver by reaſon of its ponderouſneſs, does
far more aſſiſt the dilatation of the Air, then ſo much Water
would do.</p>

proved convincing, becauſe it operated on that Senſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they chiefly rely'd.</p>
               <p>I caus'd then to be made a hollow (but ſtrong) piece of Braſs,
not above two or three inches high, (that it might be in a trice
exhauſted,) and open at both ends, whoſe Orifices were Circular
and parallel, but not equal, (the Inſtrument being made tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
ſo that it might be repreſented by an excavated <hi>Conus trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus,</hi>
or a Gigg, with the lower part cut tranſverſly off.) This
piece of Braſs being cemented on, as if it were a ſmall Receiver
to the Engine, the Perſon, that would not believe the Preſſure of
the Air to be near ſo conſiderable as was repreſented, was bidden
to lay the Palm of his Hand upon the upper Orifice; and being
ordered to lean a little upon it, that ſo the lower part of his hand
might prove a cloſe Cover to the Orifice, one Exuction of the
Air was made by the help of the Pump: and then upon the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
of the greateſt part of the Preſſure of the internal Air,
that before counterballanc'd that of the External, the Hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
left alone to ſupport the weight of the Ambient Air, would
be preſſed inwards ſo forceably, that though the ſtronger ſort

if by a ſecond Suck the litle Receiver were better exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,)
but were fain to ſtay for the Return of the Air into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
to aſſiſt them.</p>
               <p>This Experiment being deſign'd rather to convince than to
puniſh thoſe that were to make it, we took care not onely that
the Braſs ſhould be ſo thick, and the Orifices ſo ſmooth, that no
Sharpneſs nor Roughneſs of the Metal ſhould offend the Hand;
but alſo that the narrower Orifice (which was the ofteneſt made
uſe of) ſhould be but about an inch and a quarter in Diameter.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102306:45"/>
But if any were deſirous of a more ſenſible conviction, 'twas very
eaſie to give it him by making the larger Orifice the uppermoſt,
which was the reaſon why the Inſtrument was, as we formerly
noted, made tapering. But yet this larger Orifice ought not to
exceed 2 Inches, or 2 Inches and 1/2 in wideneſs, leaſt the great
Weight of the Air endanger the breaking or conſiderably hurting
the Hand of the Experimenter. Which Caution I am put in
mind of giving, by remembring that I once much endangered my
own Hand, through the miſtake of him that manag'd the Pump,
who unawares to me ſet it on work, when, for another purpoſe, I
had laid my Hand upon the Orifice of an Inſtrument of too great

Bolt head with the lower part of the Ball cut Circularly off,
upon the firſt Exuction of the Air, the Quick-ſilver that before

(for once I meaſur'd the Subſidence beneath its former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation,)
and in about three Sucks more it would be brought
quite down to the Level of the Stagnant Quick-ſilver, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
below, (as tis the property of Quick-ſilver, quite contrary
to Water, to riſe leſs in a ſlender Pipe than in a wide.) The Air
being let into the Receiver, the Quick-ſilver would be impell'd
up ſlowlier or faſter, as we pleas'd, to the former height of 29 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>NB. 1. That if the Air were ſuffer'd to go haſtily out of the
Receiver, the Mercury would, by virtue of the accelerated moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
acquir'd in its deſcent, at the very firſt Suck deſcend till it
reacht within an inch or two of the ſtagnant Mercury, though it
would preſently after a few riſings and fallings ſettle at the height
of 9 or 10 inches, till the next Suck brought it down lower.</p>
               <p>2. If when the Mercury was reimpell'd up to its due height,
thoſe that manag'd the Pump did, in ſtead of rarifying the Air, a

be eaſily made to riſe an inch or more above the former ſtandard
of 29 inches. Which Circumſtance I mention, not as a new

               <p>And to confirm another paſſage in the ſame Page, where I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
that if the Preſſure of the Air upon the ſtagnant Mercury
be not ſo great as tis wont to be, the Mercury will begin to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
in a (fill'd and inverted) Tube, which wants of the uſual
height; we took a Glaſs Cane, (ſeal'd at one end,) much ſhorter
than the due length, and having fill'd it with Mercury, and inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it into a Glaſs full of ſtagnant Mercury, we placed all in the

ſecond Suck it would ſubſide, and in two or three Sucks more it
would fall to the levell of the ſtagnant Mercury, or a little below
it. Upon the letting in of the Air it would be impell'd to the

Quick-ſilver to the height of 3 or 4 fingers. Then we took
a couple of Cylindrical Pipes of very unequal ſizes, (the wider
being as big agen as the ſlenderer) and open at both Ends. The
lower Ends of theſe two Pipes we thruſt into the Quick-ſilver,
and faſten'd them near their upper Ends to the Tube with ſtrings,
that they might not be lifted up, nor mov'd out of their poſture,
in which the convex Surface of the Mercury in both the Pipes
ſeem'd to lie almoſt in a Level, the Tube alſo it ſelf being plac'd
upright in a Frame. This done, by the help of a Funnel we pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Water by degrees at the top of the Tube, and obſerv'd,
that as the Water gravitated more and more upon the ſtagnant

as it before ſtood, as it were, in a Level in both the Pipes, ſo it
was, for ought appear'd to us, equally impell'd up beyond its

began to ſubſide alike, as to ſenſe, in them both, falling no lower

riſe uniformly as before. By which and the former Experiment

               <p>COnſidering with my ſelf, that if the Suſtentation of the
Quick-ſilver in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment at a certain

be altered, the height of it, requiſite to an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi>

ſay) I thought it might ſomewhat confirm the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> hitherto
made uſe of, if a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> ſo agreeable to it were actually
exhibited. This I ſuppoſed performable two differing wayes,
namely by mixing or (as Chymiſts ſpeak) Amalgamating Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
either with Gold, to make it a mixture more heavy, or with
ſome other Metal that might make it more light than Mercury
alone is. But the former of thoſe two ways I forbore to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
being where I then was unfurniſhed with a ſufficient
quantity of refined Gold, (for that which is Coyn'd is generally
allayed with Silver, or Copper, or both,) and therefore Amalga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
Mercury with a convenient proportion of pure Tin, (or, as
the Tradeſmen call it, Block-Tin,) that the mixture might not
be too thick to be readily poured out into a Glaſs-Tube, and to
ſubſide in it, we fill'd with this Amalgam a Cylindrical Pipe, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102306:48"/>
at one end, and of a fit length, and then inverted it into a litle
Glaſs furniſhed with the like mixture. Of which Tryal the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
was, that the Amalgam did not fall down to 29, nor even to
30 inches, but ſtopt at 31 above the ſurface of the ſtagnant Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Note 1. That though one may expect, that the Event of
the Experiment would be the more conſiderable, the Greater
the Quantity is that is mingled of the light Metal, yet care muſt
be taken that the Amalgam be not made too thick, leaſt part of
it ſtick here and there (as we did to our trouble find it apt to do)
to the inſide of the Pipe, by which means ſome Aerial Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles
will meet with ſuch convenient Receptacles, as to make it
very difficult, if not almoſt impoſſible, to free the Tube quite
from Air.</p>
               <p>2. It may perhaps be worth while to try, whether by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the height of the Amalgam, to what it ought to be upon the
ſcore of the ſpecifick Gravities of the Mercury, and the Tin, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
in a known Proportion in the Amalgam, any diſcovery may
be made whether thoſe two Metals do penetrate one another
after ſuch a manner (for there is no ſtrict Penetration of Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
among Bodies) as Copper and Tin have, as I elſewhere note,
been (by ſome Chymiſts) obſerv'd to do, when being melted
down together they make up a more cloſe and ſpecifically ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Body, than their reſpective Weights ſeem'd to require.</p>
               <p>3. That by comparing this 21. Experiment with the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
thoſe formerly publiſhed, it may appear, that the height of the
Liquor, ſuſpended in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, depends ſo
much upon its <hi>aequilibrium</hi> with the outward Air, that it may be

counterballance each other, whether the change be of weight in

in reference to the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the Printed Experiments, where I
mention, that I obſerved, by long keeping the ſame Inſtrument with
which I once made the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment in the ſame place,
that the height of the ſuſpended Mercury would vary according as the
weight of the Atmoſphere hapned to change. But though about the
Barometer (as others have by their imitation allowed me to call the
Inſtrument hitherto mentioned, put into a Frame) I made in the
year 1660 ſeveral Obſervations, that would not perhaps be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in this place, yet having long ſince left them with a Friend, who
lives far off, and not having them now in my power, I muſt beg Your
Lordſhips permiſſion to reſerve them for a part of the Appendix,
which I doubt I ſhall be engaged to adde to this Epiſtle. And in the
mean time I ſhall not forbear to preſent Your Lordſhip thoſe other
Papers that I have by me, relating to the Barometer; ſome of which
will, I preſume, ſufficiently confirm my lately mentioned conjecture

               <head type="sub">Wherein is propos'd a way of making Barometers, that may be
tranſported even to distant Countries.</head>
               <p>THinking it a deſireable thing (as I have elſewhere intimated)
to be able to compare together, by the help of Barometers,
the weight of the Atmoſphere at the ſame time, not onely in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
parts of the ſame Country, as of <hi>England,</hi> but in differing
Regions of the World; I could not but foreſee that 'twould be
very difficult to accompliſh my deſire without altering the form
of the Barometers I had hitherto made uſe of. For as theſe be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102306:49"/>
unfit to be tranſported far, becauſe that ſtagnant Mercury would
be ſo apt to ſpill. So the procuring them to be made in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where they are to be uſed, though it be no bad expedient, and
ſuch as I have divers times made uſe of, is liable to this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience;
that, beſides that few will take the pains, and have the
skill, requiſite to make Baroſcopes well, though they be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
furniſhed with Glaſſes and Mercury for that purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, I ſay, except men be more than ordinarily diligent and
skilful, (and perhaps though they be,) 'twill be very difficult to
be ſure that the Baroſcope newly made in a remote Country, is as
Good (and but as good) as that which a man makes uſe of in this;
in regard that at the making of the former, they are ſuppoſed to
have no other Baroſcope to compare it with; and to be ſure, they
have not the ſame with which it is to be compared Here.</p>
               <p>Being by theſe conſiderations invited to attempt the making of
Portable or Travailing Baroſcopes, (if I may ſo call them,) I
thought it requiſite to endeavour theſe three things: The <hi>firſt,</hi>
to make the veſſel that ſhould contain both the ſuſtained and the
ſtagnant Mercury all of one piece of Glaſs, of a like bigneſs: The
<hi>next,</hi> to place this veſſel, when fill'd, in ſuch a Frame, as may be
eaſie to be tranſported, and yet in a reaſonable meaſure defend
the Glaſs from external violence, no part of it ſtanding quite out
of the Frame, as in all other Baroſcopes: And the <hi>third,</hi> ſo to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the veſſel, that it may not be ſubject to be eaſily broken by
the violent motion of the Mercury contain'd in it.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe will not ſeem practicable to thoſe that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
(without any warrant from the Hydroſtaticks) that tis as well
neceſſary as uſual, that the ſtagnant Mercury ſhould have a veſſel
much wider than the Tube, wherein the Mercurial Cylinder is
ſuſtain'd; but to us the difficulty ſeem'd much leſs to make the
Glaſs part of our Tube of one piece, and of a convenient ſhape,
than afterwards to fill it.</p>
               <p>But to do both, we took a Glaſs Cylinder ſeal'd at one end,
and of a convenient length, (as about 4 or 5 foot,) and caus'd it by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102306:50"/>
the flame of a Lamp to be ſo bent, that, to thoſe that did not take
notice 'twas ſealed at one end, it ſeem'd to be a Syphon of very
unequal Legs, the one being 3 or 4 times longer than the other;
by virtue of which Figure the ſhorter Leg may ſerve in ſtead of
the diſtinct veſſel uſually imployed to contain the ſtagnant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.
To fill this, which is not eaſie, one may proceed after this
manner. Take a ſmall Funnel of Glaſs, with a long and ſlender
Shank, ſo that it may reach 3 or 4 Inches, or further, into the
ſhorter Leg of our Barometrical Syphon (if I may ſo call it;) and
by this Funnel pour into this ſhorter Leg as much Mercury as
may reach about 2 or 3 Inches in both Legs; then ſtopping the
Orifice with your finger, and ſlowly inclining the Tube, the
Mercury in the longer Leg will gently fall to the ſealed end; and
the Air that was there before, will paſs by it, and ſo make it
room. The Mercury in the ſhorter Leg (which Leg ought to
be held uppermoſt) will by the ſame inclination of the Tube fall
towards the Orifice, but, being by the finger that ſtops that, kept
from falling out, if you do ſlowly reerect the Glaſs, and then
make it ſtoop again as much as before, the Mercury will paſs out
of the ſhorter Leg into the longer, and joyn with that which was
there before; and if all the Mercury do not ſo paſs, the Orifice is
to be ſtopt again with your Finger, and the Tube inclin'd as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
This done, the Tube is to be erected, and by the help of the
Funnel more Mercury is to be poured in, and the foregoing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of ſtopping the Orifice, inclining the Tube &amp;c. is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
till all the Mercury pour'd into the ſhorter Leg, be
brought to joyn with that in the longer; and then the open Leg
is to be furniſht with freſh Mercury, obſerving this, that the
nearer the longer Leg comes to the being fill'd, the leſs you muſt
raiſe it from time to time, when you pour Mercury into the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
as alſo, that when you ſee the longer Leg quite full of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
(though there be but litle in the ſhorter,) you need not
pour in any more, if the longer do much exceed a Yard; becauſe
upon the reſtoring of the Tube to an erected poſture there will
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102306:50"/>
ſubſide from the taller leg into the other a pretty quantity of
Mercury, by reaſon of the ſpace at the ſeal'd end, which will be
deſerted by the Mercury that was there. But becauſe tis difficult
by this way, as well as by that practiſed already, to fill a Tube
with Mercury without leaving any viſible bubbles; to free it from
ſuch (if any happen to be) you muſt once more ſtop the Orifice
with your finger, and incline, and reerect the Tube divers times,
till you have thereby brought moſt of the ſmaller bubbles into
one greater; (which you may if you pleaſe increaſe, by letting in
a little Air:) for by making this Great bubblle paſs leiſurely two
or three times from one end of the Tube to the other, it will in
its paſſage as it were lick up all the ſmall Bubbles, and unite them
to its ſelf; which may afterwards by one inclination more of the
Tube be made to paſs into the ſhorter Leg, and thence into the
free Air.</p>
               <p>But there is another ſort of Funnels, which if one have the
skill and conveniency to make, (as <hi>I. M.</hi> eaſily doth,) one may
very expeditiouſly fill the bended Tubes of our portable Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters.
For if you make the ſlender part of the Funnel not
ſtreight but bended, in the form of an Obtuſe Angle, and of ſuch
a length, that the part which is to go into the ſhorter Leg of our
Siphon may reach to the Flexure (of the Siphon;) then you may,
by ſo holding the Tube that the ſealed end be ſomewhat lower
than the other, and by pouring in Mercury at the Obtuſe end of
the Angular Funnel, eaſily make it run over the Flexure into the
longer Leg of the Siphon; provided you do now and then, as
occaſion requires, erect a litle and ſhake the Tube, to help the
Mercury to get by the Air, and expell it.</p>
               <p>By ſuch wayes as theſe we have found by Experience, that tis
poſſible (though not eaſie) to do in ſuch a bended Glaſs, as our
purpoſe requires, what, beſides a very late Learned Writer, the
Diligent <hi>Merſennus</hi> himſelf, admoniſhes his Reader, that tis not
a practicable thing to do in the Ordinary Glaſses of the <hi>Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Experiment, viz. to free the Mercury of a ſtraight Tube from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102306:51"/>
Air and Bubbles, (ſ as to be able by inclining the Glaſs to make
the Liquor aſcend to the very top.)</p>
               <p>The Firſt of our 3 above mentioned Scopes being thus attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
it was not difficult to compaſs the Second, by the help of a
ſolid piece of Wood, which is to be ſomewhat longer than the
Tube, and a good deal broader in the lower part than in the upper,
that it may receive the ſhorter Leg of the Siphon. In ſuch a piece
of Wood, which was about an Inch thick, we caus'd to be made
a Gutter or Channel, of ſuch a depth and ſhape, that our Siphon
might be placed in it ſo deep, that a flat piece of Wood (like a
plain'd Lath) might be layd upon it, without at all preſſing upon
or ſo much as touching the Glaſs; ſo that this piece of Wood
may ſerve for a Cover to defend the Glaſs, to be put on when the
Inſtrument is to be tranſported, and taken off again when tis to
be hung up to make Obſervations with; the Channel-piece of
wood ſerving both for a part of a Caſe, and for an entire Frame;
which may for ſome uſes be a litle more commodious, if the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be joyned (as it may eaſily be) to the reſt of the Frame, by
2 or 3 litle Hinges and a Haſp, by whoſe help the Caſe may be
readily opened and ſhut at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> thing we propoſed to our ſelves is nothing near ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
as the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, nor have we yet had opportunity to try, whether the
way we made uſe of will hold, if the Barometer be tranſported
into very remote parts, though by ſmaller Removes we found
cauſe to hope that 'twill ſucceed in Greater.</p>
               <p>The Grand difficulty to be obviated was this; That though
'twere eaſie to hinder the ſpilling of the Mercury, by ſtopping
the Orifice of the ſhorter Leg of our Siphon, yet that would not
ſerve the turn; for the upper part of the Tube being deſtitute
of Air, if the Mercury be by the motion of the Inſtrument put to
vibrate, it will be apt (for want of meeting with any Air in the
upper part of the Tube to check its motions) to hit ſo violently
againſt the Top of the Glaſs as to beat it out, or to crack ſome of
the neighbouring parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:102306:51"/>
To obviate this great inconvenience our way is, to incline the
Tube, till the Mercury be impell'd to the very top of it, and yet
there will remain a competent quantity in the ſhorter leg of the
Glaſs, if that be not at firſt made too ſhort. This done, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
part of the ſhorter Leg is to be quite fill'd up either with
Water or Mercury, and the Orifice of it is to be very carefully
and firmly ſtopt, (for which purpoſe we uſe our ſtrong black Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:)
for by this means the Mercury in the longer Leg, having
no room to play, cannot ſtrike with violence as before, againſt
the top of the Glaſs. But though by many times ſucceſſively ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Baroſcope we did not perceive that 'twas very like to be
prejudiced by the ſhakes it muſt neceſſarily indure in Tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to remote places, if due care be had of it by the way, yet till
further Tryal have been made I ſhall not pretend to be certain of
the Event. But thus much of conveniency we have already found
in this Contrivance, that we ſent it ſome miles off to the top of a
Hill, and had it brought home ſafe again, the <hi>phaenomena</hi> at the top
and bottom of the Hill being anſwerable to what we might have
expected if we had imployed another Baroſcope.</p>
               <p>When the Inſtrument is to be ſent away, the height of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
Cylinder (to be meaſured from the ſurface of the ſtagnant
Mercury in the ſhorter Leg) being taken for that place, day, and
hour, and compar'd (if it may be) with that of another good Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope,
which is to continue in that place; as much of the Gutter
as is unfill'd by the Glaſs may be well ſtuffed with Cotten, or
ſome ſuch thing, to keep the Glaſs the more firm in its poſture;
and that the Tube be not ſhaken or preſs'd againſt the Wood,
ſome of the ſame matter may be put between the reſt of the Frame
and the Cover, which ought to be well bound together. And
when the Inſtrument is arriv'd at the remote place where tis to be
imployed, (for if it be to be ſent but a litle way, it may be carried
ſafely without uſing any adventitious Liquor,) the Water that is
added, may be taken off again, by ſoaking it up with pieces of
Sponge, Linnen, &amp;c. but if in ſtead of Water you put in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102306:52"/>
as it ought to have been put in by Weight, ſo it is to be
taken out, till you have juſt the Weight that was put in: and tis
not difficult to take out the Mercury by degrees, by the help of a
ſmall Glaſs-pipe, ſince You may either ſuck up litle by little as
much as remains of the additional Mercury, when by erecting the
Barometer, and warily unſtopping the Orifice of the lower Leg,
as much Mercury as will of its ſelf flow out is efflux'd; or elſe you
may take out the ſuperfluous Mercury, by thruſting the lower
end of the litle Pipe into that Liquor, and when it has taken in
enough, ſtopping the upper end cloſe with your finger, to keep
it from falling back again when you remove the Pipe.</p>
               <p>NB. If it ſhould happen in a long voyage, that by the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Shakings of the Inſtrument there ſhould from the additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Water or Mercury in the ſhorter Leg get up into the longer
any litle Aerial Bubble, which ſeems the onely (but I hope not
likely) danger in this Contrivance, he that is to uſe the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
at the end of the Voyage may, if he be skilful, free the
Mercury from it by the ſame way, that we lately preſcrib'd to free
it from Air, when the Inſtrument was firſt fill'd.</p>
               <p>I preſume I need not tell Your Lordſhip, that the chief uſe of
this Travailing Baroſcope is, That he that uſes it in a remote
part, keeping a Diary of the heights of the Mercury, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
theſe heights with thoſe at which the Mercury ſtood at the
ſame times in the Barometer that was not remov'd, the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Difference of the weight of the Atmoſphere in diſtant
places may be obſerved. To which this may be added, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,
which the ſtructure of theſe Inſtruments gives them to
be ſecurely let down into deep Wels or Mines, and to be drawn
up to the top of Towers and Steeples, and other elevated places:
not here to conſider, whether by a convenient addition, theſe, as
well as ſome other Barometers, may not be made to diſcover even
very minute Alterations of the Atmoſpheres Preſſure.</p>
               <p>Whether this Travailing Baroſcope, being furniſh'd at its up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
end with a very good Ball and Socket, and at the lower end
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102306:52"/>
with a great weight, (which way of keeping things ſteady in a
Ship has been happily uſed by the <hi>Royal Society</hi> on another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,)
whether, I ſay, our Inſtrument may by this Contrivance,
or ſome other that might be ſuggeſted to the ſame purpoſe,
be made any thing ſerviceable at Sea, notwithſtanding the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
motions of the Ship, I have had no opportunity to try: but
whether it may or may not be uſeful in ſpite of the rolling of the
Ship, it may at leaſt be made uſe of in flat Calms, (which divers
times happen in long Voyages, eſpecially to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and
to <hi>Africk,</hi>) and then the Inſtrument, which at other times may
lie by without being at all cumberſom, may be made uſe of, as
long as the Calm laſts, to acquaint the Obſerver with the weight
of the Atmoſphere in the Climate where he is, and that upon
the Sea: which may give ſome welcome Information to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
of Speculative Naturaliſts, and perhaps prove either more
directly or in its conſequences of ſome uſe to Navigators them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as by enabling them by its ſuddain changes to foretell the
end of the Calme. Beſides that, having one of theſe Inſtruments
ready at hand, where ever they ſet foot on ſhore, though it be but
upon a ſmall Iſland, or a Rock, they can preſently and eaſily take
notice of the Gravity of the Atmoſphere in that place; which
whether or no, if compared with other Obſervations, it may in
time prove not altogether uſeleſs to the Gueſſing whereabouts
they are, and the foreſeeing ſome aproaching changes of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I leave to future Experience, if it ſhall be thought worth
the making, to determine.</p>
               <p>Beſides the ordinary Baroſcope, and this Travailing one, I
have imployed 2 or 3 other Inſtruments of quite differing kinds,
to diſcover the varying Gravities of the Atmoſphere; but though
they have hitherto ſucceeded well (for the main,) yet being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to make further Obſervations about them, I reſerve one of
them for another opportunity, and think fit to leave the other in
a Tract it belongs to.</p>

               <p>SInce the writing of the foregoing and the following Experiments
about the Travailing Baroſcope, having had occaſion to make
one at a place about 50 miles diſtant from that where I was when I
writ them, I took notice, that the Mercury in the Travailing Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope
was not by 1/4 of an Inch ſo high as that in another Baroſcope
made the ordinary way; and yet 'twas not eaſie to perceive, that the
former had been leſs carefully fill'd than the latter. So that I yet
know not well to what cauſe to impute the Difference, unleſs it ſhould
perhaps depend upon this Circumſtance; That the Pipe, whereof the
Travailing Baroſcope was made, was very ſlender, and much more
ſo than the Tube of the other; and I have already elſewhere obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that Mercury, contrary to what happens in Water, is leſſe apt to
riſe in very ſlender Pipes. And though I remember that, at the
Place where I writ the Experiment, to which this Poſtſcript belongs,
in the Tube I then imployed to make the Travailing Baroſcope, the
Mercury aſcended as high as in a noted one made the common way,
yet not being in the other place furniſhed with a Tube long and big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
I think my ſelf oblig'd, till I can clear the Doubt by further
Tryal, to give Your Lordſhip this Advertiſement, leſt either the
Cauſe already ſuſpected, or ſome other unheeded thing may in ſome
caſes make theſe Travailing Baroſcopes ſomewhat differing from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But though they ſhould prove to be ſo, yet it would not follow
that they cannot be made ſerviceable: for keeping a pretty while that
Inſtrument, which ſuggeſted the Scruple to me, juſt by the other with
which I had compar'd it, and carefully taking notice of the reſpective
heights at which the Mercury reſted in both, I obſerv'd that when
it roſe or fell in the other Barometer, it did alſo riſe and fall in the
Portable one; and when it reſted at its firſt ſtation in the Fromer, it
did ſo in the Later; and though there ſeem'd to be an inequality in
the quantity of the Aſcent, and ſubſidence of the Mercury in the two
Inſtruments, yet that ſeem'd to be accountable for by ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102306:53"/>
eſpecially the very unequal breadth of the veſſel that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the ſtagnant Mercury in the other Barometer, and that ſhorter
Leg which anſwer'd to that veſsel in the Travailing Barometer. But
till the formerly propoſed Scruple be by further Obſervation remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
the ſafeſt way will be to make the Barometer to be ſent to remote

Portable one kept at home; that ſo when they are once adjuſted,
the Collations may be made betwixt two Inſtruments of the ſame

               <p>TO give Your Lordſhip ſome Inſtance (till I can preſent You

I ſhall now adde: That when I writ the foregoing Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
chancing to be within 2 or 3 miles of a Hill, which,
though not high, was the leaſt low in that Countrey, I thought
our Inſtrument might be ſfely, and not altogether uſeleſly, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on Horſe-back to the top of it, which was too remote from
the bottom to be conveniently reacht by me on foot in the midſt
of Winter. This Tryal therefore I reſolv'd to make, becauſe,
though I formerly told you of a conſiderable one that had been
made in <hi>France</hi> by ſome Eminent <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> of the Country, yet
I was willing, not onely to have a Proof how ſafely our Baroſcope
might be tranſported, but to confirm to Your Lordſhip upon
our own Obſervation, made in another Region, ſo conſiderable

an Argument, as theſe kind of Experiments afford to our <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though when I came to try the Experiment, I hapned to
have an Indiſpoſition that forbid me to do it all my Self, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
carefully mark'd on the edge of the Frame the height to
which the ſuſpended Quick-ſilver reach'd, and compar'd it with
a good Baroſcope made the ordinary way, I commmitted our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
to a couple of Servants, that I had often imployed about
Pneumatical and Mercurial Experiments, giving them particular
Inſtructions what to do. And the Inſtrument being ſuch as
might be ſafely carried on Horſeback, I had in two or three hours
an Account brought me back, the Summe of which was: That
they found the ſuſpended Mercury fall a litle as they aſcended the
Hill, at whoſe Top they gave the Liquor leave to ſetle, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
took notice by a mark of the Place it reſted at; which was;
as I afterwards found, ¼ of an Inch, or ſomewhat better beneath
the Mark I had made, and this notwithſtanding the Hill was not
high, and the Air and Wind ſeem'd to them to be much colder
at the top of it, than beneath. But though, as they deſcended
more and more, they obſerv'd the Mercury to riſe again higher
and higher, (as being preſs'd againſt by a taller column of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere,)
and though conſequently the Experiment agreed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

have done, if Opportunity had befriended me. For I deſign'd to
make the Experiment at the bottom, the top, and the intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
part of the hill, at three differing conſtitutions of Air; viz. when
it ſhould appear by a good ordinary Baroſcope, that the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere
was very heavy, when it ſhould be found to be very light,
and when it ſhould have a moderate degree of Gravity: And I
hoped, that if ſagacious Experimenters ſhould make theſe diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity'd
Obſervations on diſtant and unequal Hils, good Hints may
reſult from the Collations that may be made of the varying De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
of the Mercurial Cylinders height, according to the
differing Gravities of the Atmoſphere at ſeveral Times, and the
differing heights of the Hils and Stations where the Obſervations
ſhould be made.</p>
               <p>I alſo indeavoured to get a Baroſcope carried down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of deep Mines; partly, to try whether the Atmoſpherical
Pillar being longer There then at the Top, the Mercury in the
Tube would not be impell'd up higher; and partly, in order to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diſcoveries. But ſome Impediments in the ſtructure of thoſe

                  <p>FOraſmuch as on the one hand not onely <hi>Kepler,</hi> but divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
modern Writers of Note, do endeavour to ſtraiten the
Atmoſphere, and make it lower by half than the leaſt height to
which, according to our Eſtimation, it ſhould reach; and to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
their Opinion, will not allow the Clouds to be often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a Mile high, (nor even the higheſt Mountains to exceed
two miles.) And foraſmuch as on the other ſide other Learned
men ſeem to make the Clouds and the Mountains of a ſtupendous
height; we, who take a middle way of eſtimating the height of
the one and the other, hold it not unfit to ſubjoyn on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſome uncommon Obſervations, in favour of our Opinion,
that we have obtain'd from inquiſitive Travellers.</p>
                  <p>But firſt I will ſubjoyn a Paſſage I have ſomewhere met with
in <hi>Ricciolus</hi> his <hi>Almigestum novum,</hi> where he (if I well remember)
relates, that the <hi>Rector Metenſis</hi> (as he calls him) of the Jeſuites
Colledg affirm'd to him ſome years ſince, that he had meaſured
the height of many Clouds, without having found any of them
higher than 5000 paces: which argues, that he met with ſome ſo
high, though indeed the height of Clouds muſt needs bevery vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
according to the Gravity or Lightneſs, Denſity or Thinneſs,
Reſt or Agitation of the Air, and the condition of the Vapors &amp;
Exhaltations they conſiſt of. And if either that be true which we
have formerly had occaſion to mention concerning <hi>Maignan's</hi>
Obſervation, or if it be true that <hi>Sublunary</hi> Comets (for I ſpeak
not of <hi>Celeſtial</hi> ones) are Generated of Exhalations of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial

if its height be not uniform,) and even Clouds (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thoſe that have moſt Fumes, and feweſt Vapors) may reach
much higher than <hi>Cardan, Kepler,</hi> and others have defin'd.</p>
                  <p>But of the height of Clouds (which we have ſometimes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to take Geometrically) we may have elſewhere occaſion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102306:55"/>
to ſpeak again; and therefore I ſhall now proceed to what I have
to ſay concerning the Height of Mountains. Which being an
Enquiry curious and difficult enough in it ſelf, and of ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
in the Diſquiſition about the height of the Atmoſphere,
(it being evident that That muſt reach at leaſt as high as the tops
of Mountains, upon whoſe tops men can live;) I hope it will not
be unacceptable to Your Lordſhip, if having a while ſince (as I
was intimating) had the opportunity to diſcourſe with ſome cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Perſons that have been upon the top of exceeding high
mountains, particularly of the Pic of <hi>Tenariff,</hi> (and eſpecially
with one Gentleman, who was a few dayes before brought to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the Curioſity of our Inquiſitive and Diſcerning Monarch,
by giving him an Account of his Journey,) I acquaint You with
thoſe of the Particulars, which I learn'd from thence, that are the
moſt pertinent to our preſent purpoſe. Firſt then whereas di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
late Mathematicians will not allow above two miles or half
a German league (and ſome of them not half ſo much) to the
height of the higheſt Mountain; the Mountain we ſpeak of, in the
Iſland of <hi>Tenariff,</hi> one of the <hi>Canaries</hi> or Fortunate Iſlands, ſo
high, that, though perhaps I think thoſe Travellers I have taken
notice of, ſpeak with the moſt when they write, that the top of
this Mountain is to be ſeen at Sea 4 degrees off, <hi>i. e.</hi> at leaſt three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
German Leagues; yet having ask'd the ingenious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
lately mentioned, Mr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> from what diſtance the top
of the <hi>Sugar-loaf</hi> (or higheſt part of the Hill, ſo called from
its Figure) could be ſeen at Sea, according to the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Seamen? he anſwer'd, that that Diſtance was wont to be
reckon'd 60 Sea-leagues, of 3 miles to a League: adding, that he
himſelf had ſeen it about 40 leagues off, and yet it appear'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
high, and like a blewiſh Pyramid, manifeſtly a great deal
higher than the Clouds. And what he related to me about the
Diſtance, was afterwards confirmed by the Anſwers I receiv'd
from obſerving men of differing Nations, who had ſail'd that
way; and particularly by a Noble <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> skill'd in the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102306:56"/>
who was then Admiral of a brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet: And
the above mentioned Gentleman (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>S.</hi>) alſo told me, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
men could from thence ſee the Iſland of <hi>Madera,</hi> though
diſtant from it 70 leagues; and that the Great <hi>Canary,</hi> though 18
leagues off, ſeem'd to be very near them that were on the top of
the <hi>Sugar-loaf,</hi> as if they might leap down upon it: Thus far
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Sydenham.</hi> By whoſe Relation it appears, that this <hi>Pic</hi> muſt
be far higher than <hi>Kepler</hi> and others allow Mountains to be: for
elſe it could not be ſeen at Sea from ſo great a Diſtance. And
the Learned <hi>Ricciolus</hi> ſuppoſing it to be (as ſome Navigators re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it to be) diſcoverable at Sea 4 degrees off, calculates its
height meaſur'd by a Perpendicular line, and allowing too for
Refraction, to amount to Ten miles, which Altitude alſo the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
<hi>Snellius</hi> aſſigns it. But I fear this Learned man may have
been ſomewhat misinform'd by the Navigators he relyes on, or
elſe that the way of allowing for Refractions is not yet reduc'd to
a ſufficient Certainty. For I do not find by thoſe who have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
gone to the top of it, that the Mountain is ſo high as his
Calculation makes it. And whereas the ſame Eminent Writer
reſolutely ponounces that the Height of mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
being made for Refraction, is 51 Bolonian miles, (which
are conſiderably greater than the Roman miles,) I doubt that
here likewiſe, though I queſtion not his Supputations if You
grant him the Grounds of them, he makes this Mountain far high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than indeed it is. For the Paſſage of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> on which he
founds his Opinion, is obſcure enough; and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> himſelf
does ſometimes take up Reports upon Hear-ſay, without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictly
examining their Truth or Probability; whereas all the
Navigators and Travellers I have hitherto met with, (and Your
Lordſhip knows, that I have upon a Publick Account the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of meeting often with ſuch men,) do almoſt unanimouſly
agree, that the Pic of <hi>Teneriff</hi> is the higheſt Mountain hitherto
known in the World, and yet that is ſo far from being 15 leagues
high, (as ſome Eminent and even late Writers would perſwade us,)
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102306:56"/>
that it is ſcarce a 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part ſo high as <hi>Ricciolus</hi> computes Mount
<hi>Caucaſus</hi> to be. For having ask'd M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Sydenham,</hi> and others,
what was the Eſtimate made by the moſt knowing Perſons of the
Iſland of the height of the Hill, he told me that his Guides ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
it to be one and twenty mile high from the Town called
<hi>L'oretava,</hi> ſeated on the lower part of the Hill; from which.
town to the Sea there is 3 miles of way alwayes deſcending. But
in regard that the way, which amounted to 21 miles in length, is,
as other wayes whereby ſteep places are wont to be aſcended,
made to wind and turn for the conveniency of Travellers; I can
ſcarce deduct leſs than 2 thirds for the Crookedneſs of the way:
and accordingly having ask'd him, whether the Perpendicular
height of it had been accurately taken by any with Mathematical
Inſtruments, he anſwered, that he could ſay nothing to that upon
his own knowledg, but that a Sea-man with great confidence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
himſelf to have accurately enough meaſur'd it by Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
made in a Ship, and to have found the Perpendicular
height of the Hill to be about 7 miles. Which Eſtimate agrees
well enough with the Calculations of <hi>Ricciolus</hi> and <hi>Snellius,</hi> if we
leſſen the Diſtance from which the top of the Hill is to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
from 60 German leagues of 4 miles to a League, to the
like number of common Leagues at 3 miles to a League.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe eminent Writers have ſo confidently deliver'd
prodigious things touching the height of this Mountain, I will
here, to confirm the Eſtimate already made, adde theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
which I took from the Gentleman's own mouth, (and which
were afterwards confirm'd to me by another that went with him,
and partly alſo by a 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, who went up to the top at another time
of the Year,) <hi>viz.</hi> That they begun their Journey from <hi>L'oretava</hi>
on the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Auguſt, about 10 of the Clock at night, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
till Five in the Afternoon on the Munday following, reſting
two Hours by the way, and travelling about 10 miles of their
way upon Mules, which afterwards they were forc'd to leave, and
betake themſelves to their feet. Reſting upon Munday till
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102306:57"/>
midnight, they reſum'd their journeying, and travell'd till about
Nine the next morning, at which time they arriv'd at the top of
the Sugar-loaf, or higheſt Pile of the Mountain; ſo that they
travell'd in all but 26 hours, in which, conſidering the ſteepneſs
and ruggedneſs of the ways, and that they were forc't to goe above
half way on foot, to which they were unaccuſtomed, tis likely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that the length of the way did not much, if at all, exceed
the Computation of the Guides.</p>
                  <p>We have ſince endeavour'd, but without yet knowing what
will be the ſucceſ, to have the height of this Mountain carefully
taken by skilful men. In the <hi>interim</hi> I ſhall not deny, but that
if what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and other Authors report of Mount <hi>Caucaſus</hi>
be true, there may be far higher Mountains than the Pic of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nariff;</hi>
eſpecially ſince there is one Conſideration, which perhaps
You will not think deſpicable, that I find not taken notice of by
thoſe that have written of the height of Mountains; <hi>viz.</hi> That of
two Mountains that,<note place="margin">The like Conſideration <hi>I</hi> ſince found to have been had, before me, by the learned <hi>Ricciolus.</hi>
                     </note> meaſur'd by Geometrical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
may appear to be of the ſame height, there may
yet be a Great inequality; becauſe the Meaſurer meaſures
onely from ſome plain piece of Ground at the bottom of
the Hill to the top, whereas it may be, that the Country, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
one of thoſe Mountains ſtands, may be exceedingly much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than that wherein the other is plac'd: which difference of
heights in the ſeveral Countreys, he that is to meaſure onely the
height of one of the Mountains, is not wont to take any Notice
of; and conſequently though in reſpect of the Plains, adjacent to
the feet of the Mountains, their Altitudes may be equal, yet in
reſpect of the Level or Superficies of the Terraqueous Globe,
conſider'd as having no Mountains at all but thoſe two, the height
of the one may far exceed that of the other; and ſo the Pic of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nariff</hi>
being look'd upon from the Level of the Sea, may be much
leſs high than ſome other Hils, but may appear much higher than
ſome other Hils, which yet protuberating above the level part of
ſome Country which is it ſelf generally exceeding high, may have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102306:57"/>
its top more remote from the Centre of the Earth, than that of
the Pic, and would appear higher than it, if as well the one as the
other were look'd upon from the ſame Superficies of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the height of the Atmoſphere; in order to the
making an Eſtimate of what we have conſider'd as to the height
of Mountains, I ſhall adde, that though by what has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſaid touching the height of the <hi>Pic,</hi> and other Hills, it appears,
that the Atmoſphere reaches far higher than many learned men
would hitherto allow, yet we are not to think that the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere
may not reach almoſt incomparably higher than the tops
of Mountains. Nor do I ſuffer my ſelf to be concluded by what
many Comentators of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and other Writers are wont to
teach touching the diſtinct narrow Extent they allow to that
Sphere, within whoſe Limits they would have the Steams of the
Terreſtrial Globe to produce Meteors. How far the Height of
Mountains may make the Air at the tops of them inconvenient
for Reſpiration, ſhall be (God permitting) conſider'd, when I
come to acquaint Your Lordſhip with my looſe Tryals about
Reſpiration.</p>

               <p>BY a very ſlight variation of the foregoing 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Experiment
we may both confirm one of the moſt important and the leaſt
likely Truths of the Hydroſtaticks, and remove an Objection,
which, for want of the knowledg of this Truth, is wont to be
urg'd againſt your <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> even by Learned men. For divers of
theſe, when they ſee the ſame <hi>Phaenomena</hi> happen in the <hi>Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Experiment, whether it be made in the open Air, or in a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102306:58"/>
Chamber, are forward to object, That if it were, as we ſay tis, the
weight of the Air, incumbent on the ſtagnant Mercury, which
keeps that ſuſpended in the Tube from falling down, the Mercury
would not be ſuſtain'd at any thing near the ſame height in the
open Air, where the Pillar that is ſuppos'd to lean upon the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Mercury, may reach up to the top of the Atmoſphere, as in
a cloſe room, where they imagine that no more Air can preſs upon
it, than what reaches directly up to the Roof or Sealing. And
when to this tis anſwer'd, that though if a Room were indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
clos'd, the Suſtentation of the Mercury ought to be aſcrib'd
to ſome other cauſe than the weight of the Impriſon'd Air, (which
other Cauſe I have elſewhere ſhewn to be its Spring;) yet in
ordinary Rooms there is ſtill a Communication between the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and external Air, either by the Chimney, or, if the Room
have none, by ſome Crevice in the Window, or by ſome Chink
between the Wall and the Door, or at leaſt by the Key-hole.
And when to this tis objected, that the Orifice of the Keyhole is
much narrower than the Superficies of the ſtagnant Mercury,
and conſequently, though the Atmoſphere were not reduc'd to
preſs obliquely on the Mercury, yet, entring at ſo ſmall an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice,
it could not preſs ſufficiently upon it; when, I ſay, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to this Objection I have alleadg'd that Hydroſtatical Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reme,
That the Preſſure, in ſuch caſes as ours, is to be eſtimated
by the heights of the Liquors and not the breadths, the Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
has been thought unlikely and precarious.</p>
               <p>To confirm therefore this Hydroſtatical Truth, one may take
the bended Tube, mention'd in the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Experiment; and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it till the greateſt part of the Mercury paſs from the ſhorter
Leg into the longer, the upper end of this ſhorter Leg may by
the flame of a Lamp be drawn out ſo ſlender, that the Orifice of it
ſhall not be above an 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part (not to ſay a much leſſe)
as big as 'twas before. For this being done, and the Tube ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
again, if the tall Cylinder of Mercury be of the uſual or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
height, as we have found it, 'twill appear congruous to our
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102306:58"/>
                  <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that the weight of the external Air may exerciſe as
much Preſſion upon the ſtagnant Mercury through a little hole,
as when all the upper Superficies of that Mercury was directly
expos'd to it.</p>
               <p>And if one have not the conveniency to draw out the ſhorter
Leg as is preſcrib'd, one may nevertheleſs make the Tryal, by
carefully ſtopping up the Orifice with a Cork and Cement, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
onely (or afterwards making) a very ſmall hole for the Air
to paſs in and out. If I had not wanted a fit Inſtrument, I would
have tried to exemplifie the Truth of what has been delivered, by
adding to the Glaſſes we imploy'd to make the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuch a Cover, as might be cemented on to the Edge of the

               <head type="sub">Shewing that an Oblique preſſure of the Atmoſphere may ſuffice to
keep up the Mercury at the wonted height in the Torricellian
Experiment, and that the Spring of a little included Air
may do the ſame.</head>
               <p>BY adding a couple of little Circumſtances to the Tryals lately
propos'd, we may confirm two conſiderable Articles of our
<hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> For 1. if, in ſtead of drawing the ſhorter Leg of our
Barometrical Syphon (if I may ſo call it) directly upwards, or
parallel to the longer Leg as in the foregoing Experiment, You
make the ſlender part bend off ſo, as that, if it were continued, it
would make a right Angle with the longer Leg of the Syphon,
or elſe an acute Angle tending downwards; this being done, I ſay,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102306:59"/>
if when the Tube is erected the Mercury reſt at its wonted ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
'twill appear, that the Preſſure of the Atmoſphere may be
exercis'd upon it as well obliquely, when the Pipe that conveyes
it is either Horizontal, or opens downwards.</p>
               <p>And 2. if in ſtead of bending this ſlender Pipe, one ſeal it up
Hermetically, the continuance of the Mercurial Cylinder at the
ſame height will ſhew, that the Spring of a very litle Air, ſhut
up with the Preſure of the Atmoſphere upon it, (though no
more than what the Air here below is ordinarily expos'd to by
the weight of the incumbent Air,) is able to ſupport as tall a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
of Mercury as the weight of the whole Atmoſphere, <hi>i. e.</hi> of
as much of it, as can come to exerciſe its Preſſure againſt the
Mercury.</p>
               <p>NB. If when the ſhorter Leg of the Baroſcope is ſeal'd up,
you move the Inſtrument up and down, the Mercury will vibrate,
by reaſon of the ſomewhat yielding Spring of the impriſoned
Air; but becauſe of the reſiſtance of the Spring, the motion will
be diverſified after an odde and pretty manner: which may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
perceiv'd by the Impreſſion it makes upon the Hand, but not
ſo eaſily deſcrib'd. And becauſe that, when the ſhorter Leg is
drawn out ſlender enough, after the Inſtrument is furniſh'd with
Quick-ſilver, tis eaſie to ſeal it up with the flame of a Candle,
without the help of any Inſtrument at all, I ſhall here take notice
to Your Lorſhip, (which I could not reaſonably do before,) that
it may on ſome occaſions be convenient to ſeal up the Barometer,
before it be tranſported, and, in ſome caſes, to incline the Tube
beforehand, till the Quick-ſilver have quite fill'd the longer Leg;
by this means the vibrations of the Quick-ſilver will be leſs than
otherwiſe they would be, and 'twill be no trouble at all, when
the Inſtrument is brought to the deſign'd place, to break off the
ſlender <hi>Apex</hi> of the ſhorter Leg, and ſo expoſe again the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Preſſure of the Atmoſphere.</p>
               <p>As about the former Experiments, ſo about theſe two this
Advertiſement may be given; <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſame Tryals, for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102306:59"/>
the main, may be made without confining ones ſelf to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
wayes of making them.</p>
               <p>1. For the Firſt of theſe new Tryals may be made by Cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
very carefully on to the Orifice of the ſhorter Leg (which
need not be alter'd) a ſhort Pipe of Glaſs, whoſe upper end may
be drawn out very ſlender, and bent either Horizontally or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
which is far eaſier to be done, than to draw out the ſhorter
Leg when the Glaſs is furniſh'd with Mercury.</p>
               <p>2. And as for the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Tryal, that may be well enough made,
by carefully ſtopping the unalter'd Orifice of the ſhorter Leg
with a good Cork, and our cloſe Cement, or with the later onely;
and when you would afterwards uſe this Inſtrument as a Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope,
You need but heat a Pin or ſlender Wire red hot, and ſo
burn a hole through the Stoppel.</p>
               <p>And this Expedient, which I could not conveniently advertiſe
Your Lordſhip of ſooner, may be of Uſe when a Travailing Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope
is to be often remov'd: becauſe having once ſtopt the
whole Orifice well, tis far more eaſie to ſtop and open a Pin-hole
accurately, than to cloſe and unſtop the whole Orifice of the
Tube.</p>
               <p>Note, I endeavoured to confirm more than one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Particulars by this one Experiment. Having caus'd a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Barometer to be made with the ſhorter Leg of a ſomewhat

this Leg to be drawn out very ſlender, (as in this 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;)

the ſmall Orifice of the ſlender <hi>Apex</hi> pointed towards the

ſuſpended Mercury, but not having a fit Ruler at hand, I then
deferr'd, and afterwards forgot to do it; but I remember, that
neither I, nor ſome others verſ'd in ſuch Experiments, to whom
I ſhew'd it, took any notice that the Mercury was leſs high than
in ordinary Barometers; whence 'twas concluded, that the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere

could exerciſe his Preſſure not onely at a very ſmall Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,

               <p>Having made choice of a time, when it appear'd by a good
Baroſcope, (which I had frequently conſulted for that purpoſe,)
that the Atmoſphere was conſiderably heavy, I caus'd Galſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe,
Hermetically ſeal'd at one end, and in length about 2 foot
and a half, to be fill'd with Quick-ſilver, ſave a very litle wherein
ſome drops of Water were put, that we might the better diſcern
the Bubbles, if any ſhould be left after the inverſion of the Tube
into an open Glaſs with ſtagnant Mercury in it. Having by this
means (though not without difficulty) freed the Tube from bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
we ſo order'd the matter, that the Quick-ſilver and the litle
water that was about it, fill'd the Tube exactly, without leaving
any interval that we could diſcern at the top, and yet the Mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Cylinder was but very little higher than that of our Baroſcope
was at that time.</p>
               <p>This done, the newly fill'd Pipe was left erected in a quiet
place, where the Liquors retain'd their former height for divers
dayes. But though an ordinary School-Philoſopher would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently

have attributed this ſuſtation of ſo heavy a Body to
Nature's fear of admitting a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> yet it ſeems, that either ſhe
is not alwayes equally ſubject to that fear, or ſome other cauſe of
the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> muſt be aſſign'd; for when (a pretty while after)
I had obſerv'd by the Baroſcope, that the Atmoſphere was grown
much lighter than before, repairing to my ſhort Tube, I found
that according to my expectation the Quick-ſilver was not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably

grew leſſer, according as the Atmoſphere grew heavier.</p>
               <p>NB. 1. The Tube imployed about this Experiment, may
be brought to the requiſite ſhortneſs, either by wearing off a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

produc'd till after the ſubſiding of the Quick-ſilver, whereupon
the Aerial Particles in the Water became leſs compreſs'd than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
not to mention that the Bubble (ſuch as it was) appear'd

               </p>
               <p>We ting'd ſome ſpirit of Wine with Cocheneel, which being put
into the Receiver, and the Air withdrawn, did exceedingly bubble
for a pretty while. Then little hollow Pipes of differing Sizes
being put into it, the red Liquor aſcended higher in the ſlenderer

Pipe fill'd with a compact body, whoſe Particles are thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of imbibing it.</head>
               <p>VPon occaſion of the (ſeemingly) ſpontaneous Aſcenſion of
Water in ſlender Pipes of Glaſs, I conſider'd that 'twould
be eaſie by another way to make it riſe to a far Greater height
than hitherto had been done; for ſince we had found by Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
that, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the ſlenderer the little Pipes were that
we imployed, the higher the Liquor would riſe in them; and ſince
the <hi>Hydroſtaticks</hi> had taught us, that often times even in very
crooked Pipes Water would be made to aſcend by the ſame wayes
(of raiſing it) to the ſame perpendicular height (or thereabouts)
as in ſtraight ones; I thought, that I might well ſubſtitute a
Powder, conſiſting of ſolid Corpuſcles heap'd upon one another,
and included in a Glaſs-Cane in ſtead of the litle Pipes I had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
uſed. For I conſider'd the litle intervals, that would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
be left between theſe differingly ſhap'd and confuſedly
plac'd Corpuſcles, would allow paſſage to the Water as did the
Cavities of the little Pipes, and yet would in many places be
ſtraiter than the ſlendereſt Pipes I had us'd. And though beaten
Glaſs, or fine Sand, &amp;c. might have been imployed about this
Experiment, yet I judg'd it far more convenient to make uſe of
ſome Metalline Calx, becauſe the Operation of the Fire, making
a more exquiſite Comminution of Solid bodies than our Peſtles
are wont to do, is fit to ſupply us with exceeding minute Granes,
that intercept proportionable Cavities between them.</p>
               <p>Upon this Conſideration therefore (beſides others to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
hinted) I took a ſtrait pipe of Glaſs, open at both ends, and
of a moderate wideneſs, (for it need not be very ſlender,) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
tyed a Linnen-rag to one end of it, that the Water might
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102306:62"/>
have free paſſage in, and the Powder not be able to fall out, we
carefully and as exactly as we could, fill'd the Cavity with Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
(which is Lead calcin'd, without addition, to Redneſs;) and
then having erected the Tube, ſo that the bottom of it reſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that of a ſomewhat ſhallow and open mouth'd Glaſs, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Water enough to ſwim an Inch or two above the bottom
of the Tube;<note place="margin">This was (if I forget not) about the later end of the year 1662.</note> into whoſe cavity it did, as I expected, inſinuate it
ſelf by degrees, as appear'd by a litle change of colour in that part
of the Minium which it reacht, till (the open Glaſs being from
time to time ſupplied with freſh liquor) it attain'd to the height of
about 30 inches. And then, our Society expreſſing a Curioſity to ſee
it, and have it plac'd among better things, I was hinder'd from
making any further Obſervations with that particular Glaſs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore taking afterwards another Tube, and ſome Minimum
carefully prepared, I proſecuted the Experiment ſo as to make
the Water riſe in the Pipe about 40 inches above the ſurface of
the ſtagnant Water; and I gueſs'd it had riſen higher, but, by
reaſon that at the upper part of the Minimum the difference of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
was ſo ſmall, as not to be eaſily diſtinguiſhable with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I forbore to allow a greater height to the Aſcenſion of the
Water: nor could I, where I then was, much promote the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
for want of ſuch Accommodations as I deſir'd; but about
the Experiment, as I try'd it, I ſhall take notice of the following
particulars.</p>
               <p>I tryed ſome other Powders beſides red Lead, (as beaten Glaſs,
pieces of fine Spunge, Putty, &amp;c.) but did not find any of them
do ſo well; which ſucceſs was yet perhaps but accidental, and
therefore the Tryal may be repeated, eſpecially with Putty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that being a Metalline Calx as well as Minium, conſiſts of
very ſmall Grains, and by reaſon of its Great whiteneſs receives a
Greater change of colour by wetting than Minium does; in which,
eſpecially if it be very fine, the diſcoloration that Water makes
toward the upper part of the Tube, is ſometimes not ſo eaſie to
be clearly diſcern'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:102306:62"/>
2. I did indeed endeavour to remedy this inconvenience, by
uſing, in ſtead of meer Water, tincted Liquors, as Ink, tincture
of Safron, &amp;c. but they ſeem'd not to riſe near ſo high as Water
alone, as if the diſſolv'd ingredients did by degrees choak the pores
of the Minium.</p>
               <p>3. To have the Grains of our Powder more minute and the
ſmaller intervals between them, I choſe not onely to uſe the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſort of Minium I could procure, but alſo to ſift it through a
very fine Searce, and to put it but by litle and litle into the Tube,
that by ramming it from time to time it might be made to lie the
cloſer; which Expedients ſucceeded not ill.</p>
               <p>4. It ſeem'd by a Tryal or two (for I am not ſure the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
will alwayes hold,) that if the Tube were very ſlender, (as
about the bigneſs of a Swans quill,) the Experiment ſucceeded
not well.</p>
               <p>5. It may be worth while to obſerve in what times the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
aſcends to ſuch and ſuch heights; for at the beginning twill
aſcend much faſter then afterwards, and ſometimes twill continue
riſing 24 or 30 hours, and ſometimes perhaps much longer.</p>
               <p>6. One of the ſcopes I propos'd to my ſelf in this Experiment
was to diſcover a miſtake in the Explication that ſome Learned
modern Writers have given us of the cauſe of Filtration; for
whereas they teach that the parts of Filtre that touch the Water,
being ſwell'd by the ingreſs of it to their pores, are thereby made
to lift up the Water, till it touch the ſuperiour parts of the Filtre
that are almoſt contiguous to them; by which means theſe being
alſo wetted, and ſwell'd, raiſe the Water to the other neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
parts of the Filtre, till it have reacht to the top of it, whence
its own Gravity will make it deſcend. But in our caſe we have a
Filtre made of ſolid Metalline Corpuſcles, where twill be very
hard to ſhew that any ſuch intumeſcence is produc'd, as the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Explication requires.</p>
               <p>7. Water aſcends ſo few inches even in very ſlender Pipes,
as to ſeem much to favour their Judgment, who diſſallow the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102306:63"/>
conjecture lately entertain'd by ſome ingenious men, (particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>H.</hi>) about the raiſing of the Sap in Trees after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that Water is raiſed in ſlender Pipes; but without fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
yet my thoughts of that Speculation, I may take notice,
that in the laſt Tryal above recited, I made Water to aſcend near,
if not above, 3 foot ½ and if by ſo ſleight an Expedient, Water
may be made to riſe as high as is neceſſary for the Nutrition of
ſome thouſands of Plants, (for ſuch a number there is, that exceed
not 3 foot 1/2 in height,) one may without abſurdity ask, why tis
not poſſible that Nature, or rather the moſt wiſe Author of it,
may have made ſuch Contrivances in Plants, as to make Liquors
aſcend in them to the Tops of the talleſt Trees; eſpecially ſince,
beſides divers things that we may already ſuſpect, (as Heat, and
ſomething equivalent to well plac'd Valves,) many others, that
perhaps are not yet dreamt of, may probably concur to the
Effect.</p>
               <p>8. As I formerly made, by bending the ſlender Pipes we
have been talking of, ſhort Syphons through which the Water
runs, without being at firſt aſſiſted by Suction, ſo I thought fit to
try, whether I could not in larger Pipes, by the help of Minium,
make much longer Syphons. But though when the Orifices were
turn'd upwards, fine Minium were ramm'd into both the Legs,
and the Orifices were both of them clos'd, yet when they came
to be again turn'd downwards, the weight of the Minium would
ſomewhere or other (and for the moſt part at or near the flexure)
make ſome ſuch chink or diſcontinuation, as to hinder the farther
progreſs of the Water. Which impediment, though I judg'd it
ſuperable enough, (eſpecially by making at the Flexure a little
Pipe or Socket, by which both Legs might be cloſely fill'd) yet
for want of Accommodations and leiſure it was left unſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Upon which account alſo I did not ſatisfie my ſelf about
the ſucceſs of ſome former Tryals, as of the Aſcenſion of Water
into pieces of Wood of differing ſorts, the operation of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes
of the Suns beams, and the abſence of them upon liquors
aſcending in Tubes fill'd with Minium, &amp;c.</p>

9. Whether the Preſſure of the outward Air be the cauſe of
the Aſcenſion of Liquors in our Tubes furniſht with Minium, is
a Probleme, in order to whoſe Solution I could acquaint Your
Lordſhip with a Contrivance, wherewith to make ſome Tryals
in our Engine. But ſince it can ſcarce be well deſcrib'd without

               <p>TO the ſame Cauſe (or the like) with that of the Aſcenſion of
Water in ſlender Pipes may be probably referr'd an odde
<hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> which though I remember not to have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by any Chymical or other Writer, I have not unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerved as well by chance as in Tryals purpoſely made to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
my ſelf and others about the truth of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> in ſhort, was this. That having in wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth'd
Glaſses (which ſhould not be very deep) expoſ'd to the
Air a ſtrong Solution of common Sea-ſalt or of Vitriol, which
reacht not by ſome inches to the top of the Glaſs; and having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
much of the aqueous part to exhale away very ſlowly, the
coagulated Salt would at length appear to have lin'd the inſide of
the Glaſs, and to have aſcended much higher, not onely than the
place where the ſurface of the remaining Water then reſted at,
but than the place to which the Liquor reacht when 'twas firſt
poured in. And if the Experiment were continued long enough,
I ſometimes obſerved this Aſcenſion of the Salt to amount to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102306:64"/>
ſome inches, and that the ſalt did not onely line the inſide of the
Glaſs, but, getting over the brim of it, cover'd the outſide of it
with a Saline Cruſt: which made them that ſaw how litle liquor
remain'd in the Glaſs, admire how it could poſſibly get thither.</p>
               <p>And though I have mentioned but the Solution of Vitriol and
Sea-ſalt, becauſe they are much eaſier than others to be procur'd,
and yet the Experiment ſucceeds better in Them than in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
far leſs parable Salts; yet they are not the onely ones by
whoſe Solutions the recited <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> may be Exhibited.</p>
               <p>As for the Cauſe of this odd Effect, though I ſhall not propoſe
any thing about it with Confidence, till I have further inquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and eſpecially till I have tryed whether the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi>
may be produced in an Exhauſted Receiver; yet, by what I have
hitherto obſerved, I am inclin'd to conjecture, that it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to ſuch a cauſe as that of the Aſcenſion of Liquors in Pipes
after ſome ſuch manner as this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I obſerved, that in Water and Aqueous liquors, that
part of the Surface which is next the ſides of the Glaſs, is (whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the reaſon of it be) ſenſibly more elevated than the reſt of the
Superficies; and if very litle clippings of Straw or other ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
and light bodies, floating upon the Water, chance to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
near enough to the ſides of the Glaſs, they will be apt
(which one would not expect) to run up as twere this aſcent of
Water, and reſt againſt the ſides of the Glaſs.</p>
               <p>Next we may take notice with the Salt-boylers and Chymiſts,
that Sea-ſalt is uſually wont to coagulate at the top of the Water
in ſmall and oblong Corpuſcles, ſo that as to theſe tis eaſie to
conceive, to them that have conſidered the firſt Obſervation, how
numbers of them may faſten themſelves round about to the inſide
of the Glaſs. And beſides Sea-ſalt, I have found by tryal divers
others, <hi>if their Solutions be ſlowly enough evaporated,</hi> that will,
whilſt yet there remains a good proportion of Liquor, afford Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Concretions at the top of the Water. And the faſtning of
Saline particles to the ſides of the Glaſs may perhaps be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102306:64"/>
by the Coldneſs that may be communicated to the Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles
contiguous to the Glaſs, by reaſon of the coldneſs which the
Glaſs may be ſuſpected to have, upon the ſcore of its Denſity, in
compariſon of Water. But to proceed: I conſider, that by the
Evaporation of the aqueous parts of the Solution, the ſurface of
the remaining liquor muſt neceſſarily ſubſide, and thoſe Saline
particles, that were contiguous to the inſide of the Glaſs and the
more elevated part of the Water, having no longer enough of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
to keep them diſſolv'd, will be apt to remain ſticking to the
ſides of the Glaſs, and upon the leaſt farther Evaporation of the
Water will be a litle higher than the greater part of the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of that Liquor; by which means it will come to paſs, that,
by reaſon of the litle inequalities that will be on the internal ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the adhering Corpuſcles of the Salt, and perhaps alſo on
the internal Superficies of the Glaſs, there will be intercepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Salt and the Glaſs litle Cavities, into which the Water
contiguous to the bottom will aſcend or be impell'd upon ſuch an
account as that, whereon tis rais'd in ſlender Pipes. And when
the Liquor is thus got to the top of the Salt, and comes to be
expoſed to the Air, the Saline part may, by the evaporation of the
Aqueous, be brought to coagulate there, and conſequently to
increaſe the height of the Saline filme, (if I may ſo call it;) which
by the like means may be at length brought to reach to the very
top of the Glaſs, whence it may eaſily be brought over to the
outſide of the veſſel, where the natural weight of the Solution
will facilitate its progreſs downwards; and the skin of Salt, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the contiguous ſurface of the Glaſs, may (at length)
conſtitute a kind of Syphon.</p>
               <p>To this Explication it agrees well, that I have uſually obſerved
the Saline filme hitherto mentioned to be with great eaſe ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from the Glaſs in large Fleaks; which argues, that they did
not ſtick cloſe to one another except in ſome few places, but had
a thin Cavity intercepted between them, through which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
might aſcend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:102306:65"/>
Nor is it repugnant to this Explication, that in caſe the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
aſcended, it ſhould, as it ſeems, diſſolve the Salt. For the
Liquor being already upon the point of Concretion, is ſo glutted
with Salt, that it can diſſolve no more. Whence we may alſo
render a reaſon, why, when the Saline filme chances to reach to the
outſide of the Glaſs, the Liquor (divers times) does not run
down to the bottom, but is coagulated by the way. And I have
alſo had a ſuſpicion, (though I could not ſeaſonably take notice of
it before now,) that when the Concretion is once begun, the
Film may be raiſed and propagated, not onely by the motion of
the Liquor between the inſide of it and the Glaſs, but by the ſame
Liquor's inſinuating it ſelf on the outſide of the Film into the
ſmall Chinks and Creviſes, intercepted between the Saline Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
as Ink (eſpecially if ſomewhat thin) riſes into the Slit,
and along the ſides of the Nib of a Pen, though nothing but its
very point be dipt in the ſurface of the liquor. And by this means
the impregnated Solution may as it were climb up to the top of
the ſaline Concretion, and by coagulating there adde to its
height.</p>

Weights.</head>
               <p>VVHilſt I was making the former Experiments, 'twas more
than once my wiſh, that by knowing the juſt weight of
a Cylinder of Quick-ſilver of a determinate Diameter, and of 29
or 30 inches high, which is near the height that the Air does uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
counterballance, I might the better eſtimate the weight of a
Cylinder of the Atmoſphere of that Diameter, and conſequently
make the better Gueſses how near the effects of the Spring of
the Air (as well as of its Weight,) produc'd by the help of our
Engine, approach'd to the utmoſt of what might have been expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
in caſe all the inſtruments imployed had been perfect, and
all concurrent circumſtances had been favourable: And upon
this account I ſeveral times regretted my want of a long Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Steel or hardned Iron, wherewith I many years ſince
made an Obſervation, that was more carefully regiſtred than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
of the weight of a Mercurial Cylinder of a determinate
height as well as Diameter; which weight I did not think it ſo
ſafe to determine by the help of Glaſs-Tubes, becauſe tis very
difficult to have them uniformly Cylindrical, and to know that
they are ſo, in regard that they are form'd but by blowing and
drawing out, and, beſides the inequality that may happen to the
Cavity upon other accounts, tis very difficult to make the ſides
of the Glaſs equally thick, and to examine whether they be ſo
or no.</p>
               <p>But at length lighting upon (what I had too often wanted in
the foregoing Experiments) a dexterous Artificer, that chanced
to come for a while to the place where I then was, I indeavour'd to
repair my loſs, as well as he could help me to do it, by cauſing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102306:66"/>
him to turn very carefully a Cylindrical piece of Braſs, of an inch
in Diameter, and 3 inches in length, and open (that it might be the
better wrought) at both ends, to one of which was exactly fitted
a flat bottom of the ſame Metal, faſtned very cloſe to it with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Screws on the outſide; this being judg'd a better way, than if
it had been turn'd all of a piece:</p>
               <p>This inſtrument being diligently counterpois'd in a truſty pair
of Scales, was carefully fill'd with Mercury, which (for greater
caution) we took out of a new parcel, that we had not yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
about other Experiments, and finding it to weigh XVII
Ounces, one Dram, 45 Gr: Troy weight, (or 137 dr: 45 gr:)
multiplying that by 10, there will come for the weight of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
Cylinder, of one inch in Diameter, and 30 inches in height,
(and ſo high I have divers times ſeen the Mercury to be in a good
Barometer,) about 14, <hi>2l, (i.e. 14l,</hi> 2 Ounces, and above three
drams, Troy-weight; and almoſt 11, <hi>8l.</hi> Haberdupoiſe weight,
(<hi>i.e. 11l,</hi> 12 Ounces, and above 6 Drams,) which is a greater
weight than without ſuch a Tryal one would eaſily imagine that
ſo ſhort a Cylinder of Mercury, and much leſs that a Cylinder of
ſo light a Body as Air, being neither of them above an Inch Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
could amount to.</p>
               <p>Note Firſt, to examine at the ſame time the weight of the
Mercury, and its proportion to Water, we did, before the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was pour'd into the Braſs-veſſel, fill it with Water, (after
which we wip'd it dry before the Mercury was put into it;) and
this liquor weighing 10 drams, and 15 gr: the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Mercury and the Water appeard to be that of 13 18/41 to
1: which though it ſeem ſomewhat of the leaſt, yet Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
may remember, that I formerly told You I had ſeveral times
found the receiv'd proportion of 14 to 1, between Mercury and
Water, to be ſomewhat too great; and beſides that, in a veſſel
whoſe orifice was no leſſe than an inch in Diameter, tis excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
difficult to be ſure when tis preciſely full either of Water or
Mercury; becauſe the former has a Superficies conſiderably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102306:66"/>
and the other one that is notably convex, and though we
us'd ſome litle Artifices (which would be troubleſome here to
mention) to eſtimate the proturberance of the one liquor, and the
deficience of the other, as near the truth as could be, yet I am not
ſure but there may have been a few Mercurial Corpuſcles more
than there ſhould have been, and that conſequently ſome ſmall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement
may have been made of the weight newly attributed to
the whole Mercurial Cylinder of 30 inches.</p>
               <p>2. I had thoughts of making uſe of the Barrel of a Gun, of a
convenient length, to find the weight of a Mercurial Cylinder of
2 foot and 1/2, but I preferr'd the Inſtrument already made uſe of
(eſpecially not being where I could have one bored after a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
way,) not onely becauſe I could not meet with one whoſe
Diameter was a juſt inch, and conſequently as convenient for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
and becauſe that the Barrels of Guns are often bor'd a
litle Tapering; but becauſe a skilful Artificer confeſt to me, that
they ſcarce ever bore ſuch Barrels, but with a foure-ſquare Bit, (as
they call it,) which leaves the Cavity too Angular, or too imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
round; whereas if an Hexahedrical Bit be imploy'd it will,
as he affirm'd, make the Cavity almoſt as Cylindrical as can be
reaſonably deſired. I ſay nothing here of making uſe for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of a Trunk, as they call a hollow Cylinder of Wood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I elſewhere ſhew, that Wood (at leaſt ſuch as the Trunks
to ſhoot Pellets with are wont to be made of) is not of a Texture
cloſe enough for ſuch an uſe.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe in Cylinders of Mercury, 30 inches is a height
which the Atmoſphere is ſeldome heavy enough to be able to
counterpoiſe, and becauſe 29 inches is ſomewhat nearer the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
between the greateſt and the leaſt heights, at which I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the Mercury at differing times to ſtand in good Barome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Your Lordſhip may, if You pleaſe, abate a 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of
the weight aſſign'd above to a Mercurial Cylinder of 30 inches,
(though I take 29 and ¼, or thereabouts, to be ſomewhat a more
uſual height of the Mercury, than preciſely Nine and twenty.)</p>

4. The Weight of a Mercurial Cylinder in an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi>
with the Atmoſphere, and of one inch in Diameter being thus
ſetled, we may, by the help of the doctrine of Proportions, and a
few Propoſitions, eſpecially the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> book of <hi>Eucli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
Elements, eaſily enough calculate the weight of a Cylinder of
Mercury of another Diameter, and conſequently the force of the
Preſſure of an Atmoſpherical Pillar of the ſame Diameter. For
ſince according to the forenam'd 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Propoſition of the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,
Cylinders of equal Baſes are to one another as their Heights; and
ſince by the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Propoſition of the ſame 12. Element, Circles ſuch
as are the Baſes of Cylinders) are to one another, as the Squares
of their Diameters; and ſince laſtly we ſuppoſe, that Mercury
being a Homogeneous body, at leaſt as to ſenſe, the Mercurial
Cylinders will have the ſame proportion to each other in Weight
that they have in Bulk; ſince, I ſay, theſe things are ſo, if, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
we deſire to know what will be the weight of a Cylinder
of 30 inches high, whoſe Diameter is two inches, the Rule will
be this.</p>
               <p>As the ſquare of the Diameter of the Standard Cylinder, (as I
call that whoſe weight is already known) is to the ſquare of the
Diameter of the Cylinder propos'd, ſo will the bulk of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Cylinder be to that of the later, and the weight of that to the
weight of this.</p>
               <p>According to which Rule, the ſquare of 1 inch (which is the
Diameter of the ſtandard Cylinder) being but 1, (whereby Your
Lordſhip may perceive how much the meaſure I pitcht on facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
Computations,) and the ſquare of 2 (which is the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the propos'd Cylinder) being 4, the bulk or ſolid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of this later Cylinder, and conſequently its Weight, will be
4 times as great as thoſe of the ſtandard Cylinder; and ſo, ſince
the leſſer has been already ſuppos'd to weigh 11, <hi>8l</hi> Haberdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe,
the Mercurial Cylinder of two inches in Diameter, will
weigh 47, <hi>2l</hi> of the ſame weight.</p>

               <head type="sub">About the Attractive virtue of the Loadſtone in an Exhauſted

               <p>SOme Learned modern Philoſophers, that have attempted to
explicate the cauſe and manner of Magnetical Attraction or
Coition, give ſuch an account of it, as ſuppoſes, that the Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Magnetical Bodies, being driven away by their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums

to thoſe where the Contact is to be made; and upon ſome ſuch
ſcore (for I muſt not now ſtay to deliver their Theories Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially)
the Air is ſuppos'd to contribute very much to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
and Suſtentation of the Iron by the Loadſtone: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
partly to examine this Opinion, and partly for ſome other
Purpoſes (not neceſſary now to be mentioned) we thought fit to
make the following Exptriment.</p>
               <p>We took a ſmall but vigorous Loadſtone, cap'd and fitted with
a looſe plate of Steel, ſo ſhap'd, that when it was ſuſtained by the
Loadſtone, we could hang at a litle Crook, that came out of the
midſt of it, and pointed downwards, a Scale, wherein to put what
Weights we ſhould think fit. Into this Scale we put ſometimes
more and ſometimes leſs weight, and then by ſhaking of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
as much as we gueſs'd it would be ſhaken by the motion of
the Engine, we found the greateſt weight, that we preſum'd it
would be able to ſupport, in ſpite of the Agitation 'twould be
expoſed to, which prov'd to be, beſides the Iron-plate and the
Scale, VI Ounces Troy weight, to which if we added half an ounce
more, the whole weight appear'd too eaſie to be ſhaken off. This
done, we hung the Loadſtone, with all the weight it ſuſtain'd, at
a Button of Glaſs, which we had procur'd to be faſtned on to the
top of the inſide of a Receiver, when 'twas firſt blown, and though
in about 12 Exuctions we uſually emptied ſuch Receivers as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102306:68"/>
as much as was requiſite for moſt Experiments; yet this time, to
exhauſt it the more accurately, we continued pumping till we had
exceeded twice that number of Exuctions, at the end of which
time ſhaking the Engine ſomewhat rudely, without thereby ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
off the Weight that hung at the Loaſtone, the Iron ſeem'd
to be very near as firmly ſuſtain'd by it as before the Air began
to be pump'd out. I ſaid very <hi>near,</hi> rather than altogether, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that the withdrawing of the Air, though it be not ſuppos'd
to weaken at all the Power of the Loadſtone preciſely conſidered,
yet it muſt leſſen its power to ſuſtain the Steel, becauſe this in ſo
thin a <hi>medium</hi> muſt weigh heavier, than in the Air, by the weight
of as much Air, as is equal in bulk to the appended Body.</p>

                  <p>We took a Syringe of Braſs, (that Metal being cloſer and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

being in length (in the Barrel) about 6 inches, and in Diameter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

(or Barrel,) brought the inſtrument to be ſtanch enough, and
yet the Sucker to move to and fro without much difficulty, we
thruſt this to the bottom (or Baſis) of the Barrel to exclude the
Air, and having unſcrew'd and laid aſide the ſlender Pipe of the
Syringe (which in this and ſome other Tryals was like to prove
not onely needleſs, but inconvenient) we carefully ſtopt the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
to which the Pipe in theſe inſtruments is wont to be ſcrew'd,
and then drawing up the Sucker we let it go, to judg by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
with which it would be driven back again, whether the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
were light enough for our purpoſe, and finding it to be ſo,
we faſtned to the Barrel a ponderous piece of Iron to keep it
down, and then faſtning to the handle of the Rammer (or Axle-tree
of the Sucker) one end of a String, whoſe other end was tied
to the often mentioned turning-key: We convey'd this Syringe,
and the weight belonging unto it, into a Receiver; and having
pump'd out the Air, we then began to turn the Key, thereby to
ſhorten the String that tied the handle of the Syringe to it; and, as
we foretold, that the Preſſure of the Air, lately included in the
Receiver, being withdrawn, we ſhould no more find the wonted
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102306:69"/>
reſiſtance in drawing up the Sucker from the bottom of the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder,
ſo we found upon Tryal that we could very eaſily pull it
up without finding any ſenſible reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>However having thought fit to repeat the Experiment, (which
we did with the like ſucceſs,) leſt it might might be objected,
that this want of reſiſtance might proceed, as partly from our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
the Turning-key to raiſe the Sucker, ſo principally from
ſome unperceived Leak, at which the Air may be ſuppos'd to
have got into the cavity of the Cylinder; I thought fit <hi>not onely</hi>
to examine by Tryal, after the Receiver was remov'd from off
the Pump, whether the Syringe were not ſtanch, (upon which I
found that I could not, without ſome ſtraining, draw up the Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
even a litle way, and that it would be violently beaten back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,)
<hi>but alſo</hi> in one of theſe Experiments to make this variation;
That when, the Receiver being exhauſted, we had drawn up the
Sucker almoſt to the top of the Barrel by ſuch a ſtring as was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
choſen ſomewhat weak, we kept the parts of the Syring in
that poſture, till we had open'd a paſſage to the outward Air, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whoſe ingreſs the Sucker was (as we intended it ſhould be) ſo
forceably depreſt, that it broke the String by which it was tied to
the Turning-key, and was violently driven back to the lower part
of the Barrel, &amp; that notwithſtanding theſe two diſadvantageous
Circumſtances; <hi>one,</hi> that the ſtring was not ſo weak, but that one,
whom I imploy'd to try it before it was faſtned to the Syringe,
made it ſuſtain a lump of Iron that weighed between four and five
pound; and the <hi>other,</hi> that yet this ſtring was broken long before
all the Air, that flowed in to fill the Receiver, had got in: ſo that
the preſſure of all the admitted Air would doubtleſs have broken
a much ſtronger ſtring, if we had imploy'd ſuch a one to reſiſt

                  <p>We took the Syringe imploy'd in the foregoing Experiments,
and having found by Tryal that it was, though not perfectly, tite,
(nor altogether ſo much ſo as before,) yet enough ſo for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
purpoſe, (ſince, when the Orifice of the vent in the Baſis was
ſtopt, if the Sucker were more forceably drawn up a litle way, and
then let go, it would haſtily return, or rather violently be impell'd
back towards the bottom of the Barrel,) we made it ſerve us as
well as we could for the following Experiment. Of this Syringe
we did very carefully with a Cork and our Cement cloſe the vent;
and then having tied to the barrel of the Syring a Weight that
hapned to be at hand, (and to amount to 2 Pound, and as many
Ounces,) we ſuſpended the Rammer of the Syringe by a ſtring in
a large Receiver; and then cauſing the Pump to be applied, we
made 11 or 12 Exuctions of the Air, without any appearance of
change in the Syringe: but becauſe I had judg'd the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Weight ſufficient, and ſuppos'd that the little Air ſtill
remaining in the Receiver, had yet too ſtrong a Preſſure to be
ſurmounted by it, I caus'd the Pumping to be continued, and
within 2 or three Exuctions more I perceiv'd the Cylinder to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to be drawn down (though but very ſlowly) by the Weight
hanging at it, (aſſiſted by its own Gravity:) and likewiſe tried (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having purpoſely ſtopt a while the working of the Pump)
that juſt upon a freſh Suck the deſcent would be manifeſtly acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated.
And when we had ſuffer'd the Barrel and Weight to
ſlide down as far as we thought fit, we let in the External Air,
which (as was to be expected) rais'd them both again much faſter
than they had ſubſided.</p>
                  <p>NB. There would not have needed any thing near ſo great a
Weight to depreſs the Barrel of the Syringe, but that it is difficult
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102306:70"/>
in ſuch an inſtrument to make the Sucker fill it accurately enough,
without making it ſomewhat uneaſie to be mov'd to and fro:
Upon which account twas neceſſary that a Weight ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
not onely to ſurmount the Preſſure of the Air remaining in
the Receiver, (which was not, nor needed to be diligently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
in this Experiment,) but to overcome that reſiſtance,
which we juſt now noted the inequalities of the inſide of the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
and thoſe of the Sucker to give to the motion of the one in
or over the other. And yet for all this tis not eaſie, though it
be not impoſſible, to make one of theſe Syringes very Tight, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
when the Noſe is well ſtopt, and the Sucker drawn up;
there being often ſome litle Air that ſtrains in between the Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and the Barrel, and ſome that will be harbour'd between the
Sucker (though thruſt home) and the bottom of the Barrel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what may lurk between the ſame Sucker and the Cork that
ſtops the orifice of the Vent. Nor were we confident, that our
Syringe did not at length let ſome Aerial particles inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the Cavity, which the depreſſion of the Barrel had
made betwixt the Baſes of that Barrel and the Sucker: and in ſuch
caſes we ought not to wonder, if upon the return of the Air the
Barrel and Weight be not impell'd up all together to the ſame
height they reſted at, when they were firſt ſuſpended in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</p>
                  <p>2. It agreed very well with our Doctrine, that as the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Weight began not to fall, till a great quantity of Air had
been pump'd out of the Receiver, ſo they did not begin to move
upwards preſently upon the freedom that was allow'd the Air to
return into the Receiver. For till it had continued a pretty while
flowing in, there was not enough of it entred to reſtore by its
preſſure the Cylinder and the annexed Weight to their former
ſituation.</p>
                  <p>3. What has been deliver'd about our Experiment may be
confirm'd by this Variation which we made of it: That having

whether, when the Sucker was forceably drawn up, and held ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
in its higheſt ſtation, the Weight tyed to the Barrel (which
was held down, whilſt the Sucker was drawn up, and afterwards
let go) would be conſiderably rais'd. And when we perceiv'd,
that the addition of half a Pound, or a Pound more, would make
the Weight too Great to be ſo rais'd, we forbore to put in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of weight; and having tied the Handle of the Rammer to
the Turning-key, we convey'd the Syringe together with its clog
into a Receiver, out of which a convenient quantity of Air being
pump'd, we were thereby enabled eaſily to draw up the Sucker
without the Cylinder; after which having let in the Air, the by-ſtanders
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102306:71"/>
concluded, that the weight was rais'd a litle, which yet
I would not have allow'd, if we had not been able, by inclining
the Engine and the Receiver, to make the Syringe and Weight a
litle to ſwing. But to make the effect more evident, I caus'd a
two pound weight to be taken out, and then the Receiver being
ſomewhat exhauſted, and the Air readmitted, the Clog, when all
the Air was come in, was ſwiftly raiſed, and as it were ſnatch'd up
from the midle to the upper part of the ſuſpended Rammer.</p>
               <p>It is no eaſie matter to meaſure, with any certainty and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
by a Syringe, the weight of an Atmoſpherical Pillar equal to
it in Diameter, eſpecially if there be any imperfection in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe,
either becauſe the Sucker does not go cloſe enough, in
which caſe it can ſcarce be ſtanch, or becauſe by its Preſſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the inſide of the Barrel (which often happens if it be too
cloſe) it hinders the Sucker and Barrel from ſliding without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
by one another, and conſequently there is an undue reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
made to the endeavour of the Atmoſphere, to raiſe the
Barrel and Weight. And therefore, though our Syringe being,
upon the account of ſome ill accident, leſs in order than it was in
ſome of the foregoing Experiments, I muſt not conclude that a
Cylinder of the Atmoſphere of the ſame wideneſs with it, is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent
to no greater a weight, than that which was taken up in our
Trial, yet we may ſafely conclude that ſo ſlender a Pillar of the
Atmoſphere is able to raiſe by a Syringe at leaſt ſuch a Weight, as
in our Experiment it actually lifted up, which amounted to about
ſixteen pound (Haberdupoiſe weight,) for it exceeded fifteen
pound and three quarters, beſides the weight of the Syringes bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
it ſelf.</p>

               <p>If I had been furniſh'd with very tall Receivers, and ſuch other

                  <head>The I. Tryal.</head>
                  <p>We took a ſmall Receiver, ſhap'd almoſt like a Pear, cut off
Horizontally at both ends, (being the ſame cap'd Glaſs that is
elſewhere mentioned in the accounts of other Experiments:)<note place="margin">See the fig. of the plate</note> we
alſo took the Syringe formerly deſcrib'd, and having faſtned on to
it with good Cement, in ſtead of its own Braſs-pipe, a ſmall Glaſs
pipe of about half a foot in length, we put this Syringe in at the
narrow end of the Receiver; to whoſe Orifice was (afterwards)
carefully cemented on the Braſs-cap with the Turning-key,
whereto was tied by a ſtring the handle of the Rammer. Then
having conveniently plac'd upon the Engine a very ſhort thick
Glaſs ſhap'd like a Sugar-loaf, (which was made uſe of for want
of a better,) with a ſufficient Quantity of Quick-ſilver in it; we
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102306:72"/>
ſo placed the Receiver over it, that the lower end of the Pipe of
the Syringe reacht almoſt to the bottom of this Glaſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
was immerſt a pretty way beneath the ſurface of the
Quick ſilver. We had alſo poured a little Water in the upper
part of the Syringe, that no Air might get in between the Sucker
and the Cylinder, notwithſtanding that by ſome Accident or other
the Syringe was become ſomewhat leſs Tite than before. And
laſt of all we cemented the Receiver to the Engine after the uſual
manner.</p>
                  <p>That which now remained, being to try the Experiment it ſelf,
in order to which all this had been done, the Air was pump'd out
of the Receiver, (and conſequently out of the little Glaſs that held
the Mercury,) and then the Sucker being warily drawn up, we
could not ſee the Quick-ſilver aſcend to follow it, though a litle
Water, which it ſeems the outward Air had thruſt in between the
Sucker and the Cylinder, was either rais'd or ſtopt in the Glaſs-pipe
of the Syringe, (whereof yet much the greateſt part remain'd
unfill'd;) of which the reaſon according to our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
namely, that the Air being pump'd out of the Receiver,
the litle that remain'd had not ſtrength enough to preſs up ſo
ponderous a Liquor as the Quick-ſilver into the Pipe, (though
even that litle unexhauſted Air might have Spring enough left to
raiſe a litle water.) And ſince it appear'd by this, that <hi>without</hi>
the Preſſure of the Air the Quick-ſilver would not be elevated,
we thought it ſeaſonable to ſhew, that <hi>by</hi> the Preſſure of the Air
it would. Whereupon the Air being let ſlowly into the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the Mercury was quickly impell'd up at leaſt to the top of
the Glaſs-pipe, (though by reaſon of ſome unperceiv'd leak it was
not long ſuſtain'd there.)</p>
                  <p>And for further ſatisfaction, when the Experiment was to be
tried over again, we order'd it to be ſo made, that it might plainly
be obſerved, that though when, the Receiver not being yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
the Sucker was drawn up but one inch, the Mercury
would be rais'd to the upper part of the Glaſs-pipe of the Syringe,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102306:72"/>
yet after the exhauſting of the Receiver, though the Sucker was
drawn up twice as high, there appear'd no aſcenſion of the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the Pipe, (whoſe lower part onely was darkned by the litle
Glaſs which contain'd that fluid Metal.)</p>
                  <p>Before I diſmiſs this Experiment, I muſt, to make good a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
I made Your Lordſhip, acquaint You with a <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi>
which does not a litle confirm our Doctrine, according to which
it was eaſie both to foreſee and to explain it: The <hi>phaenomenon</hi>
was, That if when the Air was diligently pump'd out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
the Sucker were endeavour'd to be pull'd up, it could not
be ſo, without much difficulty and reſiſtance, ſuch as was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found when the Vent of the Syringe was ſtopt, of which in our
<hi>Hypotheſis</hi> the reaſon may be clearly this; That there being no
common Air in the Receiver to aſſiſt by its Preſſure (whether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
or mediate) the raiſing of the Sucker, this could not be
raiſed but by a force great enough to ſurmount the Weight of
the external Air or Atmoſpherical Pillar that lean'd upon it. So
that as the other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of our Experiments manifeſt, that
the raiſing of Liquors by a Syringe, which is commonly aſcrib'd
to Attraction, depends upon the Preſſure of the Air; ſo by this
<hi>Phaenomenon</hi> it appears, that the difficulty of opening a Syringe,
whoſe Pipe is ſtopt, need not be attributed to ſuch a <hi>fuga vacui</hi> as
vulgar Philoſophers refer it to; ſince in our caſe the ſame difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was found, though the Pipe were open, and the Liquor 'twas
immerſt in, might have had free acceſs to the place deſerted by
the Sucker.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Being a Proſecution of the former Attempt.</head>
                  <p>To vary as well as confirm the foregoing Experiment, we
caus'd the Syringe to be tied faſt to a competently ponderous
Body that might keep the Cylinder unmov'd, when the Sucker
ſhould be drawn up. We alſo cemented on to the vent or ſcrew
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102306:73"/>
at the bottom of the Syringe a Pipe of glaſs of about two inches in
length, (which ſhould have been longer, but that then there
would not have been room in the Receiver for the pulling up of
the Sucker,) and having plac'd the heavy Body whereto the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
was tied upon a Pedeſtal of a convenient height, that the
Glaſs-pipe might be all ſeen beneath it, and a very low Viol al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
fill'd with Quick-ſilver might be ſo plac'd underneath the
Pipe, that the ſtagnant Mercury reach'd a good way above the
immerſt orifice of the ſaid Pipe. Theſe things being thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
and the Handle of the Syringes Rammer being tied with
a ſtring to the Turning-key that belong'd to the Braſs-cover of
the Receiver, this veſſel was cemented on to the Engine, and by
it Exhauſted after the uſual manner.</p>
                  <p>When this was done, we look'd upon the Syringes Glaſs-pipe
above mentioned, and being able to ſee through it, (whereby we
were certain that it was not yet full of Quick-ſilver) we did by
the ſtring draw up the Sucker to a good height, but could not
perceive the Pipe to be fill'd with any ſucceeding Mercury.
Wherefore warily letting in ſome Air, we quickly ſaw the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
impell'd to the very top of the Pipe; and we concluded from
the quantity of Quick-ſilver that was rais'd, that a pretty deal was
alſo driven into the cavity of the Cylinder.</p>
                  <p>NB. I had once before ſeen the Mercury aſcend into the
Pipe upon the letting in of the Air into the emptied Receiver, but
it ſeeming ſomewhat difficult to me to determine whether the
Sucker had been raiſed, becauſe there was no mark to guide my
Aeſtimate by, I thought it might be ſuſpected, that in caſe the
Sucker had not been rais'd, the Aſcenſion of the Quick-ſilver
might have proceeded from hence, That the Air contain'd in the
Glaſs-pipe, breaking out through the ſtagnant Mercury upon the
Exhauſting of the Receiver, the Quick-ſilver might upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the Air into the Receiver be preſt up into the place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
by the Air, that broke out of the Pipe. Wherefore we
caus'd a ſtring to be tied about the Rammer, as near as we could to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102306:73"/>
the top of the Cylinder, by which means, when the Receiver was
the next time exhauſted, we perceiv'd, that by drawing up the
Sucker vve had rais'd it about two inches, if not more, and yet
vve could not diſcern any Mercury to follow it, (the Glaſs-pipe
ſtill continuing tranſparent,) till we had let ſome Air return into
the Receiver.</p>
                  <p>This Experiment joyn'd with thoſe we have formerly related
to have been tried with our Syringe, may teach us, that if a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
were made uſe of above the Atmoſphere, neither the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of the Pipe vvould hinder the eaſy drawing up of the Sucker,
nor the drawing up of the Sucker, though the Pipe vvere not
ſtopt, vvould raiſe by ſuction the Liquor vvhich the Pipe was
immerſt in.</p>

                  <p>Having then caus'd ſuch a Glaſs-pipe, as has been lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,

the Pipe ſhould be fill'd with ſpirit of Wine tincted with Coche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neel,
that the liquor and its motions might be the better diſcern'd,
and that the Pipe being fill'd, that Air might be excluded, which
vvould elſe be harboured in the Pipe, (which Caution was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the foregoing Experiment.) And this the Perſon, to whom
I committed it, affirm'd to have been carefully done, though when
he inverted the Pipe thus fill'd into the reſt of the red Liquor,
that was put into a Viol, he could not poſſibly do it ſo well, but
that a bubble of Air got into the Pipe, and took up ſome (though
but a litle) room there. By that time, I was call'd upon, to ſee

was almoſt quite exhauſted; vvherefore after I had made

Tis alſo known, that this Experiment is wont to be urg'd by
the Schools as a clear proof of that abhorrence of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> they
aſcribe to Nature; for, ſay they, the reaſon of this <hi>phaenomenon</hi>
is plainly, that the internal Air of the Cupping Glaſs, praeterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
rarified by heat when the Inſtrument is applied, That heat
after a while ceaſing, the ſucceeding Cold muſt again neceſſarily
condenſe the Air; and ſo this contracted Air being no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

a <hi>vacuum,</hi> if the fleſh covered by the Cupping Glaſs, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning

               <p>Thoſe Moderns that aſſert the Weight of the Atmoſphere, do
thence ingeniouſly endeavour to deduce the <hi>phaenomenon.</hi> And
indeed if to their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> about the Airs Weight, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of its Spring be added, 'twill be eaſie enough to explicate
the <hi>phaenomenon,</hi> by ſaying, That when the Cupping Glaſs is firſt
ſet on, though much of the Air it formerly contain'd were a litle
before expell'd by the heat, yet the ſame heat, increaſing the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the remaining Air, is the cauſe that the abſence of the
Air driven out of the Glaſs, does not immediately occaſion ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
a pain: but, when that adventitious agitation of the included
Air ceaſes, that Air having now, becauſe of the paucity of its Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
but a weak Spring, can no longer preſs upon the part co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the Cupping Glaſs neer ſo ſtrongly, as the outward
Air does by its Weight preſs upon all the neighbouring parts of
the fleſh: by which means (according to what we have more than
once explicated already) ſome of the yielding fleſh (or other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
covered by the skin) muſt be forceably thruſt into the cavity
of the Cupping Glaſs, where there is leſs Preſſure, then at the
outſide of it. And the fibres and membranous parts being thus
violently ſtretcht, there muſt needs follow a ſenſible Pain as well
as Tumour. Which Tumour yet does not fill up the Cupping
Glaſs, not onely becauſe of the reſiſtance of the skin to be ſo far
diſtended, but alſo, if the included Air have not been much rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102306:75"/>
becauſe of the Spring of the impriſoned Air, (which grows
ſo much the ſtronger, by how much the ſwelling fleſh reduces the
Air into leſs room,) as I have ſometimes tried, by applying a
Cupping Glaſs to Quick-ſilver, or even to Water, which will
riſe in it but to a certain height.</p>
               <p>But though by this, or ſome ſuch Explication, the Argument

to propoſe ſome new Experiment, to illuſtrate our <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis;</hi>
and though it ſeem'd to be far more difficult to do it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Cupping Glaſſes, than to other ſubjects, yet I pitcht
upon two different wayes of Experimenting; whoſe ſucceſs not
diſappointing me, I ſhall now give Your Lordſhip an account of
them,</p>
               <p>We took a Glaſs of about one Inch and a half in Diameter,
but a good deal longer, than an ordinarily ſhap'd Cupping Glaſs
of that breadth would have been, that there might be the more
room for the flame to burn in it, and rarifie the Air. We alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
a Receiver ſhap'd almoſt like a Pear, this Receiver was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
at both ends; at the ſharper whereof there was but a ſmall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice,
but at the obtuſe end there roſe up a ſhort neck, whoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice
was wide enough to admit with eaſe the newly mentioned
Cupping Glaſs without touching the ſides of it, and we were not
willing it ſhould be much larger, leſt it ſhould not be ſo exactly
cover'd by the Palm of the hand that ſhould be laid upon it, and
leſt alſo the hand ſhould be broken or hurt by the too great
weight of the Atmoſphere, when the included Air ſhould be
withdrawn from under it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus prepared, and the ſmaller Orifice of
the Receiver being faſtned with Cement to the Engine, I cauſed
the Cupping Glaſs to be faſtned, with the mouth upwards, to the
Palm of the hand of a Youth, (whom your Lordſhip may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to have ſeen with me,) whoſe hand ſeem'd fram'd by Nature
for this Experiment, being broad, ſtrong, and very plump. And
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102306:75"/>
having pull'd the Glaſs, to try whether it ſtuck well on, I caus'd
him to put it into the Receiver, and lay his hand ſo upon the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice
lately mentioned, that it might ſerve for a Cover to it, and
hinder any Air from getting in between them.</p>
               <p>That which we pretended was, that the Receiver being but
ſmall, (that it might be quickly exhauſted, and ſo not put the
Youth to a long pain,) upon an Exuction or two made with the
Pump, of the Air about the Cupping Glaſs, the remaining Air
ſhould have its Preſſure ſo far weakned, as not to be able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Cupping Glaſs; eſpecially ſince if the Air without the
Cupping Glaſs (but yet in the Receiver) ſhould be more rarified
by the removal of that which had been pump'd out, than the Air
included in the Cupping Glaſs was by the precedent Heat; this
laſt mentioned Air having a ſtronger Spring (or tendency to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand
it ſelf) than the External Air of the Receiver, the Glaſs
muſt needs fall down, or rather be thruſt off, though, in caſe there
had been no Air at all left in the Cavity of the Cupping Glaſs,
the Air in the Receiver would by its Preſſure ſuſtain a far
Greater weight.</p>
               <p>The Event of our Trial agreed very well with our conjecture.
For upon the firſt Suck the Cupping Glaſs fell off, the weight of
the Atmoſphere preſſing ſo hard upon the Young mans hand,
that, though he be more than ordinary ſtrong, he complain'd he
could very hardly take it off the Glaſs it was almoſt thruſt into,
and, a while after, that his hand was very ſore. But this laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
became not ſo quickly very ſenſible, but that we had
time to repeat our Experiment, by faſtning the Cupping Glaſs
more ſtrongly than before; ſo that he complain'd that it drew in
his hand very forceably, and though that part be not wont to be
fleſhy, yet the Tumour occaſioned by the Cupping Glaſs was
manifeſt enough to the eye: but as before, ſo now, at the very
firſt turning of the Stop-cock, (to let out the Air of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,)
the Cupping Glaſs fell off.</p>

it, to receive the neck of the Bladder, we ſo plac'd the cover'd
Hoop upon this piece of Wood, that the upper part of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
lay parallel to the Horizon. This done, we ſuſpended, at the
Turning-key belonging to the Cap of our Receiver, a blind head
(as Chymiſts call it) of Glaſs, which for want of a true Cupping
Glaſs we were fain to ſubſtitute, and which indeed was not very
unlike one either for ſhape or ſize; and to the upper part of this
Glaſs we faſtned a large Ring of Metal, the better to depreſs it,
and make it lean ſtrongly on the Bladder.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus made ready, and the Receiver cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on to the Engine, we did by help of the Turning-key let
down the Cupping Glaſs, (for ſo we ſhall hereafter call it,) till it
came almoſt to touch the level Superficies of the Bladder; and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102306:76"/>
when the Receiver was as far exhauſted as we thought fit, (but not
near as far as it might have been,) we let down the Cupping Glaſs
a litle lower, ſo that it lean'd upon the Bladder, and touch'd it with
all the parts of its orifice: ſo that the Cupping Glaſs with the
ſubjacent Bladder was become an internal Receiver (if I may ſo
call it,) whoſe Air was conſiderably expanded, and conſequently
weakned as to its Spring. All this being done, we warily let the
Air into the Receiver, and thereby the Air, that did ſurround
the Cupping Glaſs, (which we juſt now called the Internal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,)
having now a ſtronger Preſſure than the Air in the Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Glaſs could reſiſt; the Bladder, on which the Cupping
Glaſs reſted, was as we look'd for, thruſt up a pretty way into
the cavity of the Glaſs, in which it made a conſpicuous Tumor;
and was made to ſtick ſo cloſe to the orifice of it, that one would
have thought that the Bladder had been violently drawn in, as
the skin is wont to be in the ordinary applications of Cupping
Glaſſes.</p>
               <p>And becauſe we took notice, that though this Glaſs were not
capacious, (for it ſcarce held a Pint of Water,) yet the orifice of it
was not very narrow, (being in Diameter an inch and ⅘,) we
thought fit in repeating the Experiment to adde ſomething that
ſeem'd odd enough, and was fit to manifeſt that Cupping Glaſſes
may, without heat, by the bare Preſſure of the external Air, be
more ſtrongly faſtned, than for ought we know they are by the
help of flame. Having then reiterated the former Experiment
with this onely variation, that we exhauſted the Receiver further
than before, we took out the Cupping Glaſs and the Bladder,
which together with the included Braſs-hoop was hanging at it;
and then having tied the Glaſs to the Hook of a good <hi>Statera,</hi> and
tied a large Scale to the neck of the Bladder, we put in by degrees
Weights into the Scale, till we had loaded it enough to force off
the Bladder from the Glaſs; which hapned not till the whole
Weight, that tended to draw down the Bladder, amounted to 35
Pound (if not better,) of ſixteen ounces in the pound. Nor did
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102306:77"/>
we doubt, but that the Preſſure of the Atmoſphere would in our
Experiment have kept up a much greater Weight, if we had,
before we let in the outward Air, diligently exhauſted the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
which we had purpoſely forborn to do, for fear the too diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate
Preſſure of the external Air ſhould break the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
which puts me in mind of adding, upon the by, That as more
Weight was put into the Scale, the Bladder (ſtretcht more and
more by the Weight on one ſide, and the Air on the other,) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to ſwell higher in the cavity of the Glaſs.</p>

               <p>IT is wont by the Peripateticks and others to be made a great
argument for the <hi>fuga vacui</hi> which they attribute to Nature,
That if the Noſe of a pair of Bellows be well ſtopt, one cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
them by raiſing the upper board from the lower. But of this
another reaſon may be eaſily aſſigned, without determining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be a <hi>vacuum</hi> or no, namely the Weight and Preſſure of
the Air: for when the Noſe of a pair of Bellows, that are Tite e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
is well ſtopt, no Air being able to inſinuate it ſelf upon
the diſjoining of the boards into the Cavity made by that disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
This cannot be effected, but by ſuch a force as is <hi>almoſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(I ſay <hi>almoſt,</hi> becauſe ordinary Bellows cannot be ſo well ſhut,
but that there will remain ſome Air in them, whoſe Spring will
facilitate the opening of them) to raiſe an Atmoſphere Pillar,
whoſe <hi>Baſis</hi> ſhall be the upper board, vvhich is commonly ſo
large, that a leſs force may ſerve to break common Bellows, then
to raiſe ſo great a Weight: but if they vvere made ſtrong enough,
and there vvere applied a ſufficient force to lift ſo Great a vveight
as the newly mentioned Pillar of the Atmoſphere, the ſides might
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102306:77"/>
be disjoyn'd, how cloſe and ſtanch ſoever the Inſtrument vvere
made.</p>
               <p>Thus far one may argue upon the bare principle of the weight
of the Air, but taking in the Spring of it too, I thought one
might proceed ſo much further, that I ventur'd to foretell divers
ingenious men, that if the Preſſure of the ambient Air were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off, not onely it would be eaſie to open the Bellows in ſpite
of their being carefully ſtopt at the noſe, but that they would fly
open as it were of their own accord, without the application of
any external force at all. And 'twas partly to juſtifie this predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as well as to make a Trial, I thought more conſiderable,
that we made the following Experiment.</p>
               <p>We caus'd (then) to be made a pair of Bellows, differing from
ordinary ones in theſe particulars. Firſt, that the Boards were
circular, (and ſo without handles,) and of about 6 inches in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter:
2. That there was no Clack or Valve: 3. That the noſe
was but an inch long, or leſs, (being to be lengthned if occaſion
required vvith a Pipe:) 4. That the Leather (which vvas not
ſpar'd, that the inſtrument might be the more capacious) was
not horny or very ſtiff, but limber. The Reaſon of the firſt and
third diverſity was, that the Bellows might be capable to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
into our Receiver; (for vvhich purpoſe alſo, if there had
appear'd need, the noſe might have been made in the uppermoſt
of the two Boards:) the reaſon of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> variation was, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
might be the more ſtanch: and of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, that the <hi>baſes</hi>
of the Bellows might (as in Organ-bellows) be clapt cloſer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and harbour leſs Air in the wrinkles and cavity. So that
when the Bellows vvere opened to their full extent, by drawing
up the upper Baſis at a button purpoſely made in the midſt of it,
the Bellows look'd like a Cylinder of 16 or 18 inches high; upon
which reſemblance I take the liberty to call both the Boards (as
Geometricians do both the circular parts of a Cylinder) Baſes.</p>
               <p>But though theſe were made by an Artificer, otherwiſe dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
yet it not being his Trade to make Bellows, nor any other
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102306:78"/>
mans in the Town I then was in, he could not make them ſo
Tite, but that in ſpite of our oyling the Leather, and choaking
the Seams with good Cement, there was ſome litle and unpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
hole or cranny, whereby ſome Air had paſſage when the noſe
was accurately ſtopt: but this was not ſo conſiderable, but that
if we drew up the upper Baſis from the lower, the external Air
would on all ſides preſs the Leather inwards, and ſo make the
ſhape of the inſtrument very far from being ſo Cylindrical, as it
would be if the noſe were left open.</p>
               <p>Wherefore concluding, that notwithſtanding this imperfection
the Bellows would ſerve, though not for both the Experiments
I deſign'd, yet for one of them, we carefully ſtopt the noſe, after
we had approach'd the Baſes to one another, and conveying
them into a large Receiver, it quickly appear'd, when the Pump
was ſet on work, that at every Exſuction of the incumbent Air,
the Air harbour'd in the folds of the Leather, and the reſt of the
litle Cavitie that could not but be left between the Baſes, made
the upper of thoſe Baſes manifeſtly riſe, though its weight (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the thickneſs and ſolidity of the Wood) would ſoon after
depreſs it again, either by driving out ſome of the Air at ſome
place where the inſtrument was not ſufficiently Tite, or by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it as it were ſtrain'd through the Leather it ſelf; and if the
Pump were agitated ſomewhat faſter than ordinary, the Expanſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the internal Air would be greater than could be rendred
quite ineffectual by ſo ſmall a Leak, and the upper part of the
Bellows would be ſoon raiſ'd to a conſiderable height, as would
appear more evidently if we haſtily let in the external Air, upon
whoſe ingreſs the Baſes would be clapt together, and the upper
of them a good vvay depreſt. So that the imperfection of the
Bellows made the Experiment rather more than leſs concluding;
for ſince there was no external force applied to open them, if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that ſome of the included Air could get out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
yet the Spring of the internal Air was ſtrong enough to open the
Bellows when the ambient Air was withdrawn, much more

would the effect have been produc'd, if the Bellows had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly

(made of a Bladder) in the exhausted Receiver.</head>
               <p>I Will not now diſcuſs the Controverſie betwixt ſome of the
Modern Atomiſts, and the <hi>Carteſians;</hi> the former of whom
think, that betwixt the Earth and the Stars, and betwixt theſe
themſelves there are vaſt Tracts of Space that are empty, ſave
where the beams of Light do paſs through them; and the later of
whom tell us, that the Intervals betwixt the Stars and Planets (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which the Earth may perhaps be reckon'd) are perfectly
fill'd, but by a Matter far ſubtiler than our Air, which ſome call
Celeſtial, and others <hi>Aether.</hi> I ſhall not, I ſay, engage in this
controverſie, but thus much ſeems evident, That if there be ſuch
a Celeſtial Matter, it muſt make up far the Greateſt part of the
Univerſe known to us. For the Interſteller part of the world (if I
may ſo ſtile it) bears ſo very great a proportion to the Globes, and
their Atmoſpheres too, (if other Stars have any as well as the
Earth,) that it is almoſt incomparably Greater in reſpect of them,
than all our Atmoſphere is in reſpect of the Clouds, not to make
the compariſon between the Sea and the Fiſhes that ſwim in it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I thought it might very vvell deſerve a heedful
Enquiry, whether we can by ſenſible Experiments (for I hear
what has been attempted by Speculative Arguments) diſcover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing about the Exiſtence, or the Qualifications of this ſo vaſt
Aether: and I hoped our Curioſity might be ſomewhat aſſiſted
by our Engine, if I could manage in it ſuch a pair of Bellows as I
deſign'd. For I propos'd to my ſelf to faſten a convenient weight
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102306:79"/>
to the upper Baſis, and clog the lower with another, great enough
to keep it Horizontal and immoveable, that when by the help of
the Turning-key, frequently above mention'd, the upper Baſis
ſhould be rais'd to its full height, the cavity of the Bellows might
be brought to its full dimenſions. This done, I intended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt
the Receiver, and conſequently the thus open'd Bellows
with more than ordinary diligence, that ſo both the Receiver and
they might be carefully freed from Air. After vvhich I purpos'd
to let go the upper Baſe of the Bellows, that being haſtily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
by the incumbent Weight, it might ſpeedily enough fall
down to the lower Baſis, and by ſo much, and ſo quickly leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Cavity, might expell thence the Matter (if any were) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
contain'd in it, and that (if it could by this way be done) at
the hole of a ſlender Pipe, faſten'd either near the bottom of the
Bellows, or in the upper Baſis: againſt or over the orifice of which
Pipe there was to be plac'd at a convenient diſtance either a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or (if that ſhould prove too light) the Sail of a litle Wind-mill
made of Cards, or ſome other light body, and fit to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
motion by the impulſe of any Matter that ſhould be forc'd out
of the Pipe.</p>
               <p>By this means it ſeem'd not improbable, that ſome ſuch diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
might be made, as would not be altogether uſeleſs in our
Enquiry. For if notwithſtanding the abſence of the Air, it
ſhould appear by the Effects that a ſtream of other Matter, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſet viſible bodies a moving, ſhould iſſue out at the Pipe of
the compreſt Bellows; it would alſo appear, that there may be a
much ſubtiller Body than common Air, and as yet unobſerv'd by
the Vacuiſts, or (their Adverſaries) the Schools, that may
even copiouſly be found in places deſerted by that Air; and that it
is not ſafe to conclude from the abſence of the Air in our Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and in the upper part of thoſe Tubes where the <hi>Torricellian</hi>
Experiment is made, that there is no other body left but an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Vacuity, or (as the Atomiſts call it) a <hi>vacuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> coacervatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But
if on the other ſide there ſhould appear no motion at all to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102306:79"/>
ſo much as in the Feather, it ſeem'd that the Vacuiſts might
plauſibly argue, that either the Cavity of the Bellows was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
empty, or elſe that it would be very difficult to prove by
any ſenſible Experiment that it was full, and, if by any other way
of probation it be demonſtrable, that it was repleniſh'd with Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we that have not yet declar'd for any party, may by our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
be taught to have no confident expectations of eaſily
making it ſenſible by Mechanical Experiments; and may alſo be
inform'd, that tis really ſo ſubtle and yielding a Matter, that does
not either eaſily impell ſuch light bodies as even Feathers, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
reſiſt as does the Air it ſelf the motions of other bodies
through it, and is able without reſiſtance to make its paſſage
through the Pores of Wood, and Leather, and alſo of cloſer bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which we find not that the Air doth in its Natural or wonted
ſtate penetrate.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate this laſt Clauſe I ſhall adde, that to make the
Trial more accurate, I wav'd the uſe of other Bellows, (eſpecially
not having ſuch as I deſired,) &amp; caus'd a pair of ſmall Bellows to
be made with a Bladder, as a Body, which ſome of our former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
have evinc'd to be of ſo cloſe a Texture, that Air will
rather break it than paſſe through it: and that the Bladder might
no where looſe its entireneſs by Seams, we glued on the two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the one to the bottom, and the other to the oppoſite part of
it, ſo that the Neck came out at a hole purpoſely made for it; in
the upper Baſis, and into the Neck it was eaſie to inſert what pipe
we thought fit, binding the Neck very cloſe to it on the outſide.
We had likewiſe Thoughts to have another pair of Tite Bellows
made with a very light Clack in the lower Baſis, that by haſtily
drawing up the other Baſis, when the Receiver and Bellows were
very carefully exhauſted, we might ſee by the reſt, as the lifting
up of the Clack, whether the ſubtle Matter that was expell'd by
the upper Baſis in its Aſcent, would, according to the Modern
Doctrine of the Circle made by moving Bodies, be impell'd up
or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:102306:80"/>
We alſo thought of placing the litle Pipe of the Bladder-bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
(if I may ſo call them) beneath the ſurface of Water exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely
freed from Air, that we might ſee whither upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the Bellows by the incumbent Weight, when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
was carefully exhauſted, there would be any thing expell'd
at the Pipe, that would produce Bubbles in the liquor, wherein
its Orifice was immerſt.</p>
               <p>To bring now our Conjectures to ſome Trial, we put into a
capp'd Receiver the Bladder accommodated as before is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and though we could have wiſh'd it had been ſomewhat lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
becauſe it contain'd but between half a Pint and a Pint, yet in
regard it was fine and limber, and otherwiſe fit for our Turn, we
reſolv'd to try how it would do; and to depreſs the upper Baſis
of theſe litle Bellows the more eaſily and uniformly, we cover'd
the round piece of Paſtboard, that made the upper Baſis, with a
Pewter-plate, (with a hole in it for the neck of the Bladder;)
which nevertheleſs upon trial prov'd not ponderous enough,
whereby we were oblig'd to aſſiſt it by laying on it a Weight of
Lead. And to ſecure the above mentioned Feather, (which had
a ſlender and flexible Stem, and was left broad at one end, and
faſtned by Cement at the other, ſo as to ſtand with its broad end
at a convenient diſtance juſt over the Orifice of the Pipe,) from
being blown aſide to either hand, we made it to move in a perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
ſlit in a piece of Paſtboard,<note place="margin">See Plate the Fig. the</note> that was faſtned to one part of
the upper Baſis, as that which the Feather was glued to was to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
part. Theſe things being thus provided, the Pump was
ſet a work, and as the ambient Air was from time to time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
ſo the Air in the Bladder expanded it ſelf ſo ſtrongly, as
to lift up the metalline Weight, and yet in part to ſally out at the
litle Glaſs-pipe of our Bellows, as appear'd by its blowing up the
Feather, and keeping it ſuſpended till the Spring of the Air in the
bladder was too far weakned to continue to do as it had done.
In the mean time we did now and then, by the help of a ſtring faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
to the Turning-key, and the upper Baſis of the Bellows, let
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102306:80"/>
down that Baſis a litle, to obſerve how upon its ſinking the blaſt
againſt the Feather would decreaſe, as the Receiver was further
and further exhauſted. And when we judg'd it to be ſufficiently
freed from Air, we then let down the Weight, but could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that by ſhutting of the Bellows the Feather was at all blown
up, as it had been wont to be, though the upper Baſis were more
than uſually depreſt. And yet it ſeems ſomewhat odd, that
when, for Curioſity, in order to a further Trial, the Weight was
drawn up again, as the upper baſis was rais'd from the lower, the
ſides of the Bladder were ſenſibly (though not very much) preſt,
or drawn inwards. The Bellows being thus opened, we let down
the upper baſis again, but could not perceive that any blaſt was
produc'd; for though the Feather, that lay juſt over and near the
orifice of the litle Glaſs Pipe, had ſome motion, yet this ſeem'd
plainly to be but a ſhaking and almoſt vibrating motion (to the
right and left hand,) which it was put into by the upper baſis,
which the ſtring kept from a ſmooth and uniform deſcent; but
not to proceed from any blaſt iſſuing out of the cavity of the
Bladder. And for further ſatisfaction we caus'd ſome Air to be
let into the Receiver, becauſe there was a poſſibility, that una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
to us the ſlender Pipe might by ſome accident be choak'd;
but though upon the return of the Air into the Receiver, the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Bellows were preſt cloſer together, yet it ſeem'd that,
according to our Expectation, ſome litle Air got through the
Pipe into the cavity of the Bladder: for when we began to vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
again the Air we had let into the Receiver, the Bladder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſwell again, and upon our letting down the Weight, to blow
up and keep up the Feather, as had been done before the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had been ſo well exhauſted. What conjecture the opening
and ſhutting of our litle Bellows, more than once or twice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
procducing any blaſt ſenſible by the raiſing of the Feather,
gave ſome of the by-ſtanders, may be eaſily gueſs'd by the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of this Experiment; but whilſt I was endeavouring to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

               <p>I caus'd then to be made,<note place="margin">See plate the Figure the</note> for the formerly mentioned Syringe,
in ſtead of its ſtreight Pipe, a crooked one; whoſe ſhorter Leg
was parallel to the longer. And this Pipe was for greater cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

After this, there was faſtned to the handle of the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

was faſtned to a broad and heavy Pedeſtal, to keep it in its verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

the Weight that clogg'd it. And beſides all theſe things, there

was taken a Feather, which was about two inches long, and of

contrary way we ſuffer'd the Weight to depreſs the Sucker, that
we might ſee at what rate the Feather would be blown up; and
finding that it was impell'd forceably enough, we caus'd the pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to be ſo continued, that a pretty many pauſes were made,
during each of which we rais'd and depreſs'd the Sucker as before,
and had the opportunity to obſerve, That as the Receiver was
more and more exhauſted of the Air, ſo the Feather was leſs and
leſs briskly driven up, till at length, when the Receiver was well
emptied, the uſual elevations and depreſſions of the Sucker
would not blow it up at all that I could perceive, though they
were far more frequently repeated than ever before; nor was I
content to look heedfully my ſelf, but I made one whom I had
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102306:82"/>
often imploy'd about Pneumatical Experiments to watch atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
whilſt I drew up, and let down the Sucker, but he affirm'd
that he could not diſcern the leaſt beginning of Aſcenſion in the
Feather. And indeed to both of us it ſeem'd, that the litle and
inconſiderable motion that was ſometimes (not alwayes) to be
diſcern'd in the Feather, proceeded not from any thing that iſſued
out of the Pipe, but from ſome litle Shake, which twas difficult
not to give the Syringe and Pedeſtal, by the raiſing and depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Sucker.</p>
               <p>And that which made our <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> the more conſiderable,
was, that the Weight that carried down the Sucker being ſtill the
ſame, and the motions of the Turning-key being eaſie to be
made equal at ſeveral times, there ſeem'd no reaſon to ſuſpect
that Contingencies did much (if at all) favour the ſucceſs; but
there hapned a thing, which did manifeſtly enough disfavour it.
For I remember, that before the Syringe was put into the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
when we were trying how the Weight would depreſs it, and
it was thought that though the Weight were conveniently ſhap'd,
yet it was a litle of the leaſt; I would not alter it, but foretold,
that when the Air in the Cavity of the Syringe (that now reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
the quickneſs of its deſcent, becauſe ſo much Air could not
eaſily and nimbly get out at ſo ſmall a Pipe) ſhould be exhauſted
with the other Air of the Receiver, the elevated Sucker would
fall down more eaſily, which he, that was imploy'd to manage the
Syringe whilſt I watch'd the Feather, affirm'd himſelf afterwards
to obſerve very evidently. So that when the Receiver was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
if there had been in the cavity of the Syringe a matter as
fit as Air to make a Wind of, the Blaſt ought to have been Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
becauſe the celerity that the Sucker was depreſt with was ſo.</p>
               <p>After we had long enough tried in vain to raiſe the Feather, I
order'd ſome Air to be let into the Receiver; and though when
the admitted Air was but very litle, the motions of the Sucker
had ſcarce if at all any ſenſible operation upon the Feather, yet
when the quantity of Air began to be ſomewhat conſiderable,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102306:82"/>
the Feather began to be a litle mov'd upwards, and ſo by letting
in Air not all at once but more and more from time to time, and
by moving the Sucker up and down in the intervals of thoſe
times of admiſſion, we had the opportunity to obſerve, that as the
Receiver had more Air in it, the Feather would be more briskly
blown up.</p>
               <p>But not content with a ſingle Tryal of an Experiment of this
conſequence, we cauſed the Receiver to be again exhauſted, and
proſecuted the Tryal with the like ſucceſs as before, onely this
one Circumſtance, that we added for confirmation, may be befit to
be here taken notice of. Having, after the Receiver was exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
drawn up and let fall the Sucker divers times ineffectually;
<hi>though</hi> hitherto we had not uſually rais'd it any higher at a time,
than we could by one turn of the hand, both becauſe we could
not ſo conveniently raiſe it higher by the Hand alone, and becauſe
we thought it unneceſſary, ſince that height ſuffic'd to make the
Air briskly toſs up the Feather; yet <hi>ex abundanti</hi> we novv took
an inſtrument that was pretty long and fit ſo to take hold on the
Turning-key, that we could eaſily raiſe the Sucker between two
and three inches (by our Aeſtimate) at a time, and nimbly depreſs
it again; and for all this, which would much have increas'd the
Blaſt, if there had been a Matter fit for it in the Cavity of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe,
we could not ſenſibly blow up the Feather, till we had let a
litle Air into the Receiver.</p>
               <p>To be able to make an aeſtimate of the Quantity of Air
pump'd out, or let in, when the Feather vvas ſtrongly or faintly,
or not at all rais'd by the fall of the Sucker; vve took off the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
and convey'd a Gage into it, but though for a vvhile vve
made ſome uſe of our Gage, yet a miſchance befalling it before
the Operation was quite ended, I ſhall forbear to adde any thing
concerning that Tryal, and proceed to ſay ſomething of another
Attempt, wherein though I foreſaw and met with ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as kept me from doing altogether what I deſired, yet the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
being almoſt as good as could be expected, I ſhall venture
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102306:83"/>
to acquaint Your Lordſhip with the Tryal, which was this.</p>
               <p>In ſtead of the hitherto imploy'd Pipe of Braſs, there was well
faſtned (with Cement) to the Syringe a Pipe of Glaſs, whoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
differ'd from that of the other in this particular, that the
ſhorter (or remoter) Leg of our new Pipe, after it had for a while
been carried parallel to the other Leg, was bent off ſo, that above
an inch and a half of it tended downwards, that the orifice of it
might be immerſt into Water contain'd in a ſmall open Jarr. The
deſign of which contrivance was, that when the Receiver ſhould
be well exhauſted, we might (according to what I told Your
Lordſhip vvas at firſt deſign'd) try vvhether by the raiſing and
depreſſing of the Sucker any ſuch Matter would be driven out at
the noſe of the Pipe, as would produce bubbles in the incumbent
Water, which, Air (though highly rarefied, perhaps to ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of times beyond its wonted Dimenſions,) is capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And I chooſe to imploy rather Water than Quick-ſilver,
becauſe though by uſing the later I might hope to be leſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with bubbles, yet the ponderouſneſs and opacity of it ſeem'd
to outweigh that convenience.</p>
               <p>I need not tell Your Lordſhip, that in other reſpects this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
was made like the former, ſo that I ſhall mention onely
its peculiarities, which were, That as the Air was pump'd out of
the Receiver, that in the Glaſs pipe made its way through the
Water in Bubbles, and a litle Air having once by a ſmall Leak
got in, and forc'd ſome of the Water out of the Jarr into the pipe,
when the Receiver was again vvell emptied, both that Water
and even the litle quantity of ſtagnant Water, that was contain'd
in the immerſt part of the Pipe, produc'd ſo many bubbles of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſizes, as quite diſturb'd our Obſervations. Wherefore we
let alone the Receiver, exhauſted as it was, for 6 or 7 hours, to
give the Water time to be freed from Air, and then cauſing what
Air might have ſtolen in to be again pump'd out, till we had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by the Gage that the Receiver was well exhauſted, we
caus'd the Sucker (of the Syringe) to be rais'd and depreſt diverſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102306:83"/>
times, and though even then a Bubble vvould now and then
make our Obſervations troubleſome, and leſs certain, yet it ſeem'd
to us, that when we were not thus confounded, we ſometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that the elevation and fall of the Sucker, though reiterated,
did not drive out at the Pipe any thing that made any diſcernable
bubbles in the incumbent Water; for though there would appear
now and then ſome ſmall bubbles on the ſurface of the Water,
yet I could not perceive that the Matter that made them, iſſued
out at the Pipe; and ſome of them manifeſtly proceeded from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erial
Particles, till then lurking in the Water, as I concluded from
the place and time of their riſing. But this Non-eruption of
bubles at the noſe of the Pipe, vvas not that which gave me the
moſt of ſatisfaction. For at length both I and another had the
opportunity to obſerve the Water in the immerſt part of the
Pipe, which was very ſlender, to be about an inch higher than the
reſt of the ſtagnant Water, and to continue at that height or
place in the Pipe, though the Sucker vvere divers times together
rais'd and depreſſ'd by Gueſs between 2 and three inches at a time.
Which ſeem'd to argue, either that there was a <hi>vacuum</hi> in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the Syringe, or elſe that if it were full of <hi>Aether,</hi> that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
vvas ſo ſubtle, that the impulſe it received from the falling
Sucker vvould not make it diſpleace a very litle Thread (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not exceeding a Grain in Weight) of Water that vvas in the
ſlender Pipe, though it appear'd by the bubbles, that ſometimes
diſclos'd themſelves in the Water, after the Receiver had been
exhauſted, that far more Water vvould be diſplac'd and carried
up by a ſmall bubble conſiſting of ſuch rarified Air, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my Aeſtimate the Aerial particles of it did not, before the
Pump vvas begun to be ſet on vvork, take up in the Water a five-hundredth
part of the quantity of a Pins head.</p>
               <p>But whilſt we were conſidering what to do further in our Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
a litle Air, that ſtrain'd in at ſome ſmall undiſcoverable Leak,
drove the Water into the emptied part of the Pipe, and put an
end for that time to our Tryal, which had been too toylſome to
invite us then to reiterate it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:102306:84"/>
I had indeed thoughts of proſecuting the Enquiry, <hi>by</hi> dropping
from the top of the exhauſted Receiver light Bodies convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhap'd, to be turn'd round, or otherwiſe put out of their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt
motion of Deſcent, if they met with any reſiſtance in their
fall; and <hi>by</hi> making ſuch Bodies move Horizontally and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in the Receiver, as vvould probably diſcover whither they
were aſſiſted by the <hi>medium:</hi> and other contrivances and wayes
I had in my thoughts, whereby to proſecute our Enquiry, but
vvanting time for other Experiments, I could not ſpare ſo much
as was neceſſary to exhauſt large Receivers ſo diligently, as ſuch
nice Trials would exact; and therefore I reſolv'd to deſiſt, till I
had more leiſure than I then had, (or have ſince been Maſter
of.)</p>
               <p>In the interim, thus much we ſeem to have already diſcovered
by our paſt Tryals, that if when our Veſſels are very diligently
freed from Air, they are full of Aether, that Aether is ſuch a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as will not be made ſenſibly to move a light Feather by ſuch
an impulſe as would make the Air manifeſtly move it, not onely
whilſt tis no thinner than common Air, but when tis very highly
rarified, (which, if I miſtake not, it was in our Experiment ſo
much, as to be brought to take up above an hundred times more
room than before.)</p>
               <p>And one thing more we gain'd by the Tryal made with water,
namely a clear confirmation of what I deliver'd in the 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
about the cauſe of the Suction that is made by Syrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
for Your Lordſhip may remember, that at the cloſe of the
Experiment we have all this while been reciting, I obſerv'd, that
when the external Air was ſo very well withdrawn, the pulling up
of the Sucker would not make the ſtagnant Water, that the Pipe
of the Syringe was immerſt in, to aſcend one inch, or ſo much as the
tenth part of it.</p>

               <head type="sub">About the falling, in the Exhauſted Receiver, of a light Body, fitted
to have its motion viſibly varied by a ſmall reſiſtance of the Air.</head>
               <p>PArtly to try whether in the ſpace deſerted by the Air, drawn
out of our Receivers, there would be any thing more fit to
reſiſt the motion of other light Bodies through it, than in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Experiment we found It to impell them into motion; and
partly for another purpoſe to be mention'd by and by, we made
the following Tryals.</p>
               <p>We took a Receiver, which, though leſs tall than we would
have had, was the longeſt we could procure: and that we might be
able, not ſo properly to let down as, to let fall a Body in it, we ſo
faſtned a ſmall pair of Tobacco-Tongs to the inſide of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
Braſs-Cover, that by moving the Turning-key, we might
by a ſtring tied to one part of them, open the Tongs, which
elſe their own Spring would keep ſhut. This being done, the
next thing was to provide a Body, which vvould not fall down
like a Stone, or another dead Weight through the Air, but would
in the manner of its deſcent ſhew, that its motion was ſomewhat
reſiſted by the Air; vvherefore that vve might have a Body that
vvould be turn'd about Horizontally (as it were) in its fall, we
thought fit to joyn Croſs-wiſe four broad and light Feathers
(each about an Inch long) at their Quils with a litle Cement,
into vvhich vve alſo ſtuck perpendicularly a ſmall Label of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
about an 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an inch in breadth, and ſomewhat more in
height, by vvhich the Tongues might take hold of our light In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
vvithout touching the Cement, which elſe might ſtick
to them.</p>
               <p>By the help of this ſmall piece of Paper,<note place="margin">See Plate the Fig. the</note> the litle Inſtrument,
of vvhich it made a part, vvas ſo taken hold of by the Tongs,
that it hung as Horizontal as ſuch a thing could well be plac'd:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102306:85"/>
and then the Receiver being cemented on to the Engine, the
Pump vvas diligently ply'd, till it appear'd by a Gage, which had
been conveyed in, that the Reciver had been carefully exhauſted:
Laſtly, our eyes being attentively fix'd upon the connected Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the Tongs were by the help of the Turning-key open'd,
and the litle Inſtrument let fall, which, though in the Air it had
made ſome turns in its deſcent from the ſame height it now fell
from, yet now it deſcended like a dead Weight, without being
perceiv'd by any of us to make ſo much as one Turn, or a part of
it: notwithſtanding which I did, for greater ſecurity, cauſe the
Receiver to be taken off, and put on again, after the Feathers
were taken hold of by the Tongs, whence being let fall in the
Receiver unexhauſted, they made ſome Turns in their deſcent, as
they alſo did being a ſecond time let fall after the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>But when after this, the Feathers being plac'd as before, we
repeated the Experiment by carefully pumping out the Air, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I nor any of the By-ſtanders could perceive any thing of
Turning in the deſcent of the Feathers; and yet for further ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
we let them fall twice more in the unexhauſted Receiver, and
found them to turn in falling as before; whereas when we did a
3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> time let them fall in the well exhauſted Receiver, they fell after
the ſame manner as they had done formerly, when the Air, that
vvould by its reſiſtance have turn'd them round, vvas remov'd
out of their vvay.</p>
               <p>Note 1. though (as I intimated above) the Glaſs, vvherein
this Experiment was made, were nothing near ſo tall as I would
have had it, yet it was taller than any of our ordinary Receivers,
it being in height about 22 inches.</p>
               <p>2. One that had had more leiſure and conveniency, might
have made a more commodious Inſtrument than that we made
uſe of: for being accidentally viſited by that Sagacious Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Wren,</hi> and ſpeaking to him of this matter, he was
pleas'd with great dexterity as well as readineſs to make me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Inſtrument of Paper, on which, when twas let fall, the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102306:85"/>
of the Air had ſo manifeſt an operation, that I ſhould have
made uſe of it in our Experiment, had it not been caſually loſt
when the ingenious Maker was gone out of theſe parts.</p>
               <p>3. Though I have but briefly related our having ſo order'd
the matter, that we could conveniently let fall a Body in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
when very well exhauſted, yet to contrive and put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
what was neceſſary to perform this, was not ſo very eaſie,
and it would be difficult to deſcribe it circumſtantially without
very many words; for which reaſon I forbear an account, that
would prove too tedious to us both.</p>
               <p>4. What has been hitherto related, was done in proſecution
of but one of the two Deſigns I aim'd at in the foregoing Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
by which I intended, if I could have procured a Receiver
tall enough, to try whether Bodies (ſome very light, and ſome
heavier) being let fall when the Air was very diligently pump'd
out, would not deſcend ſomewhat faſter than if the Receiver
were full of Air. But though I had provided a <hi>Pendulum</hi> that
vibrated quarters of Seconds, yet the Glaſs being no higher than
it was, the Deſcent even of our Feathers took up ſo litle time,
that even this <hi>Pendulum</hi> was of no uſe; onely it ſeem'd to all of us
that were preſent at making the above recited Tryals, that when
the Feathers were let fall at ſuch times as the Air (that would have
turn'd them round in their deſcent) was removed, they came to
the bottom ſenſibly ſooner than at other times. But when we
ſhall have opportunity to repeat the Experiment in taller Glaſſes,
and to make ſome variation of it, I hope to be able to give Your
Lordſhip a fuller ſatisfaction about this Particular. And in the
mean while I ſhall forbear to examine whether the Air might
ſomewhat retard the deſcent of the Feathers upon ſome other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
or meerly upon that of its being a <hi>medium</hi> not quite devoid
of Gravity.</p>
               <div type="annotation">
                  <head>Annotations.</head>
                  <p>1. But here I muſt be ſo ſincere as to inform Your Lordſhip, that
this 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Experiment ſeem'd not to prove ſo much as did the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102306:86"/>
foregoing made with the Syringe: for being ſuſpicious that, to
make the feathered body above mentioned turn in its fall, there
would need a reſiſtance not altogether inconſiderable, I caus'd the
Experiment to be repeated, when the Receiver was by our Aeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
(which was not made at random neither) litle or nothing
more than half exhauſted, and yet the remaining Air was too far
rarified to make the falling Body manifeſtly turn.</p>
                  <p>2. And yet perchance it would have hapned otherwiſe, if the
Receiver had been tall enough; which though I had not then lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and conveniency to make it, yet it will not be amiſs to let
Your Lorſhip know by what means we did, that it might be
ſomewhat fit to make the recited Experiment and ſome others,
bring it to the height it had, which did conſiderably exceed that
of the talleſt Glaſs we could then procure.</p>
                  <p>To lengthen our Receiver therefore, we thought fit to try,
whether we could not cloſe enough faſten to the bottom of it,
with very good Cement a Cylindrical Pipe of Laton, whoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
orifice ſhould have neer the ſame breadth with the bottom of
the Glaſs. And though this Contrivance ſeem'd liable to a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of not mean difficulties; The one, that the Laton being every
where bended, and in ſome places neceſſary to be ſouder'd, it
would be very hard (as indeed we found it) to avoid ſome ſmall
cracks and leaks: And the other, that if the metalline Pipe were
wide enough, ſo great and heavy a pillar of the Atmoſphere would
come to bear againſt it, as to preſs it inwards, if not alſo to break
it; yet we hoped we ſhould be able to obviate both of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.
Againſt the firſt of which our Remedy was, to
Coat over very carefully the whole Pipe with the ſame cloſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherewith we faſtned it to the Glaſs Receiver. And againſt
the Second, we provided a litle Frame conſiſting of divers ſmall
Iron Bars faſtned together; which Frame (though twere not too
wide to go into the Cylinder of Laton, yet it) was wide enough
to be ſo neer it on the inſide, that (though the weight of the
Atmoſphere ſhould, as we feared, preſs the Laton ſo as to make
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102306:86"/>
it yield inward, yet) it could make it bend no further than the
Iron-frame would permit; which was not far enough to ſpoile ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Receiver or the Experiment. And this not unpleaſant
<hi>phaenomenon</hi> would ſomewhat ſurpriſe unaccuſtomed Spectators,
that when after the Receiver had been very well exhauſted, the
external Air was permitted to return, there would be heard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſome time, from the metalline part of the Receiver, divers
Sounds brisk enough, which would make an odd Cracking noiſe
proceeding from the Laton-plate, which having been forceably,
though but ſlowly, bent inwards by the predominant Preſſure of
the Atmoſphere, was now aſſiſted by the Preſſure of the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Air, to regain its former Figure. And as I thought not fit
to omit this Circumſtance, becauſe it confirms the practicable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Remedy propos'd againſt the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Inconvenience; ſo I
thought fit to mention this way of enlarging and heightning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
becauſe what we have related ſeems to give Grounds of
hoping that this Contrivance may be made good uſe of in divers
other Tryals, and particularly in attempts to make Receivers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious
enough to contain larger Animals, and perhaps even a
Boy, or a Man. In order to ſome of which purpoſes we indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to get an improvement made of our Metalline Cylinder
by additional contrivances; but could not (where we then were)
get Artificers, that would perform what was directed.</p>

ſo thick as the other,<note place="margin">See plate the Figure the</note> and leſs than an inch long: this vvas Turn'd

by the ſame Turner made for it in the midſt of the fixt Trencher,
(as we call a piece of ſolid Wood ſhap'd like a Milſtone,) being
4 or 5 inches (more or leſs according to the wideneſs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver)

in a large and round Groove, or Gutter, purpoſely made in the

call it) of the Axletree. Beſides all vvhich, there were divers
Horizontal Perforations bored here and there in the Pillar it ſelf,
to which this Axis belong'd, vvhich Pillar we ſhall to avoid am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
call the Vertical Cylinder. The general uſe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
(whoſe other parts need not to be mentioned before the
Experiments where they are imploy'd) is, that the end of the
Turning-key being put into the Socket, and the lower Axis of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102306:87"/>
the Vertical Cylinder into the Trencher, by the motion of the
Key a Body faſten'd at one of the holes to the Cylinder may be
approach'd too, or remov'd from, or made to rub or ſtrike againſt
another Body faſtned in a convenient poſture to the upper part of
the Trencher.</p>
               <p>To come now to our Tryal about Sounds, vve caus'd a Hand-Bell
(vvhoſe Handle and Clapper were taken away) to be ſo faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to a ſtrng Wire, that, one end of the Wire being made faſt
in the Trencher, the other end, vvhich vvas purpoſely bent down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
took hold of the Bell. In another hole, made in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of the ſame Trencher, vvas vvedg'd in (vvith a woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Peg) a Steel-ſpring, to whoſe upper part was tied a Gad of
Iron or Steel, leſs than an inch long, but of a pretty thickneſs.
The length of this Spring was ſuch, as to make the upper part of
the Hammer (if I may ſo call the piece of Iron) of the ſame height
with the Bell,<note place="margin">See the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to.</note> and the diſtance of the Spring from the Bell was
ſuch, that when it was forc'd back the other way, it might at its
return make the Hammer ſtrike briskly upon the outſide of the
Bell.</p>
               <p>The Trencher being thus furniſht and plac'd in a Capp'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
(as You know, for brevity ſake, we uſe to call one that is
fitted with one or other of the Braſs Covers, often mentioned
already,) the Air was diligently pump'd out; and then, by the
help of the Turning-key, the Vertical Cylinder was made to go
round, by which means as often as either of a couple of ſtiff Wires,
or ſmall Pegs, that were faſtned at right Angles into holes, made
not far from the bottom of the Cylinder, paſs'd (<hi>under</hi> the <hi>Bell,</hi>
and) by the lately mentioned Spring; they forceably did in their
paſſage bend it from the Bell, by which means, as ſoon as the
Wire was gone by, and the Spring ceas'd to be preſs'd, it would
fly back with violence, enough to make the Hammer give a ſmart
ſtroak upon the Bell. And by this means we could both conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the Experiment at diſcretion, and make the percuſſions more
equally ſtrong than it would otherwiſe have been eaſie to do.</p>

The event of our Tryal was; That, when the Receiver was
vvell emptied, it ſometimes ſeem'd doubtful, eſpecially to ſome
of the By-ſtanders, whether any Sound were produc'd or no; but
to me for the moſt part it ſeem'd, that after much attention I
heard a Sound, that I could but juſt hear; and yet, vvhich is odd,
me thought it had ſomewhat of the nature of Shrilneſs in it, but
ſeem'd (which is not ſtrange) to come from a good way off. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the often turning of the Cylindrical Key kept the Receiver
from being ſo ſtanch as elſe it vvould have been, upon vvhich
ſcore ſome litle Air might inſinuate it ſelf, I ſhall not poſitively
determine: but to diſcover vvhat intereſt the Preſence or the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Air might have in the Loudneſs or Lowneſs of the
Sound, I caus'd the Air to be let into the Receiver, not all at once
but at ſeveral times, with competent intervals between them; by
which Expedient it was eaſie to obſerve, that the Vertical Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
being ſtill made to go round, when a litle Air vvas let in, the
ſtroak of the Hammer upon the Bell (that before could now and
then not be heard, and for the moſt part be but very ſcarcely
heard) began to be eaſily heard. And when a litle more Air was
let in, the Sound grew more and more audible, and ſo increaſed,
till the Receiver was again repleniſhed with Air; though even
then (that we omit not That <hi>phaenomenon</hi>) the Sound was obſerv'd
to be much leſs loud than when the Receiver was not interpos'd
between the Bell and the Ear.</p>
               <p>And whereas in the already publiſh'd Phyſico-Mechanical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
I acquainted Your Lordſhip with what I obſerv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Sound of an ordinary Watch in the Exhauſted Receiver,
I ſhall now adde, that That Experiment was repeated not long
ſince, with the addition of ſuſpending in the Receiver a Watch,
with a good Alarum, which was purpoſely ſo ſet, that it might,
before it ſhould begin to ring, give us time to cement on
the Receiver very carefully, exhauſt it very diligently, and ſettle
our ſelves in a ſilent and attentive poſture. And to make this
Experiment in ſome reſpect more accurate than the others we
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102306:88"/>
made of Sounds, we ſecur'd our ſelves againſt any leaking at the
Top, by imploying a Receiver that was made all of one piece of
Glaſs, (and conſequently had no Cover cemented on to it,) being
furniſh'd onely within (when 'twas firſt blown) with a Glaſs-knob
or Button, to which a ſtring might be tied. And becauſe it might
be ſuſpected, that if the Watch were ſuſpended by its own Silver
Chain, the tremulous motion of its ſounding Bell might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
by that Metalline Chain to the upper part of the Glaſs;
to obviate this as well as we could, we hung the Watch, not by
its Chain, but a very ſlender Thread, whoſe upper end was
faſtned to the newly mentioned Glaſs-button.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being done, and the Air being carefully pump'd
out, we ſilently expected the time when the Alarum ſhould begin
to ring, which 'twas eaſie to know by the help of our other
Watches; but not hearing any noiſe ſo ſoon as we expected, it
would perhaps have been doubted whether the Watch continued
Going, if for prevention we had not order'd the matter ſo, that
we could diſcern it did not ſtand ſtill. Wherefore I deſir'd an
ingenious Gentleman to hold his Ear juſt over the Button, at
which the Watch was ſuſpended, and to hold it alſo very near to
the Receiver, upon which he told us that he could perceive, and
but juſt perceive ſomething of Sound, that ſeem'd to come from
far; though neither we that liſtned very attentively near other
parts of the Receiver, nor he, if his Ears were no more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in point of poſition than Ours, were ſatisfied that we heard
the Watch at all. Wherefore ordering ſome Air to be let in,
we did by the help of attention begin to hear the Alarum; whoſe
Sound was odd enough, and, by returning the Stop-cock to keep
any more Air from getting in, we kept the Sound thus low for a
pretty while, after which a little more Air, that was permitted to
enter, made it become more audible; and when the Air was yet
more freely admitted, the by ſtanders could plainly hear the noiſe
of the yet continuing Alarum at a conſiderable diſtance from the
Receiver.</p>

a Writer as <hi>Merſennus</hi> deſerves to be favourably treated: and

well enough have been true, as far as could be gathered from the
Tryals he made. For Firſt, tis no eaſie matter, eſpecially for
thoſe that have not peculiar and very cloſe Cements, to keep the
Air quite out for any conſiderable time in veſſels conſiſting of
divers pieces, ſuch as he appears to have made uſe of. And next,
the bigneſs of the Bell in reference to the capacity of the exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted

try whether a Bag-pipe will be made to afford the ſame
Sound as in the open Air, in ſuch Veſſels as he uſed for his Bels,

You remember what is related in the almoſt immediately forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

out of the Cavity of a pair of Bellows, that had force enough to
blow away a Feather, when that Cavity was freed from Air; as the
Bagpipe would be by the ſame operation, that empties the Glaſs
that contains it, or elſe the Sound would not be made in ſuch a
<hi>Vacuum</hi> as the ſcope of the Experiment requires.</p>
               <p>If I had had Conveniency, I would have made ſome Tryals by
conveying a ſmall ſtring'd Inſtrument (perhaps ſome ſuch as they
commonly call a <hi>Kit</hi>) exactly tun'd, into a large Receiver, and
then upon briskly ſtriking the String of a bigger Inſtrument,
(tuned, as they ſpeak, to an Uniſon to (or with) that of the ſmaller
Inſtrument) I ſhould have taken notice, whether the Sound would
have been ſo uniformly propagated, notwithſtanding the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the Glaſs Receiver, as ſenſibly to ſhake the included
String; in order to the diſcerning of which, a bended piece of
Straw, or Feather, or ſome ſuch light body, was to be hors'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the String to be ſhaken. I alſo intended, in caſe the ſtring
<hi>were</hi> made to move, to make the like Tryal after the Receiver
was diligently exhauſted. And laſtly I deſign'd to try, whether
two Uniſon ſtrings of the ſame Inſtruments, or of a couple to be
plac'd in the ſame Receiver, would, when the Air (which is the
uſual <hi>medium</hi> of Sounds) was well pump'd out, yet maintain ſuch

               <p>YOu know, that among the Cauſes that have been propos'd
of the ſtrange flying of a Glaſs-drop into a multitude of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
when the ſlender Stem of it comes to be broken off, One of
the leaſt improbable was taken from the Preſſure of the Air: as if
that within the poreous (and as 'twere honey-comb'd) inſide of
the Glaſs, being highly rarified when the drop of melted Glaſs
fell into the Water at its firſt formation, it was forc'd to continue
in that praeternatural ſtate of Expanſion by the hardneſs and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the external Caſe of Glaſs, that inclos'd the Pithlike part
(if I may ſo call it;) ſo that upon the breaking off a part of this
ſolid Caſe at the Stem, the external Air gaining acceſs, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Spungy part very litle reſiſtance from the highly rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and conſe quently weaken'd Air included there, ruſhes in with
ſuch violence, as to ſhiver the Glaſs-drop into a multitude of
pieces.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not now trouble Your Lordſhip with the mention of
what may be alleadg'd to queſtion this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> eſpecially if it
be compared with that accurate Account of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of

by that great Ornament of it, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Robert Moray.</hi> But I ſhall
onely ſay in this place, that when I conſider'd, that if the Diſſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102306:90"/>
it, it would be hard to aſcribe that Effect to the irruption of the
external Air, I thought fit to try what would happen, if a Glaſs-drop
were broken in our exhauſted Receiver. And accordingly
did, though not without ſome difficulty, ſo order the matter, that
the blunter part of the Glaſs-drop was faſtned to a ſtable Body
(convey'd into the Receiver,) and the crooked Stem was tyed to
one end of a ſtring, whoſe other end was faſtned to the Turning-key;
by which means, when the Air had been diligently pump'd
out, the Stem was (by ſhortning the ſtring) broken off, and the
Glaſs drop was ſhatter'd into a thouſand pieces.</p>
               <p>This Experiment was long after repeated with the like ſucceſs,
and having at that time no Gage to try how far the Air had been

attempts were made to try, whether either a Flame, or kindled
Coals would be made to continue for ſometime burning in our
Receiver: But thoſe Tryals making it evident, that it would be
either impoſſible, or very difficult to produce any durable Light,
without the preſence of the Air, by the burning of bodies; I thought
it not amiſs, conſidering the Nobleneſs of Light, to make trial,
whether it might be otherwiſe produc'd in our exhauſted Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
ſince whether or no the Attempts ſhould prove ſucceſsful,
the Event would probably be inſtructive. For as tis the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Light, when tis produc'd, to be diſcoverable by it ſelf; ſo
in ſuch a Tryal as we intended, it would teach ſomething concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               <p>VVE took a large inverted Cucurbite for a Receiver, which
being ſo well wip'd both within and without as to be
very clear, allow'd me to obſerve, and to make others do ſo too,
That when the Pump began to be ſet a work, if I caus'd a pretty
large Candle to be held on the other ſide of the Glaſs, upon the
turning of the Stop-cock to let the Air out of the Receiver into
the Cylinder, the Glaſs would ſeem to be full of Fumes, and there
would appear about the Flame of the Candle, ſeen through them,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102306:91"/>
a kind of <hi>Halo,</hi> that at firſt commonly was between Blew and
Green, and after ſome Sucks would be of a Reddiſh or Orange
colour, and both very vivid. The production of this <hi>Meteor</hi> (if
I may ſo call it) was, according to my conjecture, made on ſome
ſuch ſcore as this. That the Cement being ſomewhat ſoft and
new (as is convenient for this Experiment) abounds with Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine,
and having a litle (as well to faſten on the Receiver, as
for the other purpoſe) apply'd to it a hot Iron, whereby the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was both ſoftned and heated, it ſeem'd rational to expect,
That upon the withdrawing of the Air in the Receiver, the Aeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Particles in the Cement, freed from their former Preſſure,
would extricate themſelves, and with the looſer ſteams of the
Turpentine and perhaps of the Bees-wax would with a kind of
Exploſion expand themſelves in the Receiver, and by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
between the Light and the Eye exhibit thoſe delightful
Colours we had ſeen. To confirme which, I afterwards found,
that by watchfully obſerving it I could plainly enough perceive
the colouring ſteams, juſt upon the turning of the Stopcock, to
fly up from the Cement towards the top of the Glaſs; and if we
continued Pumping, the Receiver would grow clearer, and the
Colours more dilute, (till we had occaſion to put on the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and heat the Cement afreſh:) of which the reaſon might be,
partly that the Aerial and Volatile Particles of the upper part of
the Cement did in that tract of time ſpend themſelves more and
more; and partly, becauſe the Agitation they receiv'd from the
heat communicated by the Iron did continually decay. Not to
mention, that when the Receiver is more exhauſted, the want of
Air makes it more difficult for Steams to be ſupported, and as it
were ſwim up and down in it.</p>
               <p>But for farther Confirmation, I caus'd ſome Cement to be
put into a ſmall Crucible, warm enough to melt it; and conveying
this into a clear Receiver of a convenient ſhape and ſize, I caus'd
the Pump to be ſet a work; whereupon it appear'd manifeſtly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
That upon the opening of the Stop-cock to let out the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102306:92"/>
Air, the Steams would copiouſly be thrown about from the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
into the capacity of the Receiver, and would, after having a
litle play'd there, fall down again. But in theſe apparitions the
Vividneſs, and ſometimes the Kind of the exhibited Colours
ſeem'd much to depend upon divers circumſtances, ſuch as the
degrees of Heat, the bigneſs and ſhape of the Receiver, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Air that yet remain'd unpump'd out, and the nature of the
Cement its ſelf; which laſt particular I the rather mention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,

was faſtned a pretty ſtrong Spring of Steel or Iron, ſhap'd almoſt
like the Lathe of a Croſs-bow, and to the midſt of this Spring
was ſtrongly faſtned on the outſide a round piece of Braſs hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
almoſt like a concave Burning-glaſs, or one of thoſe Tools
wherein they uſe to grind Eye-Glaſſes for Teleſcopes. To this
piece of Braſs, which was not conſiderably thick, nor above 2 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Diameter, was fitted a convex piece of the ſame Metal, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
like a Gage for a Tool to grind Glaſſes in, which had belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it a ſquare Handle, whereinto as into a Socket was inſerted
a ſquare piece of Wood, proceeding from the Baſis of a ſquare
wooden Pillar, which we made uſe of on this occaſion in ſtead of
our vertical Cylinder. By the help of another piece of Wood
coming from the other Baſis of the ſame Pillar, the Turning-key
was joyned to this Pillar, which was made of ſuch a length, that
when the Turning-key was forceably kept down as low as the
Braſs Cover, it was a part of, would permit; the convex piece of
Metal lately deſcrib'd did depreſs the concave piece a pretty way,
notwithſtanding a vigorous reſiſtance of the ſubjacent Spring.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe things, a litle fine powder of Emery was put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the convex and concave pieces of Braſs, to make them
more congruous, and facilitate the motion that was to be made;
and there was faſtned to the upper part of the Turning key a good
Wimble, without which we preſum'd the turning of the Key
would not produce a ſufficient motion: in order to the making of
which, it was, after the firſt Tryal, judged requiſite to have a
ſtrong man, that was us'd to exerciſe his hands and armes in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102306:93"/>
labours, upon which account we ſent for a certain Lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith,
that was a luſty and dexterous fellow.</p>
               <p>All things that were thought neceſſary being thus in readineſs,
and a Mercurial Gage being convey'd into the Receiver, we caus'd
the Air to be diligently pump'd out; and then the Smith was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to turn the Wimble, and to continue to lean a litle on it,
that he might be ſure to keep the Turning-key from being at all
lifted up by the formerly mentioned Spring.</p>
               <p>Whilſt this man with much nimbleneſs and ſtrength was moving
the Wimble, I watch'd the Gage, to obſerve whether the agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Stop-cock, and conſequently the Engine, did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
the Experiment; and for greater caution I caus'd the Pump
to be almoſt all the while kept at work, though that ſeem'd not
ſo neceſſary.</p>
               <p>When the Turner of the Wimble was almoſt out of Breath,
we let in for haſt the Air at the Cover of the Receiver by lifting
up the Turning-key, and nimbly removing the Receiver we felt
the pieces of Braſs, betwixt whom the Attrition had been made,
and, as we expected, found both of them very ſenſibly warm.</p>
               <p>But being willing to confirm the Experiment by a ſecond Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
which we hoped might, after the Experience taught us by the
firſt, be ſomewhat better performed, we caus'd the Smith, after
he had well refreſh'd himſelf with reſt and drink, to lay hold of
the Wimble again, when the Gage made it appear that the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was well exhauſted, ſo that by further Pumping the Quick-ſilver
ſeem'd not to be further depreſt. And in this 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Tryal the
nimble Smith plaid his part ſo well, (the Pump in the mean while
not being neglected,) that when we did as before haſtily let in the
Air, and take out the Bodies that had been rubb'd againſt one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
they were both of them (eſpecially the uppermoſt) ſo hot,
that I could not endure to hold my hand on either of them, and
they did for a conſiderable time retain a not inconſiderable degree
of Warmth.</p>
               <p>The ſame day I caus'd to be made at the Turners two bodies
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102306:93"/>
of Wood, for ſize and ſhape like thoſe of Braſs we had juſt before
imploy'd; the upper of theſe was of hard Oak, the other of Beech,
(ſuch a difference between Woods, to be heated by mutual Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being thought to be an advantageous circumſtance;) but
though the Wimble was ſwiftly turn'd as before, and that by the
ſame Perſon, nevertheleſs the Wood ſeem'd not to me (for all
the By-ſtanders were not of my opinion) to have manifeſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
any Warmth; and yet that there had been a conſiderable
Attrition, appear'd by the great Poliſh which part of the Wood
had evidently acquir'd, vvhich made me ſuſpect, that though the
Wood ſeem'd dry enough, yet it might not really be ſo, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the contrary was affirm'd to me: but not being willing
to ſit down with a ſingle Tryal, I caus'd the Experiment to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
with more obſtinacy than before, the effect of which was,
that the Wood, eſpecially the upper piece of it, vvas brought to
a Warmth unqueſtionably ſenſible.</p>

               <p>We took in an Evaporating Glaſs a convenient quantity of

Air, and examine a Conjecture about the difference of its ſtrength
in unequally broad mouth'd Veſſels.</head>
               <p>THough ſeveral of the foregoing Tryals have ſufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
that the Spring of the Air in its natural or wonted
ſtate, hath a force very conſiderable, and indeed much Greater
than men ſeem to have hitherto believed; Yet I could not hope
by any of theſe Experiments to determine by any known weight,
how Great that force is, ſo as to conclude that it is equivalent to
ſuch a Weight, as ſo many Pounds, Ounces, &amp;c. and to no more.
Wherefore among the Uſes I had deſign'd to make of our Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe,
formerly often mentioned, it was One, to try if by the help
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102306:94"/>
of that Inſtrument, we could determine ſomewhat near (for no
more was to be expected) how much Weight a Cylinder of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compreſt
Air included in it, and conſequently of the ſame Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vvith the cavity of the Barrel, would be able to ſuſtain or alſo
to lift up.</p>
               <p>In order to this Tryal, 1. we provided a ſtable Pedeſtal, or
Frame, wherein the Syringe might be kept firm, and erected.
Next, vve alſo provided a Weight of Lead ſhap'd like our Braſs-hoop,
or Ring,<note n="*" place="margin">Expe. the <hi>Vth.</hi>
                  </note> formerly deſcrib'd, that by the advantage of its
figure it might be made to hang down by ſtrings from the top of
the Handle of the Rammer, and ſo preſs evenly enough on all
ſides, without making the upper part of the inſtrument top-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.
3. We took care to leave, between the bottom of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
(which was firmly clos'd with ſtrong Cement) and that
part of it where the Sucker was, a convenient quantity of Air, to
expand its ſelf, and lift up the Weight, when the Air external to
that included Air ſhould be pump'd out of the Receiver: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Handle of the Rammer (from which the Annular weight
lately ſpoken of depended) was ſo faſtned to the Turning-key of
the Cover of the Receiver, that the Weight might not compreſs
the Air included in the Syringe, but leave it in its natural ſtate or
wonted Laxity, till the Air were withdrawn from the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all this, when we actually tryed the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
That hapned which I feared. For though by this method
the included Air would well enough lift up a Weight of 7 or 8
pound, yet when the Rammer came to be clogg'd with ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a Weight, as my ſcope in making the Experiment requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Inſtrument prov'd not ſo ſtanch, but that it was eaſier
for ſome particles of Air to force themſelves a paſſage, and get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
between the Sucker and the inſide of the Barrel, than to
heave up ſo great a Weight. And yet I have thought fit to relate
the Experiment thus particularly, becauſe, if an exact Syringe
can be procured, (which I fear will be very difficult, but do not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102306:95"/>
think impoſſible, this ſeems to be one of the likelieſt and leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable
wayes I know, of meaſuring the force of the Airs
Spring.</p>
               <p>But deſpairing to get ſuch a Syringe, as I deſir'd, in the place
where I then was, I bethought my ſelf of another way, by which
I hop'd to be able (though not to arrive at an exact knowledge
of the full force of the Airs Spring, yet) at leaſt to approach nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
it than I have been able to do by the help of the Syringe. For
this purpoſe conſidering with my ſelf, that if a convenient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Air were included in a fine ſmall Bladder, the ſides of it
would hinder the Air from getting away, and the limberneſs of
them would permit the Air to accommodate it ſelf and the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the Figure of a Cylindrical veſſel, into which it might be
put.</p>
               <p>Wherefore with much adoe I procured to be made by a perſon
exerciſed in Turning a couple of hollow Cylinders, whoſe ſides
were of a ſufficient thickneſs, (that they might reſiſt the preſſure
of the Air to be impriſoned in them,) and of ſuch differing
breadths, that the firſt had but one inch in Diameter, and the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
two; their depths being alſo unequal, that the one might receive
a much larger Bladder than the other.</p>
               <p>With the leſſer of theſe (which was very carefully Turned) I
made a diligent Tryal; whoſe Circumſtances I cannot now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
Your Lordſhip with, the Paper, wherein they vvere am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
recorded, having been vvith other Notes belonging to this
Continuation unluckily loſt: but the moſt conſiderable things in
the Event were, That twas very difficult to procure a Bladder
ſmall and fine enough for that litle Cylinder; and that one, which
at length we procured, would not continue ſtanch for many Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
but would after a vvhile part with a litle Air in the well exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
Receiver, when twas clog'd with the utmoſt Weight it could
ſuſtain: but whilſt it continued ſtanch vve made one fair Tryal
vvith it, from vvhence vve concluded, that a Cylinder of Air of
but an inch in Diameter, and leſſe than two inches in length, was
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102306:95"/>
able to raiſe viſibly (though but a litle) a Weight of above ten
Pounds, (I ſpeak of Averdupoiz vveights, vvhere a Pound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
16 ounces.) The manner of making this Experiment, and
the cautions us'd in judging of it, Your Lorſhip may learn by the
recital of the ſubſequent Tryal; my Notes about which were not

               <p>Into a hollow Cylinder of Wood of four inches in depth,<note place="margin">See plate the Figure the</note> and
two in Diameter, furniſhed with a broad and ſolid bottom or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal,
to make it ſtand the firmer, was put a Lambs or Sheeps
bladder very ſtrongly tyed at the Neck, on vvhich vvas put a
Wooden Plug, markt with Ink where the Edg of the Cylinder
vvas contiguous to it; this Plug being loaded with Weights, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting
to 35 pound, (the uppermoſt of vvhich Weights was
faſtned to the Turning-key, to keep it upright, and to help to
raiſe it at firſt,) the Receiver vvas exhauſted, till the Mark ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
very manifeſtly above the brim of the Cylinder; and then,
though the ſtring were by turning the Key quite ſlackned, yet
the mark on the Plug continued very viſible: and vvhen ſo much
Air was let into the Receiver, as made the Weight depreſs the
Plug quite beneath the Mark, upon the repumping out of the Air
the Weight was without the help of any Turning-key lifted up,
and by degrees all the mark on the Plug was raiſed about 3/8 above
the edge of the Cylinder.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we ſubſtituted for a 7 pound weight one that was
eſtimated at 14, (for then we had not a Ballance ſtrong enough to
weigh it with,) and uſing the ſame Bladder we repeated the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
onely having a care to ſupport a litle the uppermoſt
Weight by the Turning-key, till the Bladder had attained its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion;
and then the Weight being gently let go, depreſs'd not
the Plug ſo low, but that we could yet ſee the mark on it, (which
yet was all we could do,) though that part of the Plug, where the
mark vvas, vvere manifeſtly more depreſt than the other.</p>
               <p>For the clearing up of ſome particulars relating to this Tryal,
we will ſubjoyn the following Notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:102306:96"/>
1. The Plug is to be ſo fitted to the Cavity of the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder,
as eaſily to ſlip up and down in it, without Grating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſides of it, leſt it needleſly increaſe the reſiſtance of the
Weight to be rais'd. And this Plug ought to be of a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
length, as about an inch and 1/2 at leaſt, that it may be the fitter
to help to reduce the Bladder by compreſſion into a ſomewhat
Cylindrical ſhape, and yet that it may not be thruſt in too deep by
the incumbent Weight; and that the Weight might reſt more
firmly upon it, there was a broad and ſtrong Ledge made at the
top of it, by which it might lean on every ſide upon the brim of
the hollow Cylinder.</p>
               <p>2. Before the Inſtrument was conveyed into the Receiver,
the Bladder (which ought to be of a juſt ſize, and not full blown,
and of a fine and limber contexture) was put into the Cylinder,
and by divers gradual (but not immoderate) compreſſions was
reduc'd to conform its ſelf, as much as might be, to the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical
ſhape of the containing veſſel. And then the Weight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put on, and taken off again, there was a mark (in the form of
an horizontally plac'd Arch) made with Ink, where the edge of
the brim of the hollow Cylinder did almoſt touch the Plug. This
we thought neceſſary to do, to avoid a miſtake; for we muſt not
judg, that all the Weight, that might be rais'd by our Bladder,
may paſs for the Weight ſought after by our Experiment; ſince
the Air in the Bladder is by reaſon of the incumbent weight more
compreſt than twas before, and conſequently its being able to
heave up a Great weight will not infer, that our common Air is
able in its natural ſtate (as they call it) to exert ſo Great a ſtrength;
that Weight being onely to be lookt on as rais'd or ſuſtain'd by
the uncompreſt Air, that is rais'd or ſuſtain'd when the Plug is
lifted up to the mark, ſince till then the Spring of the Air does
but bring it back from its new ſtate of adventitious compreſſion
to its natural or wonted Laxity.</p>
               <p>3. When, after the operation was ended, we took the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
out of the veſſel, it had obtain'd a form Cylindrical enough,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102306:96"/>
and though it could be but 2 inches in Diameter, yet it was ſo
litle as to be but half an inch more long than broad.</p>
               <p>4. The reaſon why I choſe to have the two Cylinders made
of the unequal Diameters above mentioned, was to examine, as
far as by this way I could, a conjecture I had, that the force of the
Spring of differing Cylinders of Air to lift up ſolid Weights,
would, <hi>at the very firſt raiſing of the Weights,</hi> be in duplicate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Diameters of their Cylinders, (thoſe Diameters
being proportionable to the Areas of the plain Superficies, againſt
which the Air does immediately preſs,) without very much conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the inequality that may be between the quantity of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parcels of Air, whoſe preſſures are compared. But tis to
be remembred, that I ſaid <hi>at the very firſt raiſing of the weights,</hi>
becauſe preſently after That, the quantity of the parcels of Air
may be very conſiderable: for, as I have ſhewn in another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
two very unequal quantities of Air being made by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion
to poſſeſs two equal ſpaces, the leſſer quantity of Air muſt
be much more rarified in proportion than the greater; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
(to bring this home to our preſent Argument) though
both be lifted up ¼ or ½ of an inch, the Spring of a very litle Air
muſt be much more weakned than that of a very conſiderable
Quantity, and ſo it cannot <hi>continue</hi> to lift up its weight, as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
mentioned proportion would (if it were not for this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement)
ſeem to require.</p>
               <p>Taking then our conjecture in the ſenſe now declared, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of our Tryals is agreeable to it, inviting us to conclude, that
the Air in the Bladder, which was but two inches in Diameter,
was able by its Preſſure to countervaile the weight of 42 pound,
which is about four times the weight that we lately obſerv'd the
Spring of a Cylinder of Air of one inch in Diameter to be able
to lift up. For though, according to what we have formerly ſaid
of a duplicate proportion, 42 pound ſeems to be ſomewhat more
than ought to have been lifted up in the Cylinder of two inches
bore, when that of one inch lifted up not much above 10 pound;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102306:97"/>
yet this diſagrees not with the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> if we conſider that the
ſubſtance of the Bladder ſtraitens the cavity of the ſmaller Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in a Greater proportion than that of the bigger.</p>
               <p>5. Though we have thus (as far as the Inſtruments we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to procure would aſſiſt us) meaſured the Preſſure of included
Air, yet I muſt not forbear to advertiſe Your Lordſhip, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
what I formerly obſerv'd to You about the weight of an
Atmoſpherical Pillar of an inch in Diameter, I cannot but think,
that if a Cylinder, or other convenient inſtrument, exactly Tite,
can be procured, the Spring of an Aerial Cylinder will appear to
be Greater than we found it by the foregoing Tryals; in which
I conſider that, not to mention the reſiſtance of the Bladder its
ſelf, the membraneous ſubſtance that lin'd the Cylinders (though
twere very thin and fine) could not but ſomewhat ſtraiten their
Cavities, and conſequently ſomewhat (though not much) leſſen
the Diameters of the included Aerial Cylinders.</p>
               <p>6. To all theſe Notes I muſt adde this Advertiſement, That
it may be therefore the more difficult in ſuch Tryals as ours to
<hi>aſcertain</hi> the force of the Airs Spring, becauſe, that Air its ſelf
when tis included, being ſhut up with the Preſſure of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere
upon it, tis probable, that ſince that Preſſure (as we have
ſhewn) is not at all times the ſame, the Spring of the included
Air will accordingly be varied. And, if my memory fail me not,
when the lately recited Experiments were made, our Barometer
declared the Atmoſphere to be ſomewhat light.</p>
               <p>From what has been hitherto delivered, this may reſult; that
tis likely, that the Spring of an Aerial Cylinder an inch broad,
may be able to ſuſtain, if not raiſe, a pretty deal more than ten
pound Weight; and that the paſt Tryals, without determining
that the Air can raiſe no more than in them it did, do, at leaſt,
prove that it can raiſe up as much Weight as we have related,
ſince we actually found it to do ſo.</p>

yet fit to be ſhewn to Strangers, to convince them, that the

               <p>We took then a Braſs veſſel made like a Cylinder, and having
one of his Orifices exactly covered with a flat Plate very firmly
faſtned to it, the other Orifice being wide open. The depth of
this veſſel was 4 inches, and the Diameter ſhould have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
(but wanted about a quarter of an inch of) 4 inches. To
this hollow Cylinder we fitted a wooden Plug, like one of thoſe

was purpoſely made of a conſiderable breadth, that it might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford

and having convey'd them into the Receiver, we found
as we expected, that if we had loaded the Plug but with a ſingle
Weight, (as to avoid trouble, and the danger of breaking the
Glaſs we uſually thought fit to do,) though that were a common
half hundred weight, (which You know amounts to 56 pounds,)
it would very quickly be manifeſtly heav'd up by the Spring of
the included Air. For confirmation of more than which, I ſhall
ſubjoyn the enſuing Tryal, as I find it recorded among my looſe
Notes.</p>
               <p>The Weight that was lifted up by the Bladder in the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
4 inches broad, was 75 pound; this Weight was lifted up till
the wooden Plug <hi>diſclos'd</hi> the Mark, that was to ſhew the height,
at which the Air kept the ſaid Plug before it was compreſt: <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd</hi>
it I ſay <hi>viſibly</hi> at the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Exuction, and at the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> that mark
was ⅛, or rather 3/16 above the Edge of the Cylinder. In the Gage
where the Mercury in the open Air was wont to ſtand about ⅛ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the uppermoſt Glaſs-mark, it was depreſt till it was ⅛ below
the ſecond mark. When the Air was let in, it was a pretty while
before the Weight did manifeſtly begin to ſubſide; the Bladder
being taken out, and the place it had poſſeſs'd in the Cylinder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſupply'd with a Sleeve, or ſome ſuch thing, and the Weight
laid again upon the Plug, we found that at 24 Exuctions the
Mercury was depreſt to the loweſt Mark of the Gage; and it was
the 34 or 35<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Exuction before the Receiver appear'd to be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
as to put an end to the ſinking of the Mercury, which
was then above ⅛ beneath the loweſt mark.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip will eaſily believe, that moſt of the Spectators
of ſuch Tryals thought it ſomewhat ſtrange to ſee a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Air, which was not onely uncompreſt in the Bladder, but
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102306:98"/>
did not near fill it, (and left it very ſoft and yielding to the leaſt
touch,) lift up ſo eaſily by its bare Spring ſuch Great Weights as
indeavoured to oppreſs it. But this not being any thing near a
ſufficient Tryal, how far the conjecture or <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> formerly
propos'd will hold, I thought fit to make the utmoſt Tryals the
talleſt Receivers I could procure would admit: and having caus'd
leaden weights to be purpoſely caſt flat like Cheeſes, and as broad
as we could conveniently put into the Receiver, that by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of this ſhape we might be able to pile up the more of
them, without much danger that any of them ſhould be ſhaken
down; we laid divers of them one upon another, and then the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part of the Receiver growing too narrow to admit more of
them, we added a leſs broad Weight or two; and then exhauſting
the Receiver, till we perceiv'd by the Gage that the Air was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
withdrawn, we found (as near as we could meaſure) by the
help of a Mark and a pair of Compaſſes, that the Plug was ſo far
rais'd, as that twas concluded, that the Elevation vvould have been
much Greater, if the included Air, being put upon ſo Great a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi>
had not found it eaſier to produce ſome Leak at the neck of
the Bladder, than to lift up ſo Great a Weight, which by our
Reckoning came to about 100 pound of 16 ounces to the pound.
But this laſt Experiment, for want of ſome requiſite accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
vve vvere hinder'd from repeating and promoting; though
the above mentioned <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> made me preſume, that a far
Greater weight might this way have been rais'd if the Bladder had
been ſtanch, and the Receiver high enough.</p>
               <p>I need not tell Your Lordſhip, that if a larger Bladder be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
and included in a Braſs veſſel of a ſufficiently wide Orifice,
a far Greater weight may be lifted up by the Spring of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Air. But yet it will not be amiſs to give Your Lordſhip on this
occaſion this Advertiſement, which may be fit to be taken notice
of on divers others: That care muſt be had not to make Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
that ought to be well emptied, too large, and eſpecially too
wide at the Orifice; for otherwayes they will be expos'd to ſo
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102306:99"/>
great a Preſſure of the Atmoſphere, that they need be of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ſtrength to reſiſt it; and even Receivers, that ſeem'd
thick enough proportionably to their bulk, and which held out
very well till the cloſe of the Operation, yet when they came to
be very diligently exhauſted, they did, by reaſon of the wideneſs
of their Orifices, begin to crack at the bottom.</p>

               <head>EXPERIMENT XLIX.</head>
               <p>IN one of my publiſh'd Experiments<note n="*" place="margin">viz. the XXXVI.</note> I long ſince told Your
Lordſhip, that when I endeavoured, by the help of a ſeal'd bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
weigh'd in an exhauſted Receiver, to compare the Gravity
of Air and Water, I was hinder'd by the caſual breaking of the
Glaſs from compleating the Experiment. Wherefore I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thought fit to repeat the Tryal; and though when I had
done ſo twice or thrice, having given away the large Receiver I
had made uſe of about them, and not being able ever ſince to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a Good one, that was capacious enough for the tender Scales
I thought ſo nice an Experiment required, I did not proſecute that
Attempt ſo far as I intended; yet this very difficulty I met with
to procure the Requiſites of making the Tryal, invites me to
ſubjoyn the two following Notes, which I find among my looſe
Papers.</p>
               <p>We weigh'd a Bubble in the Receiver,<note place="margin">April the 19. 1662.</note> which we found to
weigh above half a Grain heavier, when much of the Air was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
than when it was full. Afterwards we took out this ſeal'd
Bubble, and weighing it found it to weigh 68 Grains and a half;
then breaking off the ſmall tip of it under water, we found that the
heat, by which it was ſeal'd up, had rarifi'd its included Air, ſo that
it admitted 125 Grains of Water, for the admitted Water and
Glaſs weighed 193 ½ Grains. Then filling it full with Water,
we found it to contain in all 739 Grains of Water, for it weighed
807 1/2 Grains: whence tis evident, that the difference between
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102306:99"/>
the weight of Water and Air was leſs than 1228 to 1.]</p>
               <p>We weighed in the Receiver a Bubble,<note place="margin">May. 26. 1662.</note> the Glaſs of which
weighed 60 Grains: the Air that fill'd it weighed <hi>in vacuo</hi> 27/32 of a
Grain: the Water that fill'd it weighed 720 ¼ Grains: So that by
this Experiment the proportion of the weight of Air to Water is
as (one) to (853 17/27.)</p>
               <p>The Tryals mentioned in theſe Notes, though they were too
few for me to acquieſce in, yet being made in a nevv vvay, and
which has ſome advantages above thoſe that have been hitherto
imployed to weigh the Air, may yet ſerve to keep us from the
contrary. Extremes, that have not been avoided by ſuch eminent
Mathematicians as <hi>Galileo</hi> and <hi>Ricciolus;</hi> the former of which
makes Water to be but about 400 times as heavy the Air; and
the later, whoſe conjecture is much remoter from the Truth,
10000 times heavier.</p>
               <p>But it is ſo deſireable a thing, and may prove of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
to know the proportion in Weight betwixt Air and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that I ſhall not ſcruple to acquaint Your Lordſhip with an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
or two that I made to diſcover it by another way: For,
though at firſt ſight this Experiment may ſeem to be the ſame
with one publiſh'd a pretty while ago in the learned <hi>Schottus</hi> his
<hi>Mechanica Hydraulico pneumatica;</hi> yet Your Lordſhip will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive this difference between them: That, whereas the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
Author of that Experiment contents himſelf to ſhew,
by the diminution of the weight of a Glaſs, when the Air has been
drawn out of it, that the Air, before twas drawn out, was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
of Gravity; the following Tryal does not onely perform
the ſame thing, and by a ſuperadded circumſtance confirm the
Truth to be thereby prov'd, but it indeavours alſo to ſhew the
Proportion in Gravity betwixt the Air and Water. The Tryals
themſelves were regiſtred among my <hi>Adverſaria</hi> as follows.</p>
               <p>A ſmall Receiver being exhauſted of Air by the Engine, and
counterpois'd whilſt it continued ſo; the Stop-cock was turn'd,
and the Air readmitted, which made it weigh 36 Grains more
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102306:100"/>
than it did before: and to prevent Jealouſies, we caus'd it
to be applied the ſecond time to the Engine, by which the Air
being emptied once more, the Glaſs was put into the other Scale
of the former Ballance, and ſo counterpois'd; and then the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Air being readmitted, (which ruſh'd in as formerly with a
whiſtling noiſe), there was found 36 Grains or better, requiſite to
reſtore the Ballance to an <hi>Aequilibrium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We took a ſmall Glaſs Receiver fitted with a Stopcock, and
having exhauſted it of the Air, and counterpois'd it, and let in the
outward Air, we found the vveight of the Veſſel to be increaſed
by that admiſſion 36 Grains. This done, we took the Receiver,
after having well counterpois'd it, out of the Scale; and having
apply'd it the ſecond time to the Engine, we once more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
the Air, and then turning the Stop-cock to keep out the
external Air, vve took care that none of the Cement, imploy'd
to joyn it to the Engine, ſhould ſtick to it, as we had diligently
freed it from adherent Cement before we laſt apply'd it to the
Engine. Then weighing it again, we found it to weigh either
35 or 36 Grains (but rather the former) heavier than it did, when
twas laſt counterpois'd in the ſame Ballance. This being alſo
done, we immers'd the Stop-cock into a Baſon of fair Water,
and let in the Liquor, that we might find how much Water
would ſucceed in place of the Air vve had drawn out. When no
more vvater vvas impell'd in, vve turned the Stop-cock once
more, to keep it from falling out, and then weighing it in the
ſame Scales, (after we had wip'd the Stop-cock, that no Water
might ſtick to it on the outſide,) we found the water (without
computing the veſſel) to weigh 47 ounces, 3 drachms, and 6
Grains, vvhich divided by 35 Grains, (which I took to be the
weight of the Air, that vvas equal in Bulk to this vvater that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
it,) the Quotient was (wanting a very litle) 650 Grains,
for the proportion of the vveight between Air and Water of the
ſame bigneſs, <hi>at the time when the Experiment was made:</hi> vvhich
circumſtance I therefore take notice of, becauſe the Atmoſphere
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102306:100"/>
appear'd by the Baroſcope (wherein the Mercury ſtood then at
29 inches and 3/4) to be very heavy; which made me the leſs won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to find this proportion not ſo Great, as at other times I had
obſerved it to be between Water and Air in point of weight:
though I ſuſpected, that becauſe this odd Experiment cannot be
nimbly diſpatched, ſome litle Air may have got in at the Stop-cock,
beſides the Air that diſclos'd it ſelf in numerous bubbles in
the vvater that vvas admitted, vvhere though it lay in ſuch ſmall
particles as not to be diſcerned before; yet theſe particles, by this
opportunity to expand themſelves, extricated themſelves from
the vvater, and by getting together might <hi>ſomewhat</hi> reſiſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of more; vvhich is a difficulty, vvhere to the meaſuring the
proportion between VVater and Air in a heated Eoliple is liable.
But the Stealing in of any Air, before the vvater vvas let in, is
mentioned but as a Suſpicion.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip may perhaps think it ſomewhat ſtrange, that
I ſhould preſent You Tryals, whoſe Events do not ſo vvell agree
together, as perchance You expected. But this very Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vvas one of the motives that induc'd me to acquaint You
vvith them: for all thoſe compris'd in theſe Experiments being
made faithfully, and not without (at the leaſt) an ordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
as they ſeem to make it probable, that one may without
any Great errour eſtimate the proportion of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Air to
VVater to be as (One) to ſome number betwixt 600 and 1100;
ſo tis not to be expected, that the Proportion, vvhatever it be
that ſhould be pitch'd upon, ſhould be accurate and ſtable. For
though Learned men ſeem to have hitherto taken it for granted,
that it may ſuffice once for all diligently to inveſtigate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
betwixt thoſe two Bodies, yet, not onely I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that a Determinate quantity of Air (as a Pint or Quart)
may be unequally heavy in diſtant Countreys, and even in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
places of the ſame Countrey; but what I have taken notice of
in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the printed Experiments, and afterwards frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerv'd of the Great inequalities of the vveight of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102306:101"/>
inclines me to think, that in the ſelf ſame place two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
may be made with the ſame Inſtruments, and equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and yet the weights of the Air may be found differing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
which may keep Your Lordſhip from much wondering,
that in the 36<hi rend="sup">th</hi> printed Experiment, made when I had the variations
of the Atmoſpheres Gravity in my Eye, I found the Air to be
leſs ponderous in reference to Water, than in theſe later Tryals.
But of this I hope I ſhall, if God permit, make further Tryals
with the ſame veſſels, at times when I ſhall perceive by the Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope,
that the Gravity of the Atmoſphere is very Great and very
Small. And I wiſh the Curious would make the like Tryals in
other Regions. I do not forget, that not onely the School phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
but moſt of the Moderns deny, that Air hath any
weight in Air, no more than Water in Water; but having<note n="a" place="margin">In the Hydroſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes.</note> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where

I ſhall not here ſpend any of the litle time I have remaining,

Grounds in the newly related Experiments, eſpecially if
You pleaſe to conſider, that though the Opinion I diſallow have
been chiefly and generally grounded upon ſome Arguments ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

I had made to make a couple of coherent Marbles fall aſunder, by
withdrawing the Air from them; but though I then eſteem'd that
their Cohaeſion depended upon the Preſſure of the Air, yet not
being at that time furniſh'd with all the accommodations requiſite

               <p>We took two flat round Marbles, each of them of two
inches and about 3 quarters in Diameter, and having put a litle
Oyl between them to keep out the Air, we hung at a Hook faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the Lowermoſt a Pound weight to ſurmount the Cohaeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which the tenacity of the Oyl and the imperfect Exhauſtion
of the Receiver might give them. Then having ſuſpended them
in the cavity of a Receiver, at a ſtick that lay (Horizontally) a
croſs it; when the Engine was fill'd, and ready to work, we ſhook
it ſo ſtrongly, that thoſe that were wont to manage it, concluded,
it would not be near ſo much ſhaken by the Operation. Then
beginning to pump out the Air, we obſerv'd the Marbles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
joyned till it was ſo far drawn out, that we began to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
whether they would ſeparate. But at the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Suck, <hi>upon
the turning of the Stop-cock,</hi> (which gave the Air a paſſage out of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102306:102"/>
the Receiver into the Pump,) the ſhaking of the Engine being
almoſt, if not quite, over, the Marbles ſpontaneouſly fell aſunder,
wanting that Preſſure of the Air, that formerly had kept them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
which Event was the more conſiderable, not onely becauſe
they hung parallel to the Horizon, but adher'd ſo firmly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when they were put in, that having try'd to pull them aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and thereby obſerv'd how cloſe they ſtuck together, I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
it would coſt a good deal of pains ſo far to withdraw the Air,
as to make them ſeparate: which Conjecture Your Lordſhip will
the leſs wonder at, if I adde, that a weight of 80 and odd pounds,
faſtned to the lowermoſt Marble, may be drawn up together
with the uppermoſt, by vertue of the firmneſs of their Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>NB. This is not the onely time that this Experiment ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with us. For ſometimes, when they were not ſo cloſely preſs'd
together before they were put in, the Disjunction was made at
the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Suck, or ſooner, and we ſeem'd to our ſelves to obſerve,
that when we hung but half a pound weight to the lower Marble,
it requir'd a Greater exhauſtion of the Receiver to ſeparate them,
than when we hung the whole Pound.</p>
               <p>After, having proceeded thus far with the Inſtruments we
then had, meeting with an Artificer that was not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful,
we directed him to make (what we wanted before in that
place) ſuch a Braſs-plate to ſerve for a Cover or Cap to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
orifice of Receivers open at the top, as we have divers times
had occaſion to mention already in giving accounts of ſome of
the foregoing Tryals: by the help of which Contrivance we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
the newly related Experiment much further than we could
do before, as may appear by the following account.</p>
               <p>We faſten'd to the lower moſt of the two Marbles a weight of
a very few ounces, (for I remember not the preciſe number,) and
having cemented the capp'd Receiver with the Marbles in it, as
before, to the Pump, we did by a ſtring, whereof one end was tied
to the bottom of this Turning-key, and the other to the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102306:102"/>
Marble, and which (ſtring) paſt through the Crank or
Hook belonging to the Braſs-Cover; we did, I ſay, by the help
of this ſtring, and by turning round the Key, draw up the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Marble, and by reaſon of their coherence the lowermoſt alſo,
together with the weight that hung at it: by which means being
ſure, that the two Marbles ſtuck cloſe together, we began to
pump out the Air that kept them coherent; and after a while, the
Air being pretty well withdrawn, the Marbles fell aſunder. But we
having ſo order'd the matter, that the lowermoſt could fall but a
litle way beneath the other, we were able by inclining and ſhaking
the Engine to place them one upon another again, and then let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the Air ſomewhat haſtily, that by its Spring it might preſs
them hard together, we found the Expedient to ſucceed ſo well,
that we were not onely able by turning the abovementioned Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrical
Key, to make the uppermoſt Marble take up the other,
and the annexed weight; but we were fain to make a much more
laborious and diligent Exhauſtion of the Air to procure the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of the Marbles this ſecond time, than was neceſſary to
do it at the firſt.</p>
               <p>And for further prevention of the Objections or Scruples that
I foreſaw ſome Prepoſſeſſions might ſuggeſt, I thought fit to
make this further Tryal, that when the Marbles were thus aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the Receiver exhauſted, we did, before we let in the Air,
make the Marbles fall upon one another as before; but the litle
and highly expanded Air that remained in the Receiver, having
not a Spring near ſtrong enough to preſs them together, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Key we very eaſily rais'd the uppermoſt Marble alone,
without finding it to ſtick to the other as before. Whereupon
we once more joyn'd the Marbles together, and then letting in
the external Air, we found them afterwards to ſtick ſo cloſe, that
I could not without inconvenience ſtrain any further, than I fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
did, to pull them fairly aſunder; and therefore gave them to
one that was ſtronger than I, to try, whether he could do it, which
He alſo in vain attempted to perform.</p>

               <p>HE that ſhall take the pains to peruſe the following Paper, will
eaſily believe me, when I tell him, that twas not deſign'd to
come abroad with the Experiments, in whoſe company it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.
But the Stationer earneſtly repreſenting that divers Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
being reſerved by me for another occaſion, the remaining
ones alone would not give the Book a Thickneſs any thing proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to its Breadth; I conſented, at his ſollicitation, to annexe to
them the following Obſervations, becauſe of ſome affinity between the
ſmall Atmoſpheres of leſser Bodies, and the great Atmoſphere that
ſurrounds the Terreſtrial Globe; in which the other, that do at leaſt
help to compoſe it, are loſt and confounded, as Brooks and Rivers are
in the Ocean. And to ſave the Reader the pains of making Gueſſes
to what kind of Writing the enſuing Diſcourſe may belong, I ſhall
here intimate, that tis diſmembred from certain Papers about Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Qualities in general, which make part of the Notes I long ſince
deſigned, and alſo partly publiſhed, about the <hi>Origine of Qualities,</hi>
of which Notes thoſe that concern'd <hi>Effluviums,</hi> being the moſt copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
I referr'd them to four general Heads; whereof the firſt onely is
treated of in the following Diſcourſe, the others being withheld, as
having not affinity enough with the Atmoſphere to accompany This,
whereon they have no ſuch abſolute Dependance, but that they may
well enough ſpare it. And I make the leſs Scruple to let it appear
without them, becauſe the Inducements already mentioned are not
a litle ſtrengthned by this ſuperadded Conſideration, That the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Notes may give light to ſeveral of the Obſervations I have
<pb facs="tcp:102306:105"/>
made of ſome leſſe heeded Phanomena of the Alterations of the

               <head>Of the Atmoſpheres of Conſiſtent Bodies.</head>
               <p>THe School Philoſophers, and the Vulgar, in conſidering the
more abſtruſe Operations and <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, are
wont to run into Extremes; which, though oppoſite to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
do almoſt equally contribute to keep men ignorant of the
true cauſes of thoſe Effects they admire. For the Vulgar, being
accuſtomed to converſe with ſenſible objects, and to conceive
groſly of things, cannot eaſily imagine any other Agents in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then thoſe that they can ſee, if not alſo touch, and handle;
and as ſoon as they meet with an Effect, that they cannot aſcribe
to ſome palpable, or at leaſt ſenſible Efficient, they are, and ſtick
not to confeſs themſelves utterly at a loſs. And though the
vulgar of Philoſophers will not acknowledg themſelves to be
poſ'd by the ſame <hi>phaenomena</hi> with the vulgar of Men, yet in effect
they are ſo. But the School-philoſophers on the contrary, do
not onely refuſe to acquieſce in ſenſible Agents, but to ſolve the
more Myſterious <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, nay and moſt of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
ones too, they ſcruple not to run too far to the other ſide,
and have their recourſe to Agents that are not onely inviſible,
but inconceivable, at leaſt to men that cannot admit any ſave Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and conſiſtent Nations: they aſcribe all abſtruſe Effects
to certain ſubſtantial Forms, which however they call Material,
becauſe of their dependence on Matter, they give ſuch Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to, as belong but to Spiritual Beings: as if all the abſtruſer
Effects of Nature, if they be not perform'd by viſible Bodies,
muſt be ſo by immaterial ſubſtances: whereas betwixt viſible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Spiritual Beings there is a middle ſort of Agents, inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Corpuſcles; by which a Great part of the difficulter <hi>phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
of Nature are produc'd, and by which may intelligibly be
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102306:106"/>
explicated thoſe <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which 'twere abſurd to refer to the
former, and precarious to attribute to the latter. Now for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
ſake I will refer the Notes, that occur to me about Effluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,
to four Heads; whereof the firſt is mentioned in the Title
of this Paper, and each of the other three ſhall be ſucceſſively trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of in as many diſtinct ones.</p>
               <p>That Fluid Bodies, as Liquors, and ſuch as are manifeſtly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moiſt, or ſoft, ſhould eaſily ſend forth Emanations, will I
preſume be granted without much difficulty; eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſenſible Evaporation that is obvious to be obſerv'd in
Water, Wine, Urine, &amp;c. and the looſe contexture of parts that
is ſuppos'd to be requiſite to conſtitute ſoft Bodies, (as Flowers,
Balſomes, and the like:) but that even Hard and ponderous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
notwithſtanding the Solidity and ſtrict coheſion of their
component parts, ſhould likewiſe emit Steams, will to many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
improbable enough to need to be ſolemnly prov'd.</p>
               <p>Whether you admit the Atomical <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> or prefer the
Carteſian, I think it may be probably deduc'd from either, that
very many of the Bodies we are treating of, may be ſuppos'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haleable
as to their very minute parts. For according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Lucippus, Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> each indiviſible parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Matter hath eſſentially either a conſtant actual motion,
or an unlooſeable endeavour after it, ſo that though it may be
ſo complicated in ſome Concretions, with other minute parts, as
to have its Avolation hindred for a while; yet it can ſcarce other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be, but by this inceſſant Indeavour of all the Atomes to get
looſe, ſome of them ſhould from time to time be able to extricate
themſelves, and fly away. And though the Carteſians do not
allow Matter to have any innate motion, yet according to them
both Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals, conſiſt of litle parts ſo
contexed, that their Pores give paſſage to a Celeſtial Matter; ſo
that this Matter continually ſtreaming through them, may well
be preſum'd to ſhake the Corpuſcles that compoſe them: by which
continued concuſſion now ſome Particles, and then others, will
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102306:106"/>
be thrown and carried off into the Air, or other contiguous Body,
fitted to receive them. But though by theſe, and perhaps other
conſiderations, I might indeavour to ſhew <hi>à priori,</hi> as they ſpeak,
that tis probable Conſiſtent Bodies themſelves are exhaleable,
yet I think it may be as ſatisfactory, and more uſeful, to prove it
<hi>à poſteriori,</hi> by particular Experiments, and other Examples.</p>
               <p>That then a dry and conſiſtent form does not neceſſarily infer,
in the Bodies that are endowed with it, an indiſpoſition to ſend
forth Steams, which are as it were litle Colonies of Particles, is
evident, not onely in the leaves of Damask Roſes, whether freſh
or dried; as alſo in Wormwood, Mint, Rue, &amp;c: but in Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greece,
Musk, Storax, Cinamon, Nutmegs, and other odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and ſpicy bodies. But more eminent Examples to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
purpoſe may be afforded us by Camphire, and volatile Salts,
ſuch as are Chymically obtain'd from Harts-horn, Blood, &amp;c. for
theſe are ſo fugitive, that ſometimes I have had a conſiderable
Lump of volatile Salt (either of fermented Urine, or of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn)
fly away by litle and litle out of a Glaſs, that had been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſtopt with a Cork, without leaving ſo much as a Grain of
Salt behind it. And as for Camphire, though by its being uneaſie
to be powder'd, it ſeems to have ſomething of Toughneſs or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacity
in it; yet I remember, that having for tryals ſake counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pois'd
it in nice Scales, even a ſmall lump of it would in a few hours
ſuffer a viſible loſs of its weight, by the avolation of ſtrongly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Corpuſcles, and this, though the Experiment were made
both in a North Window, and in Winter.</p>
               <p>But I expect you ſhould require Inſtances of the Effluviums of
Bodies of a cloſe or ſolid Texture; wherefore I proceed to take
notice, that Amber, Hard wax, and many other Electrical bodies
do, when they are rubb'd, emit Effluviums. For though I will
not now meddle with the ſeveral Opinions about the cauſe and
manner of Electrical Attraction, yet beſides that almoſt all the
Modern Naturaliſts, that aim at explicating things intelligibly,
aſcribe the Attraction we are ſpeaking of to Corporeal effluxes;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102306:107"/>
and beſides that I ſhall ere long have occaſion to ſhew you, that
there is no need to admit with Carteſius, That becauſe ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectrical
bodies are very cloſe and fixt, what they emit upon rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
is not part of their own Subſtance, but ſomewhat that was
harbour'd in their Pores: beſides theſe things, I ſay, I have found
that many Electrical bodies may by the very Noſtrils be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
when they are well rubb'd, to part with ſtore of Corpuſcles,
as I have particularly, but not without attention, been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in Amber, Roſin, Brimſtone, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I know not whether it will be worth while to take notice of the
great Evaporation I have obſerv'd, even in Winter, of Fruits,
as Apples, and of Bodies that ſeem to be better cover'd, as Eggs,
which notwithſtanding the cloſeneſs of their Shels, did daily grow
manifeſtly lighter and lighter; as I obſerv'd in them, and divers
other bodies, that I kept long in Scales, and noted their Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of weight: but perhaps you will be pleas'd to hear, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a mind to ſhew how conſiderable an Evaporation is made
from Wood, I caus'd a thin Cup, capable of holding about a Pint,
or more, to be Turn'd of a Wood, that was choſen by the Turner
as ſolid and dry enough, though it were not of the cloſeſt ſort of
Woods, ſuch as are <hi>Lignum vitae,</hi> and Box. And as I caus'd the
ſhape of a Cup to be given it, that it might have a greater Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
expos'd to the Air, and conſequently might be the fitter to
emit ſtore of Steams into it; ſo the Succeſs did not onely anſwer
my Expectation, but exceed it: for though the Tryal were made
ſome time in Winter, there was ſo quick and plentiful an Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
made from the Cup, that I found it no eaſie matter to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe
it; for whilſt Grains were putting into the oppoſite
Scale, to bring the tender Ballance to an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
avolation of inviſible Steams from the Wood (which had ſo
much of Superficies contiguous to the Air) would make the Scale
that held it ſenſibly too light. And I remember, that for further
ſatisfaction, being afterwards in a City where there were both
good Materials and workmen, I order'd to be made a Boule, about
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102306:107"/>
the ſame bigneſs with the former, of well ſeaſon'd wood, which
being ſuſpended in the Chamber I lay in, (which circumſtance I
therefore mention, becauſe the Weather and a litle Phyſick I had
taken obliged me to keep a fire there,) it quickly began manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to looſe of its weight; and though the whole Cup wanted near
two Drams of 2 Ounces, yet in 12 hours, <hi>viz.</hi> from 10 a clock
in the morning to the ſame hour at night; it loſt about 40 Grains,
(for twas above 39:) but of ſuch Experiments, and the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
belonging to them, I may elſewhere ſpeak farther.</p>
               <p>It were not difficult for me to multiply Inſtances of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Emanation of Streams from Vegetable and Animal Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but I am not willing to enlarge my ſelf upon this Subject,
becauſe I conſider that there are other Bodies which ſeem ſo
much more indiſpos'd to part with Effluviums, that a few inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
given in ſuch, may evince what I would prove, much more then
a multitude produc'd in other bodies. And ſince I conſider that
thoſe Subſtances are the moſt unlikely to afford Effluvia, that
are <hi>either</hi> very cold, <hi>or</hi> very ponderous, <hi>or</hi> very ſolid and hard, <hi>or</hi>
very fixt; if I can ſhew you that neither of theſe Qualifications
can keep a Body from emitting Steams, I hope I ſhall have made
it probable, that there is no ſort of Bodies here below that may
not be thought capable of affording the Corporeal Emanations
we ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>And firſt I remember, that I have not onely taken Eggs, and
in a very ſharp Winter found them, notwithſtanding the coldneſs
of the Air where I kept them, to grow ſenſibly lighter, in a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
pair of Scales, in not very many hours; but becauſe Ice is
thought the coldeſt viſible Body we know, I thought fit to ſhew
that even this Body will looſe by Evaporation; for having coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpois'd
a convenient quantity of Ice in a good Ballance, and
forthwith expos'd it therein to the cold Air of a Froſty night, that
the Evaporations ſhould be from Ice not from Water, I found
the next morning, that though the Scale wherein the Ice were
put was dry, which argued as well as the coldneſs of the Weather
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102306:108"/>
that the expos'd Concretion had not thaw'd; yet I found its
weight to be conſiderably diminiſhed, and this Experiment I
ſuccesfully made in more than one Winter, and in more than one
place. And tis now but a few dayes ſince, expoſing not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
midnight, leſſe than two ounces of Ice in a good Ballance to
a ſharply freezing Air, I ſent for it before I was up in the morning,
and though by the dryneſs of the Scales the Ice that was in one of
them appear'd not to have thaw'd, yet it had loſt about ten Grains
of its former weight; ſo that here, the Evaporation was made in
ſpite of a double Cold, of the Ice, and of the Air.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now proceed to the mention of ponderous and ſolid
Bodies, but before I do ſo, it may be expedient to give you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that, to make the Proof of what I have propos'd more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,
and more applicable to our future purpoſes, I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to give you any Examples of the exhalations of Bodies,
where ſo potent an Agent as the Fire is made to intervene.</p>
               <p>But though I purpoſely forbear to inſiſt on ſuch Examples,
yet it may not be amiſs to intimate, that in explicating ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Qualities, even ſuch Exhalations as are produc'd by the
help of the Fire may be fit to be taken into conſideration, as we
may hereafter have occaſion to ſhew. And therefore we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in general, that the Fire is able to put the parts of Bodies
into ſo vehement a motion, that except Gold, Glaſs, and a very
few more, there are not any Bodies ſo fixt and ſolid, that tis not
thought capable to diſſipate either totally, or in part. Tis known
to thoſe that deal in the fuſion of Metals, that not onely Lead
and Tin, but much harder Bodies will emit copious and hurtful
Steams. And there are ſome kinds of that Iron, which our
Smiths call Cold ſhare iron, about whoſe ſmell whilſt it was red
hot, when I made inquiry, the ingeniouſeſt Smith I had then met
with told me, that he had found it ſeveral times to be ſo ſtrong,
and rank, that he could ſcarce indure to work with his Hammer
thoſe parcels of Metal whence it proceeded. And even without
being brought to fuſion, not onely Braſs, and Copper will, being
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102306:108"/>
well heated, become ſtrongly ſented, but Iron will be ſo too, as
is evident by the unpleaſing ſmell of many Iron-Stowes. And
on this occaſion I might not impertinently adde here a Tryal we
made to obſerve, whether the Steams of Iron may not be made,
though not immediately viſible, yet perceptible to the Eye it
ſelf, though the Metal had not a Red, much leſs a White heat.
But having elſewhere related it at large, in a Diſcourſe You may
command a ſight of, I ſhall rather refer You to it, than looſe the
time 'twould take up to tranſcribe it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premis'd, I proceed now to the mention of pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
Bodies; and concerning them, to repreſent, that if You
will admit what almoſt all the Corpuſcularians aſſert, and divers of
the Peripateticks do not now think fit to deny, that the Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
operations are perform'd by Particles iſſuing forth of the body
of the Loadſtone, or other Magnetical Agent: I ſhall not need to
go far for an Inſtance to our preſent purpoſe, ſince I have Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically
found, that ſome Loadſtones (for I have found thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
very differing in Gravity) are ſo ponderous, as to exceed
double the weight of Flints, or other Stones of the ſame bulk.</p>
               <p>But not to inſiſt on Loadſtones, Stone-cutters will inform
You, (as they did me,) that black Marble, and ſome other ſolid
and heavy ſtones will, upon the attrition they are expos'd to,
when the Workmen are poliſhing them, (eſpecially without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,)
emit, and that without the help of external heat, a very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſmell, which I found to be much more ſtrong and offenſive
when, to make it ſo, I had the curioſity to cauſe a piece of ſolid
black Marble to have divers fragments ſtruck off from it with a
Chizel and a Hammer: for the ſtroaks ſucceeding one another
faſt enough to make a great concuſſion of the parts of the black
Marble, (for in white, which is not ſo ſolid, the Tryal will not
ſucceed well,) there quickly follow'd as I expected a rank and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
ſmell; and you will grant me I know, that Odours are
not diffus'd without corporeal Emanations. I remember alſo,
that having procur'd ſome of thoſe acuminated and almoſt Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102306:109"/>
ſtones, that paſs among the vulgar for Thunder-ſtones, by
rubbing them a litle one againſt the other, I could eaſily accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my expectation excite a ſtrong Sulphureous ſtink. I have
alſo tried upon a certain Mineral Maſs, that was ponderous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as a Metal, but to Me it ſeem'd rather an unuſual kind of
Marchaſite, that I could in a trice without external heat make it
emit more ſtrongly ſented Exhalations, than I could contentedly
endure: to which I ſhall adde this Example more, that having
once made a Chemical mixture of a Metalline body, and coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Mercury, which you will believe could not but be ponderous,
though this Mixture had already endur'd as violent a fire as was
neceſſary to bring it to Fuſion, in order to caſt it into Rings; yet
it was ſo diſpos'd to part with corporeal Effluxes, that a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Perſon that practis'd Phyſick, and was there when I made
it, earneſtly begg'd a little of it of me for ſome Patients troubled
with diſtempers in the Eyes, and other parts remote enough from
the hand; which he affirm'd himſelf to have very happily cured,
by making the Patient wear a Ring of this odde Mixture, or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a litle of it as an <hi>Appenſum</hi> near the disaffected part. If you
make a <hi>vitrum Saturni</hi> with a good quantity of <hi>Minium</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Sand or Chryſtal, which it helps to bring to Fuſion,
you ſhall have a Glaſs exceeding ponderous, and yet not devoid
of Electricity: And I remember, that having ſometimes caus'd
Braſs it ſelf to be Turn'd like Wood, that I might try, whether
ſo Great (though inviſible) a Concuſſion of all the parts would not
throw off ſome Steams that might be ſmell'd, I was not reduc'd
to foregoe my Expectation; but yet becauſe it was not fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
and becauſe alſo there is great difference of Braſs upon the
ſcore of the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> whereof together with Copper
tis made, I enquired of the Workman, who us'd to turn great
quantities of Braſs, whether he did not often after find it more
ſtrong; and he inform'd me that he did, the ſmell being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſo ſtrong, as to be offenſive to Strangers, that came to his
Shop, and were not uſ'd to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:102306:109"/>
I proceed now to the Effluviums of ſolid and hard Bodies, of
which, if moſt of our Corpuſcularian Philoſophers, and divers
others be not much miſtaken, I may be allow'd to give inſtances
in all Electrical Bodies, which, as I have already noted, muſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Doctrine be acknowledged to operate by ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Emanations. Now among Electrical Bodies I have obſerv'd
divers, that are of ſo cloſe a Texture, that <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> its ſelf, nor
ſpirit of Salt will work upon them, and to be ſo hard, that ſome
of them will ſtrike fire like Flints: Of the former ſort I have found
divers Gems (which I nam'd in my Notes about Electricity,)
and even the Cornelian it ſelf, which I found to attract Hairs,
though it be thought to be of a much ſlighter Texture than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stones, did yet reſiſt <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> as I tried in a large Ring,
(brought out of the Eaſt-Indies,) which I purpoſely broke, and
reduced ſome part of it to powder, that I might make theſe and
ſome other Tryals with it. Rock Chryſtal alſo, though it have
a very manifeſt attractive virtue (as they call it,) I have yet found
it ſo hard, as to ſtrike fire rather better than worſe than ordinary
Flints. And to ſhew that no hardneſs of a Body is inconſiſtent
with its being Electrical, I ſhall adde, that though Diamonds be
confeſt to be the hardeſt Bodies that are yet known in the world,
yet frequent Experience has aſſur'd me, that even Theſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
raw or poliſh'd, are very manifeſtly (and ſometimes vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
enough) Electrical.</p>
               <p>And to let you ſee, that I need not to have recourſe to this
kind of Bodies, to prove, that very ſolid ones are capable of <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia;</hi>
I will, to what I have formerly noted about the Odour of
black Marble, ſubjoin two or three Examples of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſhall be taken from a ſort of Concretions very well
known in divers parts of <hi>Italy</hi> by the name of <hi>Cugoli,</hi> becauſe of
the great uſe that is made of it by the Glaſs-men. Theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions
you will eaſily believe are very hard, as other Minerals
of that ſort are wont to be; and yet being invited by my Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102306:110"/>
about the Atmoſpheres of Bodies, to try them by rubbing
them one againſt the other, I found as I expected, that they affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not onely a perceptible, but a very ſtrong ſmell, (which was
far from that of a Perfume.)</p>
               <p>And this brings into my mind, that having met with ſome
Stones cut out of Humane bladders, whoſe Texture was ſo cloſe,
that I could not with Corroſive Menſtruums make any ſenſible
Solution of one whereon I made my Tryal; though to facilitate
the Liquors operation, part of it were reduc'd to fine Powder,
yet by a litle rubbing of one of theſe ſo cloſely contexed Stones,
it would preſently afford a rank ſmell, very like the ſtink of ſtale
Urine.</p>
               <p>I remember I have caus'd Iron to be turn'd with a Lath, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
whether by the internal commotion, that would by that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
be produc'd in the corpuſcles of the Metal, even that ſolid
as well as ponderous Bodie would not become capable of being
ſmell'd; and though by reaſon of the nature of that parcel of
iron whereon we made our Tryal, or ſome accidental diſpoſition,
which was at that time (being Winter) in my organs of Smelling,
the Odour ſeem'd to me but very faint; yet upon the enquiry I
made of the Artificers, whether in Turning greater pieces of iron
they did not find the ſmell ſtronger? they told me, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
found it very ſtrong, and ſometimes more ſo than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
               <p>And this brings into my mind, what I have carefully obſerv'd
in Grinding of iron; for there are many Grindſtones ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,
that in caſe iron inſtruments be held upon the Stone, whilſt
it is nimbly turn'd under it, though the water that is wont to be
us'd on ſuch occaſions ſtifles (if I may ſo ſpeak) the Smell, and
keeps it from being commonly taken notice of; yet if you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
cauſe (as I remember <hi>I</hi> have done) the uſe of Water to be
forborn, your Succeſs will not be like mine, if you do not find
that ſtore of foetid Exhalations will be produc'd. And though
it be not always ſo eaſie to diſcern by the ſmell, from which of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102306:110"/>
two Bodies they iſſue, or whether they proceed from both; yet it
ſeems probable enough, that ſome of the Steams come from the
iron, and tis more than probable that if they proceed not from
that Metal, they muſt from a Body that is ſo hard as to be able to
make impreſſions in a trice upon Iron and Steel themſelves.</p>
               <p>The laſt Example I ſhall name under this head, is furniſh'd me
by Marchaſites, ſome of which would after a ſhort concuſſion
without external heat be made to exhale for a pretty while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a ſtrong Sulphureous odour, and yet were ſo hard, that when
ſtruck with a Steel-hammer, (which would not eaſily break them)
they afforded us ſuch a number of Sparks, as appear'd ſtrange e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
And tis known, that tis from their diſpoſition to ſtrike
fire, (which yet I dare not attribute to all ſorts of Marchaſites,)
that this kind of Mineral is, by a name frequently to be met with
in Writers, call'd <hi>Pyrites.</hi> And in this Example we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that a Body, capable of being the ſource of corporeal Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
may be at once both very ſolid and very ponderous.</p>
               <p>It remains now that I manifeſt, that even the Fixedneſs of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
is not incompatible with their diſpoſition to emit <hi>Effluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might alleadg on this occaſion, that the <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and alſo its Glaſs, though they muſt have endur'd Fuſion to
attain their reſpective Forms; yet they will without heat commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
to Liquors Antimonial Expirations, with which thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
being impregnated become Emetick and Purgative. I
might alſo adde, that divers Electrical Bodies are very fixt in the
fire, and particularly that Chryſtal, as we have more than once
tried, will endure ſeveral Ignitions and Extinctions in water,
without being truly Calcin'd, being indeed but crackt into a great
multitude of litle parts; but becauſe the above named Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
bodies will after a while fly away in a ſtrong fire, and becauſe
the Effluviums of Chryſtal are not ſo ſenſible as thoſe which can
immediately affect our Eyes or Noſtrils, I will here ſubjoyn one
inſtance, ſuch as I hope will make it needleſs for me to adde any
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102306:111"/>
more, it being of a Body which muſt have ſuſtain'd an exceeding
vehement fire, and is look'd upon by moſt of the Chymiſts as
more underſtroyable then Gold it ſelf, and that is Glaſs, which is
able as you know to endure ſo great a brunt of the fire, that you
did not perhaps imagine I ſhould of all Bodies name it on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
But my conjectures about the Atmoſpheres of Bodies
leading me to think, that Glaſs it ſelf might afford me a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of them; I quickly found, that by rubbing a very litle
while two ſolid pieces of it (not, as I remember, of the finer ſort)
one againſt the other, they would not onely yield a ſenſible O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
but ſometimes ſo ſtrong an one, as to be offenſive. By
which you will eaſily perceive why I told you above, that I did
not acquieſce in the Carteſian Argument againſt Electrical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
performing their operations by Emanations of their own
ſubſtance, drawn from hence, that Glaſs does attract light Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
(as indeed it does, though but weakly,) and yet is too fixt
to emit <hi>Effluviums,</hi> the contrary of which Suppoſition the lately
mentioned Experiment (and by us often repeated) does ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
evince.</p>
               <p>From what other ſolid Bodies, and that will endure the fire, I
have, or have not been able to obtain ſuch odorous Steams, it is
not neceſſary to declare in this place, but may perhaps be done in
another.</p>
               <p>You may I preſume have taken notice, that according to what
I intimated a while agoe, I have forborn in the precedent Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to mention thoſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> of ſolid Bodies, that need the action
of the Fire to be obtain'd. But ſince the Sun is the grand Agent
of Nature in the Planetary world, and ſince during the Summer,
and eſpecially at Noon, and in Southern Climates, his Heat makes
many bodies have litle Atmoſpheres, that we cannot ſo well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern
that they have conſtantly; I ſee not why I may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to aſcribe Atmoſpheres to ſuch Bodies, as I have obſerv'd
to have them when the Sun ſhines upon them, and alſo to think
that the like may be attributed at leaſt ſometimes to ſuch other
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102306:111"/>
Bodies, as will do the things uſually perform'd by <hi>Effluviums,</hi>
when yet they are excited but by an external heat, which exceeds
not that of the hot Sun.</p>
               <p>Of theſe two ſorts of Bodies I ſhall for brevities ſake name but
two or three Examples, and then haſten to a Concluſion.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe I muſt make bold to borrow from my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
about Electricity, among which this is one, that to
ſhew that the particular and uſual manner of exciting ſuch Bodies,
namely by rubbing them, is not alwayes neceſſary; I took a large
piece of good Amber, and having in a Summer morning, whilſt
the Air was yet freſh, tried that it would not without being exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
attract a light Body I had expos'd to it; I remov'd it into the
Suns beams, till they had made it moderately hot, and then I found
according to my expectation that it had acquir'd an Attractive vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
&amp; that not onely in one particular place, as is uſually obſerv'd
when tis excited by rubbing, but in divers and diſtant places at
once; at any of which it would draw to it the light body plac'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a convenient diſtance from it: ſo that even in this Climate of
ours a ſolid Body may quickly acquire an Atmoſphere by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Sun, and that long before the warmeſt part of the day.</p>
               <p>The next inſtance you will perchance think ſomewhat ſtrange,
it being that when for want of an opportunity to make the like
Trial in the warm Sun, I took a litle but thick veſſel made of
Glaſs, and held it near the fire till it had got a convenient degree
of heat, (which was not very great, though it exceeded that which
I had given the Amber,) I found as I had imagin'd that the heat of
fire had made even this Body attractive, as that of the Sun had
made the other.</p>
               <p>What degree of heat I have obſerv'd to be either neceſſary, or
the moſt convenient to excite Electrical bodies according to their
different natures, (for the ſame degree will not indifferently ſerve
for them all,) this is not the propereſt place to declare, and it will
be more to our preſent purpoſe to make ſome ſhort reflection on
what has been hitherto delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:102306:112"/>
It ſeems then probably deduceable from the foregoing Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
and Obſervations, that a very great number if not the
greateſt part even of Conſiſtent bodies, whether Animal, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
or Mineral, may emit Effluviums, and that even thoſe that
are ſolid may (at leaſt ſometimes) have their litle Atmoſpheres,
though the neighbouring Solids will often keep the Evaporations
from being every way ambient in reference to the Bodies they
iſſue from.</p>
               <p>For as the inſtances hitherto alleadg'd (which are not all that I
could have nam'd) do plainly ſhew that divers Bodies (and ſome
that have not been thought very likely) are ſuch as we ſpeak of,
ſo ſeveral things induce me to believe, that there may be many
more of the like nature.</p>
               <p>For firſt, very few if any have (that I know of) had the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to make uſe of nice Scales, (which ſuch Tryals require,) to
examine the Expirations of inanimate bodies, which if they ſhall
hereafter do, I make litle doubt but they will light on many
things, that will confirm what we have been propoſing, by their
finding that ſome Bodies, which are not yet known to yield Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations,
do afford them, and that many others do part with far
more copious ones than is imagin'd. For one would not eaſily
have thought, that ſo extremely cold a Body as a ſolid piece of
Ice ſhould make a plentiful Evaporation of its ſelf in the cold Air
of a freezing night; or that a piece of Wood, that had long lain in
the houſe, and was light enough to be conveniently hung for a
long time at a Ballance, that would looſe its <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> with
(as I remember) half a quarter of a Grain, ſhould in leſs than a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
of an hour, ſend forth ſteams enough to make the Scales ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
turn, and that in Winter.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing (which is my ſecond Conſideration) that Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
were made with good inſtruments for weighing, though it will
follow, that in caſe the expoſed body grow lighter, ſomething
exhales from it; yet it will not follow, that if no diminution of
weight be diſcover'd by the inſtrument, nothing that is corporeal
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102306:112"/>
recedes from it. I will not urge that tis affirm'd, not onely by
the generality of our Chymiſts, but by learned modern Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that when either Glaſs of Antimony, or <hi>Crocus metallorum</hi>
impregnate Wine with Vomative and Purgative Particles, they
do it without any decrement of their weight; becauſe the Scales in
Apothecaries Shops, and the litle accurateneſs wont to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in weighing things, by thoſe that are not vers'd in Statical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
make me (though not deny the Tradition which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
be true, yet) unwilling to build upon obſervations, which
to be relyed on are to be very nicely made; and therefore I ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take notice, that though the Loadſtone be concluded to have
conſtantly about it a great multitude of Magnetical <hi>Effluvia,</hi>
(which may be call'd its Atmoſphere,) yet it has not been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to looſe any thing of its Weight by the receſs of ſo many
Corpuſcles. But becauſe if the Carteſian <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> about Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnetiſms
be admitted, the Argument drawn from this inſtance
will not be ſo ſtrong as it ſeems, and as it otherwiſe would be: I
ſhall add a more unexceptionable Example, for I know you will
grant me that Odours are not diffus'd to a diſtance without Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Emanations from the Odorous body: and yet, though
good Amber-Greece be, even without being excited by external
heat, conſtantly ſurrounded by a large Atmoſphere, you will in
one of the following Diſcourſes find cauſe to admire how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
the waſt of it is.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that in Tract of time a Decrement of weight may
appear in Bodies, that in a few hours or dayes diſcovers not any;
the Objection, if granted, overthrows not our Doctrine, it being
ſufficient to eſtabliſh what we have been ſaying, if we have evinc'd
that the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of ſome Bodies may be ſubtle enough not to
make the Body by their avolation appear lighter in Statical Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
that are not extraordinarily (and as it were obſtinately) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.
And this very Objection puts me in mind to adde, that
for ought we know the Decrement of Bodies in Statical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
long continued, may be ſomewhat Greater than even nice
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:102306:113"/>
Scales diſcover to us; for how are we ſure that the weights them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which are commonly made of Braſs, (a Metal very unfixt,)
may not in Tract of time ſuffer a litle Diminution of their
Weight, as well as the Bodies counterpois'd by them: and no
man has I think yet tryed whether Glaſs, and even Gold may not
in tract of time looſe of their Weight, which in caſe they ſhould
do, it would not be eaſily diſcover'd, unleſs we had Bodies that
were perfectly fixt, by compariſon to which we might be better
aſſiſted, than by comparing them with Braſs weights, or the like,
which being themſelves leſs fixt, will loſe more than Gold and
Glaſs.</p>
               <p>My third and laſt conſideration is, that there may be divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wayes, beſides thoſe furniſh'd us by Staticks, of diſcovering
the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of ſolid Bodies, and conſequently of ſhewing, that
tis not ſafe to conclude, that becauſe their Operation is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
or manifeſt, ſuch Bodies do never emit any <hi>Effluvia</hi> at all,
and ſo are uncapable to work by their intervention on any other
Body, though never ſo well diſpos'd to receive their Action. And
this I the rather deſire that you would take notice of, becauſe my
chief (though not onely) deſign in theſe Notes is (you know) to
illuſtrate the Doctrine of <hi>occult Qualities;</hi> and it may conduce
to explicate ſeveral of them, to know that ſome particular Bodies
emit <hi>Effluvia,</hi> though perhaps they do it not conſtantly, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly;
and though perchance too, they do not appear to emit
any at all, if they be examin'd after the ſame manner with other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haleable
Bodies, but onely may be made to emit them by ſome
peculiar way of handling them, or appear to have emitted them
by ſome determinate operation on ſome other ſingle Body, or at
moſt ſmall number of Bodies.</p>
               <p>Perchance you did not think, till you read what I lately told you
about Glaſs, that from a Body that had endured ſo violent a fire,
there could, by ſo ſleight a way as rubbing a litle while one piece
againſt another, be obtain'd ſuch ſteams, as may not onely affect
but offend the Noſtrils. Nor ſhould we eaſily believe, if Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102306:113"/>
did not aſſure us of it, that a Diamond, that is juſtly reputed
the hardeſt known Body in the World, ſhould by a litle rubbing
be made to part with Electrical <hi>Effluvia.</hi> Nay, (that I may give
ſome kind of confirmation to that part of the laſt Paragraph that
ſeems moſt to need it,) I ſhall adde, that I once had a Diamond
not much bigger than a large Pen, which had never been poliſh'd
or cut, whoſe Electrical virtue was ſometimes ſo eaſily excited,
that if I did but paſs my fingers over it to wipe it, the virtue
would diſcloſe it ſelf; and if as ſoon as I had taken it out of my
Pocket, I applied a hair to it, though I touch'd not the Stone
with my fingers, that I might be ſure not to rub it, that Hair
would be attracted at ſome diſtance, and many times one after an
other, eſpecially by one of the ſides of the Stone, (whoſe ſurface
was made up of ſeveral almoſt triangular Planes,) and though this
excitation of the Diamond ſeemed to proceed onely from the
warmth that it had acquir'd in my Pocket, yet I did not find that
That warmth, though it ſeem'd not to be alter'd, had alwaies the
ſame effect on it, though the wiping it with my finger fail'd not
(that I remember) to excite it. Something like this uncertainty
I always obſerv'd in another Diamond of mine, that was much
nobler than the firſt, and very well poliſhed, and in a ſmall Ruby,
that I have yet by me, which would ſometimes be conſiderably
Electrical without being rubb'd, when I but wore the Ring it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to on my litle finger; and ſometimes again it ſeem'd to
have loſt that virtue (of operating without being excited by fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,)
and that ſometimes within a few minutes, without my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whence ſo quick a change ſhould proceed. But I muſt inſiſt
no longer on ſuch particulars, of which I elſewhere ſay ſomething;
and therefore I prceed to take notice, that we ſhould ſcarce have
dream'd, that when a Partridg, or a hunted Deer has caſually ſet
a foot upon the ground, that part where the Footſtep hath been
(though inviſibly) impreſs'd, ſhould continue for many hours a
Source of Corporeal Effluxes; if there were not ſetting Dogs,
and Spaniels, and Bloud-hounds, whoſe noſes can take notice at
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102306:114"/>
that diſtance of time of ſuch Emanations, though not onely other
ſorts of Animals, but other ſorts of Dogs are unable to do ſo.</p>
               <p>I ſaw a ſtone in the hands of an Academick, an Acquaintance
of mine, which I ſhould by the Eye have judg'd to be an Agate,
not a Blood ſtone, and conſequently I ſhould not have thought
that it could have communicated Medicinal <hi>Effluvia</hi> appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to exceſſive Bleeding, if the Wearer of it had not been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to that Diſeaſe, and had not often cur'd both himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by wearing this ſtone about his neck; which if he left off,
as ſometimes he did for Trials ſake, his exceedingly ſanguine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
(to which I have rarely ſeen a Match) would in a few
daies caſt him into Relapſes. What I have elſewhere told you
about the true virtues of ſome Stones, (for I fear that moſt of
thoſe that are wont to be aſcrib'd to them are falſe,) may give
ſome confirmation to what I have been delivering, which I cannot
now ſtay to do, being to draw to a Concluſion as ſoon as I have
put you in mind, that it would not probably have ever been
expected that ſo ponderous and ſolid a Body as the Loadſtone
ſhould be invironed by an Atmoſphere, if Iron had been a ſcarce
Mineral, and had not chanc'd to have been plac'd near it.</p>
               <p>And with this inſtance I ſhall put an end to theſe Notes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it allows me to make this Reflextion; that ſince ſolid Bodies
may have conſtant Atmoſpheres about them, and yet not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that they have ſo, but by their operation upon one particular
Body, or thoſe few which participate of That; and ſince there
are already (as we have ſeen) very differing wayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Bodies may appear to be exhaleable, it is not unlikely that
there may be more and more Bodies (even of thoſe that are ſolid
and hard) found to emit <hi>Effluvia,</hi> as more and more wayes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
that they do ſo, ſhall either by chance or induſtry be
brought to light.</p>
