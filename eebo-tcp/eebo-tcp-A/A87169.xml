            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Court being ſate, called three Priſoners to the Bar,
<hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller,</hi> Col. <hi>Harriſon, William H<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

The firſt was Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller,</hi> which with the two
others were indicted to this purpoſe following:</p>
            <p>That they together with <hi>Oliver Cromwel, Henry Ireton,
Robert Titchbourn, Iſaac Pennington, Robert Lilburn, John
Hewſon</hi> late of the City of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Shoo-maker, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had
Wilfully, Maliciouſly, and Traterouſly, Adviſed, Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Aſſiſted, Contrived, and Compaſſed the Death of
Our late Dread Soveraign <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt, by the
Grace of God of ever bleſſed Memory, King of England,
Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller</hi> began to excuſe his long being out of
England, and unacquaintance with Engliſh affairs; But
eing bid to anſwer poſitively, whether he was Guilty or
not Guilty of the High Treaſon whereof he had been indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and then Arraigned, anſwered, Guilty.</p>
            <p>The next was Col. <hi>Thomas Hariſon,</hi> who at the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to hold up his Hand, till the Lord Chief <hi>Baron,</hi> Judge
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170765:3"/>
               <hi>Forſter,</hi> and other Judges told him his duty in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:

               </gap>
ſeveral times offered to ſally out into Diſcourſes, refuſing
to anſwer Guilty or not Guilty, till the Judges declared
the neceſſity of anſw<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring one of the two, which they were
forced to do divers times before he would be brought to
give an Anſwer, but at laſt he did, and ſaid, Not Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Heveningham</hi> anſwered the like; but Col. <hi>George
Fleetwood</hi> pleaded Guilty without any demur.</p>
            <p>Theſe being diſmiſt, <hi>Iſaac Pennington, Henry Marten,
Gilbert Millington, Robert Titchbourn, Owen Roe, Robert
Lilbourn,</hi> were called to the Bar. <hi>Iſaac Penningtons</hi> Age
gave him not time to make long Apologies, for he very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
anſwered not Guilty; ſo did <hi>Gilbert Millington,</hi> and
<hi>Owen Roe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry Marten</hi> being the next began to Quibble with the
Court, and to deny his name to be mentioned in the Act;
whereupon the Court were put to the trouble of calling for
the Act of Oblivion, and there read his name; but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that his name was <hi>Marten</hi> not <hi>Martin,</hi> as in the Act
expreſſed. But being told they knew him to be the Man, let
his name be what it would, was bid to anſwer, who then
ſaid, not Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Titchbourn</hi> being next, began to excuſe his want of ſkill
in Law affairs; pleading, that he was before very Wiſe, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and Judicious Lawyers, and that being unable to plead
for himſelf, deſired the Court to aſsign him Councel to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
him therein: To which it was anſwered, that he was not
yet come to his Tryal, but onely Arraigned; and aſked him
Guilty or not Guilty? to which he could not tell what to
anſwer; He ſaid he did acknowledge part of the Indictment.
But being told he muſt ſay Guilty or not; anſwered, not
Guilty. So did <hi>Lilburn</hi> and all the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:170765:4"/>
Col. Daniel Axtel deſired he might have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of an Engliſh-man, that the Law was his
Birth right, and ſo he might lawfully claim it, That
he did conceive there was Law in his Caſe, and ſo
deſired to have Councel in it, That he did believe
the Parliament—But there he was bid to plead
to the Indictment, Guilty or not Guilty; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much roving, and being told the danger of ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dtng
Mute, he anſwered, Why then, not Guilty. And
being asked by whom he would be tryed he did not
anſwer; at which one bid him anſwer, By God
and his Countrey. But he anſwered, he could not do
ſo; For he did not believe God to be there. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
he ſaid, He would be tryed by the Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, and by his Countrey,</p>
            <p>Hugh Peters being asked whether he was guilty
of the High Treaſon whereof he was Indicted, he
lifted up his hands and eyes, and ſaid; Guilty? No
not for ten thouſand Worlds.</p>
            <p>'Tis probable, he may have regret of Conſcience,
