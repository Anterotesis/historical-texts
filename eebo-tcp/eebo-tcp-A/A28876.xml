            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O Ye Prieſts and Biſhops of this Nation, the Lord God that made Heaven and Earth is a Witneſs for me this day, I have no evil in my heart to any of you, but in Love to your Souls; and in the Bowels of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der compaſſion am I conſtrained to cry out againſt your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Gaines; for Gods day is come, and Wo to all the Workers of Iniquity.</p>
            <p>O ye Biſhops and Prieſts of this Nation, ye have for a long time covered your ſelves with the name of <hi>Chriſt's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> but now your Covering is too narrow, and your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion will not hide you; for the Light of Chriſt is riſen, and with it you are judged and condemned, and ſeen to be Enemies to the the Croſs of Chriſt, and Strangers to the Covenant of Promiſe; being in <hi>Cains</hi> way, who ſlew his Brother about Religion;<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 8.</note> and in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi>  way, who loved the Wages of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,<note place="margin"> Num. 22.</note>

Therefore I ſay, leave off your Deceit, and keep the People no longer in your dark Forms;<note place="margin">Jer. 31, verſ 31. 32, 33, 34.</note> but let them have Liberty to Worſhip God in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Truth; For the time is come, that every man need not teach his Neighbour or his Brother, ſaying, Know the Lord; for every one muſt know him from the leaſt to the greateſt. Yea, Gods ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Light and Glory is made manifeſt, <hi>I will forgive their Sins, and remember their Iniquities no more; I'll be to them a God, and they ſhall be my People:</hi> O ye Blind Guides, Will ye ſeek to diſſannul this? Will ye ſeek to ſtop the Lords Work in this the Day of his Power? Ye are but as Bryars and Thorns, who are ſetting your ſelves together againſt him, who is a conſuming Fire, and is riſen to conſume you, and all your falſe Doctrine (if ye repent not.) Therefore I ſay again and again, Leave off your Deceit, and come to the Teaching of Gods Witneſs in your own perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: For this is the day that God is pouring forth of his Spirit, and his Sons and his Daughters do Propheſie;<note place="margin">Jo. 2. 28.</note> for there is no more room for Deceit. Why take ye Chriſts Words in your Mouths, and hate to be reform'd? Why talk ye of the Scriptures, and are err'd from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that gave them forth? Ye are gone from the Practice of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtle: Did ever <hi>Peter, Paul, James, John,</hi> or any of Chriſts Miniſters, keep <hi>Curates</hi> to get money? did they ever Sue any man for <hi>Lambs, Piggs, Hens,</hi> or <hi>Geeſe?</hi> Did they ever hale any to the Courts, and to Priſon?

Have ye brought any of your Hearers into the pleaſant Valleys, where the Springs of Life are to be felt? Nay: Are they not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in the Imaginations of their own Hearts, and many of them diſſatisfied, thirſting after the Bread of Life, but know not where to find it, while you are eating the Fat, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing your ſelves with the Fleece; and putting the Day of the Lord far from you, when many of Gods faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whom he hath called to labour in his Vine-yard, are exerciſed with ſtrong Cryes to the God that made Heaven and Earth, that he may turn away his Judgments, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voak his deſtroying Angel, and ſpare this Nation, which otherwiſe will feel an heavy Stroke of Gods Hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they repent not.
