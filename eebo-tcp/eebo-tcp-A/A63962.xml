            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>LONG time had <hi>Israel</hi> been disus'd from Rest,</l>
               <l>Long had they been by Tyrants sore opprest;</l>
               <l>Kings of all sorts they ignorantly crav'd,</l>
               <l>And grew more stupid as they were enslav'd;</l>
               <l>Yet want of Grace they impiously disown'd,</l>
               <l>And still like Slaves beneath the Burden groan'd:</l>
               <l>With languid Eyes their Race of Kings they view,</l>
               <l>The Bad too many, and the Good too few;</l>
               <l>Some rob'd their Houses, and destroy'd their Lives,</l>
               <l>Ravish'd their Daughters, and debauch'd their Wives;</l>
               <l>Prophan'd the Altars with polluted Loves,</l>
               <l>And worship'd Idols in the Woods and Groves.</l>

               <l>To Foreign Nations next they have recourse;</l>
               <l>Striving to mend, they made their State much worse.</l>
               <l>They first from <hi>Hebron</hi> all their Plagues did bring,</l>
               <l>Cramm'd in the Single Person of a King;</l>
               <l>From whose base Loins ten thousand Evils flow,</l>
               <l>Which by Succession they must undergo.</l>
               <l>Yet sense of Native Freedom still remains,</l>
               <l>They fret and grumble underneath their Chains;</l>
               <l>Incens'd, enrag'd, their Passion do's arise,</l>
               <l>Till at his Palace-Gate their Monarch dies.</l>

               <l>But still resolv'd to split on Foreign Shelves,</l>

               <l>To Foreign Courts and Councils do resort,</l>
               <l>To find a King their Freedoms to support:</l>
               <l>Of one for mighty Actions fam'd they're told,</l>
               <l>Profoundly wise, and desperately bold,</l>

               <l>Like Beasts of Prey they ravage all the Land,</l>

Such wondrous Heroes our Fore-fathers were,</l>
               <l>When we, base Souls! but Pigmies are in War:</l>
               <l>By Foreign Chieftains we improve in Skill;</l>
               <l>We learn how to intrench, not how to kill:</l>
               <l>For all our Charge are good Proficients made</l>
               <l>In using both the Pickax and the Spade.</l>
               <l>But in what Field have we a Conquest wrought?</l>
               <l>In Ten Years War what Battel have we fought?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If we a Foreign Slave may use in War,</l>
               <l>Yet why in Council should that Slave appear?</l>
               <l>If we with <hi>Jewish</hi> Treasure make him great,</l>
               <l>Must it be done to undermine the State?</l>
               <l>Where are the Antient Sages of Renown?</l>
               <l>No <hi>Magi</hi> left, fit to advise the Crown?</l>
               <l>Must we by Foreign Councils be undone?</l>
               <l>Unhappy <hi>Israel,</hi> who such Measures takes,</l>
               <l>And seeks for Statesmen in the Bogs and Lakes;</l>
               <l>Who speak the Language of most abject Slaves,</l>
               <l>Under the Conduct of our <hi>Jewish</hi> Knaves.</l>
               <l>Our <hi>Hebrew</hi>'s murder'd in their hoarser Throats;</l>
               <l>How ill their Tongues agree with <hi>Jewish Notes!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Their untun'd Prattle do's our Sense confound,</l>
               <l>Which in our Princely Palaces do's sound;</l>

               <l>He do's extend to other Coasts his Pride,</l>

               <l>Tho born to Empire, thou art ever young!</l>
               <l>Ever in Nonage, canst no Right transfer:</l>
               <l>But who made <hi>Bentir</hi> thy Executor?</l>
               <l>What mighty Power do's <hi>Israel</hi>'s Land afford?</l>
               <l>What Power has made the famous <hi>Bentir</hi> Lord?</l>
               <l>The Peoples Voice, and <hi>Sanhedrim</hi>'s Accord.</l>
               <l>Are not the Rights of People still the same?</l>
               <l>Did they e'er differ in or Place or Name?</l>
               <l>Have not Mankind on equal Terms still stood,</l>
               <l>Without Distinction, since the mighty Flood?</l>
               <l>And have not <hi>Hiram</hi>'s Subjects a free Choice</l>
               <l>To chuse a King by their united Voice?</l>
               <l>If <hi>Israel</hi>'s People cou'd a Monarch chuse,</l>
               <l>A living King at the same time refuse;</l>
               <l>That <hi>Hiram</hi>'s People, shall it e'er be said,</l>

If Kings are made the People to enthral,</l>
               <l>VVe had much better have no King at all:</l>
               <l>But Kings, appointed for the Common Good,</l>
               <l>Always as Guardians to their People stood.</l>
               <l>And Heaven allows the People sure a Power</l>

               <l>They know full well what best will serve themselves,</l>

               <l>He who another Kingdom can divide,</l>

               <l>Of Foreign Birth, and undescended too,</l>
               <l>Yet he, like <hi>Bentir,</hi> mighty Feats can do.</l>
               <l>He robs our Treasure, to augment his State,</l>

               <l>In vain is Blood, or Parentages, when</l>

               <l>To Chivalry you need have no recourse,</l>
               <l>The gawdy Trappings make the Ass a Horse.</l>
               <l>No more, no more your Antient Honours own,</l>
               <l>By slavish <hi>Gibeonites</hi> you are outdone:</l>
               <l>Or else your Antient Courage reassume,</l>
               <l>And to assert your Honours once presume;</l>
               <l>From off their Heads your ravish'd Lawrels tear,</l>
