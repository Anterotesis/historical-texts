            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SINCE my laſt the News is very great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For we are certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, That Coll. <hi>Sarsfeild</hi> and his Party are totally routed. The manner as we hear, this Coll. <hi>Sarsfeild</hi> hearing of the Landing of his Grace D. <hi>Scombergh,</hi> and the defeat of the Lord <hi>Montcaſtle,</hi> began to be afraid of himſelf, and therefore not believing he was ſtrong enough to prevent the Men of <hi>Iniskillin</hi> from joining his Grace, which he mainly deſir'd to hinder, call'd a Council of War, where it was reſolv'd to ſend a faithful Meſſenger to the <hi>French</hi> General <hi>Monſieur d' Avaux,</hi> to advance with thoſe Forces which he had under his command, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him alſo to underſtand, That Coll. <hi>Sarsfeild</hi> would decamp at the ſame time, and join him the next day by ſuch an Hour. The Letter being thus written and directed to <hi>Monſieur d' Avaux,</hi> was delivered to a Truſty Meſſenger, and ſuch a one he might probably have been, had not Providence thrown him into the hands of the Proteſtants. For ſome of the <hi>Iniskillin</hi> Scouts being abroad in the Road between Coll. <hi>Sarsfeild</hi> and <hi>Monſieur d' Avaux,</hi> intercepted this faithful Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb facs="tcp:64773:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and carryed him to <hi>Iniskillin,</hi> where the chief Commander of the <hi>Iniskillin</hi> Forces caus'd him to be ſearched, and finding about him the Letter written from Coll. <hi>Sarsfeild</hi> to <hi>Monſieur d' Avaux;</hi> This Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was read, and a great conſulta<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ity which ſ<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ed to the Chief Commander to be a very fair one. It was concluded therefore, that they ſhould write a Letter back to Coll. <hi>Sarsfeild,</hi> as from <hi>Monſieur d' Avaux,</hi> wherein <hi>d' Avaux</hi> promiſed not to fail <hi>Sarsfeild</hi> at his hour and place appointed. By that time they thought that the Letter might be delivered, they ſet forward, and putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Road which <hi>D' Avaux</hi> was to take, that he might join Coll. <hi>Sarsfeild;</hi> they marched forward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Sarsfeild</hi> thus deluded, ſets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to meet <hi>D<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Avaux,</hi> and when he ſaw the <hi>Iniskillin</hi> Men at a diſtance, verily thought they had been his Friends; which made his Party upon the ſame preſumption much more remiſs and negligent in keeping their Orders, as then they ſhould have been. On the otherſide, the <hi>Iniskillin</hi> Men marched with all the ſilence, and in the beſt order that could be imagined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſidering the diſadvantages of the Place: But no ſooner were they got near enough to ſhew Coll. <hi>Sarsfeild</hi> his Error, but they fell upon him with an extraordinary fury and bravery. In this ſurprize Coll. <hi>Sarsfeild</hi> and his Men were at a loſs, not dreaming of ſuch an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. However, for a time they made as ſtout a reſiſtance as could be expected from Men ſo ſurpriz'd, and in that condition as they were; till at length being all in confuſion, they were at laſt totally routed above Two thouſand ſlain, a great many Priſoners taken, with good ſtore of Arms and Proviſions: And it is farther ſaid, That the <hi>Iniskillin</hi> Men are in purſuit of the reſt. We daily expect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Particulars, which ſo ſoon as it comes to our hands you ſhall not fail of. Remaining in the mean time</p>
