            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ALL Authors whatever in their Dedications are Poets; but I am now to Write to a Lady, who stands as little in need of Flattery, as her Beauty of Art; otherwise, I shou'd prove as ill a Poet to her in my Dedication, as to my Reader in my Play: I can do your Grace no Honour, nor make you more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers then you have already; yet I can do my self the honour to let the world know, I am the greatest you have; you will pardon me, Madam, for you know, 'tis very hard for a new Author, and Poet too, to govern his Ambition; for Poets, let them pass in the world never so much, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, honest men, but begin praise to others, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in themselves; and are like Rooks, who lend people money, but to win it back again, and so leave them in debt to 'em for nothing; they offer Laurel and Incense to their Hero's, but wear it themselves, and perfume themselves. This is true, Madam, upon the honest word of an Author,


<pb facs="tcp:101584:3"/>
who never yet writ Dedication; yet though I cannot lye like them, I am as vain as they, and cannot but publickly give your Grace my humble acknowledgments for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours I have receiv'd from you: This, I say, is the Poets Gratitude, which in plain English, is only Pride and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; and that the world might know your Grace did me the honour to see my Play twice together; yet perhaps my Enviers of your Favour will suggest 'twas in Lent, and therefore for your Mortification; then, as a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Author, I am concern'd not to have your Graces Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours lessen'd, or rather, my reputation; and to let them know, you were pleas'd, after that, to command a Copy from me of this Play; the way without Beauty and Wit, to win a poor Poets heart. 'Tis a sign your Grace understands nothing better, then obliging all the world, after the best and most proper manner; But, Madam, to be obliging to that excess as you are, (pardon me, if I tell you, out of my extream concern, and service for your Grace) is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous quality, and may be very incommode to you; for Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility makes Poets as troublesom, as Charity makes Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and your Grace will be hereafter as much pester'd with such scurvy Offerings as this, Poems, Panegyricks, and the like, as you are now with Petitions: And, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, take it from me, no man with Papers in's hand, is more dreadful then a Poet, no, not a Lawyer with his Declarations; Your Grace sure did not well consider what you did, in sending for my Play; you little thought I wou'd have had the confidence to send you a Dedication too: But, Madam, you find I am as unreasonable, and have as little conscience, as if I had driven the Poetick trade


<pb facs="tcp:101584:3"/>
longer then I have, and ne're consider you had enough of the Play; but (having suffer'd now so severely) I beseech your Grace, have a care for the future, take my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and be (if you can possible) as proud, and ill-natur'd, as other people of Quality, since your quiet is so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and since you have more reason then any to value your self; for you have that perfection of Beauty (without thinking it so) which others of your Sex, but think they have; that Generosity in your Actions, which others of your quality, have only in their Promises; that Spirit, Wit, and Judgment, and all other qualifications, which fit Hero's to command, and wou'd make any but your Grace proud. I begin now elevated by my Subject, to write with the Emotion and Fury of a Poet; yet the integrity of an Historian; and I cou'd never be weary, nay, sure this were my only way, to make my Readers never weary too, though they were a more impatient Generation of people then they are. In Fine, speaking thus of your Grace, I shou'd please all the world but you; therefore I must once observe, and obey you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against my will, and say no more, then that I am,</p>

                     <p>Nay, faith and troth that's true; for your Wits are plaguely given to borrow; they'l borrow of their Wench, Coach-man, or Link-boy their hire. Mrs. <hi>Joyner, Dapperwit</hi> has that trick with a vengeance.</p>

                     <p>Why will you keep Company with him then, I say? for to be plain with you, you have followed him so long, that you are thought but his Culley; for every Wit has his Culley, as every Squire his lead Captain.</p>

                     <p>Faith no, I believe it will not be much to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, to bring my face, or your Poetry to light, for I hope, you have yet a pretty good opinion of my face, and so have I of your wit; but if you are for proving your wit, why do not you write a Play?</p>

                     <p>Because 'tis now no more reputation to write a Play, then it is honour to be a Knight: your true wit despises the title of Poet, as much as your true gentleman the title of Knight; for as a man may be a Knight and no Gentleman, so a man may be a Poet and no Wit, let me perish.</p>

                     <speaker>Dap.</speaker>
                     <p>There are as many degrees of Wits, as of Lawyers; as there is first your Sollicitor, then your Aturney, then your Pleading-Counsel, then your Chamber-Counsel, and then your Judge; so there is first your Court-Wit, your Coffee-Wit, your Poll-Wit or Pollitick-Wit, your Chamber-Wit or Scribble-Wit, and last of all, your Judg-Wit or Critick.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lyd.</speaker>
                     <p>But are there as many Wits as Lawyers? Lord, what will become of us? what employment can they have? how are they known?</p>

                     <speaker>Dap.</speaker>
                     <p>First, your Court-Wit is a fashionable, insinuating, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, cringing, grimacing, fellow; and has wit enough to sollicit a suit of Love; and if he fail, he has malice enough to ruin the woman with a dull Lampoon, but he rails still at the man that is absent, for you must know, all Wits rail; and his wit properly lies in combing Perruques, matching Ribbonds, and being severe as they call it, upon other peoples cloaths.</p>

                     <p>He is a lying, censorious, gossiping, quibling wretch, and sets people together by the ears over that sober drink Coffee; he is a Wit, as he is a commentator upon the Gazet, and he rails at the Pyrats of <hi>Algiere,</hi> the Grand Signior of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the Christian Grand Signior.</p>

                     <speaker>Dap.</speaker>

                     <p>Come, come, her Relations can do you no hurt; I dare swear, If her Mother shou'd but say, your Hat did not cock hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly, she wou'd never ask her blessing again.</p>

                     <p>Prythee leave thy fooling, and tell me, if since my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, She has given evidences of her love, to clear those doubts I went away with, for as absence is the bane of common and bastard Love; 'tis the vindication of that, which is true and generous.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Vin.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, if you cou'd ever doubt her love, you deserve to doubt on; for there is no punishment great enough for jealousie, but jealousie.</p>

                     <p>But pray give me now the answer, which the suddenness of your flight deny'd me; how cou'd <hi>Clerimont</hi> hope to subdue her heart, by the assault of her honour?</p>

                     <p>Still turning the daggers point on your self, hear me out; I say she put her self into mourning for you— loc'kd up her self in her chamber, this month for you— shut out her barking Relations for you— has not seen the Sun, or face of man, since she saw you— thinks, and talks of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but you— sends to me daily, to hear of you— and in short (I think) is mad for you— all this I can swear, for I am to her so near a Neighbour, and so inquisitive a friend for you—</p>

                     <p>Unfortunate Lady, that I am! I have left the Herd on purpose to be chas'd, and have wandred this hour here; but the Park affords not so much as a Satyr for me, (and that's strange) no Burgundy man, or drunken Scourer will reel my way; the Rag-women, and Synder-women, have better luck then I— but who are these? if this mungril light do's not deceive me, 'tis my brother, 'tis he, there's <hi>Joyner</hi> too, and two other women; I'le follow 'em; it must be he, for this world hath nothing like him; I know not what the Devil may be in the other. <stage>Ex.

                     <p>It often happens, indeed, that too much care, is as bad as negligence; but I had rather be rob'd, then lose what I have carelesly.</p>

                     <p>'Tis better then to ruminate in them; mine, i'm sure, will not out of my head, nor heart.</p>

                     <p>Grief is so far from retrieving a loss, that it makes it greater; but the way to lesson it, is, by a comparison with others losses; here are Ladies, in the Park, of your acquaintance, I doubt not, can compare with you; pray, Madam, let us walk and find 'em out.</p>

                     <p>'Tis the resentment, you say, makes the loss great, or little; and then i'm sure, there is none like mine; however go on. <stage>Exeunt.</stage>

                     <p>Just as I shut the dore upon you, the woman, <hi>Ranger,</hi> expected, came up stairs; but finding another woman in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with him, went down again, I suppose, as jealous of him, as you of <hi>Christina.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>How do's it appear she came to <hi>Ranger?</hi>

                     <speaker>Vin.</speaker>
                     <p>Thus, <hi>Dapperwit</hi> came up after, who had brought her, just then, in a Chair from St. <hi>Jamses</hi>'s, by <hi>Rangers</hi> appointment; and it is certain your <hi>Christina</hi> came to you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>How can that be? for she knew not I was in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

                     <speaker>Vin.</speaker>
                     <p>My man confesses, when I sent him to enquire of her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, about her Lady's being here in the Park last night; he told her you were come, and she, it seems, told her Mistress.</p>

                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>That might be— <stage>Aside.</stage> But did not <hi>Christina</hi> confess, <hi>Ranger</hi> was in her lodging last night?</p>

                     <p>By intrusion, which she had more particularly inform'd me of, if her apprehensions of your danger had not posted me after you; she not having yet (as I suppose) heard of <hi>Clerimonts</hi> recovery: I left her, poor creature, at home, distracted with a thousand fears for your life and love.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                     <p>Her love, i'm sure, has cost me more fears, then my life; yet that little danger is not past, (as you think) till the great one be over.</p>

                     <p>Open but your eyes, and the Fantastick Goblin's vanish'd, and all your idle fears, will turn to shame; for Jealousie, is the basest cowardize.</p>

            <l>NOW my Brisk Brothers of the Pit, you'l say,</l>
            <l>I'm come to speak a good word for the Play;</l>
            <l>But (Gallants) let me perish, if I do,</l>
            <l>For I have Wit, and judgment, just like you;</l>
            <l>Wit never partial, judgment free and bold,</l>
            <l>For fear or friendship never bought or sold,</l>
            <l>Nor by good Nature, e're to be Cajol'd.</l>
            <l>Good Nature in a Critick were a crime,</l>
            <l>Like mercy in a Judge, and renders him</l>
            <l>Guilty of all those faults, he do's forgive:</l>
            <l>Besides, if Thief from Gallows you reprieve,</l>
            <l>He'll cut your Throat; so Poet sav'd from shame,</l>
            <l>In damn'd Lampoon, will murder your good name.</l>
            <l>Yet in true spight to him, and to his Play,</l>
            <l>(Good faith) you shou'd not rayl at 'em to day;</l>
            <l>But to be more his Foe, seem most his Friend,</l>
            <l>And so maliciously, the Play commend,</l>
            <l>That he may be betray'd to Writing on,</l>
            <l>And Poet let him be, to be undone.</l>
