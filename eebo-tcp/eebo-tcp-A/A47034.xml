         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Prieſts</hi> of all ſorts have told the People, <hi>That the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>were Deceivers;</hi> and upon that account they (even they) have ſtirred the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> (both former and latter) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them in a moſt horrible manner.</p>
            <p>Now that the People may have a little notice of what we have done in order to the removing of this Scandalous Lye, and to clear our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency in the Matter, take a ſhort hint as followeth.</p>
            <p>Beſide ſeveral Demonſtrations of our Willingneſs from time to time for having a clear Tryal, according to the Scriptures of <hi>Truth,</hi> between <hi>Us</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts;</hi> the thing was alſo laid before the <hi>King</hi> after this manner, That it was our real deſire to have a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meeting with the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that as many as they would, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of us ſhould meet in a Place Publick and Convenient, that as many a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> could might hear; and that the Matter diſcuſſed upon ſhould be according to the Scriptures of Truth; and the party whoſe Way was found to derogate from the Scriptures, that that Party would confeſs their Error, and acknowledge the Truth held forth by the other Party: Now to this we were (and ſtill are) willing. <note place="margin">The Prieſts perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Chriſt, &amp; ſaid <hi>He had a Devil, &amp;c.</hi> They perſecute and ſtir Perſecution upon his Members now.</note> The King ſaid, <hi>That the thing was Reaſonable:</hi> So the thing was promiſed; but the <hi>Biſhops</hi> put it off, knowing that their Way would not concur with the Scriptures: And yet notwithſtanding, they have ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> againſt us, and they have been the great Cauſers of all the Perſecution, and Ruin, and Bloodſhed that have befallen us.</p>
            <p>Now, in Obedience to the Lord God, I bear my Teſtimony againſt all the Prieſts which are made by the Will and Approbation of men, without exception.</p>
            <p>Such Prieſts are <hi>Deceivers,</hi> and <hi>deceive</hi> People's Souls of their Eternal Felicity: Thus I charge them in the Name of the Lord, and prove them as followeth.</p>

               <note place="margin">Wherein the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Lord ſtandeth, and how contrary it is in all things to Satan's Kingdom.</note>The Power and Spirit of the Lord God is in all things contrary to the Spirit and Power of Darkneſs, which is the <hi>Devil;</hi> the Spirit of the Lord is Holy, Juſt and Righteous; and all that come to know that Spirit, and come to be guided by it, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by led to Holineſs, Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, and to Peace; in theſe things ſtandeth the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of the <hi>Devil</hi> ſtandeth in Sin, which is all manner of <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> all manner of <hi>Unrighteouſneſs, all Debauchery, all Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all Wantonneſs, all Prophaneneſs;</hi> theſe, and ſuch like, as <hi>Cruelty, oppreſſion, Tyranny, Hard-heartedneſs, Drunkenneſs, &amp;c.</hi> are the Fruits of the <hi>Devil's Kingdom:</hi> So here is the appearance of his Kingdom, and in what People ſoever theſe Fruits are manifeſted, they are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Kigdom, and he is their Godd and King.</p>
            <p>All men in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> are in this Periſhing State, and there is no Help to come out of it but by and through <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> the Power of God; and he brings People out of Sin, even ſuch as believeth in his Light and Spirit, and deſtroyeth the Root of it in them, and ſo they come to ceaſe from the Act of Sin, and that whilſt in the Body: [Mark] Man can Sin no longer then whilſt he is <hi>in the Body;</hi> for, after Death Judgment followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Teſtimony of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and the Prieſts Teſtimony contrary.</note>Now the Teſtimony of the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt</hi> is, That there is an abſolute Neeeſſity fot all Men and Women to know the Power of God to redeem them, whilſt in the Body, from Sin and Imperfection, or elſe the Guilt will remain upon them, and their Reward will be according to their <hi>Deeds done in the Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Prieſts</hi> Teſtimony (of all ſorts) unanimouſly is, <hi>That no man can be free from Sin and Imperfection on this ſide the Grave:</hi> So this is contrary to what they bind thoſe they call <hi>Godfathers</hi> to promiſe for Children.</p>
            <p>Therefore they are <hi>Deceivers,</hi> and ſuch as plead for the Devil, and his Intereſt, which is Sin and Imperfection, even ſo long while men can ſin no longer: Therefore in God's Dread and Authority I charge them to be <hi>Deceivers,</hi> and <hi>Miniſters of the Devil.</hi>
