            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Holy and Profitable Sayings OF THAT REVEREND DIVINE, Mr. <hi>WILLIAMDYER,</hi> Late Preacher of the Goſpel at <hi>Cheſham</hi> And <hi>Chouldſbury,</hi> in the County of <hi>Bucks.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MAny have the ſpace of Repentance who have not the Grace of Repentance.</p>
            <p>It's better to Repent without periſhing, than to periſh without Repenting</p>
            <p>For if the ſecond Birth have no place in you, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cond Death ſhall have power over you.</p>
            <p>There is more bitterneſs following upon ſins ending than ever there was ſweetneſs flowing from Sins Acting</p>
            <p>Love to Chriſt begets a hatred of ſin; now he love not Chriſt at all who loves him not above all.</p>
            <p>All our precious Mercies come ſwimming to us in precious Blood.</p>
            <p>They that ſow Holineſs in the Seedtime of their live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſhall Reap happineſs in the Harveſt of Eternity.</p>
            <p>It is better ſwimming in waterworks of Repentance, than burning in the Fireworks of Gods Vengeance.</p>
            <p>For there is no coming to the fair Haven of Glory, without ſailing thorow the narrow ſtrait of Repentance</p>
            <p>If Chriſt had not freed us from the Curſe, we had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved curſedly and dyed curſedly, and been damned for ever.</p>
            <p>They who deſpiſe the Death of the Lamb, ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feel the Wrath of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>They that will not own Chriſt at his firſt coming, Chriſt will not own them at his ſecond coming.</p>
            <p>He that came from Heaven to make the Saints Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, will alſo come from Heaven to make the Saints Glorious. He is the rich Jewel in the Cabinet of Glory.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever hath him cannot be poor, and whoſoever hath him not cannot be Rich.</p>
            <p>Saints take as much delight in thoſe Precepts, that injoin Holineſs, as they do in thoſe promiſes that aſſure Happineſs.</p>
            <p>If the day of Mercy leave you Graceleſs, the day of Judgment will find you Speechleſs.</p>
            <p>Inraged Juſtice will avenge the Quarrel, of abuſed Mercy. The longer God forbears not finding amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſorer he ſtrikes when he comes to Judgment.</p>
            <p>If Gods forbearing Mercy do not draw you to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, his Judgment will drive you to Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The Sea of Damnation, ſhall not be ſweetned with a drop of Compaſſion.</p>
            <p>As you look for Happineſs as long as God hath a being in Heaven, ſo God looks for Holineſs as long as you have a being on Earth.</p>
            <p>Man is the Excellency of the Creature, The Saint is the excellency of Man.</p>
            <p>Grace is the excellency of the Saint, and Glory is the excellency of Grace.</p>
            <p>It is a Greater Favour to be Converted than to be Created. Yea, far better to have no being, than not to have a new being.</p>
            <p>Inward Holineſs is better than outward Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Goodneſs without Greatneſs is better than Greatneſs without Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Chriſt threw himſelf into the Sea of his Fathers Wrath, to ſave poor Believers from Drowning.</p>
            <p>He hath ſhut the Door of Hell, took us from perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he hath opened the Gate of Heaven to let us into Salvation.</p>
            <p>O how much is it the Duty of Man to ſerve God, ſince God hath made all the world to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>If the Life of Chriſt be not your Pattern, the Death of Chriſt will never be your portion.</p>
            <p>The Soul of Man is the Cabbinet, the Grace of God is the Jewel; now Chriſt will throw away the Cabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, where he finds not the Jewel.</p>
            <p>Wherever Chriſt is a Prieſt for Redemption, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is a Prince for Dominion.</p>
            <p>Wherever he is a Saviour, there is he a Ruler.</p>
            <p>Where he is a Fountain of happineſs there he is a a Fountain of Holineſs.</p>
            <p>It is ſeldome ſeen that the ſparkling Diamond of a great Eſtate, is ſet in the Gold Ring of a Gracious heart.</p>
            <p>A ſight of our ſelves in Grace, will certainly bring us to a ſight of our ſelves in Glory.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Sins ſhall never make a Hell for us, that be a Hell to us, for where men are ſo dilligent as to do their beſt, God is ſo Indulgent he will forgive the worſt.</p>
            <p>To be in Chriſt is Heaven below, and to be with Chriſt is Heaven above.</p>
            <p>But therre is no being with Chriſt above, if we are not in Chriſt here below.</p>
            <p>Though Holineſs is that which a Sinner ſcorns, yet Holineſs is that which a Saviour Crowns.</p>
