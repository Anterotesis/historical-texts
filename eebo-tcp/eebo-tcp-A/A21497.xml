            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ To all true Catholicks and other her Maieſties louing Subiects.</head>
            <p>THE Printer ſaith, we must be ſhort: briefelie therefore thus. The reports which the Ieſuits giue out amongst their adherents: do in ſome points not much diſpleaſe vs. Though we cannot haue (if they proue true) what we deſired: yet haue we ſo much, as makes their harts to groane. <hi>We are</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>acquit in Rome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſchiſme.</hi> Burne then your booke <hi>Ma. Lyſter:</hi> which you writ against vs. <hi>Tichborne, Hadddock, Aray,</hi> or whoſoeuer gaue information, that we were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned in Rome for Schiſmaticks, to ſpeake plaine Engliſh, lyed. And you <hi>R. Archpt Garnet, Iones,</hi> &amp; all the ſort of you, bluſh for ſhame: (it is ſome ſigne of grace) in that you were ſo peremptory, to lay ſo falſe an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. It appeareth now, that you ſhewed therein neither iudgement, nor learning: but what ſpight, &amp; malice, let the world iudge. But more particulerly to you <hi>Ma. Archp:</hi> Is it not reaſon, that you ſhould with teares bewaile
<pb facs="tcp:336:3"/>
your raſhnes: in condemning the <hi>cenſure</hi> of <hi>Paris?</hi> It is ſomthing, that you haue ſo groſſe a foyle: but that is not ſufficient. What iniurie alſo haue you done to your <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> whoſe testimonies you peruerted triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phantly? Could neither your owne reading, nor your deere Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers illuminations, theyr familiaritie vvith GOD, the companions of Ieſus, better direct you? Behold (good Readers) your <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> your Masters, your Pilots, your Leaders.</p>
            <p>Our faculties are iudged (as we alſo heare) to haue beene <hi>validae ab initio,</hi> ſufficient from the beginning, that first we receiued them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent then in like maner Ma. Prouinciall. Your words were blaſphemous, when you writ: <hi>that it was ſin to intreate vs, or helpe vs to ſay maſſe: and that they, who ſhould receiue the Sacrament at our hands, ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue povſon.</hi> How ridiculous alſo haue then your featherleſſe bolts beene <hi>(Ma. Archp:)</hi> which full blindly (God knoweth) you haue ſhot about in euery corner at vs? Many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, and prohibitions you haue publiſhed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtraliter</hi> to vexe vs: but with more boldnes, then diſcretion, as now you may ſee. And for you <hi>Ma. Parſons:</hi> hath he ſo indeed? Durst his holines checke you? Could not the Spaniſh Embaſſadors preuent ſuch a diſgrace? But
<pb facs="tcp:336:3"/>
hold vp your head man. Though <hi>our Archp:</hi> ſhall be no more bound (as they ſay) to depend vpon your lips: yet you knowe him to be a <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie Roger</hi> vnto you, and your crue. What he was before commaunded to doe, hee will now performe of his owne accord. As good neuer a whit, as neuer the better: as long as he ſitteth at the helme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea,</hi> (but ſay you) <hi>my Maiſters: who muſt ſtill gouerne the Seminaryes? Wee hope we ſhall curbe you well enough. Beſides, my children, or ſubiects, the fellowes of Ieſus, ſhall remaine amongſt you in ſpight of your harts.</hi> Good wordes <hi>Father,</hi> Christ Ieſus, and your broode, fellow and fellow-like? Good fellewes, wee aſſure you. But must you gouerne ſtill our <hi>Seminaryes?</hi> Keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your children from them, deere Catholicks: except you intende purpoſely to haue them trayned vp in treaſon, if they may haue their wills. <hi>You muſt remaine amongſt vs.</hi> We are hartilie ſorrie for it: and that in two respects. First, becauſe you are theyr mediate head: and ſuch a head, as we ſuspect is either mad, or lately become addle. Why man: what meane you, by the <hi>Propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> ſent vs lately out of <hi>France?</hi> You haue forſooth a <hi>Reformation</hi> in hand: whereunto the <hi>Counſell</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> muſt yeeld
<pb facs="tcp:336:4"/>
homage. All must be ſquared to the Apostles times. It is well ſaid <hi>good Fryer.</hi> The appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of euery Clergie mans part, to liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: commeth within the Rules of your newe diſcipline. And what then ſhall become of <hi>his holines</hi> estate? Must hee haue no larger a portion, to maintaine him with, then <hi>S. Peter</hi> had? <hi>Blocks</hi> (you will ſay:) <hi>I onely ſpeake of England.</hi> By your good fauour <hi>Ma. Fryer,</hi> you alſo affirme, <hi>that after you haue doone your pleaſure in England: all other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches elſwhere, muſt conforme themſelues to ours.</hi> Certainly, the man is either not well in his wits: or els wee ſhall haue <hi>R. P.</hi> ſhortlie transformed into <hi>T. C.</hi> But of theſe points, you ſhall heare more before it be long. Secondly: how many Ieſuits of your humour in England, ſo many vaſſals &amp; ſworne friends to the King of Spayne: and conſequently ſo many enemies to her Maiestie, her state, and kingdome: nay wee know not, how many els wee may ioyne with them, Ieſuited ſeculer priests, lay Ieſuits, and all other Catholicks, that will be aduiſed by them, and follow theyr precepts. But must you remaine heere? tell vs truly: Indeede wee feared as much. And therefore we thought it our duties, to acquaint both you (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) and all the rest of her Maiesties true
<pb facs="tcp:336:4"/>
ſubiects (be their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwiſe how it ſhal) with the <hi>Ieſuits Catechiſme</hi> (lately publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed) &amp; with this preſent <hi>Treatiſe:</hi> that ſeeing wee cannot preuaile, to haue them all called hence, wee might make it apparant to all (that wil not hoodwinke themſelues wilfully) what is to be looked for at their hands. A Ieſuit is a Ieſuit, whereſoeuer he become. Neyther may England expect leſſe, then France hath felt: if they continue amongst vs, and be not better hamperd, then yet they are. We wiſh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire with our harts, that all true harted Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen, and eſpecially they, who are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, will be pleaſed to conſider ſeriouſly of the things, which wee haue written tending to this purpoſe: and withall (for this time) to reade and obſerue (if not this whole diſcourſe yet) the <hi>85. 86. 87. 88. 89.</hi> pages thereof. GOD preſerue this Realme from their Spaniſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignements: her Maieſtie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their <hi>Clements, Barrieres,</hi> and <hi>Ehuds,</hi> of the Ieſuiticall inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: the good eſtate of the Catholick church from their franticke deformations: vs poore ſecular prieſts from their malitious practiſes: and you all true Catholicks from the leauen of ſuch Phariſees.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE many Petitions ſundry vviſe preſented vnto your Maieſtie in fauour of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> and the many reaſons alledged vnto you againſt them, cannot but breed in your mind much doubt, and diſtraction. Vppon this ground I conceiued, that it might be ſome conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to your Highneſſe, to ſee in briefe what I haue layd downe on either part, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ouer many poynts of ſmall moment, and inſiſting onely vppon ſuch as are of weight, &amp; able to moue the hart of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Prince in a cauſe of high importance, &amp; requiring preſent and ſpeedie reſolution.</p>
            <p>It is moſt true (my gracious Soueraigne) that by reſtoring the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> you ſhall giue great contentment to a number of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:336:6"/>

They are men fit for action, induſtrious, vigilant, &amp; valiant, to whom the Pulpit reſts greatly indebted for comming in ſo dangerous, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the mayne, and principall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which may ſway your Maieſtie on the one ſide; as for that poynt, which is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged touching their <hi>Instructing of youth,</hi> it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues not almoſt to be thought vpon: in as much as (all thinges rightly weighed) they haue in truth done more hurt, then good to learning. My reaſon is this in a word.</p>
            <p>Before theyr comming into Fraunce, all the wits of beſt hope, all the youth of beſt breeding, were alwaies brought vp in the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> where were ſeene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually

twentie, or thirtie thouſand ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents between French &amp; Forrainers. This famous multitude drew thether all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Schollers, all the notable men of Europe, ſome to ſhew themſelues, others to benefit themſelues. The publique Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures founded by <hi>Frauncis</hi> the firſt, were for ten yeeres before their comming ſued for, and ſupplied by the worthieſt Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of thoſe times.

One poynt more, I muſt not forget, which was likewiſe noted by the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of <hi>Padua,</hi> in their <hi>Complaint</hi> exhibited in anno 91. againſt the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> before the Signiorie of <hi>Venice,</hi> at which time they were inhibited to read to any, but thoſe of their own Societie: the poynt is this. That the maine ſcope of their owne ſtudies bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> they vſe to ſubſtitute ouer all theyr Formes (the firſt onely excepted) none but young Punies, fitter (God wot) to be taught, then to teach: inſomuch as our youth continuing vntill 15. or 16. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands of ſuch rawe, and ignorant fellowes ſildome or neuer growe to be of anie eminent note, or attaine (as we ſee) to any excellencie in their profeſſions. This was apparantly prooued in anno 94. what time the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niuerſity</hi> preferd their <hi>Complaint</hi> againſt them. They endeuoured to finde out ſome worthy Lawyer, of theyr owne Schollers, to whom they might commit the <hi>Defence</hi> of theyr cauſe: (which might perhaps haue beene ſome helpe to theyr matter) they founde out a number as well young practitioners, as auncient Pleaders, who had been trained vp in their ſchooles, but not a man of them all thought able to

ſuſtaine the burden of ſo weighty a cauſe: and in the end, they were faine to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to another, without doubt, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lawyer, but neuer any Scholler of theirs. They bring vp their Schollers, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to contemplation, then to ſtudie, and action. Likewiſe for <hi>Phyſicke,</hi> a learned profeſſion, and full of deepe knowledge, how many rare men do we ſee of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that haue been their Schollers? As for <hi>Humanitie,</hi> and the myſterie of the tongues, therein are they leſſe conuerſant. Will you haue the truth, their proper ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> that's their <hi>Facultie,</hi> that's their field: therein are they expert: and to that purpoſe they cull out in the very bud, the moſt pregnant &amp; ſharp wits, &amp; looke who once comes vnder their fingers, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gets away againe: by meanes whereof, their Order becomes a confuſion of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nations: moreouer, they take a courſe to helpe and further one another, and by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference to haue vſe of one anothers ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: In concluſion all the world muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them to be kings in this <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> the Queene of all <hi>Faculties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſaying that they are not skild in the depth, &amp; myſterie of the <hi>Tongues,</hi> my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:336:8"/>
is not to denie, but that in their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber may be found men of ſome reaſonable knowledge in <hi>Humanitie,</hi> but this I ſay, that we may not looke to finde amongſt them any, comparable to thoſe foure ornaments of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> the peeres of learning, ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and confeſt ouer the whole world, of whom there are three yet liuing, and the fourth alſo ſuruiues in his better part.

            <p>Furdermore we are to obſerue, that thoſe amongſt them, who attaine to any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie knowledge that way, buſie not their braines any longer with the <hi>Instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of youth,</hi> but preſently betake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the ſtudie of <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> wherein beeing prompted, and aſsiſted by the beſt paines of the greateſt men amongſt them, they fall a practizing with theyr pennes: and do good ſeruice (we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe) for the maintenaunce of our Catholicke Religion againſt the writings of our <hi>Aduerſaries.</hi>

            <p>What is this, but to make our Chriſtian Religion, a religion of meere Impoſtors, a Religion of Matchiaueliſts, pretending at the firſt, that <hi>our kingdom is not of this world, all of vs, as well of the Clergie, as other, liue in obedience to Kings and Gouernours:</hi> But afterwards hauing once gotten the winde, and ſeazed the Sworde into our ovvne hand, then to change our note cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and in preſumptuous manner to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate

Indeede this is right the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, theſe be their policies, this is the path they tread, to inſinuate or get footing within a Realme: but Chriſtian religion keepes a far other courſe, it ſpeakes ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and vnfainedly, without cloaking, without colouring, without diſſembling: it neither withdraweth, nor embezeleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſubiect whatſoeuer from his Prince, as doth the religion of the <hi>Ieſuits.</hi> For marke I beſeech you, <hi>Bellarmines</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion, in the 271. page of the ſaid Tractat: <hi>De exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one cleric: You will ſay perhaps, this were a wrong done to Princes, if against theyr wil they were depriued of their right, which they had ouer</hi> Clergie men, <hi>before they were of the Clergie.

the matter: This is to make ſhort work, and to tell you in a word, that looke how many <hi>Clergie men</hi> your Maieſtie hath, ſo many ſubiects hath the Pope in France. And to that effect in the 255. page he hath theſe very words: <hi>The Pope hath exempted</hi> all the Clergie, <hi>from the ſubiection of theyr ſeculer Princes, whereuppon it followeth, that as</hi> concerning the Clergie, <hi>they are</hi> not So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Princes. This is (my liege) in good French, to erect another ſtate within the ſtate, and another kingdome within your kingdom.

            <p>Theſe hereſies (my Liege) were once wholie rooted out of your Realme of Fraunce, but theſe fellowes begin to ſowe them thicke againe, and haue founde the meanes cunningly to conuey this <note n="*" place="margin">De exemp cleric.</note>  Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe   into Fraunce, together with that of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,</hi> ſhuffling it in amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the preaſe, that it might paſſe vnregarded.</p>

Of this <hi>Poſition,</hi> viz. <hi>That thoſe who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into</hi> the Clergie, <hi>are no longer ſubiects,</hi> followeth a ſtrange conſequence, to wit, <hi>that they may conſpire &amp; practiſe againſt their King, and yet not incur the guilt of treaſon.</hi> This is deliuered in expreſſe termes, in the <hi>Aphoriſmes</hi> of <hi>confeſsion,</hi> written by the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, Emanuel Sa,</hi> vpon the word <hi>Clericus.

            <p>Where firſt of all wee may note theyr bad meanings, to leaue a poynt of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

or no, that they may be at choiſe to hold eyther the one or the other part, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as ſhall beſt fit their deſires, and deſignes. Secondly, what is more diſſonant from Chriſtian religion, then to leaue it to the libertie of the people, to iudge of the good, or ill gouernment of theyr Prince, &amp; to make them belieue, that without pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill to theyr conſcience, &amp; offence to God, they may, either depoſe him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his crown, or depriue him of his life? prouided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes that the <hi>greater part</hi> be of that mind. A clauſe moſt important, for if the leſſer part were of that brainſick opinion, then might they fortune to periſh in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and vvhat pitty were it to looſe a companie ſo <hi>well diſpoſed</hi> to Ieſuitiſme, that is, to hunt their Lord and Maiſter out of his proper inheritance, crying after him, <hi>Atyrant, Atyrant?</hi> And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why <hi>Pardo</hi> the Inquiſitor of <hi>Anwerp,</hi> in the very end of that booke dated 1597, allowes it this commendation, that it vvas like to yeeld greate fruite, and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and God knowes whether it were not in his thought, that the greateſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it could yeelde to his Maiſter, vvas to helpe forward the deſtruction of your

kingdome, with whom at that time he was at mortall warrs. Furthermore, the ſame <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> in thoſe <hi>Aphoriſmes of Confeſſion,</hi> (which they daily beate into the mindes of the people) adde hereunto vpon the word <hi>Tyrannus, He which gouerneth tyrannicallie a kingdome, whereof hee is rightfully poſſeſſed, cannot be depoſed, but by authoritie of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement: but ſentence beeing once giuen, the next at hand may execute it. And he may be depoſed euen by thoſe his ſubiects, that haue ſworne perpetuall obedience to him, in caſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter admonition, he doe not reforme himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I leaue it to your Maieſties conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether this doctrine touch you neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or no. Certaine I am it imports not ſo much to the whole worlde beſides, as it doth to you alone, and to your poſteritie. Fraunce is your owne inheritance, vvhich you hold onely by God &amp; by your ſword. If the world ſhould continue ten thouſand yeeres longer, and your poſteritie as long (as wee are to wiſh it might) it ought in right to raigne continually ouer Fraunce, neither ſhall any Pope, (as ſome of them may fortune to be enemies to your houſe) euer haue authoritie to abſolue ſo much as one Frenchman, from that allegeance,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:336:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which he ſhall owe to your ſucceſſion. But if theſe <hi>Poſitions</hi> may once creepe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, then ſhall your poſteritie weare the Crowne, and enioy the ſcepter ſo long, as ſhall ſtand with the pleaſure of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sea, and no longer.</p>
            <p>Out of this firſt principle is deduced a ſecond, whereuppon I ſee much vvritten on both ſides, but none comes neere the marke. Some affirme that the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell men to murther Kings, but they doe them wrong. For they (God wot) cleane contrariwiſe ſerue and obey Kings, and many times alſo with hartie affection: but marke theyr diſtinction. They holde that, <hi>ſuch as are excommunicate by the Pope, are no longer Kings, but Tyrants,</hi> and what they comment vpon the word <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> your Maieſtie hath alreadie heard. In briefe, grant but theyr firſt propoſition, &amp; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond will followe of neceſſitie. For allowe the Pope <hi>power to intermeddle with the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and temporall estates of Kings,</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> doctrine) then is it cleer that a <hi>King, (beeing once by his Holines decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red excommunicate) remaines a priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and no longer King: and if he offer obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to continue his raigne, he is to be held a</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:336:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Tyrant.</hi> Whoſoeuer will yeelde them the former propoſition, ſhall be drawne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force to the latter. That Libell written by <hi>Iohn Guignard</hi> a <hi>Ieſuit</hi> with his owne hand, (as hee acknowledged in the open Court of Parlement, both the chambers beeing aſſembled) contained both theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, but vnder moſt inſolent and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious termes. For among other things, hee breakes foorth into theſe vvordes, <hi>That</hi> cruell Nero, <hi>was ſlaine by a</hi> Clement, <hi>and that</hi>

For if the <hi>Pope may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully excommunicate Kings,</hi> and that <hi>beeing excommunicate, it is a good, and meritorious deede to murther them,</hi> then doth it follow of congruence, that the partie ought <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to endure martyrdome therefore,</hi> and not to procure their death, who ſet him the readie way to euerlaſting life.

            <p>There is no man but knowes, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and deſignement of the <note n="*" place="margin">Sixteen go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours choſen, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion by the ſeditious multitude within Paris, to rule the cittie.</note>

And whether goe theſe <hi>Sixteene</hi> to chooſe them a <hi>Preſident</hi> of that their bloodie counſell? Went they not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> who commended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them <hi>Father Otho Pigenat?</hi> This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by themſelues in their <hi>Apologie,</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Paris: mary they pretend, it was to mitigate and allay the humour of the <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene.</hi> Some man perhaps would aunſwer, that this was, to quench fire with oyle, to turne a <hi>Ieſuite</hi> among a crewe of ſeditious perſons. For my part I ſay not ſo, I ſay the <hi>Sixteene</hi> did in truth neede a bridle, &amp; not a ſpurre, and that the onely courſe to bring their deſignes to the mark they ſhot at, was to temper their extreame &amp; outragious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. But in the meane time, who ſeeth not a wonderfull correſpondencie, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement betweene theſe <hi>Sixteene</hi> execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners (for by what fitter name can I call them? ſeeing with their owne hands they hangd vp the <hi>chiefe Preſident</hi> of the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, who knowes not that from the beginning of the yeere 85, their <hi>Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> both at <hi>Paris</hi> and elſe-where, were the common retreits for al thoſe that laboured the aduauncement of the Spaniſh affaires. Thether were the packets addreſt, there opened, and from thence diſperſed: that they had daily entercourſe with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Embaſſadour <hi>Mendoza,</hi> and thoſe that ſucceeded him at Paris, and generally with the Agents &amp; Factors for king <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> cauſes, in all the good townes where they remained. Your Maieſtie knowes it, no man better.</p>
            <p>The troth is (my liege) they alledge, that you are nowe vnited in ſo ſtraight a league of amitie with the king of Spaine, as that theſe obiections ought rather to make for them, then againſt them, inaſmuch as your Maieſtie affects none more entirely, then thoſe who beare a hartie and entire affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Spaniard. This ſpeech may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily

come now in ſeaſon, but I aſſure you, I thought it ſtrange to hear this ſpeech fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to fall from their pens at that time, when wee were in the chiefe heate of our warrs with the Spaniſh king. <hi>Jn</hi>

Me thinks theyr Fatherhoods ſhould not ſuffer themſelues to be ſo much tranſported either by theyr owne affection, or by the generall vow of their Order, as to forget in what place they were bred and borne, &amp; not to be touched with the leaſt feeling of the wofull calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Country, eſpecially they being catholicks, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Spaniards thus ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in great multitudes, without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, or reſpect either of age, or ſex.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:336:26"/>
This (mee thinkes) ſauours of a hart too ſauadge, and degenerate, to ſpeak ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in defence of them, who at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant were bathing their hands in the blood of our countrymen, and thoſe Catholicks alſo. VVhat though the Spaniards giue theſe <hi>Fathers</hi> reſpect, honour, &amp; reuerence aboue ordinarie, though they binde them by many ſpeciall benefits, and ſinguler fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, though they entitle them by the name of Apoſtles (as they themſelues doe publiſh in their writings) yet ought they not for all this (eſpecially in Fraunce) to vſe the ſame ſtile of them in the heate of war, as in the time of peace.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Petition</hi> which they afterwards preferd to your Maieſty, they haue dilated this argument, though with greater libertie of ſpeech, yet with more reaſon, then at that time. Their wordes are theſe. <hi>And whereas they challenge vs to be Spaniſh: that was an accuſation, faſhioned in the forge of of time, and it bare a good test in that ſeaſon, (onely in reſpect of the ſeaſon) that is, while the warre continued betweene Fraunce, and Spaine. In thoſe dayes it was an odious name, a name full of ſuſpition and hate: but now, that that your</hi> Moſt Chriſtian <hi>maiestie hath knit</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And yet (my liege) to tell you true, this I obſerue (beſides the too euident proofe, which we haue formerly had thereof) that through out all theſe glorious and painted ſpeeches, they ſtill diſcouer theyr harts to be mightily engaged to the king of Spain. The troth is, they haue an earneſt deſire to deliuer your Maieſtie of all iealouſie, and diſtruſt thereof, and to that purpoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the vtmoſt of their art: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a man ſhall perceaue, they would not at any hand, but your ſubiects ſhould take notice, that they remaine true deuoted ſeruaunts to king <hi>Phillip,</hi> preſuming that this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, makes greatly to the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his affaires.

            <p>Furdermore, your Maieſtie is to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that this doctrine of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> carries with it at this preſent, more danger, and perrill to our Realme, then in former times, when we had <note n="*" place="margin">Sicilie, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, which haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beene ſubiect to the French king.</note>  territories, &amp; ſorces   in Italie: by meanes wherof we weare at hand to ſuccour the Pope, in caſe he might be forced to doe any thing to our preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. But as now the caſe ſtands, a <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iceroy</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> with the <hi>Spaniſh partakers,</hi> that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:336:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are within Rome, holde the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> necke vnder their girdle, vvho might be thriſe beſieged, and ſackt, before we could come halfe way to the reſcue. Another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience is, that Rome was neuer able to ſuſtaine it ſelfe, but by the ſupply of come from <hi>Sicilie,</hi> their granarie.</p>
            <p>And amongſt the reſt, this poynt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues ſpeciall obſeruation, that the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> being guiltie to themſelues, of what perill theyr doctrine is to the ſtate of Princes, are carefull and warie not to diſcouer it, when firſt they creepe, &amp; inſinuate into a State: but hauing once got firme footing, then do they ſpread it by degrees from hand to hand amongſt the people, who are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ouer-apt, and prone to receaue this poyſon. For what can ſound more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the minds of a multitude, then to be releaſed of that bond of ſubjectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are by their birth tied, &amp; engaged? I know that men of vnderſtanding forget not that excellent ſaying of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, <hi>That for a man to liue in ſubiection to his Prince, is true, and perfect libertie:</hi> and the lawes both of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> doe teach and tie vs to ſerue, and honour that Prince, vnder whoſe gouernment we firſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:336:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
enioyed the light of the Sun: and that no fleſh and blood is able to diſpence vs, for that obedience, whereunder God himſelfe hath bound and concluded vs: but for one well diſpoſed mind, that is thus perſwaded, you ſhall finde three that are of a contrarie opinion, and the miſchiefe is, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſtouteſt, the moſt reſolute, &amp; deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate fellowes, are ſooneſt caried down this ſteepe, and head-long diſcent; and a ſmall number of ſuch ſtirring ſpirits, prooue too hard for a multitude of others. Haue vvee not had experience heereof? I am verily perſwaded, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the late king was firſt proclaimed <hi>Tyrant</hi> in Paris, vpon pretence that <hi>hee was excommunicate by the Pope, and therefore to be expelled his kingdome,</hi> the citie affoorded two for one, that were of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie beleefe, and would gladly haue ſeene him raigne peaceably in the Louver, and a douſen of thoſe rebellious malcontents hangd at the <note n="*" place="margin">The place of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within Paris.</note>  
               <hi>Greue.</hi> But they ſtoode ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring   one vpon another: they wanted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, they wanted not ſtrength. So haue three theeues many times by ſurpriſal robd halfe a ſcore Merchants. They that keepe the beaten roade, and continue in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural obedience, take their reſt in the night,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:336:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and follow their buſines in the day: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as contrariwiſe, ſuch as labour to exchange their old maiſter for a new, ſuch as ſtudy to ouerturne the State, they haue their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies by night, holde their ſecrete parlies, encreaſe their ſtrength daily: they haue no buſineſſe elſe to entend, (for they liue in the meane time vpon their ſecret penſions) ſo that in the end, they ſuddenly ſurprize the contrarie ſide. He that firſt laieth hand on his weapon, hath the aduantage.</p>
            <p>This then being ſo, that the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vphold theſe dangerous Poſitions, and ſcatter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> throughout the worlde (as hath beene ſhewen) I aſſure your Maieſtie, the danger of ſuffering this doctrine to take roote, ſeemes to mee (I muſt confeſſe) to ouer-ballance all thoſe conſiderations, that may be alledged to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. For as for ouerthrowing the <hi>New opinions in Religion,</hi> we may ſay, and ſay truly, that as during the firſt fiftie yeeres, the opinions of <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Caluine</hi> were ſtoutly propoſed, preached, and publiſhed, ſo for theſe fiue, &amp; twenty, or thirtie yeeres, they haue beene notably confuted, both by word, &amp; writings, ſuch as for depth of learning, haue by infinite degrees exceeded all, that euer were ſet
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:336:30"/>
foorth by men of former times. And our ſelues can teſtifie, that the beſt, &amp; moſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient amongſt them, are daily reclaimed into the boſome of the Church: A matter that (in my opinion) ſhould work in vs all, exceeding comfort, and contentment. For theſe bleſſed conuerſions are not forced with the Racke, with tortures, or with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of death: as is the manner of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Inquiſition,</hi> (vnto which, and to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Castile,</hi> the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> wholy attribute the preſeruation of the Catholick religion, as hath beene formerly declared:) but by the ſword of the ſpirit, and the euerlaſting word, mildly deliuered by our Doctors, Paſtors, and reuerent Biſhops, whom I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme no whit inferiour, for learning, to the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> although they ſometimes bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe their arguments, which are in truth very ſound and ſubſtantiall.</p>
            <p>And albeit the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> haue ſometimes furthered ſuch conuerſions, yet this I will ſay, that they are not (in my iudgement) ſo fortunate heerein, as are the Biſhops, and Doctors of our Church. Their carriage is ſo auſtere, and ſo far different from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our French Nation, as it difaſteth men at the firſt encounter. They conuerſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:336:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and company ſo much with Spaniards, &amp; withal frame themſelues ſo preciſely to the imitation of their <hi>Paetron</hi> (a Spaniard born) that their lookes, their preſence, their faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and behauiour, carie with them too great aſemblance of ſeueritie.</p>
            <p>Who ſo deſires to cure a ſick perſon, muſt apply himſelfe to his humor, and cal about him ſuch Phyſicians, as the patient can fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and affect. Such are not the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> to Frenchmen: They haue in ſo furious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thundred out ſuch intolerable blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt the deceaſed King, as the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror therof dooth to this day retaine an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in mens minds. Frenchmen haue a certaine inclination by nature, to loue theyr Prince: and that cauſeth their harts ſuddenly to riſe, and ſtart within their breaſts, when they heare ſuch outragious ſpeeches vttered againſt their kings. I once ſent them word, (for I once loued them well, if not too wel) by a cloſe copartner of theirs, with whom I had talke about theyr doings: that I was ſorie to ſee them ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly enraged againſt a dead man, and that the ſeruices, which this vnfortunate Prince had performed to the Church in his life time, hauing in her quarrell ſo often
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:336:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
times, in ſuch a number of battailes, in ſo many ſieges, aduentured his deereſt blood, might (mee thought) deſerue at leaſt to haue his memorie ſpared, when hee vvas dead: They made him anſwere, there was ſome reaſon in that he ſaid, but the time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired another courſe, for nowe or neuer was the ſeaſon, to ſettle and eſtabliſh the Catholick religion quite thorow Fraunce. I ſoone aymed at the meaning thereof, to wit, that they were determined, to worke the people into a diſlike with the preſent gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vnder which they had ſo long liued, perſwading them to change theyr naturall Lord for a new, and vtterlie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the race &amp; familie of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> And when I afterwards, beheld the <note n="*" place="margin">Receaued into Paris by the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, where they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 3. yeres.</note>  garriſons   of <hi>Castilians,</hi> and <hi>Neapolitans</hi> within Paris, I tooke that to be an entrance to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of their former aunſwere: and to be plaine (my liege) I made reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the game had been at an end, &amp; that your Maieſtie was neuer like to ſet foote vvithin Paris; iudging that the ſmaller townes would be faine in the end to ſtrike ſayle to the greater.</p>
            <p>But God who hath alwaies had a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler care of this kingdome, the firſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:336:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſtned kingdome in the world, hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe diſpoſed it, and hath by plaine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, in deſpight of your enemies, ſeated you in quiet poſſeſſion of all this ſpacious Empire, and to heape vp the meaſure of your happines, hath giuen you a beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a noble, and a vertuous Princeſſe, and within ten months, (fore-ſtalling both our wiſhes, and our expectations) a true and liuely Image of your ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The care for this young Prince, more then for your owne perſon, exciteth your Highnes, with mature deliberation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of all the important affaires of your State, in which number, this poynt touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Restoring of the Ieſuits,</hi> may vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily claime a place.</p>
            <p>In this conſultation, one of theſe three courſes muſt be reſolued vpon; <hi>eyther to yeeld the Ieſuits abſolute contentment to their deſires,</hi> or <hi>to make them yeeld abſolute obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to your Decrees:</hi> or <hi>elſe to</hi>  
               <note n="*" place="margin">That is, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them wholie into France, nor to remoue them out of Bourdeaux &amp; Tholouſe, where they yet remaine.</note>  
               <hi>let matters rest in ſuch condition as now they are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will firſt enter into examination of the laſt branch, becauſe it beares at firſt ſight the moſt plauſible ſhew, yet is in truth the leaſt queſtionable: it beeing a cleere caſe, that the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> are, eyther wholie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:336:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or to be enforced, wholy to yeeld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to your <hi>Decree.</hi> If it be iuſt, and commodious for your ſtate, that they be permitted to ſtay, then is it reaſon they ſhould remaine as inhabitants, and not as exiles: if otherwiſe, then let them be gone, and not be ſuffered, by their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumacie to giue example of rebellion, as they haue doone too long. The Lacedemonian ſtate, was wont to direct out but a ſmal ſcroule of Parchment, leſſe then your little finger, &amp; theyr commaund was inſtantly to be put in execution. It is a matter of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, that your Highneſſe be obeyed as well at Bourdeaux and Tholouſe, as at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris and Fontaine-bleau. You want no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts in thoſe places, and whatſoeuer you ſhall commaund, like a King, and abſolute Lorde, will be executed, make you no doubt.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> be incommodious to your ſtate, then ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to take any deepe roote in thoſe two Prouinces. The Tree which this yeere may be plucked vp vvith one hand, will the next yeere aske both: and the third, will neede a mattock, and an axe. This neighboring vpon Spaine, giues vs iuſt cauſe of ſuſpicion &amp; iealouſie. They
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:336:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue been alwayes charged to be Spaniſh; they haue declared it in the whole courſe of their actions, the older this complaint hath beene, the truer, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>If in any part of your realme, they ſhould be leaſt ſuffered to fortifie, it is in ſuch a frontier, as is ſituate far from our Sun, and neere to the climate of <hi>Madrill:</hi> A man would iudge, that Spaine ſets in, to backe them: or that they retire thether of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to barricado, &amp; ſtrengthen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt your Maieſtie, as who ſhould ſay, You haue driuen vs out of Paris and other places, but your armes are too ſhort to force vs any further.

of it: but they muſt know, that they owe as much obedience to your Maieſtie, as the meaneſt vaſſall in Paris, none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. This is too high a preſumption, this is to open a contempt. Your want of iſſue hath hetherto made them holde you in neglect, (to vſe the wordes of an ancient Emperour) now make them knowe, that they ſhall owe their allegeance to you, and your poſteritie for euer, and it will make the proudeſt of them all to tremble. <hi>The remembrance of a treſpaſſe doone to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neuer dies in the ſonne.</hi>

            <p>When your Maieſtie had reduced Paris vnder your obedience, it was expected of all hands, that you ſhould inſtantly haue hunted out all thoſe bad ſeruitors, who had with their enuenomed cups, poyſoned a great part of your ſubiects, and with open face declared themſelues ſworne enemies to the King deceaſed, and your ſelfe.

In this meane time, happened that ſtroke which God turned away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your throat, and vſed your teeth for a defence againſt it.

            <p>Vppon this confeſſion they ſent to the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> Colledge, vvhere amongſt other things, was found a diſcourſe, pend by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Guignard,</hi> and written with his owne hand; containing in it, the ſap &amp; marrow of all this barbarous, this bloodie, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious

This vvhole practiſe iumpt with that which had been prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, but not beleeued in anno 64, &amp; with other predictions the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> newly foretold.

            </p>
            <p>Vppon theſe proceedings, what milder courſe could the Parlement aduiſe on, then to aſſent to the <hi>Request</hi> of the <hi>Vniuerſitie:</hi> God himſelfe ſeeming by a kinde of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to ſhew himſelfe as Iudge in the cauſe, by ſetting forth (without further miſchiefe) to the view of the world, the truth of that which had at ſeuerall times beene prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied againſt that Societie, and which theyr

out for any time, inaſmuch as they grewe ſcanted of theyr meanes, and that then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would be eaſily taken, for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this <hi>Sentence:</hi> howbeit as we ſee, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reſpects, &amp; occurrences haue delayed, and put it off till this day: And this (my liege) is the plaine, and vndiſguiſed truth of the whole cariage of this matter: this hath been the proceeding, and iudgement of your Court againſt the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> executed in part, and in part pretermitted.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:336:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
places (God wot.) I will tell you a ſtrange thing, and it is true. There is no man but knowes, how hard it is for a <hi>Frenchman</hi> to get entrance into the Caſtle of <hi>Milan:</hi> and when all is done, hee muſt paſſe vnder the name of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and at his perill to, if he chaunce to be diſcouered. Yet this I wil ſay, that let all the <hi>French Ieſuits,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine at this day in <hi>Guienne,</hi> &amp; <hi>Languedoc,</hi> preſent themſelues before the gates, &amp; let but one <hi>Ieſuit</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> auouch them of his knowledge, to be <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> they ſhal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently haue the bridge let downe, and the great gates ſet wide open to receiue them. Such a ſinguler vertue hath the die and tincture of Ieſuitiſme, as that it drownes all naturall colours whatſoeuer. And in truth, to what perſons liuing are the Spaniards more indebted, then to this Societie? who haue vndertaken ſuch toyles, and trauailes for the aduauncement, &amp; encreaſe of their Empire, as they, whom onely they haue to <note place="margin">Vnion de Portugal fol. 197. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But from whence proceedes this vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful affection of the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> vnto Spaine? The cauſe is two-fold. The firſt taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their originall, which was Spaniſh, &amp; that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:336:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was it, that firſt ingrafted in them this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affection, wherein they haue been by tradition fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hand to hand, nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, they ſet it downe for a principle, that the Turkiſh Empire, can neuer be brought to finall ouerthrow, but by ſome Monarche of Chriſtendome, and caſting their eyes round about, they ſee none in their opinion comparable, for wealth, puiſſance, and poſſeſſions, vnto the houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> in whoſe handes it the whole Empire, part of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> the better halfe of <hi>Italie,</hi> all <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies:</hi> beſides that they eſteem the king of Spain the onely man, able to reduce all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the Catholicke religion.</p>
            <p>No man knowes better, then your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, how far the deſignes of the houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> tend and aſpire, who promiſe to themſelues no leſſe, then the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> vviſh them.

            <p>This hath beene hetherto truly verified in our ſtate: for there was neuer any thing fore-told, touching the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> and theyr deſignements, but hath iuſtly fallen out: yet was there neuer any of thoſe predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belieued, vntill the blow was felt.</p>

            <p>Perhaps they wil pretend, that this fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full encreaſe of their <hi>nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber,</hi> is an argument of Gods bleſſing vpon their Societie: but this were both a dangerous, and an abſurd conſequence.

            </p>
            <p>What courſe is then to be taken in this matter? The courſe is plaine &amp; eaſie: that his Holineſſe be fullie informed of thoſe weightie reaſons, which inforce an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſitie of putting the aforeſaid <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> of the <hi>Parlement</hi> in execution. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which there is one very memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not heeretofore remembred: that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede other companies, and ſocieties, did in thoſe times, affoord heere and there a man, who behaued themſelues in vile, and outragious manner againſt their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and therein matched the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> to the full. They marched (I ſay) hand in hand with the formoſt of them: if the one ſtrained his throat with thundring againſt the King, the other ſpared not his: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of now the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> can well remember vs, they play the Orators therein, they retch that ſtring to the higheſt noat; their books and <hi>Petitions,</hi> containe wholie diſcourſes of that ſubiect; the ſumme vvhereof is, <hi>if we had a deepe hand in thoſe vndutifull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be you ſure there were of other Orders, who cam not far behind vs.</hi> But yet in all this they come not to the point: no, they will
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:336:51"/>
none of that, that is ſlipt ouer in ſilence: that in all other <hi>Orders,</hi> though ſome there were, who bare a vehement affection to Spaine, yet there were others, which did worthy ſeruice at <hi>Tours, Caen, Renes, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, Chalon,</hi> and thoſe other few Townes of note, which remained vnder the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our late King. Theſe good men, woorthily deſeruing the name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, of Catholicks, of <hi>Religious</hi> perſons, ceaſed not in their pulpits, (the ſeats of truth, &amp; not of leaſing, of comfortable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and not of contumelious inuec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues) to confute, and ouerthrow, that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous doctrine of rebellion, which the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> built and ſet vp in their daily Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons within the reuolted Citties. But this is wonderful, this is that memorable point, that in the vvhole troope of the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> there was not one founde, (one is a ſmall number) &amp; yet I ſay againe there was not one, that from <note n="*" place="margin">Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan againſt the laſt king.</note> 89 to <note n="*" place="margin">vvhat time the king that nowe is, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Paris.</note> 94, was heard to let fall one word, that might be ſtrained to the good of his Prince, or countrie: but euermore vehement in behalfe of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, and to qualifie the hard conceit of his gouernment. What can any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie hereunto? Who can denie this to haue
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:336:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beene a generall, a terrible, a monſtrous, a helliſh conſpiracie? and now hauing miſt their marke, they take vs belike for meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſely ſots, if they hope, wee will keepe them ſtill in ſtore, that at the next oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, hauing taken better ayme, they may deſtroy both vs and our State toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>True it is (my liege) that to rid you of all feare, and feeling, they frame two allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: One is, that they are mightily refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they are not the men, they were, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your Maieſtie ſaw them, they are none of thoſe, that wrought you ſo many diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Secondly, it is alledged, that if they were willing to harme your Maieſtie, yet they want force to effect it.</p>
            <p>For proofe of the firſt, they make oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a ſolemne <note n="*" place="margin">1. Ieſ. Catech. lib. 3. ca. 13.</note>  
               <hi>Decree</hi> concluded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt   them, that they <hi>ſhall no more inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in matters of State.</hi> But let vs ſee, what date this <hi>Decree</hi> beares; they ſay of <hi>anno</hi> 93. Hath your Maieſtie then alreadie forgotten, that ſince that time, they haue practiſed twiſe againſt your life? Behold the performance of this glorious <hi>Decree,</hi> Doe not we know the generall exception of all their ſtatuts: <hi>Vnleſſe it be for the good</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:336:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>of the Church,</hi> an exception, that extends as farre, as they liſt to ſtraine it? But will you vnderſtand, how they are reſolued, not to intermedle any more with the <hi>State,</hi> &amp; the good reſpect thy carie towards it? Doe but peruſe their aforeſaid <hi>Apologie,</hi> giuen out vnder the title of <hi>The defence of the</hi>

               <hi>truth,</hi> and in the 229 page you ſhall meete with theſe words. <hi>But what kind of creature is this ſame</hi> State? <hi>Let vs behold her face, that the Ieſuits may no more intermedle in her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and thereby incurre the heauie diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of her iealous friends, and fauourites.</hi> And in the 231. page, <hi>Let theſe good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks be aduiſed, what they ſay, accuſing the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits for intermedling in too many matters, &amp; let them take heede, that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw not the state, by making ſo light account of their religion, and that in ſeeking the quiet, &amp;</hi> peace of the earth, <hi>they both miſſe of it, &amp; loſe beſides the peace of heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it poſſible, in a more inſolent, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous manner, to profeſſe, that they will continue more then euer heeretofore, to worke the ruine and ouerthrow of the State, whoſe face they ſay they know not? And they haue reaſon, for they neuer har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in their harts any other proiect, but
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:336:53"/>
the ſubuerſion of States, diſauthorizing of Magiſtrates, and ſeducing of ſubiects from their allegeance. Moreouer, you heare how they proclaime the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſworne enemies to all that are friends to <hi>peace.</hi> Neither muſt it be forgotten, that in the very ſame page 229. to make odious to the people, all ſuch as wiſh the ſafety of your ſtate, your crown, &amp; Scepter, they haue framed a new terme, calling them <note n="*" place="margin">Eſtatiens.</note> 
               <hi>Statemongers.</hi> During their tempeſtuous raigne, they termed vs <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,</hi> they dare no longer meddle vvith that word, it hath beene too often <note n="*" place="margin">By the Edict of Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> called in: they coyne a nevve of the ſame ſtamp. An ordinarie tricke with their <hi>Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Maieſtie ſeeth then, in what ſort the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> accompliſh this painted <hi>Decree,</hi> which notwithſtanding they oppoſe as a ſhield againſt all Obiections what ſoeuer. But who euer heard, that any man was ſo ſimple, to build vpon ſuch promiſes, or to ground aſſurance vpon the like <hi>Decrees,</hi> or reſolutions? It would bear as likely a ſhew, if the <hi>Pirats</hi> ſhould ſend word to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that they haue in a <hi>generall Synode,</hi> concluded to roue or rob no more, &amp; that they may now ſafely giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaue to ſaile
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:336:53"/>
in conſort with them. A pretie tale to tell a child. And who is ſo ignorant in the courſe of matters abroad, as that hee knowes not, how the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> are as great, if not greater <hi>entermedlers,</hi> then euer they were?

            <p>But to digreſſe no farther from our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I would faine knowe, if the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> were admitted into theſe quarters againe, vvho ſhould be their controller, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer? who could haue intelligence vvhat meſſengers went to and fro to their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, what ſecret aſſemblies vvere there holden, what counſels were there giuen: who ſeeth not, that they muſt foorthwith haue the raines as looſe, as in the yeere 88?

            <p>But to returne to our purpoſe.

Let vs proceed one point further. Their <hi>Patrone</hi> was a chiefe Commaunder in the Spaniſh garriſon within <hi>Pampelune:</hi> and his <hi>followers</hi> likewiſe planted, and vpheld for the ſpace of three yeres, a Spaniſh gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon in <hi>Paris.</hi> But al this is nothing to that, which now I come to touch. The diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this <hi>Loyola,</hi> foreſeeing out of theyr ſharpe, and percing iudgement, that the <note n="*" place="margin">The King hat now is.</note>  grandchild of this King, &amp; this Queene, (ſo miſerablie turnd out of their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)   would one day become the terrour of Spain, haue left nothing vndone, which could fall into the imagination of the moſt vowed, and mortall enemies in the world, for the extirpation of this young branch. And ſeeing him in deſpight of theyr ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, mounted into the throne of S. <hi>Lewes,</hi> they haue redoubled both their feare, and their practiſes againſt his perſon &amp; State, powring out in ful meaſure vpon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the ſame poyſon, which had before times beene the principall meane of the loſſe of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and which could neuer haue beene brought into Fraunce, but by theſe politicke, and preſumptuous Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks.</p>
            <p>No part of theſe proceedings is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known

to this heire of Queene <hi>Catherine,</hi> &amp; yet notwithſtanding, I know not what influence, or maleuolent aſpect, as fatal, &amp; ineuitable to <hi>Fraunce,</hi> as to <hi>Nauarre,</hi> hath in a manner ouer-wrought him to harbor theſe ſectaries of <hi>Loyola</hi> in his Realme, out of which, by ſolemne ſentence of his <hi>High Courts,</hi> they haue been baniſht, and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Can any man beleeue ſo ſtrange a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that a Prince, after hee hath ſo manie yeeres encountred the Lyons skin, ſhould in the end ſuffer himſelfe to be ſurprized with the Foxes caſe?</p>
            <p>But the world yeeldes not euery day a <hi>Iulius ſecundus.</hi> True. Neyther affoords it euery day a crowne to loſe.

Howe thinke you by the <hi>Ieſuits?</hi> Are they not woorthy Champions? Are they not gallant fellowes? If in thirtie yeeres ſpace, they haue profited ſo well, vvhat would they haue doone in continuance of time, hauing alreadie ſhaken, and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo many conſciences, hauing ſeaſoned with their doctrine ſuch a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of young ſtudents, who daily grewe into charge of ſoules? Whence is it, that in all ſocieties, the ancienter ſort haue been for the moſt part your loyall ſubiects, and the younger al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all your profeſt enemies? Whence is it, that wee haue ſo often ſeene the ſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite in opinion to his Father, but that the auncient ſort did neuer ſucke this milke of Ieſuitiſme?</p>
            <p>But will your Maieſtie beleeue, that they can be ſo audacious, as to glory and vaunt, how great, and ghaſtly a wound they haue made in the harts of your ſubiects, vvhich they enlarge, teare wider, and make bigger from day to day? I neede but to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall of thoſe words, which I formerly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out of their <hi>Apologie.

If by our policie, and the mediation of our many friends abroade, wee can but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our footing in Fraunce, wee will ſo thorowly <hi>diſpoſe</hi> &amp; <hi>prepare</hi> their mindes, as that the next time wee doubt not to ſound an abſolute triumph.</p>
            <p>Surely your Maieſties poſteritie ſhall ſtande greatly bounde vnto you, if you ſo miſerably inthrall, &amp; in danger them to the luſt and humor of the next <hi>Spaniſh parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> that ſhall be aduanced to the <hi>Holy ſea:</hi> by reſtoring thoſe, who are ſo hardie, and preſumptuous, to ſowe this ſchiſmaticall doctrine, and which is more, to glory in it, to proclaime it openly, to publiſh it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, and thereby to keepe the maine

buſines continually on foot. To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe dooth your Maieſtie ſo cheriſh that young infant in the cradle, if in the meane while you bring in theſe Maſons, to raiſe ſtrong forts within his realme, that at the firſt ſound of the trumpet, all his ſubiects may be ſtrooken into as great an amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ſences, into as great a numnes of their ioynts, in a word, that they may be found as well <hi>prepared</hi> or <hi>diſpoſed,</hi> as the <hi>Nauarrians</hi> were in 1512? Is it not enough that this doctrine hath loſt him <hi>Pampelune,</hi> vnleſſe it rob him of <hi>Paris</hi> alſo?</p>
            <p>True it is, that the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> in their <hi>Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> offer ſureties, to warrant, &amp; ſecure you, and yours, from all danger whatſoeuer. I muſt tell your Maieſtie, I neuer yet heard, that ſureties haue beene taken in caſe of a Crowne: and to ſpeake vprightly, before what Iudges ſhal he ſue, or conuent them, beeing himſelfe driuen out of doores, and deſtitute of all place of refuge, and abode?

VVell then, let vs accept of theyr ſureties, prouided they be of ſubſtance, &amp; abilitie to acquite the forfeiture, els is theyr offer friuolous, and to no purpoſe. Let vs ſee, what theſe ſureties ſhall be. Amongſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:336:66"/>
your ſubiects, it is impoſſible to finde any of wealth ſufficient: for their eſtate cannot be the thouſanth part of the <hi>whole,</hi> which is to be ſecured. Amongſt ſtrangers vvhom can they nominate of woorth, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile the realme of Fraunce? I vnderſtand their minds (my liege) the pledge, &amp; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which they will tender your Maieſtie for their faith, and allegeance, muſt be the King of Spaine, who is readie to become bound for them, bodie for bodie. He is of infinite wealth, hee is mightie in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he is <hi>deepely in loue with Fraunce,</hi> then what exception can you take to him?</p>
            <p>So then we are thorow for the ſecuritie, let vs now thinke of the reſidue. How will your Maieſtie diſpoſe of that <hi>Piller,</hi> which ſtands before your Pallace, in whoſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſides, is recorded to poſteritie, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this populous nation of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> towardes their good King, towardes theyr great King, their <hi>Deliuerer,</hi> who the ſelfe-ſame yere had freed their necks from the Spaniſh yoake?

            <p>What is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be done? The firſt work you doe, you muſt race downe this <hi>Piller.</hi> Howe? race it downe?

            <p>Oh my liege, what could the <hi>Generall</hi> of the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> wiſh for more?

Such weakenes is vnſuting to your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, it is vnwoorthie a King of Fraunce, though not of your proweſſe. A King of Fraunce is ſubiect to no controule, but to Gods only.

originall, their encreaſe, the place from whence they ſprung, me thinks you ſhould preſently conceaue a deteſtation of theyr ſect. But hauing taſted theſe cruell fruits of their Seminarie, fully aunſwering the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of your deadlieſt enemies, and nowe beeing deliuered by a ſolemne <hi>Sentence</hi> of your Parlement, from this perillous &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious faction, what ſhew of reaſon, what colour can you haue, your ſelfe to reſtore murtherers into your State, ſedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your ſubiects, factions, and partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities into your Prouinces, which ſince the baniſhment of the Ieſuits, haue ſeen more quiet, and peaceable dayes, then they had done in thirtie yeeres before?</p>
            <p>God loues not to be tempted, his hand hath twiſe protected your Maieſtie, from their bloodie attempts: hee hath furniſht you with ſo many good Prelates, &amp; Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors on all hands, with ſo many learned, &amp; deuout <hi>Religious</hi> of all Orders, men full of pietie, knowledge, dutie, &amp; loialtie towards your maieſtie, a thouſand times more fit for the aduauncement of our Catholicke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then they that are infected with this dangerous hereſie, grounded vppon <hi>the power to change kingdoms, and to take them</hi>

               <hi>from one, and transfer them to another:</hi> and why wil you ſo ſlenderly regard the fauor, which he out of his heauenly bountie hath extended towards you, ſnatching you out of the very graue, and out of the armes of death? a death by them much deſited, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and practiſed, wholie endeuouring to burie Fraunce, together with her two laſt Kings, all in a Tombe? Doe you not feare (my liege) to prouoke his wrath, who will be admired in his prouidence, and praiſed in his bountie, and protection? Doe you not beleeue that he ſate as Preſident in the midſt of that honourable aſſembly, of that great Court, the moſt ſacred Court of the world, beeing met in conſultation of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that concerned the life of their Prince, &amp; the preſeruation of his State?
